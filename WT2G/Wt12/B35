The life of Kanaka Maoli, the indigenous Hawai`i people, is linked closely with <STRONG>kalo</STRONG>, the <STRONG>taro</STRONG> plant.  <STRONG>Kalo</STRONG> is believed to have the greatest life force of all foods.  According to the Kumulipo, the creation chant, <STRONG>kalo</STRONG> grew from the first-born son of Wakea (sky father) and Papa (earth mother), through Wakea's relationship with his and Papa's daughter, Ho`ohokulani.  Haloa-naka, as the son was named, was stillborn and buried.  Out of his body grew the <STRONG>kalo</STRONG> plant, also called Haloa, which means everlasting breath.  <STRONG>Kalo</STRONG> and <STRONG>poi</STRONG> (pounded <STRONG>kalo</STRONG>) are a means of survival for the Hawai`i people.  By eating <STRONG>kalo</STRONG> as <STRONG>poi</STRONG>, one at a time as a ritual around the <STRONG>poi</STRONG> bowl (`umeke) at the center of the diners, the protocol of Hawai`i is maintained.  This is a ceremony of life that brings people together and supports a relationship of `ohana (family) and of appreciation with the `aumakua (ancestors).
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="kalo-line.gif" VSPACE=4 HSPACE=8>
From early times, <STRONG>kalo</STRONG> was the primary food of the Hawai`i people, supplemented by other principal and traditional foods: <A HREF="ulu.html>breadfruit (`ulu)</A>, <A HREF="uala.html>sweet potato (`uala)</A>, <A HREF="uhi.html>yams</A>, greens, ferns, fruit, fish and seaweed (limu).  
<P>
<STRONG>Taro</STRONG> (<STRONG><EM>Colocasia esculenta</EM></STRONG>) came to Hawai`i Nei with the earliest <A HREF="index.html#pvs">Polynesian settlers in their canoes</A> and has been cultivated as a mainstay from ancient times in the tropical and subtropical latitudinal band around the earth.  <STRONG>Taro</STRONG> grows in tropical Africa, the West Indies, the Pacific nations and in countries bordering the Indian Ocean in South Asia.  In Hawai`i, where cultivation has been the most intense, in the early days there were more than 300 varieties of <STRONG>taro</STRONG>.  Approximately 87 of these varieties are still recognized today, with slight differences in height, stalk color, leaf or flower color, size, and root type.  Some of the local varieties are Mo`i, Lehua, Ha`akea and Chinese.
<P>
<STRONG>Taro</STRONG> is cultivated both in the uplands as high as 4,000 feet, and in marshy land irrigated by streams.  The plant is a hearty succulent perennial herb, with clusters of long heart or arrowhead-shaped leaves that point earthward.  <STRONG>Taro</STRONG> grows on erect stems that may be green, red (lehua), black or variegated.  The new leaf and stem push out of the innermost stalk, unrolling as they emerge.  The stems are usually several feet high.  Tiny new plants appear around the base of the root corm.  The pua, inflorescence, is an open yellow-white tube, enclosing a spike covered with flowers.
<P>
Depending on the variety, all parts of this sturdy and vital plant are eaten.  The leaves are cooked as greens, similar to spinach.  The tubers are eaten baked, boiled or steamed, or cooked and mashed with water to make <STRONG>poi</STRONG>.  The fibrous flesh of the tubers is tough and spongy, ranging in color from white, yellow, lilac-purple and pink to reddish.  Most important is the starchy root with enough glutinosity to make quality <STRONG>poi</STRONG>.  The stiffest <STRONG>poi</STRONG> is called locally "one finger" and the most liquid "three finger".  "Two finger" <STRONG>poi</STRONG> is considered the best.  The planters know which kind of <STRONG>taro</STRONG> makes the best <STRONG>poi</STRONG>, which variety has the most tender leaves and which has the necessary medicinal properties.
<P>
<STRONG>Taro</STRONG> is often fed to babies as their first whole and natural healthy food, as well as to the elderly, for its ease of digestion and high vitamin content.  Some people call <STRONG>poi</STRONG> the "soul food" of Hawai`i.  <STRONG>Poi</STRONG> is eaten fresh or allowed to ferment for a few days, often for longer, creating a sour taste considered pleasant, acid, but not alcoholic.  In the old days, a person might consume up to five pounds of <STRONG>poi</STRONG> per day.  Several kinds of <STRONG>kalo</STRONG> had such special flavor and color that they were reserved only for the chiefs.  It is said that Soviet astronauts ate dehydrated <STRONG>taro</STRONG> in space, adding water to the packets...instant <STRONG>poi</STRONG>!
<P>
In the <STRONG>kalo</STRONG> and <STRONG>poi</STRONG>-based agricultural society, the people of ancient Hawai`i were dependent on wetland <STRONG>taro</STRONG>.  Great skills were needed to terrace, cultivate and irrigate the land, along with the social and political skills to maintain it.  The planters of wetland <STRONG>taro</STRONG> were practicing engineers, building walls of earth reinforced with stone to enclose the lo`i (pond field).  Along the banks of the lo`i were planted <A HREF="maia.html>mai`a (banana)</A>, <A HREF="ko.html>ko (sugarcane)</A>, <A HREF="ki.html>ki (ti)</A>, and <A HREF="wauke.html>wauke (paper mulberry)</A> for kapa cloth, also known as tapa.  In the pond field, several varieties of fish were grown, such as `awa, `ama`ama, o`opu and aholehole.  An acre of wet lo`i could produce 3 to 5 tons of food per year.  Dryland <STRONG>taro</STRONG> was grown in the lower forests where the soil was rich and the rainfall sufficient.  
<P>
<A HREF="http://hawaii-nation.org/nation/keanae.html"><IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="http://hawaii-nation.org/nation/keanaesm.gif" BORDER=1 VSPACE=4 HSPACE=8></A>
Today there are still functional lo`i along the <A HREF="http://hawaii-nation.org/nation/keanae.html">Keanae</A>, Wailua and Hana coastlines of Maui, as well as other locations throughout these Hawai`i islands.  
<P>
A <STRONG>taro</STRONG> farmer exemplifies self-sufficient stewardship of natural resources through hard work.  There is wisdom in encouraging and supporting community as well as back-yard cultivation of this valuable food.
<P>
In planting both wetland and dryland <STRONG>taro</STRONG>, the huli, the planting material, consists of a 1/2 inch thick slice of the top of the <STRONG>kalo</STRONG> (corm, from which derives the plant's name) attached to 6 to 10 inches of the leaf-stem.  These protrude above the water or dryland where planted.  The bottom of the corm/root is saved for cooking and eating, making <STRONG>taro</STRONG> a recyclable plant.  In 6 to 12 months, depending upon plant variety along with soil and water conditions, the <STRONG>taro</STRONG> should be ready to harvest.  Each parent tuber produces from two to l5 `oha, side tubers of corms, up to 6 inches in diameter.  `Oha means specifically the suckers or shoots concentrically growing from the corm of the <STRONG>kalo/taro</STRONG> plant.  Knowing this, it is easy to understand why the Hawai`i family as a group is termed `ohana, which literally means "all from the shoots".
<P>
Before <STRONG>kalo</STRONG> can be eaten, all parts of the plant must be cooked, in order to break down the needle-like calcium oxalate crystals present in the leaves, stem and corm.  These could be extremely irritating to the throat and mouth lining, causing a burning and stinging sensation.
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="kalo.gif" VSPACE=2 HSPACE=2>
<STRONG>Lu`au</STRONG> is the name of the edible <STRONG>taro</STRONG> leaf, from the word lau, leaf.  Lu`au supplies high amounts of vitamins A, B and C, as well as calcium, iron, phosphorus, thiamine and riboflavin.  The cooked corm and <STRONG>poi</STRONG> have fewer vitamins, but are an excellent carbohydrate source and have the ability to balance the pH factor in the body, as they are an alkali producing food.
<P>
The following are a few of the medicinal uses of <STRONG>poi</STRONG> and the <STRONG>kalo</STRONG> plant.  <STRONG>Poi</STRONG> is used to settle the stomach.  Mixed with ripe <A HREF="noni.html>noni</A> fruit, it can be applied topically for boils.  <STRONG>Poi</STRONG> can be mixed with <A HREF="pia.html>pia</A> (arrowroot starch) and taken for diarrhea.  Undiluted <STRONG>poi</STRONG> is sometimes used as a poultice on infected sores.  A piece of <STRONG>taro</STRONG> stem, haha, can be touched to the skin to stop surface bleeding.  Some infections respond to the use of <STRONG>taro</STRONG> leaves mashed with Hawai`i salt.  This poultice can be applied to an injury, covered and wrapped with a large <STRONG>taro</STRONG> leaf.  For a sting from an insect, the stem can be cut and rubbed on the afflicted area.
<P>
Mud from the <STRONG>taro</STRONG> patch was used as a black dye for <A HREF="wauke.html>kapa</A> cloth, while some leaf-stem juice yielded red dye.  Also, diluted <STRONG>poi</STRONG> was used as a paste to glue together pieces of <A HREF="wauke.html>kapa</A> cloth.
<P>
The <STRONG>kalo</STRONG> plant is said to be the hiapo, the number one sibling.  It is also said to be the kinolau, the body form, of Kane, the procreator.  The small round depression where the <STRONG>taro</STRONG> stalk meets the leaf surface is called the piko, from whence comes the name for the human belly button.
<P>
If we want to learn more about <STRONG>kalo</STRONG> and how to grow it, it is a good idea to talk to the farmers who already grow it.  Many of these are eager to share their knowledge and expertise and many fascinating stories about this plant so central to the life of Hawai`i and her people.  Exchanging stories and <STRONG>taro</STRONG> varieties with friends and neighbors is the Hawai`i way.
<P>
As kumu Kawaikapuokalani Hewitt said "Our existence depends on Haloa, our elder brother, the <STRONG>Kalo</STRONG>."
<P>
May the mother nation Hawai`i live forever through the <STRONG>poi!</STRONG>

<UL><H1>KAMANI</H1></UL>
<P>
A member of the mangosteen family with the scientific name of <STRONG><EM>Calophyllum inophyllum</EM></STRONG>, <STRONG>kamani</STRONG> was brought north to Hawai`i from the South Pacific islands in early <A HREF="index.html#pvs">migrations of Polynesian settlers</A>.  Also called <STRONG>Alexandrian laurel</STRONG>, true <STRONG>kamani</STRONG> was probably introduced by seed, which is how it is propagated.  This native of the Pacific and of tropical Africa, grows slowly along sandy shores and in lowland forests.  It was cultivated in villages, near houses and also in groves away from villages.  When found growing in windy areas it is sometimes in a picturesque, crooked or misshapen form.
<P>
True <STRONG>kamani</STRONG> is not to be confused with "false kamani", a common tropical almond that grows profusely along the shores of Hawai`i.  This "kamani haole" was introduced after the first white settlers arrived, and has the scientific name of <EM>Teminalia catappa</EM>.  It was planted for shade and as an ornamental, also growing from the edible seed in its corky pod that washes ashore with waves and currents.
<P>
True <STRONG>kamani</STRONG> is a large attractive spreading tree up to 60 feet high, with a rounded head of dense foliage and rough grey bark.  A reddish-brown hardwood is derived from the trunk.  From this was carved many objects including canoes; homes; `umeke la`au, wooden containers or calabash, specifically <STRONG>`umeke kamani</STRONG>, food bowls and trays called <STRONG>pa kamani</STRONG>.  As with <A HREF="milo.html">milo</A> and <A HREF="kou.html">kou</A> wood, there is no bad-tasting taste or odor in <STRONG>kamani</STRONG> wood, so it is perfect for vessels that will be contacting or containing food.
<P>
The leaves of <STRONG>kamani</STRONG> are large, stiff, shiny, leathery and oblong with a blunt tip.  They are 3-8 inches long, arranged opposite each other and have closely placed fine parallel veins running from a prominent raised yellow-green midrib to the leaf margin.
<P>
The delightfully fragrant (when new) flowers are small, 1 inch wide, and white with 4-8 petals.  They smell like orange blossoms and were used to give fragrance to <A HREF="wauke.html">kapa</A> cloth, and also for lei making.  They are waxy and showy with golden yellow stamens and a pink pistil, and grow in clusters of a dozen or so flowers found hanging from a long stalk.
<P>
The fruit begins pinkish-green, rounds out to about 2 inches long and becomes bright green.  When mature, it has a thin leathery dark grey-brownish skin which covers a bony shell that holds a partly poisonous kernel or seed surrounded by a cork-like substance.  A lamp oil for light was produced from the kernel and was used at times instead of <A HREF="kukui.html">kukui</A> nut oil.  The kernel is called a "punnai nut" in some areas of the Pacific, and the oil is dark, green, thick and called "dilo oil".  Sometimes this oil is useful for lomi lomi, massage, especially when enhanced with <A HREF="niu.html">coconut</A> oil or flower fragrances.  The oil may have been useful in waterproofing <A HREF="wauke.html">tapa</A> cloth.
<P>
The seed, leaves, gum and bark are said to have medicinal properties.  In the old days an extract from the fruit was used to make a brown dye to color <A HREF="wauke.html">tapa</A> cloth.
<P>
<STRONG>Kamani</STRONG> was often planted around heiau, temples.  
<P>
<STRONG>Kamani</STRONG> was mentioned in early chants, and considered a sacred tree in parts of Polynesia.  An especially fine grove is to be found on the island of Moloka`i.

It is common from sea level in the lower wetlands up to the 4,000 foot elevation.  <STRONG>Ti</STRONG> is found in shady moist gardens, as a landscaping background plant or as a hedge.  The people of Hawai`i plant it around their homes and churches for good luck.  In the old days <STRONG>Ki</STRONG> was planted around the lo`i, taro ponds.  The botanical or scientific name of this member of the lily family is <STRONG><EM>Cordyline terminalis</STRONG></EM> or <STRONG><EM>Taetsia frucicosa</STRONG></EM>.<P><IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="ki-line.gif" VSPACE=4 HSPACE=8>Introduced to Hawai`i by the earliest <A HREF="index.html#pvs">Polynesian settlers</A>, <STRONG>Ki</STRONG> is considered sacred to the Hawai`i God Lono and to the Goddess of the hula, Laka.  It is also an emblem of high rank and divine power.  The Hawai`i feather kahili is said to be derived from this plant.  The leaves are also worn or carried as protection to ward off evil spirits and to call in good.  The kahuna priests wore <STRONG>ti</STRONG> leaves either as lei or as garments when they conducted ancient ceremonial rituals.  <STRONG>Ti</STRONG> leaves are still used today in religious ceremonies conducted by Hawai`i's multi-racial clergy, especially at opening ceremonies to bless new buildings and projects.<P><IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="ki.gif" VSPACE=2 HSPACE=2>The <STRONG>ti's</STRONG> versatile leaves have many uses, including: roof thatching; as fly whisks or fans; wrappings for cool food storage, preservation and protection; for wrapping of food to be cooked, especially for laulau; as plates or cups; as fishing lures on hukilau nets; as wearing apparel, such as rain capes, sandals and as hula skirts called pa`u; and, more recently, as feed for cattle and horses.  <STRONG>Ti</STRONG> leaves are also decorative; they are braided, twisted or woven into lei for numerous special and celebratory occasions; used as a covering for luau tables; and, they provide Hawai`i's tropical flower industry with a wonderful variety of foliage for impressive floral arrangements.  <P><STRONG>Ti</STRONG> (pronounced tee) has tall, sparingly branched wood stalks 3 to 10 or more feet high.  The tightly spiraled leaf cluster is in a tuft at the top of the ringed stalk.  The plant's green leaves are pointed, oval and blade- shaped, about 4 inches wide and vary from 1 to 2 feet long.  As new leaves form at the center, the outside older leaves turn yellow and fall, leaving a circular ring on the plant's stalk.  The thick, shiny and flexible leaves do not wilt quickly, making them useful for many purposes, some as already mentioned.  Varieties of the <STRONG>ti</STRONG> plant have colored foliage and variously shaped leaves.  Besides the original and sacred green <STRONG>ki</STRONG>, the plant ranges in leaf color from pale white and yellow with green tones, to reds, covering a broad spectrum from pale to pink to a maroon, that appears almost black.<P>The plant's flower stalk emerges in winter.  With the coming of spring, a many-branched drooping cluster of flowers comes into bloom.  Its' hundreds of tiny half-inch whitish purple flowers resemble miniature lilies.<P>This versatile plant has many medicinal uses, either alone or as a wrapping for other herbs needing to be steamed or boiled.  For fever, the entire body of an unclothed prone person is covered from the neck down with large green <STRONG>ti</STRONG> leaves.  After the patient sweats and fever is broken, the leaves are removed.  Drinks of fresh water are given to the patient during this process, which may take several hours.  Cool, freshly washed damp green <STRONG>ti</STRONG> leaves, held and wrapped around the forehead and temples, can be helpful in relieving headache and fever.  The center of <STRONG>ti</STRONG>, mole ki, is often picked and unfurled for this use.  Hot stones are wrapped in <STRONG>ki</STRONG> leaves and used to soothe sore back muscles.<P>A drink from boiled green <STRONG>ti</STRONG> leaves is used to aid nerve and muscle relaxation.  Steam from boiled young shoots and leaves makes an effective decongestant.  The pleasantly fragrant flowers are also used for asthma.<P>A popular use of this plant was in making Okolehau, affectionately called oke, a potent liquor much like a clear brandy.  This brew is distilled from a ferment of baked mashed <STRONG>ti</STRONG> root.  The root is thick, white and sweet, growing very large in older plants.  The baked roots are also an emergency famine food and have been eaten as a confection.<P>Children of old Hawai`i (and modern times, too) enjoyed sliding down steep grassy slopes on <STRONG>ti</STRONG> leaf sleds, holding onto the stem towards the front.  Whistles can also be made from the plant's leaf.<P>New plants propagate easily from cuttings and grow best where sunlight and moisture are both available.

Simple were the days when <STRONG>ko</STRONG>, <STRONG>sugar cane</STRONG>, began its life here in Hawai`i, brought by <A HREF="index.html#pvs">Polynesian settlers in their canoes</A> sailing forth.  This plant travels well, plants easily, and is a pleasant addition to life.  Only later came the days when other settlers began to grow sugar cane commercially.  Modern-day hybrid sugar production causes concerns: to burn the fields or not, as their heat and the pollutants released all contribute to our personal health and the local and global environment...to eat the white sugar crystals that are processed from the original sap or not, as the overuse of this substance can become addictive and harmful to the health of many people...and, yet, the glorious beauty of fields of green cane waving in the trade winds cannot be denied.<P><STRONG>Ko</STRONG>, <STRONG><EM>Saccharum officinarum</EM></STRONG>, is a perennial grass that grows best at low elevations, but can be cultivated up to nearly the 3000 foot level.  <STRONG>Ko</STRONG> probably originated in Southeast Asia.  The unbranched stems or stalks are 1-2 inches thick and, like <A HREF="ohe.html">bamboo</A>, have clearly marked internodes.  The stems range in color from red to purple, and from a pale green to green with pink or with yellow striations.  The stalks are from 6 to 15-20 feet high, forming clumps as they grow.  The stalks tend to lean as they heighten and are blown by the wind.  Inside the stem is a fibrous and pithy material filled with sugar juice in the mature plant.  The 1-2 foot long leaves are smooth and narrow with a mid-rib, and have saw-toothed edges that can cut the skin if care is not taken in their presence.  The leaves droop and die at the lower stem and can be pulled off.  <STRONG>Ko</STRONG> matures in 12-15 months in the lowlands, and in 18-24 months at higher elevations.  After about 2 years the plant produces a silvery-rosy-lavender colored tassel at the end of the cane stem.  It is usually 1-2 feet long and signals the plant's maturity.  This is in the late autumn, around November-December in Hawai`i.  Sometimes the tassels are cut for decoration around the Christmas holiday season.  <P>In earlier times, the people of Hawai`i grew nearly 40 varieties of <STRONG>ko</STRONG>.  Some of them were grown in clumps near their homes.  These giant grasses were also planted on the embankments of the lo`i, <A HREF="kalo.html">taro</A> ponds.<P>A few varieties were used for medicines.  <STRONG>Ko</STRONG> sweetens many medicinal concoctions, and the juice of pan-toasted sugar cane can be used as a tonic for babies.<P>One of the few varieties used medicinally is kokea, white cane, a native cane with yellowish-green stem and a thin skin that can be easily removed or crushed.  This juice is popular as an ingredient in herbal combinations.  It helps to make bad-tasting medicine taste better.  Honua`ula, red cane, is also considered to have particular healing properties.<P>Young <STRONG>ko</STRONG> shoots were used for lacerations and cuts.  Along with other plants and salt, the shoots were wrapped in <A HREF="ki.html">ti</A> leaves and baked over charcoal.  The juice was then squeezed and placed on a cut.<P>The juices of <STRONG>ko</STRONG> are used to sweeten haupia and kulolo desserts, made of <A HREF="niu.html">coconut</A> and <A HREF="kalo.html">taro</A>, respectively.  The leaves of <STRONG>ko</STRONG> were used for inside house thatching, or for outside of pili grass wasn't available.  The flower stalks of sugar cane were used to fashion a dart, sometimes used during the Makahiki games.<P>This plant makes an effective windbreak, and is also planted as a hedge or border.  To propagate, plant sections of the mature upper portion of the stalk, using those pieces that have several nodes on them.  Each node will create a new stalk.  Dig a trench 6-8 inches deep and plant an 8-12 inch section sideways in the earth.  <STRONG>Ko</STRONG> likes a lot of sunshine and also moisture, and whenever possible, a rich soil.  Traditionally, <STRONG>sugar cane</STRONG> was planted in November-December.<P>For a treat, have a chew on a joint of your home-grown <STRONG>ko</STRONG>, the garden variety which has a thin rind and is easy to chew because of its soft pulp.  Or, when hiking, carry a section of <STRONG>ko</STRONG> along, to slake your thirst.<P><IMG SRC="hrcolor2.gif"><BR><P><CENTER><TABLE BORDER="2" CELLPADDING="2"><TR><TD ALIGN="center">The 24 "Canoe Plants" of Ancient Hawai`i</TD><TR><TR><TD ALIGN="center"><FONT SIZE="-1"><A HREF="ape.html">`Ape</A> -<A HREF="awa.html">`Awa</A> -<A HREF="awapuhi.html">`Awapuhi</A> -<A HREF="hau.html">Hau</A> -<A HREF="ipu.html">Ipu</A> -<A HREF="kalo.html">Kalo</A> -<A HREF="kamani.html">Kamani</A> -<A HREF="ki.html">Ki</A> -<A HREF="kou.html">Kou</A> -<A HREF="kukui.html">Kukui</A> -<A HREF="maia.html">Mai`a</A><BR><A HREF="milo.html">Milo</A> -<A HREF="niu.html">Niu</A> -<A HREF="noni.html">Noni</A> -<A HREF="ohe.html">`Ohe</A> -<A HREF="ohia.html">`Ohi`a `Ai</A> -<A HREF="olena.html">`Olena</A> -<A HREF="olona.html">Olona</A> -<A HREF="pia.html">Pia</A> -<A HREF="uala.html">`Uala</A> -<A HREF="uhi.html">Uhi</A> -<A HREF="ulu.html">`Ulu</A> -<A HREF="wauke.html">Wauke</A></FONT></TABLE></CENTER><A HREF="index.html"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="canostss.gif" BORDER="0"></A> Return to the <A HREF="index.html">Canoe Plants Home Page</A> or the <A HREF="index.html#contents">Table of Contents</A><P></HTML>

This plant grows easily and quickly from seed, preferring sunny warm coastal lowlands on the islands' leeward areas.  It was cultivated near settlements, and is only occasionally found in the wild forests.  Because of its thick wide crown of leaves, <STRONG>kou</STRONG> was a favorite shade tree near home sites.  Beneath its cool shelter, the women beat the <A HREF="wauke.html">kapa</A> cloth or would string lei, as they shared the day together.<P>The straight and erect trunk of <STRONG>kou</STRONG> is pale grey, with grooved and flaky or stringy bark.  Within the trunk can be found a heartwood with beautiful colored markings that are reddish dark brown, sometimes with a hint of purple.  The sapwood is straw color, with a tint of pink.  In the medium soft and durable wood are grain markings, some straight and some of which are wavy with dark and light lines and bands of yellow.  The texture is medium fine, and the density is considered medium.  The wood is long-lasting, and has little shrinkage.  Therefore, large and stable vessels can be made.  These were usually carved by the same men who made the wa`a, canoes.  These men knew how to season and how to gracefully shape the woods they used for the best and most practical purposes, and how to finish them so that a fine patina was achieved and their beauty would endure.  Because of the good workability of <STRONG>kou</STRONG>, it is fashioned into `umeke la`au, containers of wood, crafted with great skill, as well as being aesthetically pleasing.  <STRONG>`Umeke kou</STRONG>, food bowls, and specifically <A HREF="kalo.html">poi</A> bowls called `umeke `ai, platters called <STRONG>pa kou</STRONG>, and serving dishes of <STRONG>kou</STRONG> were all preferred, because there is no unpleasant taste in the sap that would flavor food.  Also made from <STRONG>kou</STRONG> wood were canoes, paddles, back scratchers, calabashes and boxes, fish hook containers and other carved objects, such as images of deities.<P><STRONG>Kou</STRONG> leaves are smooth, large and oval, with a pointed end and rounded base.  They are alternately arranged and are about 4 inches long.  The leaf stem is 1/2 to 3 inches long.  The leaves have wavy edges with prominent midrib and veins.  In the old days <STRONG>kou</STRONG> leaves were used to make a brown dye that was applied in designs on <A HREF="wauke.html">kapa</A>.  It is said that banyan (ficus) fruit was added to <STRONG>kou</STRONG> leaves to make a fine red dye for <A HREF="wauke.html">tapa</A> cloth.<P>The showy orange flowers of <STRONG>kou</STRONG> have no scent, and are one inch long, 1-2 inches across, with 5-7 lobes.  They grow in clusters on short stalks, and are used as a lei flower. <P>The fruit is nearly round, one inch long, growing in small clusters.  The green fruit changes color to yellow and then to black as they dry and become hard.  They contain a "stone" with 1-4 seeds.<P><STRONG>Kou</STRONG> occurs in ancient legends of Polynesia, one of which suggests that <STRONG>kou</STRONG> was one of the first trees created.<P><IMG SRC="hrcolor2.gif"><BR><P><CENTER><TABLE BORDER="2" CELLPADDING="2"><TR><TD ALIGN="center">The 24 "Canoe Plants" of Ancient Hawai`i</TD><TR><TR><TD ALIGN="center"><FONT SIZE="-1"><A HREF="ape.html">`Ape</A> -<A HREF="awa.html">`Awa</A> -<A HREF="awapuhi.html">`Awapuhi</A> -<A HREF="hau.html">Hau</A> -<A HREF="ipu.html">Ipu</A> -<A HREF="kalo.html">Kalo</A> -<A HREF="kamani.html">Kamani</A> -<A HREF="ki.html">Ki</A> -<A HREF="ko.html">Ko</A> -<A HREF="kukui.html">Kukui</A> -<A HREF="maia.html">Mai`a</A><BR><A HREF="milo.html">Milo</A> -<A HREF="niu.html">Niu</A> -<A HREF="noni.html">Noni</A> -<A HREF="ohe.html">`Ohe</A> -<A HREF="ohia.html">`Ohi`a `Ai</A> -<A HREF="olena.html">`Olena</A> -<A HREF="olona.html">Olona</A> -<A HREF="pia.html">Pia</A> -<A HREF="uala.html">`Uala</A> -<A HREF="uhi.html">Uhi</A> -<A HREF="ulu.html">`Ulu</A> -<A HREF="wauke.html">Wauke</A></FONT></TABLE></CENTER><A HREF="index.html"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="canostss.gif" BORDER="0"></A> Return to the <A HREF="index.html">Canoe Plants Home Page</A> or the <A HREF="index.html#contents">Table of Contents</A><P></HTML>

Over the years, I have come to love these ancestors that thrive here in Hawai`i Nei, some so large as 50 feet.  The tree is a symbol of enlightenment.<P>The seeds of this plant were brought to Hawai`i by the first <A HREF="index.html#pvs">Polynesian voyagers</A>.  Today this member of the Spurge family is the official symbol of the `Aha Kupuna, the Council of Elders of the Nation of Hawai`i.  Its scientific name is <STRONG><EM>Aleurites moluccana</STRONG></EM>. It grows wild in the lower mountain forest areas and is used in gardens as a shade tree, although it is a bit messy due to dropping its leaves and nuts.<P>The <STRONG>kukui</STRONG> nut has many uses.  Originally it was most valued for its light, the oil of the white kernels being extracted for its use in stone lamps and in ti leaf sheath torches.  The shelled nuts were skewered on a <A HREF="niu.html">coconut</A> frond mid-rib and lit one by one, from the top to bottom, as they set in a container of sand or dirt, or in the earth itself.  Often the children were given the responsibility for keeping the "candles" lit.  The tree is sometimes called the <STRONG>Candlenut Tree</STRONG>. The nuts are widely used as a traditional lei, both the hard shells of the polished black and the tan or brown, which are more rare.  The white flowers and leaves are also strung as lei, representing Moloka`i, whose symbolic color is silvery green.  The bark, flowers and nuts are all used for medicine.  As food, a small amount of the pounded roasted nuts, plus salt and sometimes chili peppers, is used as a relish and is called Inamona.<P>The small, five-petaled white flowers were chewed by the parents of a young child and given to the child to aid in healing of e`a (thrush) sores inside the mouth and upon the tongue.  Also used for this problem was the juicy sap that fills up the depression left when the stem is pulled off the green fruit.  This is applied with the finger and rubbed inside of the child's mouth and on the tongue.  The green fruit is the part of the plant that contains the nut.  This sap is also a healing application for chapped lips, cold sores and mild sunburn.<P>One mashed nut (sometimes the raw kernel, sometimes the roasted) or the sap of the green nut was often used in combination with other traditional Hawai`i medicinal plants, particularly when a purgative for constipation was needed.  The potency of this plant is so strong that these internal remedies are administered very carefully by those with experience in these matters.  The late Uncle Harry Mitchell of Keanae recommended the use of <STRONG>kukui</STRONG> nut for high blood pressure.  He suggested one teaspoon a day of the ground roasted kernel.<P>For bad cases of ulcers and other skin sores, the baked meat of ripe <STRONG>kukui</STRONG> nuts was pounded and mixed with other plants, such as ripe <A HREF="noni.html">noni</A> fruit.  In the treatment of rheumatic joints or deep bruises and wounds, <STRONG>kukui</STRONG> and <A HREF="noni.html">noni</A> leaves were wrapped around the afflicted places and heat applied by hot packs of salt, sand or rocks wrapped in <A HREF="wauke.html">tapa</A> cloth.<P>The inner bark provided a red-brown dye for <A HREF="wauke.html">tapa</A> cloth, while the gum from the bark strengthened the <A HREF="wauke.html">tapa</A>.  The soot (pau) of burned nuts provided a black dye for tattooing and for painting designs on canoes and on <A HREF="wauke.html">tapa</A> cloth.  The soft light-colored wood of the tree trunk was fashioned into canoes.  The oil provided a varnish similar to linseed oil.  <P>Roasted kernels, pulverized by fishermen while on the reef or in canoes, were blown upon the ocean surface where there were small ripples and waves.  The film increased underwater visibility by creating a lens on the water's surface.  Fishing nets were preserved by a coating of <STRONG>kukui</STRONG> oil.<P>The <STRONG>kukui</STRONG> tree is a classic example of the wisdom of ancient voyaging Polynesians.  The plants that they chose to bring on their canoes had to serve many useful purposes.  The <STRONG>kukui</STRONG> is such a plant.<P><IMG SRC="hrcolor2.gif"><BR><P><CENTER><TABLE BORDER="2" CELLPADDING="2"><TR><TD ALIGN="center">The 24 "Canoe Plants" of Ancient Hawai`i</TD><TR><TR><TD ALIGN="center"><FONT SIZE="-1"><A HREF="ape.html">`Ape</A> -<A HREF="awa.html">`Awa</A> -<A HREF="awapuhi.html">`Awapuhi</A> -<A HREF="hau.html">Hau</A> -<A HREF="ipu.html">Ipu</A> -<A HREF="kalo.html">Kalo</A> -<A HREF="kamani.html">Kamani</A> -<A HREF="ki.html">Ki</A> -<A HREF="ko.html">Ko</A> -<A HREF="kou.html">Kou</A> -<A HREF="maia.html">Mai`a</A><BR><A HREF="milo.html">Milo</A> -<A HREF="niu.html">Niu</A> -<A HREF="noni.html">Noni</A> -<A HREF="ohe.html">`Ohe</A> -<A HREF="ohia.html">`Ohi`a `Ai</A> -<A HREF="olena.html">`Olena</A> -<A HREF="olona.html">Olona</A> -<A HREF="pia.html">Pia</A> -<A HREF="uala.html">`Uala</A> -<A HREF="uhi.html">Uhi</A> -<A HREF="ulu.html">`Ulu</A> -<A HREF="wauke.html">Wauke</A></FONT></TABLE></CENTER><A HREF="index.html"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="canostss.gif" BORDER="0"></A> Return to the <A HREF="index.html">Canoe Plants Home Page</A> or the <A HREF="index.html#contents">Table of Contents</A><P></HTML>

The <STRONG>banana</STRONG> is an essential to Pacific island life.  It is a staple food brought to Hawai`i by the earliest <A HREF="index.html#pvs">canoes of Polynesian settlers</A>.  Although it is said to have originated in India, it is at the heart of myth and stories world-wide.  Some say this plant grew in the garden of Eden.<P>Polynesian legends, proverbs and similes abound about <STRONG>mai`a</STRONG>.  Hawai`i legend tells that a brother of Pele brought the <STRONG>banana</STRONG> to Hawai`i from Tahiti.  It is believed to be bad luck to dream of <STRONG>bananas</STRONG>, to meet someone who carries them, or to bring them on a fishing trip.  Some similes speak of a person's skin being like a ripe <STRONG>banana</STRONG> or of a person being as beautiful as a young <STRONG>banana</STRONG> leaf.  Many tales regard the <STRONG>banana</STRONG> plant as a person.  <STRONG>Mai`a</STRONG> is kinolau, the body form, of Kanaloa, the Hawaiian god of healing.<P>There are more than 50 varieties of <STRONG><EM>Musa paradisiaca</STRONG></EM>.  Descendants of the early plants are now growing wild in protected valleys, stream gullies and mountain slopes.  This common edible fruit native to the tropics ripens all year.  Diseases and pests are rare.<P><STRONG>Bananas</STRONG> are not really a tree, but are a gigantic herb, being a member of the grass family, like wheat, rye and barley.  The fibrous stems, trunks that may be as tall as 20 feet, are up to 8 inches in diameter and are made up of overlapping leaf bases (sheaths).   A cross section of the succulent trunk looks like a huge onion slice.  The leaves are spirally arranged, rising higher than the stems.  Tightly rolled at first, they push their way outward, lubricated by a white waxy powder.  The leaf stems become thick, with smooth large blades, usually 4 or more feet long and 1-2 feet wide.  These are entire at first, appearing as large rounded blades.  They soon split along parallel side veins to appear like a large feather.<P>After the plant reaches full growth, a flower cluster forces its way up through the compressed layers of the leaf sheaths that make up the trunk.  The flowers are borne on a thick erect or drooping stem, issuing from the top of the trunk or at the center of the leaf cluster, commonly in flat groups under a large dark to light colored purple-red or green bract.  Male flowers are at the stem tip, female flowers at the stem base.  The calyx is tubular, soon splitting on one side.  There is a corolla with one petal and approximately 6 stamen.  The flowers set fruit without pollination and then drop their purple leathery petals one by one.  It takes about a year for the plant to produce mature fruit.  Each healthy <STRONG>banana</STRONG> plant bears 5 to 9 rows, or hands, of <STRONG>bananas</STRONG>.<P>To harvest the fruit the entire trunk is cut down, often with one or two swipes of a machete.  This can occur when the first <STRONG>bananas</STRONG> turn yellow, or earlier if the <STRONG>bananas</STRONG> are to be used for cooking, rather than eating while ripe.  The trunk is then chopped up and placed as necessary mulch around the base of the clump.  Before mulching, one might seek out the <STRONG>banana's</STRONG> heart, which is a round cylindrical white tube with a smooth shiny cover.  This lies inside the layers of bark fiber.  It can be cooked and is like celery, with a texture and taste similar to <A HREF="ohe.html">bamboo</A> shoots.  Fruit varies in size, shape, color, quality and quantity.  The pulp may be white, yellow or shades of pink.  The raw mature fruit is a sugar and an easily digested source of carbohydrate.  The cooked fruit becomes a starch.  Green unripe <STRONG>bananas</STRONG> can be boiled or baked in their skins, and are usually eaten as a starch, replacing potatoes, bread or <A HREF="kalo.html">taro</A>.  Surplus ripe <STRONG>bananas</STRONG> can be peeled and frozen for later use.  They can also be sun-dried on screens, or in an indoor oven or dehydrator machine.<P><STRONG>Bananas</STRONG> are a good source of potassium and vitamin A, contain some vitamin B, and a fair amount of vitamin C.  They are a fair source of phosphorus and contain some calcium and iron.<P>Except for two varieties, <STRONG>bananas</STRONG> were kapu, forbidden for women of Hawai`i to eat under penalty of death until the early l800's.<P>New plants develop quickly from underground stems, usually forming clumps of plants.  The new plants are called keiki, children.  The <STRONG>mai`a</STRONG> rhizome puts forth pohuli, suckers.  Cutting out and transplanting excess pohuli helps to promote fruit production.  Keeping two keiki per parent plant seems to work out best.  The Hawai`i way is to give extra plants to a friend's garden or to plant them in the wild for times of scarcity.  Traditionally, <STRONG>mai`a</STRONG> was planted in clumps around the <A HREF="kalo.html">taro</A> lo`i, pond fields, as well as near to dwelling sites.<P>There are many planting rituals, times and beliefs to ensure productivity.  Sometimes planting occurs on the night of the full moon, when the moon is shining straight into the hole.  Some people plant at high noon, so that the <STRONG>banana</STRONG> sill contain the shadow and the strength will go into the trunk and fruit.<P>In order to plant, dig a large deep hole, as large as an arm, from elbow to fingertips, ha`ilima.  This depth is important to support the shallow root system.  For proper propagation, the hole needs good drainage and to be in a place protected from strong winds.  <STRONG>Mai`a</STRONG> appear to be sturdy, but have no wood in them for support.  They are pure fiber and are 80% water.  Copious amounts of water are required to bring these plants to maturity.  They also thrive on humus, mulch and plenty of sunshine. <P><STRONG>Mai`a</STRONG> has multitudinous uses, in addition to food.  Every part of this plant is useful.  Leaves: for house roofs, umbrellas and rain hats, as a truce flag, bowl covers, table cloths and temporary mats, cigarette papers, clothing and temporary sandals, dyes, packing material, cattle feed, and as covering for the earth oven, imu, to hold in the heat.  Leaf buds: as a vegetable.  Leaf sheaths: for water runways, and as containers for lei and plants being transported.  Leaf sheath fiber: thatching, stringing lei, tying, plaiting into clothing, cloth and thread.  Trunks: to aid canoes as rollers enroute from the shore to the sea; and the stalks of a mature felled tree are placed in the imu to add moisture and to create steam in the cooking process.<P>Medicinally, the ripe fruit of <STRONG>mai`a</STRONG> is used for asthma.  Boiled ripe <STRONG>banana</STRONG> fruit can be mashed and taken for constipation, especially when mixed with other recommended plants.  For strengthening babies, vitamin-rich nectar sap is pinched from the flower bud.  Bud juice is used for stomach problems in people of all ages.  In the old days, this juice was also used to dye <A HREF="wauke.html">tapa</A> cloth.  Perhaps the most popular use of <STRONG>mai`a</STRONG> medicinally is as a poultice for wounds.  This can be made of the pounded peels of ripe <STRONG>bananas</STRONG>.  There are antibiotic properties in the inside of the peel that are said to be effective against bacteria.  Wrap the peel, inside out, around a cut or wound in an emergency.<P><STRONG>Bananas</STRONG> teach us patience as they grow and ripen slowly.  <STRONG>Bananas</STRONG> do not fruit in a single day.  <EM>`A `ohe hua o ka <STRONG>mai`a</STRONG> i ka la ho`okahi</EM> .<P><IMG SRC="hrcolor2.gif"><BR><P><CENTER><TABLE BORDER="2" CELLPADDING="2"><TR><TD ALIGN="center">The 24 "Canoe Plants" of Ancient Hawai`i</TD><TR><TR><TD ALIGN="center"><FONT SIZE="-1"><A HREF="ape.html">`Ape</A> -<A HREF="awa.html">`Awa</A> -<A HREF="awapuhi.html">`Awapuhi</A> -<A HREF="hau.html">Hau</A> -<A HREF="ipu.html">Ipu</A> -<A HREF="kalo.html">Kalo</A> -<A HREF="kamani.html">Kamani</A> -<A HREF="ki.html">Ki</A> -<A HREF="ko.html">Ko</A> -<A HREF="kou.html">Kou</A> -<A HREF="kukui.html">Kukui</A> -<BR><A HREF="milo.html">Milo</A> -<A HREF="niu.html">Niu</A> -<A HREF="noni.html">Noni</A> -<A HREF="ohe.html">`Ohe</A> -<A HREF="ohia.html">`Ohi`a `Ai</A> -<A HREF="olena.html">`Olena</A> -<A HREF="olona.html">Olona</A> -<A HREF="pia.html">Pia</A> -<A HREF="uala.html">`Uala</A> -<A HREF="uhi.html">Uhi</A> -<A HREF="ulu.html">`Ulu</A> -<A HREF="wauke.html">Wauke</A></FONT></TABLE></CENTER><A HREF="index.html"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="canostss.gif" BORDER="0"></A> Return to the <A HREF="index.html">Canoe Plants Home Page</A> or the <A HREF="index.html#contents">Table of Contents</A><P></HTML>

It is told that the Waikiki home of Kamehameha I was surrounded by <STRONG>milo</STRONG> trees.<P>Although rare today, in old Hawai`i <STRONG>milo</STRONG> was a commonly found tree, cultivated as a shade plant around homes near sunny coastal areas with loose soil.  It does not grow in the high inland forests.<P>Brought to these islands by early <A HREF="index.html#pvs">Polynesian settlers</A> who carried the seeds, this fast-growing evergreen tree was planted around the temples in Tahiti, as it was said to be spiritually connected to the chant and to prayer.  It is a widespread species throughout Polynesia and Micronesia, as well as tropical Africa.  <P><STRONG>Milo's</STRONG> scientific name is <STRONG><EM>Thespia populnea</STRONG></EM>, and it is also known as a portia tree.  A member of the Hibiscus family, the malvacceae, it is a close relative of <A HREF="hau.html">hau</A>, `ilima, and ma`o, Hawai`i cotton.<P>The bark of <STRONG>milo</STRONG> was used for cordage fiber, similarly to <A HREF="hau.html">hau</A>, but it is inferior in quality to <A HREF="hau.html">hau</A> and to <A HREF="olona.html">olona</A>.  The tree also yields tannin, dye, oil, medicine and gum, from various parts of the plant.  The <STRONG>milo</STRONG> wood was skillfully crafted into <A HREF="kalo.html">poi</A> bowls called `umeke `ai, and into plates, too.  Calabashes/bowls of <A HREF="kou.html">kou</A> wood were more highly prized than those of <STRONG>milo</STRONG>, and were more often used.<P>`Umeke `ai is an honored implement in a Hawai`i home, for through the ceremony of eating <A HREF="kalo.html">poi</A> one at a time from the bowl at the center, the traditions and protocol of Kanaka Maoli is maintained. The `umeke `ai filled with <A HREF="kalo.html">kalo (taro)</A> is considered the means of survival of the people of Hawai`i Nei.  <P>`Umeke la`au is the Hawai`i name for these containers or calabashes of wood, which were used for the storage, transport and serving of food in various stages of preparation.  <STRONG>Milo</STRONG> wood is flavorless, because it is lacking in any unpleasant-tasting sap that could contaminate stored food.<P>The <STRONG>milo</STRONG> tree is a small to medium-sized one, growing to less than 40 feet high.  The trunk can be 2 feet in diameter at full maturity.  The bark is corrugated, with scaly twigs.  The branches are widely spread and usually horizontal, making for an ideal shade tree.  The glossy heart-shaped leaves are 3-5 inches across.  Young leaves are edible.  Bell-shaped pale yellow flowers with maroon or purple centers turn purplish-pink as they with in their short one day hibiscus life.  Following the flowering stage, the one inch diameter seeds grow in globular 5-celled woody cases that have downy hairs on their surface.  These remain on the plant for sometime, and only ripen in areas of dry climate.<P><STRONG>Milo</STRONG> wood has an attractive grain that takes to a high polish and, in addition to food utensils and containers, was fashioned into paddles and other carved objects, as well as for an occasional canoe, although koa was considered to be the most popular material for canoes.<P><IMG SRC="hrcolor2.gif"><BR><P><CENTER><TABLE BORDER="2" CELLPADDING="2"><TR><TD ALIGN="center">The 24 "Canoe Plants" of Ancient Hawai`i</TD><TR><TR><TD ALIGN="center"><FONT SIZE="-1"><A HREF="ape.html">`Ape</A> -<A HREF="awa.html">`Awa</A> -<A HREF="awapuhi.html">`Awapuhi</A> -<A HREF="hau.html">Hau</A> -<A HREF="ipu.html">Ipu</A> -<A HREF="kalo.html">Kalo</A> -<A HREF="kamani.html">Kamani</A> -<A HREF="ki.html">Ki</A> -<A HREF="ko.html">Ko</A> -<A HREF="kou.html">Kou</A> -<A HREF="kukui.html">Kukui</A> -<A HREF="maia.html">Mai`a</A><BR><A HREF="niu.html">Niu</A> -<A HREF="noni.html">Noni</A> -<A HREF="ohe.html">`Ohe</A> -<A HREF="ohia.html">`Ohi`a `Ai</A> -<A HREF="olena.html">`Olena</A> -<A HREF="olona.html">Olona</A> -<A HREF="pia.html">Pia</A> -<A HREF="uala.html">`Uala</A> -<A HREF="uhi.html">Uhi</A> -<A HREF="ulu.html">`Ulu</A> -<A HREF="wauke.html">Wauke</A></FONT></TABLE></CENTER><A HREF="index.html"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="canostss.gif" BORDER="0"></A> Return to the <A HREF="index.html">Canoe Plants Home Page</A> or the <A HREF="index.html#contents">Table of Contents</A><P></HTML>

This tree is strong, resilient and can provide us with our most basic need for life - water!  I am told that the most sterile water on earth is from this nut.  There are stories of island and coastal people surviving months of drought with this the only drinking water available.  Coconut water and fish can provide sustenance.<P><STRONG><EM>Coco nucifer</EM></STRONG>, <STRONG>niu's</STRONG> scientific and botanical name, is slender and tall, up to 100 feet, with a cluster of leaves at the top of a slightly curved stem or trunk.  It has a swollen base which is ringed, making a perfect ladder for the very agile.  These steps mark points of attachment of the fallen leaf fronds, which are from 10 to 18 feet long.  The trunk is very strong and elastic, and is able to bend in heavy winds.  In times of hurricanes the coconut palm has been a life saver.  People lashing themselves to this flexible tree have avoided being swept out to sea.  <P>Hawai`i is on the edge of the coconut belt.  The coconut bears better nearer the equator, where it is more widely used than here.  In Hawai`i there are other plants, native and introduced, that provide as well for people's needs.  <STRONG>Niu</STRONG> was valued cargo on the sailing canoes of the original <A HREF="index.html#pvs">Polynesian voyagers</A> to Hawai`i Nei.  Some of the ancestors of our trees also floated ashore, alive for up to 4 months at sea, still able to germinate. Coconuts grow well near the ocean, thriving in sandy soil near salt spray.  Maui's Hana coast has the remnants of many ancient groves. <P>This palm is the most useful plant of the tropics.  It is said that more uses are made of it than any other tree in the world.  Besides drink, food and shade, <STRONG>niu</STRONG> offers the possibilities of housing, thatching, hats, baskets, furniture, mats, cordage, clothing, charcoal, brooms, fans, ornaments, musical instruments, shampoo, containers, implements and oil for fuel, light, ointments, soap and more.  <P>Traditionally, a coconut palm is planted at the birth time of a kama`aina.  The tree bears fruit around the seventh birthday, for up to 70-100 years, providing food for a human lifetime.  There may be up to 50 fruit a year.  A he`e, octopus, was often planted in the bottom of the hole, furnishing fertilizer and giving the plant the idea of roots that spread and grip, and a body that is fat and round.<P>Nectar-producing fountaining flowers, in a spathe, bloom at any time of year.  The budding flower sprays are tapped for their sap, which can yield sweet syrup, vinegar or wine.  Left untrimmed, the tree continually produces a prodigious number of nuts, with mature fruit constantly available.  It takes 15 months from flower to mature fruit, but the nut (drupe) is usable at about 5 months.  The mature fruit is 10 to 12 inches long, usually with 3 sides, having a thick fibrous husk encasing the hard-shelled, one seeded nut.  There are 3 pores at one end.  One pore may be easily punched to obtain the water.  <P>The perfect drinking nut is full-sized, yet immature.  It is green, with no trace of yellow color, and it must be picked.  Up to one quart of water is inside, but you can't hear it when you shake it.  The yellow or browning coconut is mature when it drops to the ground.  There is still some water in the cavity, which can be combined to make coconut milk.  Coconut milk is a blend of coconut water and the scrapings of the coconut meat.  This milk is a good source of iron and contains calcium, phosphorus, protein and vitamins.<P>Coconut water, like the <A HREF="kalo.html">taro</A>, is an alkali producer in the digestive system and therefore helps in the important balancing of pH in the human body.  Often, a too-acidic body is prone to disease, whereas if the pH is balanced with alkaline-producing foods, the body is more prone to stay in good health.<P>As food, the <STRONG>niu</STRONG> flesh or meat is used for different purposes, depending upon the maturity of the nut.  The jelly-like spoon meat of a green nut is called `o`io.  The next stage is haohao, when the shell is still white and the flesh soft and white.  Half ripe, at the ho`ilikole state, it is eaten raw with Hawai`i red salt and <A HREF="kalo.html">poi</A>.  At the o`o stage, the nut is mature, but the husk not dried.  The flesh of a mature nut at the malo`o stage is used to make coconut cream, which when mixed with <A HREF="kalo.html">kalo/taro</A> makes a dish called kulolo; with <A HREF="uala.html">`uala/sweet potato</A> it is called poipalau; and paipaiee with ripe <A HREF="ulu.html">`ulu/breadfruit</A>.  These delicious dessert-like foods were traditionally cooked in the imu, underground oven.  Haupia is made with <STRONG>niu</STRONG> cream mixed with <A HREF="pia.html">pia/Polynesian arrowroot</A>, traditionally wrapped in <A HREF="ki.html">ki/ti</A> leaves and baked in the imu.  The mature meat of coconut is also grated, squeezed or scraped to be cooked in main dishes with fish, chicken or greens.<P>Medicinally, a small piece of coconut meat was chewed following the ingestion of disagreeable tasting medicines.  Fishermen also chewed the meat and spit the oil onto the water, to produce a glossy calm place, smooth enough to spot the fish below the surface.<P>The malo`o stage is also the stage for planting.  Propagation is by planting the whole coconut, usually at its growing site.  It is easy to determine the top of the nut by floating it in water.  Plant it with this side up, partially cover and keep moist.  Germination occurs in four to five months.<P>If the <STRONG>coconut</STRONG> is to be transplanted, germination should be atop wide screening or loose rocks to prevent the roots from taking hold.  The plant should be moved before it is a foot high.  The plant responds well to organic fertilization and mulching, particularly as it later begins to bear.<P>The <STRONG>coconut</STRONG> heart is sometimes eaten as a vegetable, when a felled tree presents itself.  The heart is located just below the crown of leaves, and can be as long as a human leg.  It keeps fresh for about two weeks.  The iho, spongy pulp, in a sprouting nut is also considered choice food.<P><EM>Wahi ka <STRONG>niu</STRONG></EM>, break open the<STRONG> coconut!</STRONG><P><IMG SRC="hrcolor2.gif"><BR><P><CENTER><TABLE BORDER="2" CELLPADDING="2"><TR><TD ALIGN="center">The 24 "Canoe Plants" of Ancient Hawai`i</TD><TR><TR><TD ALIGN="center"><FONT SIZE="-1"><A HREF="ape.html">`Ape</A> -<A HREF="awa.html">`Awa</A> -<A HREF="awapuhi.html">`Awapuhi</A> -<A HREF="hau.html">Hau</A> -<A HREF="ipu.html">Ipu</A> -<A HREF="kalo.html">Kalo</A> -<A HREF="kamani.html">Kamani</A> -<A HREF="ki.html">Ki</A> -<A HREF="ko.html">Ko</A> -<A HREF="kou.html">Kou</A> -<A HREF="kukui.html">Kukui</A> -<A HREF="maia.html">Mai`a</A><BR><A HREF="milo.html">Milo</A> -<A HREF="noni.html">Noni</A> -<A HREF="ohe.html">`Ohe</A> -<A HREF="ohia.html">`Ohi`a `Ai</A> -<A HREF="olena.html">`Olena</A> -<A HREF="olona.html">Olona</A> -<A HREF="pia.html">Pia</A> -<A HREF="uala.html">`Uala</A> -<A HREF="uhi.html">Uhi</A> -<A HREF="ulu.html">`Ulu</A> -<A HREF="wauke.html">Wauke</A></FONT></TABLE></CENTER><A HREF="index.html"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="canostss.gif" BORDER="0"></A> Return to the <A HREF="index.html">Canoe Plants Home Page</A> or the <A HREF="index.html#contents">Table of Contents</A><P></HTML>

<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="noni-color.gif" VSPACE=4 HSPACE=8>
This is a fascinating plant, demanding of our respect.  Its prolific beauty, bearing fruit year round...as if to say, "here I am, please use me."  However, as you may already be aware, few of us are willing to make its intimate acquaintance.  The aroma of its fruit is truly awesome.  Some say "disgusting" or "horrid" or "stinks bad" or worse.  And, it doesn't taste good either!  Yet, it is well-known to be one of the main healers among the traditional Hawai`i medicinal plants.  It is said that this plant food is to be used when we are feeling really ill or really old.
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="noni-line.gif" VSPACE=4 HSPACE=8>
The <STRONG>noni</STRONG>, also known as <STRONG>Indian Mulberry</STRONG>, with the scientific name of <STRONG><EM>Morinda citrifolia</STRONG></EM>, is a small evergreen shrub or tree, usually less than 10 feet high, occasionally up to 20 feet.  The conspicuous large dark green shiny leaves are generally paired, except where forming fruit.  Thick and oval in shape, they are deep veined, short-stemmed and 8 inches or longer.  The flowers form in globose heads, about an inch long and bearing many small white flowers.  The flower heads grow to become mature fruit, 3 to 4 inches in diameter.  The fruits resemble those of <A HREF="ulu.html">`ulu, breadfruit</A>, only smaller.  The surface is divided into somewhat warty polygonal pitted cells.  The <STRONG>noni</STRONG> fruit begins green, turns yellow, and as mentioned, has an unpleasant, insipid, foul or fetid odor, especially as it ripens to whiteness and falls from the tree.
<P>
In the early morning, the best time to pick most plants, I carry  a gallon glass jar like the institutional ones for pickles, and pule (pray with) the plant, thanking it for its food.  I pick the fruit at its yellow stage, filling the jar and capping it tightly.  I place the jar in a sunny spot, letting it set there for five days to a week or more, until the fruit turns to mush and sun-charged juices drain into the bottom of the jar.  It is these juices that can be strained into a cleaner smaller jar, and then refrigerated until used.  
<P>
Another method taught by Hawai`i's healers is to pick the fruit before ripe, letting it ripen within the home.  When soft, place it in a blender with a little fresh water and make into a sauce.  Then mash and strain through a sieve.  This concoction can be refrigerated in a clean glass jar, and the person who wishes the medicine can take a clean straw and slurp two sucks from the jar, in the morning and in the evening.
<P>
As a medicine, the fruit and its juices have been used in the treatment of diabetes, heart troubles and high blood pressure, with different portions prescribed for different illnesses.
<P>
The juices can be diluted with clean water or a fruit juice such as apple, and drunk before meals and at resting periods.  Treatment should always be at a relaxed time, not before going to work.  It is good to seek the advice of an Hawai`i health practitioner before using any plant medicines.  <STRONG>Noni</STRONG> is believed to have been brought here centuries ago by early <A HREF="index.html#pvs">Polynesian settlers</A>, and is a native of the Pacific islands, Asia and Australia.
<P>
The late Uncle Harry Mitchell of Keanae, Maui, suggested using <STRONG>noni</STRONG> with garlic, both being great blood purifiers and cleansers of bacteria from the body.  He also mentioned boiling it for use with diabetes, and using it strained raw for heart problems and high blood pressure, as it is said to increase the flow of blood.
<P>
The young unripe fruit can be pounded thoroughly with salt and the mixture placed carefully on deep cuts and on broken bones.  Sometimes the juice is squeezed out of this mixture, boiled and applied to the wounds.  The ripe fruit can be used as a poultice for facial blemishes, rubbed until the oil disappears, and also to draw out the pus and core from an infected sore or boil, such as with a staph infection.  In the old days, this was tied on with a bandage of <A HREF="wauke.html">tapa bark</A> cloth.  The dressing of <STRONG>noni</STRONG> could be reapplied more than once for difficult cases.
<P>
There are those that eat <STRONG>noni's</STRONG> fruit unripened, either as a food in times of scarcity, or as a tonic when needed.  Other people make a tea using the leaves of this plant.  The fruit was used in a recipe for a reputed remedy against tuberculosis, arthritis, rheumatism and the changes of old age.  The leaves and bark of the stem were pounded and strained, resulting in a liquid drunk as a tonic or for urinary disorders, muscle and joint pain.  The juice of the fruit was applied to the hair to rid it of head lice, uku, followed whenever possible by a fragrant shampoo of <A HREF="awapuhi.html">`awapuhi kuahiwi</A> or <A HREF="niu.html">coconut</A> water.  
<P>
Other uses for this ancient Polynesian plant: the bark yields a red dye, while a yellow dye can be prepared from the root.  Both colors were use to dye the <A HREF="wauke.html">tapa</A> cloth of the chiefs of ancient Hawai`i.
<P>
Cultivation is either by seed or cutting.  <STRONG>Noni</STRONG> is a valuable plant to have nearby the home of anyone wishing to utilize the many natural healing properties of this remarkable life sustaining plant.

(For more information on the many incredible values and uses of <STRONG>`ohe / bamboo</STRONG>, see the list of related web sites at the bottom of this page.)
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="ohe-line.gif" VSPACE=4 HSPACE=8>
This versatile and giant member of the grass family is able to grow more rapidly than any other plant.  After two months of growth it is the size it will remain for its lifetime.  <STRONG>Bamboo</STRONG>, as well as <A HREF="niu.html">niu, coconut</A>, is one of the most useful and practical plants for humankind, providing food, shelter, medicine, raw materials for household and garden use, musical instruments and more.
<P>
<STRONG>`Ohe</STRONG> is said to be one of the "canoe plants" brought to Hawai`i Nei by early <A HREF="index.html#pvs">Polynesian settlers in their oceanic navigation</A>.  This plant may have originated in India or Java.
<P>
The two types of <STRONG>`Ohe</STRONG> or <STRONG>"Hawaiian Bamboo"</STRONG> both have thin walled culms and long internodes.
One is <STRONG><EM>Schizostachyum glaucifolium</EM></STRONG> and the other is a green <STRONG><EM>Bambusa</STRONG></EM>.  Both are clumping bamboos. They seldom flower.  Most bamboo do flower, but only once in 60-120 years, with large heads much like those of <A HREF="ko.html">sugar cane</A>.  After blooming, all of the bamboo plants of the same species die back.  This happens worldwide at the same time!  Quite a remarkable feat, right out there with the similar global songs of the Humpback whales.  Overall, there are more than 1000 kinds of bamboo, all of them relatives of the <A HREF="ko.html">sugar cane</A> and of corn.
<P>
This vigorous and fertile plant flourishes in warm moist forests.  Growing to more than 50 feet high, some bamboo can reach 100 feet in height, growing up to 18 inches a day.  The stems have hollow thin-walled internodes with thick hard nodes joining them.  The beauty and purity of line is very pleasing to see.
<P>
Bamboo grows in clumps of culms called sympodial, the term for tropical bamboo that grows directly from the parent, where the culm and rhizome are one.  Other kinds of bamboo have a single free-standing culm and are called monopodial, which means they grow out of a rhizome that travels fast and far underground. 
<P>
Valuable in the control of soil erosion, bamboo can be propagated from young rhizomes or from cuttings.  The plant needs rich moist soil, full sun and nitrogen.  Upon Maui's Haleakala's slopes above Keanae in an area called Waikamoi, it is said that the Polynesian goddess Hina planted a grove of <STRONG>`ohe</STRONG> brought from Tahiti.
<P>
The leaves of <STRONG>`ohe</STRONG> are long, flat, thin and pointed, with rough undersides that can cut.  They are different lengths, depending upon the variety, the largest being about 14 inches long by 2 inches wide.  Most varieties shed their leaves yearly, growing new ones that appear immediately.
<P>
The Japanese name for bamboo is take, while the Chinese call it chu.
<P>
Bamboo's usefulness takes many forms.  People of ancient Hawai`i used <STRONG>`ohe</STRONG> to kindle fires, blowing air through hollow tubes onto the embers.  This tool was called <STRONG>`ohe puhi ahi</STRONG>.
<P>
To irrigate their crops, kanaka would cut the <STRONG>`ohe</STRONG> in half lengthwise, then cut out the middle of the node walls, allowing water to flow down these irrigation troughs from the stream into the different levels of the <A HREF="kalo.html">taro</A> pond fields.
<P>
A traditional knife for cutting the umbilical cord of a newborn was fashioned of bamboo, as were skewers to string <A HREF="kukui.html">kukui</A> nuts for candles, lama or kali <A HREF="kukui.html">kukui</A>.
<P>
In the <A HREF="wauke.html">tapa</A> cloth-making process, women used lapa, bamboo sticks, to apply dye.  Also, <STRONG>`ohe</STRONG> sticks were cut out to create designs that were then stamped with dye into intricate geometric patterns on the <A HREF="wauke.html">kapa</A>.  The stamps of bamboo were called <STRONG>`ohe kapala</STRONG>.
<P>
The <STRONG>`ohe</STRONG> stem is a valuable plant for hula accompaniment.  A three-holed nose flute, <STRONG>`ohe hano ihu</STRONG>, is made from the hollow stem of the thin-walled bamboo, as well as percussion instruments, including the pu`ili, fringed split bamboo tubes about two feet long that rattle when hit.  Other sounds can emanate from the <STRONG>`ohe ka `eke`eke</STRONG>, tubes of the thick-walled bamboo, with closed nodes on the bottom end.  These are alternately struck on the ground to make tones.  Another instrument using bamboo is the <STRONG>`ohe kani</STRONG>, somewhat like a Jew's harp.
<P>
Bamboo wood has silica in its cell walls and is hard, straight, strong, flexible, light and easily split.  
<P>
Lengths of <STRONG>`ohe</STRONG> with closed ends can be used as a water carrier.  Surely, these vessels of water would have been invaluable on ocean voyages.  Along with the <A HREF="ipu.html">gourd, `ipu</A>, the needs for water vessels was well met.  Other uses for the bamboo stems are for building, posts, bridges, vessels, gutters, floats, hives, canes, flutes, masts, furniture, utensils, agricultural tools, ladders, ornaments, toys and fishing poles.  If the bamboo is dried correctly, the esthetic smooth beauty of bamboo stalks can be maintained for years.  Otherwise, rot and mildew can occur.
<P>
Split bamboo can be made into mats, hats, screens, baskets, fans, umbrellas, brushes, paper, ropes, roofing tiles, wall mats, or as a part of the sleds of old Hawai`i, called holua.
<P>
As food, the young shoots are eaten, as are seeds of some varieties.
<P>
<STRONG>`Ohe</STRONG> is said to be the kinolau, body form, of the Polynesian creator god Kane, along with <A HREF="kalo.html">kalo/taro</A> and <A HREF="ko.html">ko/sugar cane</A>.

Looking up, you will probably see the parent tree, branches bursting full of cerise tufted blossoms.  This is <STRONG>`ohi`a `ai</STRONG>.  Its stamens are being released.  It's spring...usually March-April in Hawai`i.<P><STRONG>Queen Liliu`okalani</STRONG> wrote in a letter to a friend in 1901 that..."for it to rain while the sun shines, the old wise ones say that these showers are for strewing the petals of our <STRONG>mountain apples</STRONG>, preparation to the coming of the fruit - then another shower and the ripening of it.  It is very poetical to us - the idea is continuity of life."<P>As summer arrives, we can look forward to the fruit of the <STRONG>`ohi`a `ai</STRONG>.  Late summer and early autumn is the time to gather the apples.  Be sure to take along a long-handled fruit picker, because these offerings are usually high up and beyond easy reach.  <P>A member of the myrtle family, <STRONG><EM>Eugenia malaccensis</STRONG></EM> grows in groves or alone in protected shady valleys where there is plentiful rainfall.  The trees are found in humid areas, at altitudes of up to 1800 feet on the windward mountainsides of the islands.  The tree may be as tall as 50 feet or only a small shrub.  It is said to have originated in India and Malaysia, which accounts for the fruit sometimes being called <STRONG>Malay apple</STRONG>.  This plant grows well on many Pacific islands and is another of the plants whose seed were brought to Hawai`i by early <A HREF="index.html#pvs">Polynesian settlers</A>.  <P><STRONG>`Ohi`a `ai</STRONG> is a relative of the yellow rose apple and the crimson flowered <STRONG>`Ohi`a `lehua</STRONG> <A HREF="http://hawaii-nation.org/nation/ohiabird.jpeg">(JPEG)</A>. <A HREF="http://hawaii-nation.org/nation/ohiabird.jpeg"><IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="ohiabirdsm.gif" VSPACE=2 HSPACE=6  BORDER=1></A> The blossoms all secrete sweet nectars that attract birds and insects.  <STRONG>`Ohi`a `ai</STRONG> is also related to guava, eucalyptus, Java plum, Surinam cherry and allspice.  In Malaysia and India, the rose apple represents the golden fruit of immortality and is associated with the Buddha.  In Hawai`i, the red <STRONG>`ohi`a `lehua</STRONG> is associated with the goddess of the volcano and fire, Pele, about whom many songs and legends abound.  It is also treated in reverence to Ku and Kane.  In Tahiti, the <STRONG>`ohi`a `ai</STRONG> is called ahia and was traditionally for sacred temple use.  The <STRONG>`ohi`a `ai</STRONG> was perhaps one of the few fruit of the people of Hawai`i before others were introduced by Europeans and other later settlers.<P>The trunk of the <STRONG>mountain apple tree</STRONG> was used by the people of old to build beams for their hale, house.  The tree has gray, smooth, spotted bark.  The bark is traditionally used for medicine.  The leaves are dark green, smooth and shiny, thick and oval and are paired.  The youngest leaves are usually tinged with read.  They are also used for medicine.  It is said that young leaves from saplings and the bark from mature trees are made into a warm drink for the mother of a newborn baby.  This is to assist in expelling the afterbirth and to cleanse the mother's body after giving birth or even after a miscarriage.  Remedies using pounded bark have been used in the mouth for lesions and also for lacerations.  The leaves can be processed for a tonic, and the old fruit of this plant was considered a helpful remedy for sore throats.<P>A reddish brown dye for making patterns on <A HREF="wauke.html">kapa, tapa bark</A> cloth, was processed from the bark and the root of <STRONG>`ohi`a `ai</STRONG>.<P>The cerise colored flower blossoms are shaped like a star-burst of bright filaments, growing on short stems on the tree's trunk and main branches.  There is also a variety of <STRONG>mountain apple</STRONG> that has white blossoms and fruit.<P>After 7 to 8 years, the tree begins to bear fruit, usually in June.  The waxy fruit are thin-skinned, delicate, crimson-red with splotches of pink and white.  They hang all along the branches and trunk, rather than at the ends of twigs, like some other fruit.  They are 2 to 3 inches long, oval and slightly block-shaped.  The fruit pulp is crisp, white, sweet, juicy and refreshing.  The delicate taste is not very distinctive, somewhat like a pear.  Inside are 1 or 2 large round brown seeds.  We can grow backyard trees from these seeds, watering them well and looking ahead seven years to maturity and the tree's fruit bearing.<P>Usually, the fruit is eaten raw, but sometimes it is dried and eaten later.  It is also made into preserves and pickles.  Fresh is best!<P><EM>O Hinaia`ele`ele ka malama, `aluka ka pala a ka <STRONG>`ohi`a</STRONG>.</EM>  Hinaia`ele`ele is the month when the <STRONG>mountain apples</STRONG> open everywhere.<P><IMG SRC="hrcolor2.gif"><BR><P><CENTER><TABLE BORDER="2" CELLPADDING="2"><TR><TD ALIGN="center">The 24 "Canoe Plants" of Ancient Hawai`i</TD><TR><TR><TD ALIGN="center"><FONT SIZE="-1"><A HREF="ape.html">`Ape</A> -<A HREF="awa.html">`Awa</A> -<A HREF="awapuhi.html">`Awapuhi</A> -<A HREF="hau.html">Hau</A> -<A HREF="ipu.html">Ipu</A> -<A HREF="kalo.html">Kalo</A> -<A HREF="kamani.html">Kamani</A> -<A HREF="ki.html">Ki</A> -<A HREF="ko.html">Ko</A> -<A HREF="kou.html">Kou</A> -<A HREF="kukui.html">Kukui</A> -<A HREF="maia.html">Mai`a</A><BR><A HREF="milo.html">Milo</A> -<A HREF="niu.html">Niu</A> -<A HREF="noni.html">Noni</A> -<A HREF="ohe.html">`Ohe</A> -<A HREF="olena.html">`Olena</A> -<A HREF="olona.html">Olona</A> -<A HREF="pia.html">Pia</A> -<A HREF="uala.html">`Uala</A> -<A HREF="uhi.html">Uhi</A> -<A HREF="ulu.html">`Ulu</A> -<A HREF="wauke.html">Wauke</A></FONT></TABLE></CENTER><A HREF="index.html"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="canostss.gif" BORDER="0"></A> Return to the <A HREF="index.html">Canoe Plants Home Page</A> or the <A HREF="index.html#contents">Table of Contents</A><P></HTML>

It is best known throughout the world as <STRONG>Turmeric</STRONG>.<P><STRONG>`Olena</STRONG> is rarely found in Hawai`i today.  It grows in cultivation and in the wild in moist forested valleys, up to altitudes of 3000 feet, preferring shade, yet able to tolerate heat.<P>The <STRONG>`olena</STRONG> is without a stem, yet the overlapping clustered leaves appear to be growing out of a stem above ground.  The leaves are blade-like, 8 inches long by 3 inches wide, and rise to about 20 inches high, directly from the underground root.  This root/rhizome grows its leaves much as the <A HREF="maia.html">banana</A> does.<P>It is <STRONG>`olena's</STRONG> rhizome which is precious.  In tropical India, turmeric is widely cultivated as a dye and as a spice, being the yellow color we associate with curry powder, which is actually a mixture of spices that includes turmeric.  The root is thick and orange or yellow-colored on the inside.  It is this bright color that is characteristic of turmeric, the cooking spice.  In the language of Hawai`i, <STRONG>`olena</STRONG> means yellow.  Dyes from these roots were used to color <A HREF="wauke.html">tapa</A> cloth.  Young roots were steamed to provide a light yellow dye and the steamed older mature roots provided a golden or a deep orange dye.  The juice of crushed raw roots produces stain also.<P>Traditionally, this root can be used medicinally.  The roots are pounded and pressed to extract a juice that, when mixed with water, is helpful in earaches and to clear the sinuses through nasal application.  The astringent qualities of <STRONG>`olena</STRONG> are also useful in cases of consumption, tuberculosis, bronchitis, colds and asthma, the root being lightly cooked and then eaten.  At times <STRONG>`olena</STRONG> has been taken as a diuretic, and topically it can be helpful with pimples or to stop bleeding.<P>Ceremonially, the traditional use for <STRONG>`olena</STRONG> is as a purifier, containing much mana, spiritual power.  Pieces of the crushed root mixed with sea water are sprinkled to remove negative influences from places, persons and things.  Typically, when someone is ill, or when a home or other place is to be newly occupied and needing blessing, a ceremony is held.  To sprinkle, a <A HREF="ki.html">ti</A> leaf is dipped into a calabash or bowl containing the <STRONG>`olena</STRONG> and sea water.  The sprinkling is accompanied by prayers.<P>If you wish to cultivate <STRONG>`olena</STRONG> in your garden, remember that this plant likes rich soil, some shade and plenty of water.  After the rhizomes are planted, <STRONG>`olena</STRONG> hides in the garden for three or more months.  In addition, this plant is usually dormant from about September to March, but the roots do survive and will revive to come up with green leaves once again.  When they do, they will later show flowers on a stem developing from the center of the leaf stalks, called petioles.  The cylindrical flower cluster is about 5 inches long.  The pale yellow and white flowers grow on the lower pale green bract, while the upper pinkish part of the bract grows no flowers.<P><IMG SRC="hrcolor2.gif"><BR><P><CENTER><TABLE BORDER="2" CELLPADDING="2"><TR><TD ALIGN="center">The 24 "Canoe Plants" of Ancient Hawai`i</TD><TR><TR><TD ALIGN="center"><FONT SIZE="-1"><A HREF="ape.html">`Ape</A> -<A HREF="awa.html">`Awa</A> -<A HREF="awapuhi.html">`Awapuhi</A> -<A HREF="hau.html">Hau</A> -<A HREF="ipu.html">Ipu</A> -<A HREF="kalo.html">Kalo</A> -<A HREF="kamani.html">Kamani</A> -<A HREF="ki.html">Ki</A> -<A HREF="ko.html">Ko</A> -<A HREF="kou.html">Kou</A> -<A HREF="kukui.html">Kukui</A> -<A HREF="maia.html">Mai`a</A><BR><A HREF="milo.html">Milo</A> -<A HREF="niu.html">Niu</A> -<A HREF="noni.html">Noni</A> -<A HREF="ohe.html">`Ohe</A> -<A HREF="ohia.html">`Ohi`a `Ai</A> -<A HREF="olona.html">Olona</A> -<A HREF="pia.html">Pia</A> -<A HREF="uala.html">`Uala</A> -<A HREF="uhi.html">Uhi</A> -<A HREF="ulu.html">`Ulu</A> -<A HREF="wauke.html">Wauke</A></FONT></TABLE></CENTER><A HREF="index.html"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="canostss.gif" BORDER="0"></A> Return to the <A HREF="index.html">Canoe Plants Home Page</A> or the <A HREF="index.html#contents">Table of Contents</A><P></HTML>

Although it is not common today, this stout-stemmed rain forest shrub of the nettle family can still be found in the gullies of lower elevation forests, near the 2,000 foot level, or in very wet boggy interior valleys near streams.<P>With 4 to 8 foot tall stems in the wild, the bark of <STRONG>olona</STRONG> slips off easily, revealing the inner bark or bast, which is made up of fine quality fibers that are durable and said to be many times stronger than hemp fiber.

The leaves have netted veins that are more prominent on the underside, due to their reddish-brown color.<P><STRONG>Olona</STRONG> has multiple flowers that turn to clustered flesh-orange colored fruit at the ends of the branches.  These resemble the "mulberry" of Mamaki, a close relative.<P>Propagation is from rooted stem cuttings, root shoots and occasionally from seeds, all of which were thickly planted in previously cleared areas.  Although seldom cultivated these days, in ancient Hawai`i <STRONG>olona</STRONG> was widely cultivated in very wet interior valleys upland.<P>Some <STRONG>olona</STRONG> plantation patches were as large as 2 to 3 acres.  The cuttings were planted close together to encourage straight unbranched stems.  The few branches that did grow were removed regularly.  In a year's time the plants were mature enough to harvest.  They were 6 to 10 feet tall, and the bark could be easily stripped at this young age.<P>Temporary crude shelters for hanging the drying strips of <STRONG>olona</STRONG> were built near the <STRONG>olona</STRONG> patch.  The leaves were removed, and the stems cut at soil level, so shoots would regrow.  The stems (with a few leaf nodes) which were taken were ripped into strips, usually 6 feet long and 1 to 2 inches wide.  The outer bark was carefully stripped off with opihi/limpet shells or with pearl shells, usually over hardwood boards or large flat stones.  The strips were then rolled inside out, and soaked for a few short days in a shallow place in a nearby stream.  The next step was to scrape off the remaining pulp with seashell or turtle shell scrapers.  The strips were then hung to dry in the shed.  At the same time workers were separating the clean strong fibers into various widths, and bundling them into rolls for the return to the village.  There they were bleached in the sunlight and later twisted by the village women into fine cordage of varying thicknesses.<P>The white cordage was highly valued for its light weight and its exceeding great strength under duress.<P>After Captain Cook's arrival, later traders prized and purchases <STRONG>olona</STRONG> cordage for ship's rigging and for whaler's harpoon lines.  Word reached Europe of the superior qualities of Hawai`i's <STRONG>olona</STRONG> cordage, such as it does not kink nor stretch, and Swiss climbers began to import it for their use in the mountains of the Alps.<P>The pliable whitish cordage and twine from <STRONG>olona</STRONG> remains soft and resists breaking down from exposure to sea water, so here in Hawai`i Nei it was the main fiber used for aho, fishing line, where the no-kink and no-stretch factors were also useful.  Fishnets with large mesh, upena, as well as finer fishnets, and net bags for carrying containers, koko, were also crafted from <STRONG>olona</STRONG> fiber.  To prolong its life, it was often treated with <A HREF="kukui.html">kukui</A> oil.<P>Carefully crafted <STRONG>olona</STRONG> fibers made up the net base that provided backing for the exceptionally fine feather cloaks, ahu`ula, as well as for some of the feather helmets, mahiole, and for <A HREF="ki.html">ti</A> leaf capes, ahu la`i.  Kahili feather standard (as appears in the center of the Nation of Hawai`i flag) were wound with <STRONG>olona</STRONG> cord.  <STRONG>Olona</STRONG> cordage was superior for tying adz heads to hau wood handles.<P>Other uses for <STRONG>olona</STRONG> in ancient Hawai`i were as threads for stitching together <A HREF="wauke.html">kapa, tapa bark</A> cloth, into garments, for stringing and wrapping all manner of lei, to tie off the umbilical cord after a birth, for canoes lines and for every possible purpose that we today might use rope, twine, string or thread.<P><IMG SRC="hrcolor2.gif"><BR><P><CENTER><TABLE BORDER="2" CELLPADDING="2"><TR><TD ALIGN="center">The 24 "Canoe Plants" of Ancient Hawai`i</TD><TR><TR><TD ALIGN="center"><FONT SIZE="-1"><A HREF="ape.html">`Ape</A> -<A HREF="awa.html">`Awa</A> -<A HREF="awapuhi.html">`Awapuhi</A> -<A HREF="hau.html">Hau</A> -<A HREF="ipu.html">Ipu</A> -<A HREF="kalo.html">Kalo</A> -<A HREF="kamani.html">Kamani</A> -<A HREF="ki.html">Ki</A> -<A HREF="ko.html">Ko</A> -<A HREF="kou.html">Kou</A> -<A HREF="kukui.html">Kukui</A> -<A HREF="maia.html">Mai`a</A><BR><A HREF="milo.html">Milo</A> -<A HREF="niu.html">Niu</A> -<A HREF="noni.html">Noni</A> -<A HREF="ohe.html">`Ohe</A> -<A HREF="ohia.html">`Ohi`a `Ai</A> -<A HREF="olena.html">`Olena</A> -<A HREF="pia.html">Pia</A> -<A HREF="uala.html">`Uala</A> -<A HREF="uhi.html">Uhi</A> -<A HREF="ulu.html">`Ulu</A> -<A HREF="wauke.html">Wauke</A></FONT></TABLE></CENTER><A HREF="index.html"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="canostss.gif" BORDER="0"></A> Return to the <A HREF="index.html">Canoe Plants Home Page</A> or the <A HREF="index.html#contents">Table of Contents</A><P></HTML>

Sometimes <STRONG>pia</STRONG> is also confused with Maranta arundinacea, called arrowroot for its arrow-shaped, starchy edible root.<P>The tuber/hua of <STRONG>pia</STRONG> is white and nearly round.  The highly starchy carbohydrate was traditionally grated or pounded and put into a calabash with water, where the starch settled to the bottom.  <P>Each day, the water was poured off and fresh water was added.  This was done to release the bitterness of the root.  When the bitterness was gone, the starch was spread on flat rocks to dry in the sun.<P>Later, the sheet of starch was scraped off and ground into a powder using a stone mortar and pestle.  Starch that was not immediately needed was stored, often in the shape of small cakes.<P>Traditionally, prepared <STRONG>pia</STRONG> is mixed with <A HREF="niu.html">coconut</A> milk or cream and steamed, boiled or baked into the dessert pudding called haupia.<P>Medicinally, the raw dry starch was added to water and taken several times a day to cure diarrhea.  For severe cases, such as dysentery, the <STRONG>pia</STRONG> was mixed with alae, red clay, to provide iron for rehabilitation, being careful to know the right quantities to ingest so as not to cause constipation.  This combination was also used to stop internal hemorrhaging in the stomach and colon.<P><STRONG>Pia</STRONG> can also be useful in the household, as a laundry starch, to stiffen fabrics.<P>Polynesian arrowroot grows in moist, open woods at low altitudes, in warm and shady places.  It was once widely cultivated, usually alongside <A HREF="kalo.html">kalo</A> lo`i, <A HREF="kalo.html">taro</A> ponds, as well as in village gardens.  Nowadays, it is rare and isolated, usually found near streams in the wild or in an occasional garden, where it is often grown as an ornamental plant.<P>To propagate <STRONG>pia</STRONG>, plant the tuber in a hole, near the end of the rainy season. The best time to harvest the tubers is when the leaves are dry and yellowing.  <STRONG>Pia's</STRONG> leaves die in winter, while the underground tubers remain dormant until springtime.  In the spring, the slender, finely grooved leafstalks are sent up 1 to 3 feet high, with broad leaves, similar in appearance to papaya leaves - divided, with many lobes.  These are 1 to 2 feet wide.<P>The leaf upper surface has depressed veins, and the under surface is shiny with bold yellow veins.  Near the end of the annual above-ground growing season, numerous small green and purple flowers appear at the top of <STRONG>pia's</STRONG> flower stalks.  These are accompanied by leafy bracts and by thready green and purplish bracelets that are 4 to 9 inches long.<P>If growing an old-fashioned Hawai`i garden is a consideration for your family, <STRONG>pia</STRONG> is one of the plants you may wish to include.<P><IMG SRC="hrcolor2.gif"><BR><P><CENTER><TABLE BORDER="2" CELLPADDING="2"><TR><TD ALIGN="center">The 24 "Canoe Plants" of Ancient Hawai`i</TD><TR><TR><TD ALIGN="center"><FONT SIZE="-1"><A HREF="ape.html">`Ape</A> -<A HREF="awa.html">`Awa</A> -<A HREF="awapuhi.html">`Awapuhi</A> -<A HREF="hau.html">Hau</A> -<A HREF="ipu.html">Ipu</A> -<A HREF="kalo.html">Kalo</A> -<A HREF="kamani.html">Kamani</A> -<A HREF="ki.html">Ki</A> -<A HREF="ko.html">Ko</A> -<A HREF="kou.html">Kou</A> -<A HREF="kukui.html">Kukui</A> -<A HREF="maia.html">Mai`a</A><BR><A HREF="milo.html">Milo</A> -<A HREF="niu.html">Niu</A> -<A HREF="noni.html">Noni</A> -<A HREF="ohe.html">`Ohe</A> -<A HREF="ohia.html">`Ohi`a `Ai</A> -<A HREF="olena.html">`Olena</A> -<A HREF="olona.html">Olona</A> -<A HREF="uala.html">`Uala</A> -<A HREF="uhi.html">Uhi</A> -<A HREF="ulu.html">`Ulu</A> -<A HREF="wauke.html">Wauke</A></FONT></TABLE></CENTER><A HREF="index.html"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="canostss.gif" BORDER="0"></A> Return to the <A HREF="index.html">Canoe Plants Home Page</A> or the <A HREF="index.html#contents">Table of Contents</A><P></HTML>

This member of the morning glory family is thought to be of tropical South American origin, and was brought to Hawai`i by early <A HREF="index.html#pvs">Polynesian settlers</A> as an important staple in their diet.  There are may varieties of Ipomoea batatas, most maturing in 3-7 months from time of planting.<P><IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="uala-line.gif" VSPACE=4 HSPACE=8>The people of ancient Hawai`i grew about 200 varieties of <STRONG>`uala</STRONG>.  Now there are only a few.  In old Hawai`i, the cultivation of <STRONG>`uala</STRONG> was one of the few agricultural ventures shared by both men and women.  <STRONG>`Uala</STRONG> is planted in mounds, ridges or flat ground, from sea level to 5,000 feet elevation.  These plants will grow in areas of poor soil with limited rainfall, but thrive in loamy soil, producing larger tubers where the soil is loose and more porous.  They are a drought-resistant vegetable, enjoying plenty of sunshine.  One hundred well-tended plants produce about 150 pounds of tubers.<P>This sweet potato is a vigorous plant that spreads its dark green heart-shaped or five-lobed leaves closely to the ground.  The large tuberous roots range in color from purple to white or orange.  The flowers are pinky-lavender and tubular, resembling small morning glories.<P>The season of planting varies with the variety and locale.  In a dry locality, after the early winter rains begin is considered the best planting time.  In wet areas, it is best to plant after a wintertime of rain is passing.  <P>Propagation is from stem cuttings or slips, not from the tubers. the 6-9 inch slips are planted about a foot apart, preferably in mounds, pu`e, or ridges, allowing the vines to trail off outside the beds.  It is a good idea to plant <STRONG>`uala</STRONG> near the periphery of a garden, as the plants tend to take over the area in which they grow, and to wander on and on.<P>In planting, the older vines are used, with the cuttings being vine ends broken off from 10-20 inches from the tip.  Gather these in the evening, not in the heat of the day.  Pluck all leaves off except for three or four at the end, being careful to leave the leaf bud at the tip.  Planting can be the next day, or even several days later, if the slips are kept moist, such as in a bucket of water.  Root buds may begin to appear during this time.  <P>The leaves may be steamed, boiled or baked.  The tuber is a carbohydrate.  A good source of Vitamin A, calcium and phosphorus, most of the nutrients are near the skin.  Therefore, it is nutritionally best to steam or bake the potatoes in their scrubbed skins in an oven or in an imu, rather than to boil them.  If mixed with water, the cooked, skinned and mashed <STRONG>`uala</STRONG> makes a sweet potato poi.  The tubers and greens are also used as food for livestock, especially pigs.<P>In addition to providing food, some varieties in ancient days were used medicinally.  <STRONG>`Uala</STRONG> was used as a tonic during pregnancy and to induce lactation.  Other varieties were said to cure asthma.  <STRONG>`Uala</STRONG> was also used as a laxative, and could be prepared as a gargle for sore throat and to reduce phlegm.  Raw <STRONG>`uala</STRONG> mixed with <A HREF="ki.html">ti</A> stem was used when it was necessary to induce vomiting.  One variety was used as fish bait, while old vines and leaves of <STRONG>`uala</STRONG> were placed beneath floor mats as padding.<P>When harvesting the <STRONG>`uala</STRONG>, dig carefully so as not to injure the potato.  The tubers should be dried and cured in a protected place for a week after they are dug up.  During this process, the carbohydrates turn towards sugar, sweetening the flavor of the potato.<P>Kamapua`a is said to be the god of the <STRONG>sweet potato</STRONG>.  This god has a pig-like snout, making it possible for him to root up the tubers.  Happy growing, harvesting and eating of the <STRONG>`uala</STRONG> to you, even though unlike Kamapua`a, you use a trowel or shovel.<P><IMG SRC="hrcolor2.gif"><BR><P><CENTER><TABLE BORDER="2" CELLPADDING="2"><TR><TD ALIGN="center">The 24 "Canoe Plants" of Ancient Hawai`i</TD><TR><TR><TD ALIGN="center"><FONT SIZE="-1"><A HREF="ape.html">`Ape</A> -<A HREF="awa.html">`Awa</A> -<A HREF="awapuhi.html">`Awapuhi</A> -<A HREF="hau.html">Hau</A> -<A HREF="ipu.html">Ipu</A> -<A HREF="kalo.html">Kalo</A> -<A HREF="kamani.html">Kamani</A> -<A HREF="ki.html">Ki</A> -<A HREF="ko.html">Ko</A> -<A HREF="kou.html">Kou</A> -<A HREF="kukui.html">Kukui</A> -<A HREF="maia.html">Mai`a</A><BR><A HREF="milo.html">Milo</A> -<A HREF="niu.html">Niu</A> -<A HREF="noni.html">Noni</A> -<A HREF="ohe.html">`Ohe</A> -<A HREF="ohia.html">`Ohi`a `Ai</A> -<A HREF="olena.html">`Olena</A> -<A HREF="olona.html">Olona</A> -<A HREF="pia.html">Pia</A> -<A HREF="uhi.html">Uhi</A> -<A HREF="ulu.html">`Ulu</A> -<A HREF="wauke.html">Wauke</A></FONT></TABLE></CENTER><A HREF="index.html"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="canostss.gif" BORDER="0"></A> Return to the <A HREF="index.html">Canoe Plants Home Page</A> or the <A HREF="index.html#contents">Table of Contents</A><P></HTML>

The other two yams brought here are <STRONG><EM>Discorea pentaphylla</EM></STRONG> or <STRONG>pi`a</STRONG> (not to be confused with <A HREF="pia.html">pia, Polynesian arrowroot</A>), and <STRONG><EM>Discorea bulbifera</EM></STRONG>, also called <STRONG>hoi</STRONG> (which is considered poisonous and should not be eaten, so it is curious that it is said to have been introduced here.)  Most likely originating in tropical Asia and carried eastward into Polynesia, <STRONG>uhi</STRONG> is not to be confused with <A HREF="uala.html">`uala, the sweet potato</A> of Hawai`i.<P>The people of ancient Hawai`i usually ate the delicious starchy carbohydrate <STRONG>uhi</STRONG> after cooking it in an imu, underground oven, eating it while still warm, as it is said to be fit only for pigs when cold.  It does not make good poi, because it is not sticky and is too mealy.  <STRONG>Uhi</STRONG> never did become as popular here as a staple food, as it did in other Pacific societies, such as Tonga, for instance.  Perhaps there was enough <A HREF="kalo.html">kalo</A>, <A HREF="uala.html">`uala</A> and <A HREF="ulu.html">`ulu</A> usually in season in Hawai`i.  <STRONG>Uhi</STRONG> is a vine that grows for support on tree trunks and branches in moist forests and gulches.  It is also grown upon stakes and other supports.  The vine grows during summertime and withers away in the winter, while the large edible tubers continue to grow underground.  New vine shoots appear at the beginning of the spring rainy season, which is the best time to dig up the yams to eat.  It takes a full year's cycle to grow a crop.  For food to be produced, the plants need a warm moist growing place with loose soil, and can be planted anytime of the year by propagation from pieces of the tuber, which will bear sprouts.  <P>Heart-shaped ovate leaves 3-6 inches long grow wing-like on opposite sides of a square stem that has 4 flat sides and twines to the right.  All yam leaves have veins that begin at the leaf base.<P>The flowers of <STRONG>uhi</STRONG> are small, with a yellow or yellow-green calyx and no petals.  The edible fruit, tuber, of the yam forms after the female flower is fertilized.  The tuber grows on an underground stem and is thick, variously shaped (lobed or elongated), depending on the variety.  The tubers are also variously colored.  Two of the varieties are <STRONG>ke`oke`o</STRONG>, which is white inside and outside, and <STRONG>`ula`ula</STRONG>, with red skin and white flesh.  The `ula`ula was also used as medicine and is said to have healing properties useful for coughs, constipation, dysentery, appendicitis and for counteracting vomiting blood.<P>The <STRONG>uhi</STRONG> yam was the most widely cultivated and could be found growing along steep hillsides, where special cultivation methods were devised.  The yam was also grown in bins, such as were built of tree-fern trunks on the big island of Hawai`i.  In the post-Cook contact days, the yams of these islands were widely cultivated in fields, and were procured by the tons for shipboard use, where they were preferred to <A HREF="uala.html">sweet potatoes</A> which germinated more rapidly.<P>The <STRONG>pi`a</STRONG> yam differs from the <STRONG>uhi</STRONG> yam, in that the vine stems are round, rather than square, and have no wings.  The alternate palmate leaves are divided into 3-5 lobes, instead of being ovate, and there are small spherical or horse-shoe shaped aerial tubers scattered along the stem where the leaves connect.  The underground tubers are bulbous, like turnips, or elongated, and are hairy with stiff rootlets.  The tubers vary from brown to reddish or white inside.  <STRONG>Pi`a</STRONG> are eaten cooked or warm, and are considered pig food when cold, like <STRONG>uhi</STRONG>.<P>The wild and very bitter poisonous yam called <STRONG>hoi</STRONG> can be recognized by its round stem and the round aerial tubers at the axils of the leaves (like the <STRONG>pi`a</STRONG>), but hoi has alternate heart-shaped leaves (like the <STRONG>uhi</STRONG>, but not winged like the <STRONG>uhi</STRONG>).  The underground tubers are usually in pairs, with one larger than the other, shaped like fans or flattened spheres, reddish-brown on the outside and white inside.  These should not be eaten as they are alkaloid and poisonous unless peeled and boiled and steeped in lime water for several days of changing the water frequently.  The hoi yam is described here only for identification purposes, so that it may be avoided.<P>The moral of the story is, know your yams before you gather or cultivate them.

The <STRONG>`ulu</STRONG> (fruit) grows on a smooth gray-barked tree that may attain heights of 40 to 60 feet.  The <STRONG>breadfruit tree</STRONG> is easily recognized by its bright dark-green leathery palmate leaves, which are deeply lobed and can be up to three feet long.  The branches reach out to a span of 30 to 60 feet.  Coming upon a grove of these large trees usually signifies an area of ancient settlement and cultivation in this mother nation Hawai`i.  <STRONG>`Ulu</STRONG> was one of the plants considered important enough to life and the culture of life for earliest <A HREF="index.html#pvs">Polynesian settlers</A> to have brought it in their <A HREF="index.html#pvs">canoes</A>, traveling to Hawai`i Nei from South Oceania.<P><STRONG>`Ulu</STRONG> belongs to the Moracceae (fig or mulberry) family.  Its scientific name is <STRONG><EM>Artocarpus communis</STRONG></EM> or <STRONG><EM>Artocarpis altilis</STRONG></EM>.  The staminate male flowers grow in an upright yellowish-green cylinder at the branch tips.  The pistillate female flowers form a large ball just below the male flowers.  It is this female flower that develops into a spherical or, depending on the variety, elongated green globe, rough on the surface, becoming about eight inches in diameter and weighing up to 10 pounds.  Its ripe fruit is yellowish or brownish.  The fruit is actually thousands of little fruit growing together around a core to form a ball with polygonal markings at each fruit boundary.  Its flesh is a mealy sweet pulp, similar to the potato.  <STRONG>`Ulu</STRONG> fruit is usually picked while still firm and will soften in a few days.  If not picked before it softens on the tree, it often falls and smashes.  Pick <STRONG>`ulu</STRONG> with the aid of a "picker", as the branches are brittle and can easily break.<P><STRONG>Breadfruit</STRONG>, the name for which <STRONG>`ulu</STRONG> is well-known, is a high carbohydrate vegetable, not a fruit as we generally use the term.  It is a good source of calcium, a wholesome food high in vitamin B, with some ascorbic acid and thiamine.  In green breadfruit, the carbohydrates are in the form of starch, turning to sugar as the fruit ripens.<P>There are recipes throughout the islands indicating many ways to prepare <STRONG>breadfruit</STRONG>.  It may be steamed, baked, boiled, marinated or stir-fried.  It is also made into an <STRONG>`ulu poi</STRONG>.  Although it is usually cooked before eating, I know people who were beginning to acquaint themselves with breadfruit, doing so by first eating it uncooked and raw, and seeming to enjoy it that way.<P>When cutting a green <STRONG>breadfruit</STRONG> to prepare it for cooking, a milk-like, extremely sticky sap is released.  It is a good idea to keep your hands, the knife and the breadfruit wet with running tap water, or at least to oil your utensil with vegetable oil.  One of the most basic cooking methods is to remove the stem and core, cut the <STRONG>breadfruit</STRONG> into large sections and to simmer it in lightly salted water in a big pot from 30 minutes to an hour to the consistency of a cooked potato.  Drain and cool it, remove the skin, and prepare to use it as you would a white or <A HREF="uala.html">sweet potato</A>.  Delicious alone with seasonings or combined with other vegetables into another dish or a salad.<P>The <STRONG>breadfruit</STRONG> tree has many uses other than for food.  All parts of the plant give off the milky sticky sap.  When the sap is used alone or when mixed with other plants, it can be applied to the skin to heal cuts, scratches and various skin diseases.  It is also used as a moisturizer for wind-cracked or scaly skin.  Mouth sores can be treated with the sap and the leaf buds.  The sap can also be used as a chewing gum, and more importantly was used in ancient days as a glue and caulking material, for such as canoe building.  In the old times, a bird-lime made from the sap was used to catch nectar-feeding birds for their brightly-colored feathers.  These were collected for their service as warm and colorful capes for the chiefly ones.  The fallen and sun-dried male flowers of the <STRONG>`ulu</STRONG> can be lit, and the smoke is a nontoxic mosquito repellent in these days of that notorious introduced species.<P>The wood of the tree's trunk is light in weight.  Hawai`i's craftsmen used it for making canoes, woodwork for homes, drums, surfboards and for papa kui`ai or poi boards.  A low grade tapa cloth was made from the inner bark of young branches.  The rough sheath, maloulu, was used as a dry abrasive in the final polishing of bowls and utensils.  It was also used to sand <A HREF="kukui.html">kukui/candlenut</A> before they were strung into lei.<P><STRONG>Breadfruit</STRONG> is propagated from shoots growing from the roots or from one inch diameter root cuttings, 9 to 10 inches long.  These can be placed in a shaded bed until a 2-3 foot top has grown.  The <STRONG>`ulu</STRONG> plant grows an extensive root system, so it is best to plant it where it will have plenty of room to stretch out and also up!  It does not transplant easily.  Trees begin to bear five to seven years after planting the root shoot.<P>Kahanu Gardens of the National Tropical Botanical Garden, located on the Hana coast of Maui, grows nearly 100 varieties of <STRONG>breadfruit</STRONG>.  Hawai`i mythology tells us that the <STRONG>`ulu</STRONG> fruit is the symbol of the creation, and of the generosity of a loving and abundantly providing creator.<P><STRONG>Breadfruit</STRONG> leaf designs are often used in Hawai`i's quilt patterns and are printed in various ways on modern-day fabrics, ceramics and upon other goods.  Maui Community College and the Hotel Hana-Maui use logos featuring <STRONG>`ulu</STRONG> leaves.<P>Traditionally, <STRONG>`ulu</STRONG> is planted to provide a life-time of food at the birth of a keiki `o ka `aina, a child of the land, kaulana na pua `o Hawai`i Nei, the glorious children of this Hawai`i.<P><IMG SRC="hrcolor2.gif"><BR><P><CENTER><TABLE BORDER="2" CELLPADDING="2"><TR><TD ALIGN="center">The 24 "Canoe Plants" of Ancient Hawai`i</TD><TR><TR><TD ALIGN="center"><FONT SIZE="-1"><A HREF="ape.html">`Ape</A> -<A HREF="awa.html">`Awa</A> -<A HREF="awapuhi.html">`Awapuhi</A> -<A HREF="hau.html">Hau</A> -<A HREF="ipu.html">Ipu</A> -<A HREF="kalo.html">Kalo</A> -<A HREF="kamani.html">Kamani</A> -<A HREF="ki.html">Ki</A> -<A HREF="ko.html">Ko</A> -<A HREF="kou.html">Kou</A> -<A HREF="kukui.html">Kukui</A> -<A HREF="maia.html">Mai`a</A><BR><A HREF="milo.html">Milo</A> -<A HREF="niu.html">Niu</A> -<A HREF="noni.html">Noni</A> -<A HREF="ohe.html">`Ohe</A> -<A HREF="ohia.html">`Ohi`a `Ai</A> -<A HREF="olena.html">`Olena</A> -<A HREF="olona.html">Olona</A> -<A HREF="pia.html">Pia</A> -<A HREF="uala.html">`Uala</A> -<A HREF="uhi.html">Uhi</A> -<A HREF="wauke.html">Wauke</A></FONT></TABLE></CENTER><A HREF="index.html"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="canostss.gif" BORDER="0"></A> Return to the <A HREF="index.html">Canoe Plants Home Page</A> or the <A HREF="index.html#contents">Table of Contents</A><P></HTML>

It is the principle plant used in the making of <STRONG>kapa</STRONG>, <STRONG>tapa cloth</STRONG>.  Kapa means the beaten thing. One of the principle plants introduced by early <A HREF="index.html#pvs">voyaging Polynesians</A> who settled here in Hawai`i, <STRONG>wauke</STRONG> is thought to have been carried in the canoes as root shoots, but can also be grown from cuttings and occasionally by seed.<P>The ancient practice of making bark cloth and bark paper likely began in Asia, where other species of Broussonetia are known, yet in Polynesia, Broussonetia papyrifera reigns supreme.  The quality of its cloth is prized and valuable, warm, water resistant, long lasting, washable, soft, mothproof, flexible and white.  In Polynesia, the loom and weaving of fibers did not occur, possibly because there were no mammals of size to provide hair; and cotton, flax, hemp and silk were not produced.<P><STRONG>Wauke</STRONG> grows best in moist areas, along streams, in forests, wherever soil is rich, and where there is protection from the wind.  Usually a small tree or shrub, <STRONG>wauke</STRONG> can grow as tall as 50 feet, but in cultivation, the plants were kept small.  Nurtured and carefully tended by both men and women, <STRONG>wauke</STRONG> was grown around the lo`i, <A HREF="kalo.html">taro</A> pond fields, and near home sites in thick stands of 8-9 foot tall trees.  Keiki grow from roots of established plants, so the <STRONG>wauke</STRONG> grove extends outwards naturally.<P>As the <STRONG>wauke</STRONG> tree grew, planters cut off the side branches, so a straight trunk stalk without branch holes could later be stripped.  In 6-10 months the trunk shoots were cut down and the roots and tops removed.  The trunks were stripped of bark, as thick as a finger and about 4 feet long.  The outer bark was slit and peeled off.  The inner bark fibers, called bast, were then soaked in running water, such as a high tide pool, with stones placed on top of the fiber pile.  This part of the process breaks down the woody fibers and washes away the starch.  A complicated process of soakings and fermentation followed, leaving the fine fibers of the moist inner bark still tough and resilient when finally removed from the waters.  At this time in the process, the women of Hawai`i would often twist cordage out of the fibers, for use as fish nets, upena, and as carrying nets, koko, from which to hang calabashes of wood and <A HREF="ipu.html">gourds</A>.<P>The women then spread the strips of inner bark to be used for cloth into several layers, all of the same thickness.  After the water was drained away, the fibers began to stick together and the entire bundle could be lifted as one mass.  This was called mo`omo`o.  It was  beaten on smooth rocks and sun dried.  Mo`omo`o was then often stored until enough material had accumulated to make a large piece of kapa cloth.  When enough mo`omo`o bundles were accumulated, these were soaked for half a day, then pounded gently to loosen the fibers.  They were then laid between layers of <A HREF="maia.html">mai`a, banana</A> leaves, for a week to mature and ferment, making the fibers softer, almost like the leavening process in bread making.  These cakes of <STRONG>wauke</STRONG> were then kneaded until elastic.  When ready, the women laid the bundle on a long piece of wood with a flat even surface, an anvil called kua kuku.  Then the women beat the pulp with a simple heavy mallet, a wooden beater called hohoa, until a solid strip formed.  The beating established a rhythm with resonating sounds.  After this, the strips were soaked again.  The cloth expanded greatly with each beating.  It was often doubled over and beaten again.<P>Most wooden beaters, i`e kuku, used in the final stage, were four-sided, carved and incised with stamps in intricate geometric designs and patterns.  The kapa maker left her "watermark" imprinted on the kapa she made.  These can be seen by holding the kapa up to the light. <P>At this point in the process, the cloth was hung in the sun to dry and to bleach whiter.  The quality of the kapa varied according to the bark quality and the skills of the maker.  Most i`e kuku were made from kolea wood.<P>After the kapa was completed, intricate designs were added to some of the cloth with dyes and a high quality of colored stamped patterns.  These were unique to Hawai`i and are considered a lost art form, although in the last 15 years a few people have resumed the making and stamping of kapa in the old way, renewing this lost art.<P>The beaters, anvils and stamps were made by the men of the village.  The dyes came from varied natural plant sources.  Pigmentation comes in many colors, predominantly black, from burying the cloth in the mud of a <A HREF="kalo.html">kalo</A> lo`i, brown from such as <A HREF="kukui.html">kukui</A> root bark and red from its bark, yellow and orange from the tuber of `<A HREF="olena.html">olena</A>, red from <A HREF="noni.html">noni's</A> bark and yellow from its root.  Geometric designs with inherent symbolism, such as lines, triangles, circles and chevrons were imprinted using stencils and stamps usually carved in <A HREF="ohe.html">`ohe, bamboo</A>.  <A HREF="ohe.html">`Ohe</A> was also used for brushes, as were dried hala drupes (fruit).  Sticky adhesives were used to waterproof kihei, capes.  Some kapa was scented, usually that which was to be stored.  Aromatic oils, seeds and flowers of such as maile, mokihana, `awahuhi, `iliahi/sandalwood, hinano and <A HREF="kamani.html">kamani</A> flowers were applied.<P>The clothing made was a knee length wrap-around skirt called pa`u (pareau, sarong, lava lava) for women; loin cloth, malo, for men; sandals, hula costumes and the kihei, cape.<P>Bed clothes were kapa moe, single sheets of kapa, placed together for warmth, a modern double-bed size.  Also, kapa ku`ina, several layers stitched along one side with <STRONG>wauke</STRONG> cordage, was used in colder climates.  The top layer was called kilohana, usually decorated and/or dyed.<P>There are two existing forms of paper mulberry.  <STRONG>Wauke</STRONG>, of superior quality, and po`a`aha, which produces very thin sheets of kapa.  The plants are similar, except for the leaves.  Those of <STRONG>wauke</STRONG> are thick and rough on top, woolly underneath and are lobed.  The leaves of po`a`aha are velvety soft and rounded.  The leaves of both plants are heart shaped with serrated edges, and are 4-6 inches long by 3-5 inches wide.  The flowers are rare and sparse, fuzzy, one inch round with hairy bracts and long stigmas.  Fruit are rare, and are orange and one inch round.<P>Other sources for kapa fibers are mamake, a species of pipturus, which produces a dark fiber.  Ma`aloa also produces brown fibers.  Other occasional sources are po`ulu and mamane.<P>Medicinally, the slimy sap of <STRONG>wauke</STRONG> is a mild laxative.  `Ea, thrush, a mouth disease, is said to be improved when the ash from burned kapa made from <STRONG>wauke</STRONG> is applied to the mouth.<P>Kapa figured in several Hawai`i legends, one of which is about the god Maui and his mother, the goddess Hina, and how he lassoed the sun from Haleakala to slow down the day, so it would be warm long enough to dry his mother's kapa cloth.<P>There were a great abundance of <STRONG>wauke</STRONG> plants grown in Hawai`i prior to the introduction of foreign fabrics, but now this once cherished plant is rarely to be found.<P><IMG SRC="hrcolor2.gif"><BR><P><CENTER><TABLE BORDER="2" CELLPADDING="2"><TR><TD ALIGN="center">The 24 "Canoe Plants" of Ancient Hawai`i</TD><TR><TR><TD ALIGN="center"><FONT SIZE="-1"><A HREF="ape.html">`Ape</A> -<A HREF="awa.html">`Awa</A> -<A HREF="awapuhi.html">`Awapuhi</A> -<A HREF="hau.html">Hau</A> -<A HREF="ipu.html">Ipu</A> -<A HREF="kalo.html">Kalo</A> -<A HREF="kamani.html">Kamani</A> -<A HREF="ki.html">Ki</A> -<A HREF="ko.html">Ko</A> -<A HREF="kou.html">Kou</A> -<A HREF="kukui.html">Kukui</A> -<A HREF="maia.html">Mai`a</A><BR><A HREF="milo.html">Milo</A> -<A HREF="niu.html">Niu</A> -<A HREF="noni.html">Noni</A> -<A HREF="ohe.html">`Ohe</A> -<A HREF="ohia.html">`Ohi`a `Ai</A> -<A HREF="olena.html">`Olena</A> -<A HREF="olona.html">Olona</A> -<A HREF="pia.html">Pia</A> -<A HREF="uala.html">`Uala</A> -<A HREF="uhi.html">Uhi</A> -<A HREF="ulu.html">`Ulu</A></FONT></TABLE></CENTER><A HREF="index.html"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="canostss.gif" BORDER="0"></A> Return to the <A HREF="index.html">Canoe Plants Home Page</A> or the <A HREF="index.html#contents">Table of Contents</A><P></HTML>

By Daniel B. Wood, Staff writer of the Christian Science Monitor
<P>
OUT of 47 acres of rain forest above this rural seaside village, a group of kanaka maoli - native Hawaiians - are creating what they call the "rebirth of a nation."
<P>
Gravel paths lead to and from canvas-covered decks and geodesic dome tents. Blue and yellow outhouses dot the perimeter of freshly planted taro patches. While chickens cluck and finches flit, chain saws and earth movers clear a view of white water reefs below.
<P>
"We want to return to the Hawaii of old which is to live simply, off our own land," says resident Gina Maikai. Within 18 to 24 months, she says, these sodless clearings will be a first-class neighborhood of homes, self-sufficient in food, power, and water.
<P>
The nascent community is run from a beach-front office compound about three miles away where a giant bear of a man appears in bare feet and shorts to greet visitors.
<P>
"Before, we were dissidents. Now, sovereignty in Hawaii has become a household word," says Puuhonua Kanahele, greeting visitors with a hug, handshake, and broad smile. The elected leader of one of Hawaii's most radical pro-sovereignty groups, the Ohana Council, Mr. Kanahele wields a business card with the same golden symbol that graces a large flag behind his desk. Below the symbol - a kahili feather designating royalty - the card reads: Head of State/Hawaii/Independent Nation State.
<P>
On January 16 of this year, the Ohana Council <A HREF="proclamsum.html">declared independence</A> from the United States for its 10,000 members and all native Hawaiians. The action came on the eve of the 100th anniversary of the US-backed overthrow of Queen Liliuokalani and the Kingdom of Hawaii. 
<P>
 "Today, we, the kanaka maoli [native Hawaiian descendants] proclaim our right of self-determination as a people in accordance with Article 1 of the United Nations Charter," said Ohana Council member Iaukea Bright, reading a <A HREF="proclamsum.html">proclamation</A> before a gathering of about 400 on the downtown grounds of the <A HREF="palace.html">Iolani Palace</A>, residence of the deposed queen. "We hereby reestablish our independent and sovereign nation of Hawaii that was illegally taken from the kanaka maoli on Jan. 17, 1893."
<P>
The Ohana Council is one of about six major factions here that have evolved from perhaps 300 splinter groups in recent years into what has become known as the Hawaiian sovereignty movement. Both the number of groups and their membership are growing on all seven inhabited Hawaiian islands.
<P>
On Nov. 23, 1993, President Clinton signed a <A HREF="publawsum.html">congressional resolution</A> "apologiz[ing] to Native Hawaiians on behalf of the people of the US for the [1893] overthrow." The resolution acknowledged the overthrow as "illegal" resulting "in the suppressions of the inherent sovereignty of the Native Hawaiian people." It urged both congressional and presidential commitment "to acknowledge the ramifications ... and to support reconciliation efforts between the US and Native Hawaiian people."
<P>
The US Navy added fuel to the pro-sovereignty fire this year when it returned to the state the small island of Kahoolawe, after an 18-year legal and political battle. The island, used as a bombing and target range for decades, is being held in trust as a possible site for a future sovereign nation - though detractors stress that a two-decade, $400 million cleanup is ahead before the island is inhabitable.
<P>
<STRONG>Support from officials</STRONG>
<P>
With a newly created Hawaiian Sovereignty Advisory Commission (HSAC) - formed by Gov. John Waihee (D) last year to advise the Legislature - and a scheduled 1995 statewide plebiscite on the issue, federal, state, and local officials have also spurred the debate.
<P>
"It is my sincere hope that the sovereignty of the Hawaiian people will be restored in my lifetime," says US Sen. Daniel Inouye (D) of Hawaii. "I stand ready and willing to act on ... legislation at the request of and on behalf of the American people."
<P>
"There are few today who doubt that sovereignty will happen," Governor Waihee adds. "It's a matter of how, when, and in what form."
<P>
Close observers say most vocal proponents of sovereignty fall into three categories:
<P>
<LI> Those demanding complete separation from the US and a return to independent, internationally recognized status;
<P>
<LI> Those desiring nation-within-a-nation status with federal recognition as a new, native-American nation;
<P>
<LI> Those wanting to maintain the political status quo while forging ahead for both reparations and full control of Hawaiian trust assets by Hawaiians.
<P>
Kanahele and the Ohana Council are taking their cue from <A HREF="boylebio.html">F.A. Boyle</A>, a professor of international law at the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana. Professor Boyle is a globally prominent authority who has advised Palestinian groups displaced by Israel on how to create a viable Palestinian state. He has also won two provisional measures from the World Court on behalf of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzogovina, denouncing genocide of all Bosnians: Croats, Muslims, Serbs, and Jews within the republic.
<P>
<A HREF="boylesum.html">Boyle addressed the HSAC</A> in December 1993, to discuss implications of the so-called <A HREF="publawsum.html">Hawaii Apology Bill</A>, the congressional resolution signed last year.
<P>
"Congress is effectively conceding now that the [1959 Hawaiian statehood] vote is meaningless, as a matter of international law and US domestic law," Boyle said. "So you're not bound by it. Rather, I'm suggesting you're now free to determine your own fate pursuant to the principle of self-determination."
<P>
Wielding a hammer on a tent deck in the Waimanalo hills, Steve Tayama says he is dedicated to taking the land back so that the state or federal government can never say later that Hawaiians had failed to take advantage of their right to self-determination.
<P>
"I saw that independence was the answer for us in 1974," says Mr. Tayama. "The government is illegally in control of these islands and we're taking them back."
<P>
He shows inquirers his INSOH (Independent Nation State of Hawaii) driver's license and insurance card, one of 7,000 already issued to Ohana followers. "If you are trying to form a nation, you've got to act like one," he says.
<P>
Soon Tamaya expects to be growing his own food, and the commune is investigating plans for generating electricity with solar and bio-gas technologies. The group uses volunteer mechanics and carpenters as well as half-time workers to help with plumbing and farming. Trucks, bulldozers, and equipment have been donated by sympathetic companies, and the group has received grants by various foundations.
<P>
"The main thing for now is to get a roof over our heads, have meeting places, and a place to eat to continue the fight," Tayama says. The resident group of 150 includes families with children. Strategy and organizational meetings are held in a large tent that doubles as a mess hall, and administration is performed by a staff of about seven at the beach house.
<P>
The state is leasing land to Ohana Council in a 55-year agreement. The idea was part of a settlement to get rid of a 200-resident tent city that had occupied the nearby beaches of Makapuu for over a year in defiance of state law. Members had also erected an ancient Hawaiian heiau, a shrine surrounded by stone walls. The episode gained national attention when members of the Ohana Council passed out leaflets here and at beaches of Waikiki encouraging non-Hawaiian tourists to leave.
<P>
Because of such high-profile activism, Ohana has been called the most radical of Hawaii's sovereignty groups.
<P>
"Ohana is the most active group of all in pushing for independence," says Boyle. One of Boyle's colleagues, Patrick Sickels - also a veteran in the Palestinian and Bosnian cases - has become Ohana's resident legal counsel, dealing with state, county, and federal officials. He has also helped draft a constitution for an independent nation-state that was ratified during an Oct. 7 to 10 convention of delegates from all over Hawaii.
<P>
<STRONG>A moderate approach</STRONG>
<P>
The group has been taken to task by other key activists for divisive tactics.
<P>
"Our immediate concern is that [Kanahele's] <A HREF="proclamsum.html">proclamation</A> ... may cause more dissension in our movement," says Kekuni Blaisdell, head of another faction known as Ka Pakaukau. Because Ohana's "tourists-go-home" tactics were played up in the media, Mr. Blaisdell worried that the whole movement might be discredited.
<P>
Saying his group seeks reason, justice, peace, and nonviolence, Blaisdell convened a mock international tribunal in August 1993 to hear charges by kanaka maoli against the state. He has circulated a videotape of the proceedings, heard before nine distinguished human rights authorities. The tribunal findings have also been reviewed sympathetically by international human rights officials.

With 20,000 citizens and a written constitution, another pro-sovereignty group known as Ka Lahui, "the nation," is advocating nation-within-a-nation status for Hawaii. Governor Mililani Trask is an articulate advocate who has been criticized for refusing to be represented on Hawaiian Sovereignty Advisory Commission.
<P>
A fourth group, boasting 30,000 members, is the State Council of Hawaiian Homestead Associations, which was formed to address the concerns of homesteaders who have been seeking fruitlessly to claim lands made available to Hawaiians before statehood.
<P>
But according to observers, the majority of the 260,000 native Hawaiians are silent on the issue of sovereignty. "They are the most important faction of all," says Robert Rees, a columnist for Pacific Business News who puts the number of undecided voters for next year's plebiscite at 200,000.
<P>
"I haven't figured out what I want, who's going to rule and how," says cabbie Lois Fogelstrom. She says the issue of who constitutes true kanaka maoli has divided islanders. Many pure-blooded native Hawaiians bristle at legal definitions requiring at least 50 percent pure Hawaiian blood.
<P>
"People have assimilated so much with Caucasians, Filipinos, Hispanics, Asians ... it's going to be very complicated for people to try to prove their blood line," she says. By one measure, there will be no 50-percent-or-higher pure Hawaiians left by the year 2044.
<P>
Many native Hawaiians, by whatever definition, say they support many or all of the sovereignty groups but are afraid to become formally affiliated or attend regular meetings.
<P>
Shirley Martin, a Waimanalo resident who works as an aid for the handicapped, is looking for custodial work with the state. She shows support for sovereignty activists by flying the Hawaiian flag upside down in the backyard of her Waimanalo home.
<P>
 "I support [Kanahele] and the others," she says, "but I'm not into getting active. The state will check you out and won't hire you." For kanaka maoli, she says, the issue comes down to decades of federal and state abuse over land.
<P>
In 1921, Congress established a "<A HREF="http://hinc.hinc.hawaii.gov/dhhl/dhhl.html">Hawaiian Homes</A>" program, a land trust of approximately 200,000 acres for homesteading by persons of 50 percent or more Hawaiian blood. Because of the political power of sugar interests, trust land consisted of the least-usable agricultural properties on the islands. Stories of administrative neglect of the program over decades by state and federal officials have been legion with thousands of Hawaiians waiting up to seven decades for land, to no avail.
<P>
"Is it any surprise that Hawaiians want more than apologies and social services?" asks H.K. Bruss Keppeler, an Oahu attorney. "Many [Hawaiians] want more than just money and land; they want political autonomy."
<P>
According to <A HREF="boylebio.html">Boyle</A>, several factions on the island are so angry they are contemplating violence. But those leading Kanahele's Ohana Council say open peaceful negotiation is the only way.
<P>
<STRONG>A long road to sovereignty</STRONG>
<P>
Following in the footsteps of Palestinians, whose state has been recognized by more nations than have recognized Israel, Kanahele's current goal is to get recognition by as many nations as possible as a prerequisite to admittance to the UN. He hopes to address the UN General Assembly in December and meet with with representatives from South American and third-world countries.
<P>
According to Senator Inouye, much needs to be discussed before the nation-state could be recognized. "The realities of this day would suggest that if a sovereign nation ... were to be restored, that would have to be with the support of the people of Hawaii and through them, the governments of Hawaii, namely the state and counties ... the Congress of the US and the president."
<P>
He adds: "Can the restored nation establish a military? What about police powers? Can this nation develop a nuclear reactor? Would the sovereign entity have jurisdiction over all crimes.... Would all our federal environmental laws apply?"
<P>
For Inouye and other top officials, the ball is in the court of the several factions of kanaka maoli to agree on a model and bring it formally to an established decision making process.
<P>
Mahealani Kamauu, executive director of the Native Hawaiian Legal Corporation, which has handled legal cases for indigenous Hawaiians for 20 years, does not envision a drastic US exit or continued land grabs by various factions of native Hawaiians. She says Ohana Council, Ka Pakaukau, and Ka Lahui are in the vanguard of a movement that is helping to raise the consciousness of all native Hawaiians by their bold moves. But she feels they all need to embrace undecideds more fully. By 1998, the centennial of annexation, she predicts, "something significant" will be ratified from the context of a constitutional convention and in the form of some document of organic, self-governance.
<P>
"The most conceivable and practical solution will be some sort of land base comprising non-contiguous lands located throughout the island chain, including certain claims to water, mineral and other natural resources," she says. "After 1998 however, agitation toward complete independence will continue and not abate. We are a free people and can't let go of that vision. Our challenge is to make others - both Hawaiian and foreign - see that that vision makes sense."

<P>
OUT of 47 acres of rain forest above this rural seaside village, a group of kanaka maoli - native Hawaiians - are creating what they call the "rebirth of a nation."
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=Right SRC="csmplate.gif" VSPACE=2 HSPACE=5><HR>SAY IT WITH A LICENSE PLATE: <EM>Some Hawaiians use their cars to display their political leanings.  the Ohana Council has issued 'Independent Nation State of Hawaii' driver's licenses.</EM>
<HR>
<P>
Gravel paths lead to and from canvas-covered decks and geodesic dome tents. Blue and yellow outhouses dot the perimeter of freshly planted taro patches. While chickens cluck and finches flit, chain saws and earth movers clear a view of white water reefs below.
<P>
"We want to return to the Hawaii of old which is to live simply, off our own land," says resident Gina Maikai. Within 18 to 24 months, she says, these sodless clearings will be a first-class neighborhood of homes, self-sufficient in food, power, and water.
<P>
The nascent community is run from a beach-front office compound about three miles away where a giant bear of a man appears in bare feet and shorts to greet visitors.
<P>
"Before, we were dissidents. Now, sovereignty in Hawaii has become a household word," says Puuhonua Kanahele, greeting visitors with a hug, handshake, and broad smile. The elected leader of one of Hawaii's most radical pro-sovereignty groups, the Ohana Council, Mr. Kanahele wields a business card with the same golden symbol that graces a large flag behind his desk. Below the symbol - a kahili feather designating royalty - the card reads: Head of State/Hawaii/Independent Nation State.
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="csmpuu.gif" VSPACE=2 HSPACE=7><HR> <STRONG>'Before, we were dissidents.  Now, sovereignty in Hawaii has become a household word.'</STRONG><BR>
<UL><EM>- Puuhonua Kanahele, leader of the Ohana Council</I></UL><HR>
<P>
On January 16 of this year, the Ohana Council <A HREF="proclamsum.html">declared independence</A> from the United States for its 10,000 members and all native Hawaiians. The action came on the eve of the 100th anniversary of the US-backed overthrow of Queen Liliuokalani and the Kingdom of Hawaii. 
<P>
 "Today, we, the kanaka maoli [native Hawaiian descendants] proclaim our right of self-determination as a people in accordance with Article 1 of the United Nations Charter," said Ohana Council member Iaukea Bright, reading a <A HREF="proclamsum.html">proclamation</A> before a gathering of about 400 on the downtown grounds of the <A HREF="palace.html">Iolani Palace</A>, residence of the deposed queen. "We hereby reestablish our independent and sovereign nation of Hawaii that was illegally taken from the kanaka maoli on Jan. 17, 1893."
<P>
The Ohana Council is one of about six major factions here that have evolved from perhaps 300 splinter groups in recent years into what has become known as the Hawaiian sovereignty movement. Both the number of groups and their membership are growing on all seven inhabited Hawaiian islands.
<P>
On Nov. 23, 1993, President Clinton signed a <A HREF="publawsum.html">congressional resolution</A> "apologiz[ing] to Native Hawaiians on behalf of the people of the US for the [1893] overthrow." The resolution acknowledged the overthrow as "illegal" resulting "in the suppressions of the inherent sovereignty of the Native Hawaiian people." It urged both congressional and presidential commitment "to acknowledge the ramifications ... and to support reconciliation efforts between the US and Native Hawaiian people."
<P>
The US Navy added fuel to the pro-sovereignty fire this year when it returned to the state the small island of Kahoolawe, after an 18-year legal and political battle. The island, used as a bombing and target range for decades, is being held in trust as a possible site for a future sovereign nation - though detractors stress that a two-decade, $400 million cleanup is ahead before the island is inhabitable.
<P>
<STRONG>Support from officials</STRONG>
<P>
With a newly created Hawaiian Sovereignty Advisory Commission (HSAC) - formed by Gov. John Waihee (D) last year to advise the Legislature - and a scheduled 1995 statewide plebiscite on the issue, federal, state, and local officials have also spurred the debate.
<P>
"It is my sincere hope that the sovereignty of the Hawaiian people will be restored in my lifetime," says US Sen. Daniel Inouye (D) of Hawaii. "I stand ready and willing to act on ... legislation at the request of and on behalf of the American people."
<P>
"There are few today who doubt that sovereignty will happen," Governor Waihee adds. "It's a matter of how, when, and in what form."
<P>
Close observers say most vocal proponents of sovereignty fall into three categories:
<P>
<LI> Those demanding complete separation from the US and a return to independent, internationally recognized status;
<P>
<LI> Those desiring nation-within-a-nation status with federal recognition as a new, native-American nation;
<P>
<LI> Those wanting to maintain the political status quo while forging ahead for both reparations and full control of Hawaiian trust assets by Hawaiians.
<P>
Kanahele and the Ohana Council are taking their cue from <A HREF="boylebio.html">F.A. Boyle</A>, a professor of international law at the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana. Professor Boyle is a globally prominent authority who has advised Palestinian groups displaced by Israel on how to create a viable Palestinian state. He has also won two provisional measures from the World Court on behalf of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzogovina, denouncing genocide of all Bosnians: Croats, Muslims, Serbs, and Jews within the republic.
<P>
<A HREF="boylesum.html">Boyle addressed the HSAC</A> in December 1993, to discuss implications of the so-called <A HREF="publawsum.html">Hawaii Apology Bill</A>, the congressional resolution signed last year.
<P>
"Congress is effectively conceding now that the [1959 Hawaiian statehood] vote is meaningless, as a matter of international law and US domestic law," Boyle said. "So you're not bound by it. Rather, I'm suggesting you're now free to determine your own fate pursuant to the principle of self-determination."
<P>
Wielding a hammer on a tent deck in the Waimanalo hills, Steve Tayama says he is dedicated to taking the land back so that the state or federal government can never say later that Hawaiians had failed to take advantage of their right to self-determination.
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=Right SRC="csmsteve.gif" VSPACE=2 HSPACE=7><HR> TAKING BACK THE LAND: <EM>Steve Tayama and others are helping to create what they call 'the rebirth of a nation.'  He and other members of the pro-sovereignty Ohana Council are building a commune in Waimanalo, where they will 'return to the Hawaii of old, which is to live simply, off our own land,' according to one resident.</EM><HR>
"I saw that independence was the answer for us in 1974," says Mr. Tayama. "The government is illegally in control of these islands and we're taking them back."
<P>
He shows inquirers his INSOH (Independent Nation State of Hawaii) driver's license and insurance card, one of 7,000 already issued to Ohana followers. "If you are trying to form a nation, you've got to act like one," he says.
<P>
Soon Tamaya expects to be growing his own food, and the commune is investigating plans for generating electricity with solar and bio-gas technologies. The group uses volunteer mechanics and carpenters as well as half-time workers to help with plumbing and farming. Trucks, bulldozers, and equipment have been donated by sympathetic companies, and the group has received grants by various foundations.
<P>
"The main thing for now is to get a roof over our heads, have meeting places, and a place to eat to continue the fight," Tayama says. The resident group of 150 includes families with children. Strategy and organizational meetings are held in a large tent that doubles as a mess hall, and administration is performed by a staff of about seven at the beach house.
<P>
The state is leasing land to Ohana Council in a 55-year agreement. The idea was part of a settlement to get rid of a 200-resident tent city that had occupied the nearby beaches of Makapuu for over a year in defiance of state law. Members had also erected an ancient Hawaiian heiau, a shrine surrounded by stone walls. The episode gained national attention when members of the Ohana Council passed out leaflets here and at beaches of Waikiki encouraging non-Hawaiian tourists to leave.
<P>
Because of such high-profile activism, Ohana has been called the most radical of Hawaii's sovereignty groups.
<P>
"Ohana is the most active group of all in pushing for independence," says Boyle. One of Boyle's colleagues, Patrick Sickels - also a veteran in the Palestinian and Bosnian cases - has become Ohana's resident legal counsel, dealing with state, county, and federal officials. He has also helped draft a constitution for an independent nation-state that was ratified during an Oct. 7 to 10 convention of delegates from all over Hawaii.
<P>
<STRONG>A moderate approach</STRONG>
<P>
The group has been taken to task by other key activists for divisive tactics.
<P>
"Our immediate concern is that [Kanahele's] <A HREF="proclamsum.html">proclamation</A> ... may cause more dissension in our movement," says Kekuni Blaisdell, head of another faction known as Ka Pakaukau. Because Ohana's "tourists-go-home" tactics were played up in the media, Mr. Blaisdell worried that the whole movement might be discredited.
<P>
Saying his group seeks reason, justice, peace, and nonviolence, Blaisdell convened a mock international tribunal in August 1993 to hear charges by kanaka maoli against the state. He has circulated a videotape of the proceedings, heard before nine distinguished human rights authorities. The tribunal findings have also been reviewed sympathetically by international human rights officials.
<P>
With 20,000 citizens and a written constitution, another pro-sovereignty group known as Ka Lahui, "the nation," is advocating nation-within-a-nation status for Hawaii. Governor Mililani Trask is an articulate advocate who has been criticized for refusing to be represented on Hawaiian Sovereignty Advisory Commission.
<P>
A fourth group, boasting 30,000 members, is the State Council of Hawaiian Homestead Associations, which was formed to address the concerns of homesteaders who have been seeking fruitlessly to claim lands made available to Hawaiians before statehood.
<P>
But according to observers, the majority of the 260,000 native Hawaiians are silent on the issue of sovereignty. "They are the most important faction of all," says Robert Rees, a columnist for Pacific Business News who puts the number of undecided voters for next year's plebiscite at 200,000.

Aluli also said he was grateful for Gillmor's ruling, but hoped she would modify it further.<P>The federal government charged Kanahele in 1994 with harboring and impeding efforts to arrest federal fugitive Nathan Brown, who has evaded a 78-month sentence for tax fraud.<P>Authorities arrested Kanahele on Aug. 2 and denied bail. They cited previous convictions, threats to law enforcement officers, and judges and a disregard for federal jurisdiction.<P>U.S. District Judge David Ezra on Nov. 13 ruled to release Kanahele to Miller Hale to balance law enforcement concerns with Kanahele's constitutional rights.<P>His ruling came after Gillmor declared a mistrial in Kanahele's case, saying jurors were at an impasse and jury tampering may have occurred.<P>Although Gillmor set a second trial for April 23, Aluli has appealed to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, saying a second trial would amount to double jeopardy.<P>In modifying Kanahele's bond conditions, Gillmor acknowledged a change in Kanahele's attitude regarding the law, from following rules at the halfway house to obtaining state license plates for family vehicles.<P>Kanahele previously had plates advocating &quot;sovereignty.&quot;<P>Aluli said Kanahele, who was convicted of driving without a license and plates, made a point and has moved on, adding: &quot;He's more akamai in going through the legal maze.&quot;<P>Kanahele, who said he was not a criminal, said the time in custody gave him an opportunity to focus on his approaches.<P>&quot;I've done all my apologies,&quot; he said. &quot;But a lot of things could have been done more professionally.&quot;<P>He also said he didn't object to staying away from the &quot;Nation of Hawaii,&quot; which he has done while staying at the halfway house. But he did object to the government referring to it as a &quot;compound.&quot;<P>&quot;It's a village,&quot; he said. &quot;It's not a compound or a Waco. That's a misconception brought by the government.&quot;<P>The government opposed Kanahele's request to be released to his Waimanalo home, saying he continued to be a danger and flight risk.<P><HR><P>See related article: <B><A HREF="allowed.html">Kanahele allowed to go home</A></B><BR>Hawaiian activist restricted while he's back in Waimanalo<BR>Honolulu Advertiser, Saturday, February 10, 1996<P><IMG SRC="hrcolor2.gif"><BR><A HREF="index.html"><IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="flagsm.gif" BORDER="0" HSPACE=4 VSPACE=4></A> Return to the <A HREF="index.html">Nation of Hawai`i Home Page</A>, the <A HREF="political_prisoner.html">Political Prosecution Page</A>, or the <A HREF="news.html">News Articles Index</A></BODY></HTML>

<HR>
Hawai`i entered the decade of the 1890s as a kingdom and emerged from it as a Territory of the United States, with a provisional government and a republic in between. It was a time of monarchs and "mission boys," of royalists, republicans and revolutionaries. 
<P>
The storm that had been gathering broke on Jan. 17, 1893, when the Hawaiian monarchy ended in a day of bloodless revolution. Armed insurrection by a relatively small group of men, most of them American by birth or heritage, succeeded in wresting control of the Islands with the backing of American troops sent ashore from a warship in Honolulu Harbor. To this "superior force of the United States of America," Queen Lili`uokalani yielded her throne, under protest, in order to avoid bloodshed, trusting that the United States government would right the wrong that had been done to her and the Hawaiian people. 
<P>
Sugar and a coerced constitution played roles in the drama -- intertwined themes of economics and politics. 
<P>
Sugar was by far the principal support of the Islands, and profits and prosperity hinged on favorable treaties with the United States, Hawaiian sugar's chief market, creating powerful economic ties. As the Islands' sugar industry grew, large numbers of contract laborers were imported first from China, then from Japan and other countries, to work on the plantations -- the beginning of Hawai`i's present multicultural population. Plantation ownership and control of the business community were in the hands of men of American or European blood.

<HR>
In 1887, during the reign of Lili`uokalani' s brother, King Kalakaua, a group of planters and businessmen, seeking to control the kingdom politically as well as economically, formed a secret organization, the Hawaiian League. Membership (probably never over 400, compared to the 40,000 Native Hawaiians in the kingdom) was predominantly American, including several missionary descendants. Organizer and fire brand of the league was Lorrin A. Thurston, a lawyer and missionary grandson, who would later be a leader in the overthrow of the monarchy, with many of the same men.

<HR>
Their goal, for now, was to "reform" the monarchy. But reform, like beauty, was in the eye of the beholder. The Native Hawaiians looked up to their sovereigns with respect and aloha. Kalakaua and Lili`uokalani were well-educated, intelligent, skilled in social graces, and equally at home with Hawaiian traditions and court ceremony. Above all, they were deeply concerned about the well-being of the Hawaiian people and maintaining the independence of the kingdom.
<P>
The league's more radical members favored the king's abdication -- one even proposed assassination -- but cooler heads prevailed. They would allow the king to remain on the throne with his power sharply limited by a <A HREF="constitution-1887.html">new constitution</A> of their making. Dethroning him would be a last resort, if he refused to comply. Many Hawaiian League members belonged to a volunter militia, the Honolulu Rifles, which was officially in service to the Hawaiian government, but was secretly the league's military arm.
<P>
Kalakaua was compelled to accept a new Cabinet composed of league members, who presented their constitution to him for his signature at <A HREF="palace.html">`Iolani Palace</A>. The reluctant king argued and protested, but finally signed the document, which became known as the <A HREF="constitution-1887.html">Bayonet Constitution</A>. As one Cabinet member noted, "Little was left to the imagination of the hesitating and unwilling sovereign, as to what he might expect in the event of his refusal to comply with the demands made upon him."
<P>
The Bayonet Constitution greatly curtailed the king's power, making him a mere figurehead. It placed the actual executive power in the hands of the Cabinet, whose members could no longer be dismissed by the king, only by the Legislature. Amending this constitution was also the exclusive prerogative of the Legislature.
<P>
The Bayonet Constitution's other purpose was to remove the Native Hawaiian majority's dominance at the polls and in the Legislature. The righteous reformers were determined to save the Hawaiians from self-government. 
<P>
The privilege of voting was no longer limited to citizens of the kingdom, but was extended to foreign residents -- provided they were American or European. Asians were excluded -- even those who had become naturalized citizens. The House of Nobles, formerly appointed by the king, would now be elected, and voters and candidates for it had to meet a high property ownership or income requirement -- which excluded two-thirds of the Native Hawaiian voters. While they could still vote for the House of Representatives, to do so they had to swear to uphold the despised Bayonet Constitution. 
<P>
The Hawaiians strenuously opposed the diminution of their voice in governing their own country and resented the reduction of the monarch's powers and the manner in which the Bayonet Constitution had been forced on him. Hawaiians, Chinese and Japanese petitioned the king to revoke the constitution. The self-styled Reform Cabinet responded that only an act of the Legislature could do this - though their new constitution had never been put to a vote. 
<P>
For the remaining years of the monarchy, efforts to amend or replace the constitution received widespread support. The constitutional controversy proved to be the spark that ignited the overthrow of the monarchy.

<P>
In 1889 a young part-Hawaiian named Robert W. Wilcox staged an uprising to overthrow the Bayonet Constitution. He led some 80 men, Hawaiians and Europeans, with arms purchased by the Chinese, in a predawn march to `Iolani Palace with a new constitution for Kalakaua to sign. The king was away from the palace, and the Cabinet called out troops who forcibly put down the insurrection. Tried for conspiracy, Wilcox was found not guilty by a jury of Native Hawaiians, who considered him a folk hero.

<HR>
A new constitution would have to be another monarch's responsibility. On Jan. 20, 1891, King Kalakaua died of kidney disease at age 54. He lay in state in the throne room of `Iolani Palace, which during his reign had been the scene of many gala receptions and grand balls.

<HR>
<P>
Like her brother, the new queen was childless. She named as her successor to the throne her niece, Princess Ka`iulani, who was away at school in London.  
<P>
Lili`uokalani's husband, John Dominis, an American sea captain's son, died just seven months after she became queen. 
<P>
She would soon face a formidable threat to the monarchy and the independence of the kingdom. In early 1892 Lorrin Thurston and a group of like-minded men, mostly of American blood, formed an Annexation Club, plotting the overthrow of the queen and annexation to the United States. They kept the organization small and secret - wisely, since they were talking treason. 
<P>
Thurston went to Washington to promote annexation, and received an encouraging message from President Benjamin Harrison: "You will find an exceedingly sympathetic administration here." 
<P>
In Honolulu, Hawaiians spoke out strongly for their monarchy and presented numerous petitions to the Legislature to replace the Bayonet Constitution, to no avail. 
<P>
The queen had also been deluged with petitions for a new constitution, signed by an estimated two-thirds of the kingdom's voters, and she boldly prepared to act on their wishes. In her book, <EM>Hawai`i's Story by Hawai`i's Queen </EM>, she noted, "The right to grant a constitution to the nation has been, since the very first one was granted, a prerogative of the Hawaiian sovereigns." 
<P>
On Jan. 14, the first of four crucial days in Hawai`i's history, the queen presided at noon over the legislative session's closing ceremonies at the Government Building. She then walked across the street to <A HREF="palace.html">`Iolani Palace</A> for a more significant ceremony. She was about to proclaim a <A HREF="constitution-1893.html">new constitution</A> which she had written, restoring power to the throne and rights to the Native Hawaiian people. 
<P>
The Royal Hawaiian Band played as the queen's invited guests, including diplomats, legislators and Hawaiian petitioners, assembled in the throne room, and a large crowd of Native Hawaiians gathered on the palace lawn. 
<P>
As the audience waited, the queen argued heatedly with her Cabinet, who refused to sign her new constitution, fearing her enemies would use it as a pretext to challenge her. They finally persuaded her to defer action on it. 
<P>
The queen addressed the guests in the throne room, and the crowd on the palace grounds, telling them that she was ready to promulgate a new constitution, but yielding to the advice of her ministers, was postponing it to some future day. 
<P>
Alerted earlier of the queen's intention by two of her Cabinet members, the Annexation Club sprang into action. A 13-member Committee of Safety was chosen to plan the overthrow of the queen and the establishment of a provisional government. As they plotted revolution, they claimed that the queen, by proposing to alter the constitution, had committed ''a revolutionary act." 
<P>
The American warship USS Boston was in port at Honolulu Harbor. With an eye toward landing troops, Lorrin Thurston and two others called upon the American minister in Hawai`i, John L. Stevens, an avowed annexationist. Stevens assured them he would not protect the queen, and that he would land troops from the Boston if necessary "to protect American lives and property." He also said that if the revolutionaries were in possession of government buildings and actually in control of the city, he would recognize their provisional government. 
<P>
The next day, Jan. 15, Thurston told the queen's Cabinet that the Committee of Safety would challenge her. 
<P>
In an effort to stave off the mounting crisis, the queen issued a proclamation declaring that she would not seek to alter the constitution except by constitutional means. Unsuccessfully, she sought Minister Stevens' assurance that he would support her government against armed insurrection. The kingdom's marshal proposed declaring martial law and arresting the Committee of Safety, but the Cabinet feared this would lead to armed conflict, and Lili`uokalani wished to avoid bloodshed. 
<P>
On Jan. 16, several hundred Native Hawaiians and other royalists gathered peaceably at Palace Square in support of the queen, expressing loyalty to the monarchy, and carefully avoiding saying anything inflammatory. 
<P>
Simultaneously, at the mass meeting called by the Committee of Safety at the armory, the speeches were incendiary. Lorrin Thurston vehemently denounced the queen and asked the crowd to empower the committee to act as it deemed necessary. The resolution passed amid cheers. No one had mentioned overthrowing the monarchy, but the unspoken was apparently understood by all. 
<P>
The Committee of Safety delivered a letter to Minister Stevens requesting him to land troops from the Boston, stating that "the public safety is menaced and life and property are in peril." 
<P>
At 5 that afternoon, 162 fully armed troops from the Boston came ashore. A few of the marines were posted at the American Consulate and Legation, but the main body of troops marched through downtown Honolulu past `Iolani Palace. They were quartered less than a block from the Government Building and the palace. While the troops were ordered ashore ostensibly "to protect American lives and property," their placement close to the palace was threatening. Members of the queen's Cabinet hastened to Stevens to protest the troops' presence, but it made no difference. 
<P>
The Committee of Safety had initially proposed that Thurston head the government, but he said he was considered such a ,"radical mover" it would be better to choose someone more conservative. They then offered the presidency to Sanford B. Dole, another of the "mission boys," as Thurston called them. Dole had declined to take part in the revolution except for drafting documents. Rather than abolishing the monarchy, he favored replacing the queen with a regency holding the throne in trust until Princess Ka'iulani came of age. Still, he accepted the presidency and submitted his resignation as a justice in Hawai`i's Supreme Court.

<HR>
<P>
On the morning of Jan. 17, Dole gave Stevens a letter from Thurston, asking for his recognition of the provisional government, which they planned to proclaim at 3 that afternoon. The American minister told Dole, "I think you have a great opportunity." 
<P>
They also had luck. Just as Dole and the Committee of Safety were about to set out to take possession of the Government Building, Hawaiian police halted a wagon loaded with arms for the insurgents, and the driver shot a policeman in the shoulder. (This was the only blood shed during the revolution.) The sound of the shot drew a crowd, including the policemen who had been keeping an eye on the Committee of Safety, and in the confusion, they walked to the Government Building unnoticed. 
<P>
The building was unguarded and nearly deserted, and few people heard the proclamation that was read from its steps, declaring the end of the monarchy and the establishment of a provisional government as an interim measure until annexation to the United States could be achieved. The American troops were lined up nearby. Minister Stevens immediately, and prematurely, recognized the provisional government. 
<P>
On Jan. 17, 1893, at dusk, Queen Lili`uokalani yielded her throne under protest, with these words: 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"I, Lili`uokalani, by the grace of God and under the constitution of the Hawaiian Kingdom, Queen, do hereby solemnly protest against any and all acts done against myself and the constitutional government of the Hawaiian  Kingdom by certain persons claiming to have established a Provisional Government of and for this Kingdom. 
<P>
"That I yield to the superior force of the United States of America, whose Minister Plenipotentiary, His Excellency John L. Stevens, has caused United States troops to be landed at Honolulu and declared that he would support the said Provisional Government. 
<P>
"Now,  to avoid any collision of armed forces and perhaps loss of life, I do, under this protest, and impelled by said forces, yield my authority until such time as the Government of the United States shall, upon the facts being presented to it, undo the action of its representative and reinstate me in the authority which I claim as the constitutional sovereign of the Hawaiian Islands." 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The queen surrendered Hawai`i's <A HREF="sovereignty.html">sovereignty</A> not to the revolutionaries but to the "superior force of the United States of America" -- temporarily, she believed -- confident that the American government would restore her to the throne.

<HR>
<P>
After the queen yielded, the marshal surrendered the police station house, and at the barracks, the Queen's Royal Guards stacked their arms. 
<P>
Having stated her case in writing, Lili`uokalani retired to her private residence, Washington Place, urging the leaders of her people to avoid riot and to await tranquilly the result of her appeal to the United States government. 
<P>
The provisional government took over the palace and declared martial law. Later, at its request, Minister Stevens proclaimed Hawai`i a temporary protectorate and raised the American flag over government buildings. He wrote the State Department urging annexation, saying, "The Hawaiian pear is now fully ripe, and this is the golden hour for the United States to pluck it." 
<P>
The provisional government had chartered a steamer, and Thurston and four others hastened to Washington with a treaty of annexation in hand. The queen's envoys were refused permission to sail on the same ship, and by the time they reached Washington, President Harrison had already sent the annexation treaty to the Senate. 
<P>
But Harrison was in his last days in power, and Grover Cleveland, who replaced him, withdrew the treaty. 
<P>
Lili`uokalani wrote to Cleveland requesting redress, and young Princess Ka`iulani went to Washington to appeal for the monarchy and the Hawaiian nation, impressing the president and all who met her with her beauty and dignity. 
<P>
President Cleveland sent to Honolulu special commissioner James H. Blount, former chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs. Blount's job was to investigate the circumstances of the revolution, the role Minister Stevens and American troops played in it, and to determine the feelings of the people of Hawai`i toward the provisional government. 
<P>
Blount's instructions were secret, but it was known that his word would be "paramount," concerning the United States in the Islands, so he was given the nickname "Paramount Blount." 
<P>
He ordered the troops back to their ship and the American flag taken down and replaced by the Hawaiian flag. 
<P>
Accessible to all who wished to talk to him, he cordially and impartially heard a steady stream of people from both sides. Over four months, he assembled a vast amount of information from interviews, letters and documents. 
<P>
Blount's final report charged that Stevens conspired in the overthrow of the monarchy, which would not have taken place without the landing of U.S. troops. Blount recommended restoring the queen, saying...The undoubted sentiment of the people is for the queen, against the provisional government and against annexation." He noted, "There is not an annexationist in the Islands, so far as I have been able to observe, who would be willing to submit the question of annexation to a popular vote." 
<P>
Based on Blount's findings, President Cleveland decided that, in the name of justice, he would do everything in his power to reinstate the queen, provided she would grant amnesty to those who had overthrown her government. The idealistic Cleveland, in assuming the provisional government would willingly relinquish power to her at his request, misjudged the character and tenacity of her adversaries. 
<P>
The new American minister in Hawai`i, Albert Willis, expressed to the queen the president's regret that the unauthorized intervention of the United States had caused her to surrender her <A HREF="sovereignty.html">sovereignty</A>, and his hope that the wrong done to her and her people might be redressed. Willis told her the president's condition for reinstating her on the throne was that she grant full amnesty. 
<P>
Lili`uokalani replied that according to Hawaiian law, the punishment for treason was death, but that she would be satisfied with banishing them from the kingdom forever. Later, she agreed to accede to the president's wishes. 
<P>
Willis next went to Sanford Dole and the provisional government, assuring them of the queen's amnesty. Speaking for President Cleveland, Willis acknowledged the wrong committed by the United States in the revolution and requested them to resign power and restore the queen. 
<P>
The answer, of course, was no. They repudiated the right of the American president to interfere in their domestic affairs and said that if the American forces illegally assisted the revolution, the provisional government was not responsible.  
<P>
On Dec. 18, 1893, <A HREF="cleveland.html">President Cleveland made an eloquent speech to Congress</A> on the Hawaiian situation. 
<P>
He had harsh words for the landing of American troops at the revolutionaries' request: <BLOCKQUOTE>"This military demonstration upon the soil of Honolulu was of itself an act of war; unless made either with the consent of the government of Hawai`i or for the bona fide purpose of protecting the imperiled lives and property of citizens of the United States. But there is no pretense of any such consent on the part of the government of the queen ... the existing government, instead of requesting the presence of an armed force, protested against it. There is as little basis for the pretense that forces were landed for the security of American life and property. If so, they would have been stationed in the vicinity of such property and so as to protect it, instead of at a distance and so as to command the Hawaiian Government Building and palace. ... When these armed men were landed, the city of Honolulu was in its customary orderly and peaceful condition. ... " </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The president continues: <BLOCKQUOTE>"But for the notorious predilections of the United States minister for annexation, the Committee of Safety, which should have been called the Committee of Annexation, would never have existed. 
<P>
"But for the landing of the United States forces upon false pretexts respecting the danger to life and property, the committee would never have exposed themselves to the plans and penalties of treason by undertaking the subversion of the queen's government. 
<P>
"But for the presence of the United States forces in the immediate vicinity and in position to accord all needed protection and support, the committee would not have proclaimed the provisional government from the steps of the Government Building. 
<P>
"And, finally, but for the lawless occupation of Honolulu under false pretexts by the United States forces, and but for Minister Stevens' recognition of the provisional government when the United States forces were its sole support and constituted its only military strength, the queen and her government would never have yielded to the provisional government, even for a time and for the sole purpose of submitting her case to the enlightened justice of the United States. ... "</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
He further stated, <BLOCKQUOTE>"... if a feeble but friendly state is in danger of being robbed of its independence and its <A HREF="sovereignty.html">sovereignty</A> by a misuse of the name and power of the United States, the United States cannot fail to vindicate its honor and its sense of justice by an earnest effort to make all possible reparation." </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
President Cleveland concluded by placing the matter in the hands of Congress. 
<P>
The Senate hearings were conducted by the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, John Tyler Morgan, an annexationist, whose final report managed to find everyone blameless for the revolution except the queen. Many in the Senate disagreed, and the House censured Stevens and passed a resolution opposing annexation. In the end, Congress took no action either to restore the monarchy or to annex Hawai`i. 
<P>
With their goal of annexation stalled, the leaders of the provisional government decided to form a republic, while waiting for a more opportune political climate. 
<P>
They drafted a constitution and declared it law by proclamation -- the very act for which they had forced Lili`uokalani from her throne. 
<P>
The new constitution required voters to swear allegiance to the republic, and thousands of Native Hawaiians refused, out of loyalty to queen and country. Foreigners who had sided with the revolution were allowed to vote. Property requirements and other qualifications were so strict that relatively few Hawaiians and no Asians could vote. 
<P>
On July 4, 1894, Sanford Dole announced the inauguration of the Republic of Hawai`i, and declared himself president. 
<P>
Unwilling to give up, many Hawaiians and other royalists accumulated arms for a counterrevolution to restore the monarchy. In the January 1895 uprising, led by Robert Wilcox, the royalists were forced by government troops to retreat into the valleys behind Honolulu, and after 10 days of fighting, most of them, including Wilcox, were captured.

<HR>
<P>
The republic's prize catch was Queen Lili`uokalani. A search revealed a cache of arms buried in the flower garden of her home. She was arrested Jan. 16, 1895, exactly two years from the date the American troops landed in support of the revolution. Imprisoned in a corner room on the second story of `Iolani Palace, she was guarded day and night, allowed only one attendant and no visitors. 
<P>
Shortly after she was imprisoned, Lili`uokalani was given a document of abdication to sign and was led to believe that, if she refused, several of her followers were to be shot for treason. She wrote, "For myself, I would have chosen death rather than to have signed it; but it was represented to me that by my signing this paper all the persons who had been arrested, all my people now in trouble by reason of their love and loyalty toward me, would be immediately released ... the stream of blood  ready to flow unless it was stayed by my pen." 
<P>
Wilcox and four others were sentenced to death, after all. Many other royalists received long prison sentences and heavy fines. 
<P>
Lili`uokalani noted, ''Their sentences were passed the same as though my signature had not been obtained. That they were not executed is due solely to a consideration which has been officially stated: 'Word came from the United States that the execution of captive rebels would militate against annexation.'" 
<P>
The queen was charged with misprision of treason -- having knowledge of treason and failing to report it--and was tried by a military commission. Her trial was held in the former throne room of the palace, where she had once greeted sovereigns and dignitaries from around the world. The prosecutors taunted, insulted and tried to humiliate her, but they never succeeded in destroying her dignity. 
<P>
Found guilty, she was given the maximum sentence of five years imprisonment at hard labor and a $5,000 fine. It was not carried out, but she remained a prisoner in the palace. 
<P>
On New Year's Day 1896, all the royalist prisoners were freed -- except Lili`uokalani. After eight months of imprisonment in the palace, she was allowed to return to her home, under house arrest. Not until late 1896 was her freedom restored. 
<P>
She went to Washington, armed with documents signed by many Hawaiians asking President Cleveland to reinstate their queen. The president welcomed her warmly and she expressed her gratitude for his earlier efforts to restore her kingdom's independence. But it was now too late for him to be of further help. 
<P>
His successor, William McKinley, sent the annexation treaty to the Senate. 
<P>
Hawaiians submitted a petition to Congress with 29,000 signatures opposing annexation, and petitions to the Republic of Hawai`i, asking that annexation be put to a public vote. They were never permitted to vote on the issue. 
<P>
Adding to the pro-annexation argument was the outbreak of the Spanish-American War in 1898, drawing attention to the Islands' strategic position in the Pacific. 
<P>
Ultimately, the annexationists won, and Grover Cleveland wrote: "I am ashamed of the whole affair." 
<P>
<A HREF="sovereignty.html">Sovereignty</A> of Hawai`i was formally transferred to the United States at ceremonies at `Iolani Palace on Aug. 12, 1898. Sanford Dole spoke as the newly appointed governor of the Territory of Hawai`i. The Hawaiian anthem, ''Hawai`i Pono `I" -- with words written by King Kalakaua -- was played at the Hawaiian flag was lowered, and replaced by the American flag and "The Star-Spangled Banner." The Hawaiian people had lost their land, their monarchy and now their independence. 
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="soaliliold.gif" VSPACE=2 HSPACE=8>
Another loss came the following year, with the death of the beautiful young Princess. Ka'iulani, heir to the Hawaiian throne, at age 23. 
<P>
Lili`uokalani remained an indomitable spirit, honored and revered by her people as a queen to the end. She died in 1917, at the age of 79, still waiting for justice.

Last year, for the observance of the centennial of the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy, `Iolani Palace, draped in the black of mourning, was a powerful symbol. The Hawaiian people are still seeking justice through legal means reparations, a fulfillment of trust commitments, settlement of land claims and the return of lands. They are, moreover, seeking recognition of Hawaiian <A HREF="sovereignty.html">sovereignty</A>. The Native Hawaiians will decide how they choose to structure sovereignty -- as a nation-within-a-nation, complete independence, or some other model. It is no longer a distant dream, but an attainable goal.

<P>
As a first step toward redressing the wrongs of a century ago, <A HREF="publawsum.html">the Hawaiian people have finally received a federal apology</A>, recognition of the American government's participation in the overthrow of the monarchy. 
<P>
Last November, the United States Congress passed and President Clinton signed a joint resolution saying, <EM>"The Congress... apologizes to Native Hawaiians on behalf of the people of the United States for the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawai`i on Jan. 17, 1893 with the participation of agents and citizens of the United States, and the deprivation of the rights of Native Hawaiians to self-determination;" [and] "... expresses its commitment to acknowledge the ramifications of the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawai`i, in order to provide a proper foundation for reconciliation between the United States and the Native Hawaiian people."</EM>

<H1>The Overthrow of the Monarchy</H1>

<BODY>
Hawai`i entered the decade of the 1890s as a kingdom and emerged from it as a Territory of the United States, with a provisional government and a republic in between. It was a time of monarchs and "mission boys," of royalists, republicans and revolutionaries. 
<P>
The storm that had been gathering broke on Jan. 17, 1893, when the Hawaiian monarchy ended in a day of bloodless revolution. Armed insurrection by a relatively small group of men, most of them American by birth or heritage, succeeded in wresting control of the Islands with the backing of American troops sent ashore from a warship in Honolulu Harbor. To this "superior force of the United States of America," Queen Lili`uokalani yielded her throne, under protest, in order to avoid bloodshed, trusting that the United States government would right the wrong that had been done to her and the Hawaiian people. 
<P>
Sugar and a coerced constitution played roles in the drama -- intertwined themes of economics and politics. 
<P>
Sugar was by far the principal support of the Islands, and profits and prosperity hinged on favorable treaties with the United States, Hawaiian sugar's chief market, creating powerful economic ties. As the Islands' sugar industry grew, large numbers of contract laborers were imported first from China, then from Japan and other countries, to work on the plantations -- the beginning of Hawai`i's present multicultural population. Plantation ownership and control of the business community were in the hands of men of American or European blood. 
<P>

In 1887, during the reign of Lili`uokalani' s brother, King Kalakaua, a group of planters and businessmen, seeking to control the kingdom politically as well as economically, formed a secret organization, the Hawaiian League. Membership (probably never over 400, compared to the 40,000 Native Hawaiians in the kingdom) was predominantly American, including several missionary descendants. Organizer and fire brand of the league was Lorrin A. Thurston, a lawyer and missionary grandson, who would later be a leader in the overthrow of the monarchy, with many of the same men. 
<P>

Their goal, for now, was to "reform" the monarchy. But reform, like beauty, was in the eye of the beholder. The Native Hawaiians looked up to their sovereigns with respect and aloha. Kalakaua and Lili`uokalani were well-educated, intelligent, skilled in social graces, and equally at home with Hawaiian traditions and court ceremony. Above all, they were deeply concerned about the well-being of the Hawaiian people and maintaining the independence of the kingdom.
<P>
The league's more radical members favored the king's abdication -- one even proposed assassination -- but cooler heads prevailed. They would allow the king to remain on the throne with his power sharply limited by a new constitution of their making. Dethroning him would be a last resort, if he refused to comply. Many Hawaiian League members belonged to a volunter militia, the Honolulu Rifles, which was officially in service to the Hawaiian government, but was secretly the league's military arm.
<P>
Kalakaua was compelled to accept a new Cabinet composed of league members, who presented their constitution to him for his signature at `Iolani Palace. The reluctant king argued and protested, but finally signed the document, which became known as the Bayonet Constitution. As one Cabinet member noted, "Little was left to the imagination of the hesitating and unwilling sovereign, as to what he might expect in the event of his refusal to comply with the demands made upon him."
<P>
The Bayonet Constitution greatly curtailed the king's power, making him a mere figurehead. It placed the actual executive power in the hands of the Cabinet, whose members could no longer be dismissed by the king, only by the Legislature. Amending this constitution was also the exclusive prerogative of the Legislature.
<P>
The Bayonet Constitution's other purpose was to remove the Native Hawaiian majority's dominance at the polls and in the Legislature. The righteous reformers were determined to save the Hawaiians from self-government. 
<P>
The privilege of voting was no longer limited to citizens of the kingdom, but was extended to foreign residents -- provided they were American or European. Asians were excluded -- even those who had become naturalized citizens. The House of Nobles, formerly appointed by the king, would now be elected, and voters and candidates for it had to meet a high property ownership or income requirement -- which excluded two-thirds of the Native Hawaiian voters. While they could still vote for the House of Representatives, to do so they had to swear to uphold the despised Bayonet Constitution. 
<P>
The Hawaiians strenuously opposed the diminution of their voice in governing their own country and resented the reduction of the monarch's powers and the manner in which the Bayonet Constitution had been forced on him. Hawaiians, Chinese and Japanese petitioned the king to revoke the constitution. The self-styled Reform Cabinet responded that only an act of the Legislature could do this - though their new constitution had never been put to a vote. 
<P>
For the remaining years of the monarchy, efforts to amend or replace the constitution received widespread support. The constitutional controversy proved to be the spark that ignited the overthrow of the monarchy. 
<P>

In 1889 a young part-Hawaiian named Robert W. Wilcox staged an uprising to overthrow the Bayonet Constitution. He led some 80 men, Hawaiians and Europeans, with arms purchased by the Chinese, in a predawn march to `Iolani Palace with a new constitution for Kalakaua to sign. The king was away from the palace, and the Cabinet called out troops who forcibly put down the insurrection. Tried for conspiracy, Wilcox was found not guilty by a jury of Native Hawaiians, who considered him a folk hero. 
<P>

A new constitution would have to be another monarch's responsibility. On Jan. 20, 1891, King Kalakaua died of kidney disease at age 54. He lay in state in the throne room of `Iolani Palace, which during his reign had been the scene of many gala receptions and grand balls. 
<P>

Like her brother, the new queen was childless. She named as her successor to the throne her niece, Princess Ka`iulani, who was away at school in London.  
<P>
Lili`uokalani's husband, John Dominis, an American sea captain's son, died just seven months after she became queen. 
<P>
She would soon face a formidable threat to the monarchy and the independence of the kingdom. In early 1892 Lorrin Thurston and a group of like-minded men, mostly of American blood, formed an Annexation Club, plotting the overthrow of the queen and annexation to the United States. They kept the organization small and secret -wisely, since they were talking treason. 
<P>
Thurston went to Washington to promote annexation, and received an encouraging message from President Benjamin Harrison: "You will find an exceedingly sympathetic administration here." 
<P>
In Honolulu, Hawaiians spoke out strongly for their monarchy and presented numerous petitions to the Legislature to replace the Bayonet Constitution, to no avail. 
<P>
The queen had also been deluged with petitions for a new constitution, signed by an estimated two-thirds of the kingdom's voters, and she boldly prepared to act on their wishes. In her book, <EM>Hawai`i's Story by Hawai`i's Queen </EM>, she noted, "The right to grant a constitution to the nation has been, since the very first one was granted, a prerogative of the Hawaiian sovereigns." 
<P>
On Jan. 14, the first of four crucial days in Hawai`i's .history, the queen presided at noon over the legislative session's closing ceremonies at the Government Building. She then walked across the street to `Iolani Palace for a more significant ceremony. She was about to proclaim a new constitution which she had written, restoring power to the throne and rights to the Native Hawaiian people. 
<P>
The Royal Hawaiian Band played as the queen's invited guests, including diplomats, legislators and Hawaiian petitioners, assembled in the throne room, and a large crowd of Native Hawaiians gathered on the palace lawn. 
<P>
As the audience waited, the queen argued heatedly with her Cabinet, who refused to sign her new constitution, fearing her enemies would use it as a pretext to challenge her. They finally persuaded her to defer action on it. 
<P>
The queen addressed the guests in the throne room, and the crowd on the palace grounds, telling them that she was ready to promulgate a new constitution, but yielding to the advice of her ministers, was postponing it to some future day. 
<P>
Alerted earlier of the queen's intention by two of her Cabinet members, the Annexation Club sprang into action. A 13-member Committee of Safety was chosen to plan the overthrow of the queen and the establishment of a provisional government. As they plotted revolution, they claimed that the queen, by proposing to alter the constitution, had committed ''a revolutionary act." 
<P>
The American warship USS Boston was in port at Honolulu Harbor. With an eye toward landing troops, Lorrin Thurston and two others called upon the American minister in Hawai`i, John L. Stevens, an avowed annexationist. Stevens assured them he would not protect the queen, and that he would land troops from the Boston if necessary "to protect American lives and property." He also said that if the revolutionaries were in possession of government buildings and actually in control of the city, he would recognize their provisional government. 
<P>
The next day, Jan. 15, Thurston told the queen's Cabinet that the Committee of Safety would challenge her. 
<P>
In an effort to stave off the mounting crisis, the queen issued a proclamation declaring that she would not seek to alter the constitution except by constitutional means. Unsuccessfully, she sought Minister Stevens' assurance that he would support her government against armed insurrection. The kingdom's marshal proposed declaring martial law and arresting the Committee of Safety, but the Cabinet feared this would lead to armed conflict, and Lili`uokalani wished to avoid bloodshed. 
<P>
On Jan. 16, several hundred Native Hawaiians and other royalists gathered peaceably at Palace Square in support of the queen, expressing loyalty to the monarchy, and carefully avoiding saying anything inflammatory. 
<P>
Simultaneously, at the mass meeting called by the Committee of Safety at the armory, the speeches were incendiary. Lorrin Thurston vehemently denounced the queen and asked the crowd to empower the committee to act as it deemed necessary. The resolution passed amid cheers. No one had mentioned overthrowing the monarchy, but the unspoken was apparently understood by all. 
<P>
The Committee of Safety delivered a letter to Minister Stevens requesting him to land troops from the Boston, stating that "the public safety is menaced and life and property are in peril." 
<P>
At 5 that afternoon, 162 fully armed troops from the Boston came ashore. A few of the marines were posted at the American Consulate and Legation, but the main body of troops marched through downtown Honolulu past `Iolani Palace. They were quartered less than a block from the Government Building and the palace. While the troops were ordered ashore ostensibly "to protect American lives and property," their placement close to the palace was threatening. Members of the queen's Cabinet hastened to Stevens to protest the troops' presence, but it made no difference. 
<P>
The Committee of Safety had initially proposed that Thurston head the government, but he said he was considered such a ,"radical mover" it would be better to choose someone more conservative. They then offered the presidency to Sanford B. Dole, another of the "mission boys," as Thurston called them. Dole had declined to take part in the revolution except for drafting documents. Rather than abolishing the monarchy, he favored replacing the queen with a regency holding the throne in trust until Princess Ka'iulani came of age. Still, he accepted the presidency and submitted his resignation as a justice in Hawai`i's Supreme Court. 
<P>

On the morning of Jan. 17, Dole gave Stevens a letter from Thurston, asking for his recognition of the provisional government, which they planned to proclaim at 3 that afternoon. The American minister told Dole, "I think you have a great opportunity." 
<P>
They also had luck. Just as Dole and the Committee of Safety were about to set out to take possession of the Government Building, Hawaiian police halted a wagon loaded with arms for the insurgents, and the driver shot a policeman in the shoulder. (This was the only blood shed during the revolution.) The sound of the shot drew a crowd, including the policemen who had been keeping an eye on the Committee of Safety, and in the confusion, they walked to the Government Building unnoticed. 
<P>
The building was unguarded and nearly deserted, and few people heard the proclamation that was read from its steps, declaring the end of the monarchy and the establishment of a provisional government as an interim measure until annexation to the United States could be achieved. The American troops were lined up nearby. Minister Stevens immediately, and prematurely, recognized the provisional government. 
<P>
On Jan. 17, 1893, at dusk, Queen Lili`uokalani yielded her throne under protest, with these words: 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"I, Lili`uokalani, by the grace of God and under the constitution of the Hawaiian Kingdom, Queen, do hereby solemnly protest against any and all acts done against myself and the constitutional government of the Hawaiian  Kingdom by certain persons claiming to have established a Provisional Government of and for this Kingdom. 
<P>
"That I yield to the superior force of the United States of America, whose Minister Plenipotentiary, His Excellency John L. Stevens, has caused United States troops to be landed at Honolulu and declared that he would support the said Provisional Government. 
<P>
"Now,  to avoid any collision of armed forces and perhaps loss of life, I do, under this protest, and impelled by said forces, yield my authority until such time as the Government of the United States shall, upon the facts being presented to it, undo the action of its representative and reinstate me in the authority which I claim as the constitutional sovereign of the Hawaiian Islands." 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The queen surrendered Hawai`i's <A HREF="sovereignty.html">sovereignty</A> not to the revolutionaries but to the "superior force of the United States of America" -- temporarily, she believed -- confident that the American government would restore her to the throne. 
<P>

After the queen yielded, the marshal surrendered the police station house, and at the barracks, the Queen's Royal Guards stacked their arms. 
<P>
Having stated her case in writing, Lili`uokalani retired to her private residence, Washington Place, urging the leaders of her people to avoid riot and to await tranquilly the result of her appeal to the United States government. 
<P>
The provisional government took over the palace and declared martial law. Later, at its request, Minister Stevens proclaimed Hawai`i a temporary protectorate and raised the American flag over government buildings. He wrote the State Department urging annexation, saying, "The Hawaiian pear is now fully ripe, and this is the golden hour for the United States to pluck it." 
<P>
The provisional government had chartered a steamer, and Thurston and four others hastened to Washington with a treaty of annexation in hand. The queen's envoys were refused permission to sail on the same ship, and by the time they reached Washington, President Harrison had already sent the annexation treaty to the Senate. 
<P>
But Harrison was in his last days in power, and Grover Cleveland, who replaced him, withdrew the treaty. 
<P>
Lili`uokalani wrote to Cleveland requesting redress, and young Princess Ka`iulani went to Washington to appeal for the monarchy and the Hawaiian nation, impressing the president and all who met her with her beauty and dignity. 
<P>
President Cleveland sent to Honolulu special commissioner James H. Blount, former chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs. Blount's job was to investigate the circumstances of the revolution, the role Minister Stevens and American troops played in it, and to determine the feelings of the people of Hawai`i toward the provisional government. 
<P>
Blount's instructions were secret, but it was known that his word would be "paramount," concerning the United States in the Islands, so he was given the nickname "Paramount Blount." 
<P>
He ordered the troops back to their ship and the American flag taken down and replaced by the Hawaiian flag. 
<P>
Accessible to all who wished to talk to him, he cordially and impartially heard a steady stream of people from both sides. Over four months, he assembled a vast amount of information from interviews, letters and documents. 
<P>
Blount's final report charged that Stevens conspired in the overthrow of the monarchy, which would not have taken place without the landing of U.S. troops. Blount recommended restoring the queen, saying...The undoubted sentiment of the people is for the queen, against the provisional government and against annexation." He noted, "There is not an annexationist in the Islands, so far as I have been able to observe, who would be willing to submit the question of annexation to a popular vote." 
<P>
Based on Blount's findings, President Cleveland decided that, in the name of justice, he would do everything in his power to reinstate the queen, provided she would grant amnesty to those who had overthrown her government. The idealistic Cleveland, in assuming the provisional government would willingly relinquish power to her at his request, misjudged the character and tenacity of her adversaries. 
<P>
The new American minister in Hawai`i, Albert Willis, expressed to the queen the president's regret that the unauthorized intervention of the United States had caused her to surrender her <A HREF="sovereignty.html">sovereignty</A>, and his hope that the wrong done to her and her people might be redressed. Willis told her the president's condition for reinstating her on the throne was that she grant full amnesty. 
<P>
Lili`uokalani replied that according to Hawaiian law, the punishment for treason was death, but that she would be satisfied with banishing them from the kingdom forever. Later, she agreed to accede to the president's wishes. 
<P>
Willis next went to Sanford Dole and the provisional government, assuring them of the queen's amnesty. Speaking for President Cleveland, Willis acknowledged the wrong committed by the United States in the revolution and requested them to resign power and restore the queen. 
<P>
The answer, of course, was no. They repudiated the right of the American president to interfere in their domestic affairs and said that if the American forces illegally assisted the revolution, the provisional government was not responsible.  
<P>
On Dec. 18, 1893, <A HREF="cleveland.html">President Cleveland made an eloquent speech to Congress</A> on the Hawaiian situation. 
<P>
He had harsh words for the landing of American troops at the revolutionaries' request: <BLOCKQUOTE>"This military demonstration upon the soil of Honolulu was of itself an act of war; unless made either with the consent of the government of Hawai`i or for the bona fide purpose of protecting the imperiled lives and property of citizens of the United States. But there is no pretense of any such consent on the part of the government of the queen ... the existing government, instead of requesting the presence of an armed force, protested against it. There is as little basis for the pretense that forces were landed for the security of American life and property. If so, they would have been stationed in the vicinity of such property and so as to protect it, instead of at a distance and so as to command the Hawaiian Government Building and palace. ... When these armed men were landed, the city of Honolulu was in its customary orderly and peaceful condition. ... " </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The president continues: <BLOCKQUOTE>"But for the notorious predilections of the United States minister for annexation, the Committee of Safety, which should have been called the Committee of Annexation, would never have existed. 
<P>
"But for the landing of the United States forces upon false pretexts respecting the danger to life and property, the committee would never have exposed themselves to the plans and penalties of treason by undertaking the subversion of the queen's government. 
<P>
"But for the presence of the United States forces in the immediate vicinity and in position to accord all needed protection and support, the committee would not have proclaimed the provisional government from the steps of the Government Building. 
<P>
"And, finally, but for the lawless occupation of Honolulu under false pretexts by the United States forces, and but for Minister Stevens' recognition of the provisional government when the United States forces were its sole support and constituted its only military strength, the queen and her government would never have yielded to the provisional government, even for a time and for the sole purpose of submitting her case to the enlightened justice of the United States. ... "</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
He further stated, <BLOCKQUOTE>"... if a feeble but friendly state is in danger of being robbed of its independence and its <A HREF="sovereignty.html">sovereignty</A> by a misuse of the name and power of the United States, the United States cannot fail to vindicate its honor and its sense of justice by an earnest effort to make all possible reparation." </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
President Cleveland concluded by placing the matter in the hands of Congress. 
<P>
The Senate hearings were conducted by the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, John Tyler Morgan, an annexationist, whose final report managed to find everyone blameless for the revolution except the queen. Many in the Senate disagreed, and the House censured Stevens and passed a resolution opposing annexation. In the end, Congress took no action either to restore the monarchy or to annex Hawai`i. 
<P>
With their goal of annexation stalled, the leaders of the provisional government decided to form a republic, while waiting for a more opportune political climate. 
<P>
They drafted a constitution and declared it law by proclamation -- the very act for which they had forced Lili`uokalani from her throne. 
<P>
The new constitution required voters to swear allegiance to the republic, and thousands of Native Hawaiians refused, out of loyalty to queen and country. Foreigners who had sided with the revolution were allowed to vote. Property requirements and other qualifications were so strict that relatively few Hawaiians and no Asians could vote. 
<P>
On July 4, 1894, Sanford Dole announced the inauguration of the Republic of Hawai`i, and declared himself president. 
<P>
Unwilling to give up, many Hawaiians and other royalists accumulated arms for a counterrevolution to restore the monarchy. In the January 1895 uprising, led by Robert Wilcox, the royalists were forced by government troops to retreat into the valleys behind Honolulu, and after 10 days of fighting, most of them, including Wilcox, were captured. 
<P>

The republic's prize catch was Queen Lili`uokalani. A search revealed a cache of arms buried in the flower garden of her home. She was arrested Jan. 16, 1895, exactly two years from the date the American troops landed in support of the revolution. Imprisoned in a corner room on the second story of `Iolani Palace, she was guarded day and night, allowed only one attendant and no visitors. 
<P>
Shortly after she was imprisoned, Lili`uokalani was given a document of abdication to sign and was led to believe that, if she refused, several of her followers were to be shot for treason. She wrote, "For myself, I would have chosen death rather than to have signed it; but it was represented to me that by my signing this paper all the persons who had been arrested, all my people now in trouble by reason of their love and loyalty toward me, would be immediately released ... the stream of blood  ready to flow unless it was stayed by my pen." 
<P>
Wilcox and four others were sentenced to death, after all. Many other royalists received long prison sentences and heavy fines. 
<P>
Lili`uokalani noted, ''Their sentences were passed the same as though my signature had not been obtained. That they were not executed is due solely to a consideration which has been officially stated: 'Word came from the United States that the execution of captive rebels would militate against annexation.'" 
<P>
The queen was charged with misprision of treason -- having knowledge of treason and failing to report it--and was tried by a military commission. Her trial was held in the former throne room of the palace, where she had once greeted sovereigns and dignitaries from around the world. The prosecutors taunted, insulted and tried to humiliate her, but they never succeeded in destroying her dignity. 
<P>
Found guilty, she was given the maximum sentence of five years imprisonment at hard labor and a $5,000 fine. It was not carried out, but she remained a prisoner in the palace. 
<P>
On New Year's Day 1896, all the royalist prisoners were freed -- except Lili`uokalani. After eight months of imprisonment in the palace, she was allowed to return to her home, under house arrest. Not until late 1896 was her freedom restored. 
<P>
She went to Washington, armed with documents signed by many Hawaiians asking President Cleveland to reinstate their queen. The president welcomed her warmly and she expressed her gratitude for his earlier efforts to restore her kingdom's independence. But it was now too late for him to be of further help. 
<P>
His successor, William McKinley, sent the annexation treaty to the Senate. 
<P>
Hawaiians submitted a petition to Congress with 29,000 signatures opposing annexation, and petitions to the Republic of Hawai`i, asking that annexation be put to a public vote. They were never permitted to vote on the issue. 
<P>
Adding to the pro-annexation argument was the outbreak of the Spanish-American War in 1898, drawing attention to the Islands' strategic position in the Pacific. 
<P>
Ultimately, the annexationists won, and Grover Cleveland wrote: "I am ashamed of the whole affair." 
<P>
<A HREF="sovereignty.html">Sovereignty</A> of Hawai`i was formally transferred to the United States at ceremonies at `Iolani Palace on Aug. 12, 1898. Sanford Dole spoke as the newly appointed governor of the Territory of Hawai`i. The Hawaiian anthem, ''Hawai`i Pono `I" -- with words written by King Kalakaua -- was played at the Hawaiian flag was lowered, and replaced by the American flag and "The Star-Spangled Banner." The Hawaiian people had lost their land, their monarchy and now their independence. 
<P>
Another loss came the following year, with the death of the beautiful young Princess. Ka'iulani, heir to the Hawaiian throne, at age 23. 
<P>
Lili`uokalani remained an indomitable spirit, honored and revered by her people as a queen to the end. She died in 1917, at the age of 79, still waiting for justice. 
<P>

Last year, for the observance of the centennial of the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy, `Iolani Palace, draped in the black of mourning, was a powerful symbol. The Hawaiian people are still seeking justice through legal means reparations, a fulfillment of trust commitments, settlement of land claims and the return of lands. They are, moreover, seeking recognition of Hawaiian <A HREF="sovereignty.html">sovereignty</A>. The Native Hawaiians will decide how they choose to structure sovereignty -- as a nation-within-a-nation, complete independence, or some other model. It is no longer a distant dream, but an attainable goal. 
<P>

As a first step toward redressing the wrongs of a century ago, <A HREF="publawsum.html">the Hawaiian people have finally received a federal apology</A>, recognition of the American government's participation in the overthrow of the monarchy. 
<P>
Last November, the United States Congress passed and President Clinton signed a joint resolution saying, <EM>"The Congress... apologizes to Native Hawaiians on behalf of the people of the United States for the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawai`i on Jan. 17, 1893 with the participation of agents and citizens of the United States, and the deprivation of the rights of Native Hawaiians to self-determination;" [and] "... expresses its commitment to acknowledge the ramifications of the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawai`i, in order to provide a proper foundation for reconciliation between the United States and the Native Hawaiian people."</EM>

<HR>
<CENTER><H1>Constitution Kingdom of Hawai`i of 1887</H1>

<H3>Granted by Kalakaua Rex., July 6, 1887</H3></CENTER>


 <P>WHEREAS, the Constitution of this Kingdom heretofore in force contains many provisions subversive of civil rights and incompatible with enlightened Constitutional Government:

 <P>And WHEREAS, it has become imperative in order to restore order and tranquility and the confidence necessary to a further maintenance of the present Government that a new Constitution should be at one promulgated:

<P>NOW THEREFORE, I Kalakaua, King of the <A HREF="archip.html">Hawaiian Islands</A>, in my capacity as Sovereign of this Kingdom, and as the representative of the people hereunto by them duly authorized and empowered, do annul and abrogate the Constitution promulgated by Kamehameha the Fifth, on the 20th day of August, A.D. 1864, and do proclaim and promulgate this Constitution.


<H3>ARTICLE 1.</H3>

  God hath endowed all men with certain inalienable rights, among which are life, liberty, and the right of acquiring, possessing, and protecting property, and of pursuing and obtaining safety and happiness.


<H3>ARTICLE 2.</H3>

  All men are free to worship God according to the dictates of their own consciences; but this sacred privilege hereby secured, shall not be so construed as to justify acts of licentiousness, or practices inconsistent with the peace or safety of the Kingdom.


<H3>ARTICLE 3.</H3>

  All men may freely speak, write, and Publish their sentiments on all subjects, being responsible for the abuse of that right, and no law shall be enacted to restrain the liberty of speech, or of the press.


<H3>ARTICLE 4.</H3>

  All men shall have the right, in an orderly and peaceable manner, to assemble, without arms, to consult upon the common good, and to petition the King or Legislature for redress of grievances.


<H3>ARTICLE 5.</H3>

  The privilege of the writ of Habeas Corpus  belongs to all men, and shall not be suspended, unless by the King, when in cases of rebellion or invasion, the public safety shall require its suspension.

  No person shall be subject to punishment for any offense, except on due and legal conviction thereof, in a Court having jurisdiction of the case.

In all cases in which the right of trial by Jury has been heretofore used, it shall be held inviolable forever, except in actions of debt or assumpsit in which the amount claimed is less than Fifty Dollars.


<H3>ARTICLE 8.</H3>

  No person shall be required to answer again for an offense, of which he has been duly convicted, or of which he has been duly acquitted.

  No person shall be compelled, in any criminal case, to be a witness against himself; nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.


<H3>ARTICLE 10.</H3>

  No person shall sit as a judge or juror, in any case in which his relative, by affinity, or by consanguinity within the third degree, is interested, either as plaintiff or defendant, or in the issue of which the said judge or juror, may have, either directly or through such relative, any pecuniary interest.


<H3>ARTICLE 11.</H3>

  Involuntary servitude, except for crime, is forever prohibited in this Kingdom.  Whenever a slave shall enter Hawaiian Territory, he shall be free.


<H3>ARTICLE 12.</H3>

  Every person has the right to be secure from all unreasonable searches and seizures of his person, his house, his papers, and effects; and no warrants shall issue, except on probable cause, supported by oath   or affirmation, and describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.


<H3>ARTICLE 13.</H3>

  The Government is conducted for the common good, and not for the profit, honor, or private interest of any one man, family, or class of men.


<H3>ARTICLE 14.</H3>

  Each  member of society has a right to be protected in the enjoyment of his life, liberty, and property, according to law; and, therefore, he shall be obliged to contribute his proportional share to the expense of this protection, and to give his personal services, or an equivalent when necessary.  Private property may be taken for public use, but only upon due process of law and just compensation.


<H3>ARTICLE 15.</H3>

  No subsidy, duty, or tax, of any description, shall be established or levied without the consent of the Legislature; nor shall any money be drawn from the Public Treasury without such consent, except when between the sessions of the Legislature, the emergencies of war, invasion, rebellion, pestilence, or other public disaster shall arise, and then not without the occurrence of all the Cabinet, and of the whole Privy Council; and the Minister of Finance shall render a detailed account of such expenditure to the Legislature.


<H3>ARTICLE 16.</H3>

  No retrospective laws shall ever be enacted.

<H3>ARTICLE 20.</H3>

  The Supreme Power of the Kingdom in its exercise, is divided into the Executive, Legislative, and Judicial; these shall always be preserved distinct, and no Executive or Judicial officer, or any contractor, or employee of the Government, or any person in the receipt of salary or emolument from the Government, shall be eligible to election to the Legislature of the Hawaiian Kingdom, or to hold  the  position  of an elective member of the same.  And no member of the Legislature shall, during the time for which  he is elected, be  appointed to any  civil office under the Government, except that of a member of the Cabinet.

<HR>
This document is purported to be the text of the draft constitution presented by Queen Liliuokalani on January 14th, 1893, which was never ratified. Opposition to the promulgation of this constitution, primarily from American business interests and missionary family descendents who owned large areas of land ("small group of non-Hawaiian residents of the Kingdom of Hawaii, including
citizens of the United States" <A HREF="publawall.html">PL 103-150</A>), resulted in the treasonous overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii on Jan. 17, 1893, with the support of the American Minister to Hawaii. See the <A HREF="publawall.html">Apology Resolution</A> and the article <A HREF="soa.html">Overthrow of the Monarchy</A> for more information.
<HR>

<CENTER><H1>Draft Constitution of January 14, 1893.</H1></CENTER>


<H2>PREAMBLE</H2>

Whereas the constitution of this Kingdom contains many provisions inconsistent, ambiguous and contradictory in its terms, and is subversive and restrictive of civil and popular rights, and incompatible with enlightened constitutional monarchical government; and Whereas the prayers of my people, coming in the form of petitions from all parts of this Kingdom, to myself and to the Legislature, asking for a new constitution embodying in it provisions equal rights among all my subjects; which prayer to the Legislature of this Kingdom has not been duly recognized by that body through undue and unjust influences; and Whereas it has become imperative in order to restore order and tranquility, and to gratify the just demand of my subjects for a new constitution to be remodeled upon the most liberal and popular form of Constitutional Monarchical Government, that a new constitution be at once promulgated.  
<P>
Now, therefore, I, Liliuokalani, Queen of the <A HREF="archip.html">Hawaiian Islands</A>, in my capacity  as Sovereign of this Kingdom, and as the representative of the people, and in accordance with their almost universal desire, and in conformity with their wishes, do annul and abrogate the constitution promulgated by Kalakaua on the 7th day of July, A.D. 1887, and do proclaim and promulgate this constitution.

<H1>Kingdom of Hawai`i Constitution of 1840</H1></CENTER>


<H2>DECLARATION OF RIGHTS, BOTH OF THE PEOPLE AND CHIEFS.</H2>

	"God hath made of one blood all nations of men to dwell on the earth," in unity and blessedness.  God has also bestowed certain rights alike on all men and all chiefs, and all people of all lands.
<P>
	These are some of the rights which He has given alike to every man and every chief of correct deportment;  life,  limb, liberty, freedom from oppression;  the earnings of his hands and the productions of his mind, not however to those who act in violation of laws.
<P>
	God has also established government, and rule for the purpose of peace;  but in making laws for the nation it is by no means proper to enact laws for the protection of the rulers only, without also providing protection for their subjects;  neither is it proper to enact laws to enrich the chiefs only, without regard to enriching their subjects also, and hereafter there shall by no means be any laws enacted which are at variance with what is above expressed, neither shall any tax be assessed, nor any service or labor required of any man, in a manner which is at variance with the above sentiments.  


<H3>PROTECTION FOR THE PEOPLE DECLARED.</H3>


The above sentiments are hereby published for the purpose of protecting alike, both the people and the chiefs of all these islands, while they maintain a correct deportment;  that no chief may be able to oppress any subject, but that chiefs and people may enjoy the same protection, under one and the same law.
<P>
	Protection is hereby secured to the persons of all the people, together with their lands, their building lots, and all their property, while they conform to the laws of the kingdom, and nothing whatever shall be taken from any individual except by express provision of the laws.  Whatever chief shall act perseveringly in violation of this constitution, shall no longer remain a chief of the Hawaiian Islands, and the same shall be true of the Governors, officers,and all land agents.
<P>
	But if any one who is deposed shall change his course, and regulate his conduct by law, it shall then be in the power of the chiefs to reinstate him in the place he occupied previous to his being deposed.

<H2>CONSTITUTION</H2>

	It is our design to regulate our kingdom according to the above principles and thus seek the greatest prosperity both of all the chiefs and all of the people of these Hawaiian Islands.  But we are aware that we cannot ourselves alone accomplish such an object--God must be our aid, for it is His province alone to give perfect protection and prosperity.--Wherefore we first present our supplication to HIM, that he will guide us to right measures and sustain us in our work.
<P>
	It is therefore our fixed decree,
<P>
	I.  That no law shall be enacted which is at variance with the word of the Lord Jehovah, or at variance with the general spirit of His word.  All laws of the Islands shall be in consistency with the general spirit of God's law.
<P>
	II.  All men of every religion shall be protected in worshipping Jehovah, and serving Him, according to their own understanding, but no man shall ever be punished for neglect of God unless he injures his neighbor, of bring evil on the kingdom. 
<P>
	III.  The law shall give redress to every man who is injured by another without a fault of his own, and shall protect all men while the conduct properly, and shall punish all men who commit crime against the kingdom or against individuals, and no unequal law shall be passed for the benefit of one to the injury of another.
<P>
	IV.  No man shall be punished unless his crime be first made manifest, neither shall he be punished unless he be first brought to trail in the presence of his accusers, and they have met face to face, and the trail having been conducted according to law, and the crime made manifest in their presence, the punishment may be inflicted.
<P>
	V.  No man or chief shall be permitted to sit as judge of act on a jury to try his particular friend (or enemy), or one who is especially connected with him.  Wherefore if any man be condemned or acquitted, and it shall afterwards be made to appear, that some one who tried him acted with partiality for the purpose of favoring his friend (or injuring his enemy), or for the purpose of enriching himself, then there shall be a new trial allowed before those who are impartial.

<H3>EXPOSITION OF THE PRINCIPLES ON WHICH THE PRESENT DYNASTY 
IS FOUNDED.</H3>

	The origin of the present government, and system of polity, is as follows:  Kamehameha I, was the founder of the kingdom, and to him belonged all the land from one end of the Islands to the other, though it was not his own private property.  It belonged to the chiefs and people in common, of whom Kamehameha I was the head, and had the management of the landed property.  Wherefore, there was not formerly, and is not now any person who could or can convey away the smallest portion of land without the consent of the one who had, or has the direction of the kingdom.
<P>
	These are the persons who have had the direction of it from that time down, Kamehameha II, Kaahumanu I, and at the present time Kamehameha III.  These persons have had the direction of the kingdom down to the present time, and all documents written by them, and no others are the documents of the kingdom.
<P>
	The kingdom is permanently confirmed to Kamehameha III, and his heirs, and his heir shall be the person whom he and the chiefs shall appoint, during his life time, but should there be no appointment, then the decision shall rest with the chiefs and house of Representatives.

<H3>PREROGATIVES OF THE KING.	</H3>

	The prerogatives of the King are as follows:  He is the sovereign of all the people and all the chiefs.  The kingdom is his.  He shall have the direction of the army and all the implements of war of the kingdom.  He also shall have the direction of the government property--the poll tax--the land tax--the three days monthly labor, though in conformity to the laws.  He also shall retain his own private lands, and lands forfeited for the non-payment of taxes shall revert to him.
<P>
	He shall be the chief judge of the Supreme Court, and it shall be his duty to execute the laws of the land, also all decrees and treaties with other countries, all however in accordance with the laws. 
<P>
	It shall also be his prerogative to form treaties with the rulers of all other kingdoms, also to receive ministers sent by other countries, and he shall have power to confirm agreements with them.
<P>
	He shall also have power to make war in time of emergency, when the chiefs cannot be assembled, and he shall be the commander-in-chief.  He shall also have power to transact all important business of the kingdom which is not by law assigned to others.

<H3>RESPECTING THE PREMIER OF THE KINGDOM.</H3>


	It shall be the duty of the King to appoint some chief of rank and ability, to be his particular minister, whose title shall be Premier of the Kingdom.  His office and business shall be the same as that of Kaahumanu I, and Kaahumanu II.  For even in the time of Kamehameha I, life and death, condemnation and acquittal were in the hands of Kaahumanu.  When Kamehameha I, died, his will was,    "The Kingdom is Liholiho's, and Kaahumanu is his Minister."  That important feature of the government, originated by Kamehameha I, shall be perpetuated in these Hawaiian Islands, but shall always be in subserviency to the law.
<P>
	The following are the duties of the Premier:  All business connected with the special interests of the kingdom, which the King wishes to transact, shall be done by the Premier under the authority if the King.  All documents and business of the kingdom executed by the Premier, shall be considered as executed by the King's authority.  All government property shall be reported to him (or her) and he (or she) shall make it over to the King.
<P>
	The King shall not act without the knowledge of the Premier, nor shall the Premier act without the knowledge of the King, and the veto of the King on the acts of the Premier shall arrest the business.  All important business of the kingdom which the King chooses to transact in person, he may do it but not without the approbation of the Premier.

<H3>GOVERNORS.</H3>

	There shall be four Governors over these Hawaiian Islands--one for Hawaii--one for Maui and the Islands adjacent--one for Oahu, and one for Kauai and the adjacent Islands.  All the Governors, from Hawaii to Kauai shall be subject to the King.
<P>
	The prerogatives of the Governors and their duties, shall be as follows:  Each Governor shall have the general direction of the several tax gatherers of his island, and shall support them in the execution of all their orders which he considers to have been  properly given, but shall pursue a course according to law, and not according to his own private views.  He also shall preside over all the judges of his island, and shall see their sentences executed as above.  He shall also appoint the judges and give them their certificates of office.
<P>
	All the Governors, from Hawaii to Kauai shall be subject not only to the King, but also to the Premier.
<P>
	The Governor shall be the superior over his particular island or islands.  He shall have charge of the munitions of war, under the direction of the King, however, and the premier.  He shall have charge of the forts, the soldiery, the arms and all the implements of war.  He shall receive the government dues and shall deliver over the same to the Premier.  All important decisions rest with him in times of emergency, unless the King or Premier be present.  He shall have charge of all the King's business on the island, the taxation, new improvements to be extended, and plans for the increase of wealth, and all officers shall be subject to him.  He shall also have power to decide all questions, and transact all island business which is not by law assigned to others.
<P>
	When either of the Governors shall decease, then all the chiefs shall assemble at such place as the King shall appoint, and shall nominate a successor of the deceased Governor, and whosoever they shall nominate and be approved by the King, he shall be the new Governor.

<H3>HOUSE OF NOBLES.</H3>

	At the present period, these are the persons who shall sit in the government councils, Kamehameha III, Kekauluohi, Hoapiliwahine, Kuakini, Kekauonohi, Kahekili, Paki, Konia, Keohokalole, Leleiohoku, Kekuanaoa, Kealiiahonui, Kanaina, Keoni Ii, Keoni Ana, and Haalilio.  Should any other person be received into the council, it shall be made known by law.  These persons shall have part in the councils of the kingdom.  No law of the nation shall be passed without their assent.  They shall act in the following manner:  They shall assemble annually, for the purpose of seeking the welfare of the nation, and establishing laws for the kingdom.  Their meetings shall commence in April, at such day and place as the King shall appoint.
<P>
	It shall also be proper for the King to consult with the above persons respecting all the great concerns of the kingdom, in order to promote unanimity and secure the greatest good.  They shall moreover transact such other business as the King shall commit to them.
<P>
	They shall still retain their own appropriate lands, whether districts of plantations, or whatever divisions they may be, and they may conduct the business on said lands at their discretion, but not at variance with the laws of the kingdom.


<H3>RESPECTING THE REPRESENTATIVE BODY.</H3>

	There shall be annually chosen certain persons to sit in council with the Nobles and establish laws for the nation.  They shall be chosen by the people, according to their wish, from Hawaii, Maui, Oahu and Kauai.  The law shall decide the form of choosing them, and also the number to be chosen.  This representative body shall have a voice in the business of the kingdom.  No law shall be passed without the approbation of a majority of them.

<H3>RESPECTING THE MEETINGS OF THE LEGISLATIVE BODY.</H3>


	There shall be an annual meeting as stated above;  but if the Rulers think it desirable to meet again they may do it at their discretion.
<P>
	When they assemble, the Nobles shall meet by themselves and the representative body by themselves, though at such times as they shall think it necessary to consult together, they may unite at their discretion.
<P>
	The form of doing business shall be as follows:  The Nobles shall appoint a Secretary for themselves who at the meetings shall record all decisions made by them, and that book of records shall be preserved in order that no decrees affecting the interests of the kingdom may be lost.
<P>
	The same shall be done by the representative body.  They too shall choose a Secretary for themselves, and when they meet for the purpose of seeking the interests of the kingdom, and shall come to a decision on any point, then that decision shall be recorded in a book, and the book shall be preserved, in order that nothing valuable, affecting the interests of the kingdom should be lost; and there shall no new law be made, without the approbation of a majority of the Nobles and also a majority of the representative body.
<P>
	When any act shall have been agreed upon by them, it shall thin be presented to the King, and if he approve and sign his name, and also the Premier, then it shall become a law of the kingdom, and that law shall not be repealed until it is done by the voice of those who established it.

<H3>RESPECTING THE TAX OFFICERS.</H3>

	The King and Premier shall appoint Tax Officers, and give them their certificates of office.  There shall be distinct tax officers for each of the islands, at the discretion of the King and Premier.
<P>
	When a tax officer has received his certificate of appointment, he shall not be dismissed from office without first having a formal trial, and having been convicted of fault, at which time he shall be dismissed.  Though if the law should prescribe a given number of years as the term of office, it may be done.
<P>
	The following are the established duties of the tax officers.  They shall assess the taxes and give notice of the amount to all the people, that they may understand in suitable time.  The tax officers shall make the assessment in subserviency to the orders of the Governors, and in accordance with the taxes are to be gathered, they shall gather them and deliver the property to the Governor, and the Governor shall pay it over to the Premier, and the Premier shall deliver it to the King.
<P>
	The tax officers shall also have charge of the public labor done for the King, though if they see proper to commit it to the land agents it is well but the tax officers being above the land agents shall be accountable for the work.  They shall also have charge of all new business which the King shall wish to extend through the kingdom.  In all business however they shall be subject to the Governor.
<P>
	The tax officers shall be the judges in all cases arising under the tax law.  In all cases where land agents or landlords are charged with oppressing the lower classes, and also in all cases of difficulty between land agents and tenants, the tax officers shall be the judges, and also all cases arising under the tax law enacted on the 7th of June, 1839.
<P>
	They shall moreover perform their duties in the following manner:  Each tax officer shall be confined in his authority to his own appropriate district.  If a difficulty arises between a land agent and his tenant, the tax officer shall try the case and if the tenant be found guilty, then the tax officer, in connection with the land agent and his tenant, the tax officer shall try the case and if the tenant be found guilty, then the tax officer, in connection with the land agent shall execute the law upon him.  But if the tax officer judge the land agent to be in fault, then he shall notify all the tax officers of his particular island, and if they are agreed,they shall pass sentence on him and the 
<P>
governor who shall have power to try the case again, and if exceptions are taken to the decision of the Governor, on information given to the Supreme Judges, there shall be a new and final trial before them.

<H3>OF THE JUDGES</H3>

	Each of the Governors shall at his discretion, appoint judges for his particular island, two or more as he shall think expedient, and shall give them certificates of office,  After having received their certificates, they shall not be turned out, except by impeachment, through it shall be proper at any time for the law to limit the term of office.
<P>
	They shall act in the following manner:  They shall give notice before hand of the days on which courts are to be held.  When the time specified arrives, they shall then enter on the trails according as the law shall direct. They shall be the judges in case arising under all the laws excepting those which regard taxation, or difficulties between land agents, or landlords and their tenants.  They shall be sustained by the Governor, whose duty it shall be to execute the law according to their decisions.  But if exceptions are taken to their judgment,  Whosoever takes them may appeal to the supreme judges.
<P>
	Their business shall be to settle all cases of difficulty which are left unsettled by the tax officers and common judges.  They shall give a new trial according to the conditions of the law. they shall give previous notice of the time for holding courts, in order that those who are in difficulty may appeal.  The decision of these shall be final.  There shall be no further trial after theirs.  Life, death, confinement, fine, and freedom, from it, are all in their hands, and their decisions are final.

<H3>OF CHANGES IN THIS CONSTITUTION.</H3>


	This constitution shall not be considered as finally established, until the people have generally heard it and have appointed persons according to the provisions herein made, and they have given their assent, then this constitution shall be considered as permanently established.
<P>
	But hereafter, if it should be thought desirable to change it, notice shall be previously given, that all the people may understand the nature of the proposed change, and the succeeding year, at the meeting of the Nobles and the representative body, if they shall agree as to the addition proposed or as to the alteration, then they may make it.

Few now doubt that sovereignty will come to Hawaii. Still, many people are confused about what sovereignty really means.  Legallythe only true <A HREF="sovereignty.html">sovereignty</A> is independence.<P>The history is now well known.  Hawaii was once an independent and sovereignnation state, <A HREF="treatylist.html">recognized by the United States and around the world</A>.  Theoverthrow, the annexation, and statehood were all violations of Kanaka Maoli,American, and international law, and the United States Congress and Presidenthave now acknowledged this in <A HREF="publawsum.html">Public Law 103-150</A>, which recognizes our"inherent sovereignty" and "the rights of Native Hawaiians toself-determination."  More than just an apology, this resolution opens the doorfor Kanaka Maoli to freely exercise their right of self-determination, whichincludes the right to restore Hawaii as a fully independent country.  <P><A HREF="boylebio.html">Professor Francis A. Boyle</A>, a reknowned expert on international law of humanrights and self-determination, testified last December before the SovereigntyAdvisory Commission on the meaning of the <A HREF="publawsum.html">Apology Resolution</A>.  Prof. Boylestated that, "...now the United States government, after one hundred years, hasfinally and officially conceded, as a matter of United States law, that NativeHawaiian people have the right to restore the Independent Nation State that youhad in 1893 when the United States government came and destroyed it.  ...as amatter of international law, the Native Hawaiian people have the right to goout now and certainly proclaim the restoration of that State..."<P>On January 16, 1994, at <A HREF="palace.html">`Iolani Palace</A>, a coalition of Kanaka Maoli andpro-sovereignty groups issued such a <A HREF="proclamsum.html">Proclamation Restoring the Independence ofthe Sovereign Nation State of Hawaii</A>.  This Proclamation empowered the 'AhaKupuna, the Council of Elders, as the Provisional Government, to providemeasures of development for the restoration of our Country, leading to aConstitutional Convention.  Since that time, the restoration process hasproceeded in accordance with well recognized principals of international law. Independence is coming, sooner than many may imagine.<P><STRONG>Non-Kanaka Maoli (Native Hawaiians)</STRONG><P>One of the most common fears that we hear expressed in the media and inconversations about sovereignty is that non-Hawaiians will no longer bewelcome, that they will be kicked off the land and told to go home.  However,this fear is truly unfounded.  Remember, this is the land of <A HREF="aloha.html">Aloha</A>, even if ithas been abused for many long years.<P>Ho'oponopono, forgiveness and reconciliation, are at the foundation of ourmovement and our success.  There are many innocent people of all nationalitieswho care deeply about Hawaii.  It is our responsibility to care for all thesepeople, protect them, and include them as we develop our Country.  <P>The <A HREF="proclamsum.html">Proclamation of Restoration</A> of January 16, 1994, states that: "TheIndependent and Sovereign Nation of Hawaii will establish procedures foraccording citizenship by means of naturalization to all people who are habitualresidents of Hawaii as of today's date."  Those non-Hawaiian residents who wishto become citizens in the nation will share the rights and responsibilities ofcitizenship, like any other country.  Dual citizenship could also be an optionfor those who wish to maintain American or other citizenship, and this will bedetermined by treaties negotiated with the respective countries. <P><STRONG>Why Independence?</STRONG><P>It is quite clear that we have the right to restore Hawaii's independence.  Thenext question is, Why?  How will we all benefit?<P>It is obvious that the existing political and economic system, aside from beingillegal, is not working well in terms of real meaningful values, such as ourquality of life and the sustainability of our environment.  Discontent with thegovernment is at an all time high, and a feeling of being out of control of thedecisions which affect our lives and lands is rampant, both at a state andfederal level.  If we keep going in the same direction, we'll certainly end upwhere we're headed, which would be most unfortunate.  <P>Our society, here in Hawaii and globally, is not living in anywhere near asustainable manner, and an evolution of values and visions is essential for thequality of our future.  So we are in for a change, and we must be ready tocreate a positive change, before the economic and environmental circumstancesforce us into a more drastic negative one.  We must collectively empower a formof self-government that works in a real way, with humanity's laws in deepalignment with the natural and spiritual laws that are the basis for our veryexistence.<P>"Independence" means more than just political independence.  Right now, we area very "dependent" society, depending on outside sources, primarily the UnitedStates, to meet most of our basic needs.  For example, we import overthree-quarters of our food, and even more of our energy.  Therefore we aresubject to the control of outside forces.  We lack self-reliance and sufferfrom great vulnerability.  Hawaii must become more independent in many ways toensure the future stability and security of our land and people.<P>Once one shifts perspectives from US domestic law to international law, therange of options becomes much more broad.  The opportunity exists to evolvequickly in a positive direction with independent political status.  Life won'tchange drastically overnight, but can change steadily for the better.  <P>Economically, we could to take advantage of our unique global position in thecenter of the Pacific Rim, controlling our 200 mile Exclusive Economic Zone,and becoming a center for international trade and the development of globalethical banking, while at the same time investing in the diversification of ourlocal economy with innovative community based projects for meaningfulemployment and self-sufficiency.<P>Do we have the will to take that opportunity?  How we develop, how we movethrough the transition toward sovereignty, and how Hawaii's futureself-governance and real independence unfolds, depends on how educated andinvolved each one of us becomes.  <P>If there is any place in the world capable of evolving politically,economically, culturally, and spiritually in a smooth and peaceful transitiontoward a truly equitable and sustainable future, it is Hawaii.  In the process,we will be an example for the entire world.  <P>We must remember, the wisdom of our ancestors is essential for our success. With <A HREF="aloha.html">Aloha</A>, we can do it.<P></BODY><IMG SRC="hrcolor2.gif"><BR><A HREF="index.html"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="flagsm.gif" BORDER="0"></A> Return to the <A HREF="index.html">Nation of Hawai`i Home Page</A> or the <A HREF="news.html">News Articles Index</A><P></BODY></HTML>

<H1>Kanahele trial likely to wait until January</H1>
<H2>Juror misconduct and possible tampering led to the mistrial</H2>

Despite jury questions that appeared to favor sovereignty activist Dennis "Bumpy" Kanahele, most jurors appeared to want to convict him of two felony charges, jurors said after they were dismissed.
<P>
But they also said that the 12 jurors in the controversial case could not have reached a verdict and that sovereignty concerns did not play a role in their deliberations.
<P>
"A couple jurors tried to bring up sovereignty, but it really didn't pertain to the case," said juror Kevin Watanabe, an Aina Haina auto detailer.
<P>
Jurors, who began deliberating Friday, quickly decided to acquit Kanahele, leader of the self-proclaimed Nation of Hawaii, and Gordon Kaaihue of the misdemeanor charge against them from the January 1994 incident.
<P>
The government charged them with interfering with a police officer trying to serve a warrant on fugitive Nathan Brown, who had evaded a 78-month sentence for tax fraud.
<P>
Juror Matthew Allard, a Makiki grocery store clerk, said he thought Kanahele and Kaaihue were not guilty because the officer serving the warrant didn't say that Brown was under arrest.
<P>
"Count one was definitely acquittal," Watanabe said.
<P>
But jurors split early on the felony charges against Kanahele and reached an impasse Monday afternoon after about a day of deliberations.
<P>
The government charged that Kanahele harbored Brown and interfered with deputy marshals trying to arrest him at Kanahele's Waimanalo home in March 1994.
<P>
Allard, who said he was leaning toward conviction of both counts, said that jurors appeared split 10 to 2, with most wanting to convict Kanahele of interfering with the marshals and 9 to 3 in favor of conviction for harboring Brown.
<P>
He said those who favored conviction tended to believe Kanahele had heard the marshals identity themselves because they were so close to him.
<P>
Kanahele's defense had been that he did not hear the marshals and was protecting his property from strangers.
<P>
Watanabe, who said he was leaning toward acquittal, said he was unaware of vote totals.  He said more jurors appeared to favor conviction, but not a sound majority.
<P>
Neither Watanabe nor Allard knew about anyone who tampered with the jury or which juror raised the question.

(Nansay) for a Special Management Area (SMA) use permit.<BR><BR> In order to pursue development of a resort complex on land within a SMA on the island of Hawai'i (Big Island), Nansay applied to the HPC for a SMA use permit. PASH, an unincorporated public interest membership organization based in Kailua-Kona, and Pilago opposed the issuance of the permit and requested contested case hearings before the HPC. The HPC denied the requests on the ground that, under its rules, neither PASH nor Pilago had standing to participate in a contested case. The HPC subsequently issued a SMA use permit to Nansay. When the case came before the circuit court, the court essentially vacated the permit by remanding to the HPC with instructions to hold a contested case hearing in which both PASH and Pilago would be allowed to participate. In other words, because the SMA permit was granted pursuant to flawed procedures, the circuit court implicitly concluded that the SMA permit was void. On appeal, the ICA affirmed the circuit court's order with respect to PASH and reversed it with respect to Pilago. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the ICA's decision and remand the case to the HPC for proceedings consistent with this opinion.<BR><BR><CENTER><H2>  I. BACKGROUND FACTS</H2></CENTER> The HPC received a SMA use permit application from Nansay for a resort development on the Big Island. Nansay sought approval of its plans to develop a community complex including: two resort hotels with over 1,000 rooms; 330 multiple family residential units; 380 single family homes; a golf course; a health club; restaurants; retail shops; an artisan village; a child care center; and other infrastructure and improvements over a 450 acre shoreline area in the ahupua'a (<A HREF="#FN1">FN1</A>) of Kohanaiki on the Big Island. On September 28, 1990, the HPC held a public hearing on Nansay's permit application, as required by the agency's rules. See County of Hawai'i Planning Commission, Rules of Practice and Procedure (HPC Rules) 9-11(B) (1992). (<A HREF="#FN2">FN2</A>) At the public hearing, many parties presented testimony, including Pilago and the coordinator of PASH. Various individuals and groups orally requested contested case hearings. (<A HREF="#FN3">FN3</A>)<BR><BR> On November 8, 1990, after further testimony and discussion, the HPC determined that PASH and Pilago's interests were &quot;not clearly distinguishable from that of the general public&quot; and, therefore, that they did not have standing to participate in a contested case. See HPC Rule 4-2(6)(B). (<A HREF="#FN4">FN4</A>) The HPC then voted to deny the contested case requests and to grant Nansay a SMA use permit.<BR><BR> PASH and Pilago sought review in circuit court of both agency decisions (denial of their contested case requests and issuance of the SMA use permit) pursuant to HRS ss 91-14 and 205A-6 (1985). (<A HREF="#FN5">FN5</A>) The circuit court determined that the HPC erred in finding that PASH and Pilago did not have interests that were distinguishable from the general public. Accordingly, the court remanded the case with instructions for the HPC to grant PASH and Pilago a contested case hearing pursuant to its rules.<BR><BR>Nansay and the HPC appealed, and the ICA affirmed in part, holding that PASH was entitled to contested case hearing procedures. PASH I, slip op. at 12. The ICA's conclusion was based on its determination that the HPC &quot;disregarded the rules regarding the gathering rights of native Hawaiians and its obligation to preserve and protect those rights.&quot; Id. In other words, the ICA determined that PASH'S &quot;interest in the proceeding was clearly distinguishable from that of the general public(.)&quot; Id. (<A HREF="#FN6">FN6</A>) However, the ICA reversed the circuit court with respect to Pilago, explaining that his acknowledged &quot;special&quot; interest in the proceeding was not a sufficiently &quot;personal&quot; interest &quot;clearly distinguishable from that of the general public.&quot; Id. at 15.<BR><BR> The HPC and Nansay subsequently applied for a writ of certiorari, which we granted on May 7, 1993.<BR><BR><CENTER><H2>II. THE RIGHTS OF A NON-APPEALING PARTY</H2></CENTER> Appeals from decisions of the ICA are governed by HRS s 602-59 (1985), which provides for an appeal only by application for writ of certiorari. State v. Bolosan, 78 Hawai'i 86, 88, 890 P.2d 673, 675 (1995). In the instant case, the ICA ruled against the HPC and Nansay with respect to PASH'S claims, and against Pilago with respect to his claims. The HPC and Nansay accordingly filed applications for writs of certiorari.<BR><BR> Notwithstanding our October 28, 1993 order permitting Pilago's counsel to withdraw and allowing PASH'S representative to appear as counsel for Pilago, Pilago never filed an application for writ of certiorari from the decision of the ICA. Accordingly, we decline to address Pilago's asserted rights in this opinion.<BR><BR><CENTER><H2>III. JURISDICTIONAL REQUIREMENTS</H2></CENTER> It is well-settled that &quot;every court must ... determine as a threshold matter whether it has jurisdiction to decide the issue(s) presented.&quot; Pele Defense Fund v. Puna Geothermal Venture, 77 Hawai'i 64, 67, 881 P.2d 1210, 1213 (1994). Moreover, subject matter jurisdiction may not be waived and can be challenged at any time. Bush v. Hawaiian Homes Comm'n, 76 Hawai'i 128, 133, 870 P.2d 1272, 1277 (1994).<BR><BR> In the instant case, the HPC and Nansay argue that the circuit court lacked jurisdiction to consider PASH'S claims. Nansay asserts further that the proper remedy for PASH to pursue was an action for declaratory judgment and/or an injunction, rather than an appeal under HRS s 91-14. PASH contends that the circuit court properly exercised appellate jurisdiction under HRS s 91-14. (<A HREF="#FN7">FN7</A>)<BR><BR> The necessary inquiry in this case, therefore, is whether PASH has met the requirements of HRS s 91-14: first, the proceeding that resulted in the unfavorable agency action must have been a &quot;contested case&quot; hearing--i.e., a hearing that was 1) &quot;required by law&quot; and 2) determined the &quot;rights, duties, and privileges of specific parties&quot;; second, the agency's action must represent &quot;a final decision and order,&quot; or &quot;a preliminary ruling&quot; such that deferral of review would deprive the claimant of adequate relief; third, the claimant must have followed the applicable agency rules and, therefore, have been involved &quot;in&quot; the contested case; and finally, the claimant's legal interests must have been injured--i.e., the claimant must have standing to appeal. See generally Puna Geothermal, supra. In the remaining subsections of this part, we shall apply this test to the circumstances presented in this appeal.<BR><BR><CENTER><H3>A. Contested Case Hearing</H3></CENTER>In Puna Geothermal, we observed that &quot;a contested case must have occurred before appellate jurisdiction may be exercised. A contested case is an agency hearing that 1) is required by law and 2) determines the rights, duties, or privileges of specific parties.&quot; 77 Hawai'i at 67-68, 881 P.2d at 1213-14 (citations and footnote omitted). In order for a hearing to be &quot;required by law,&quot; it may be required by statute, agency rule, or constitutional due process. See id. at 68, 881 P.2d at 1214.<BR><BR> In the instant case, we need only look to agency rules promulgated under the authority of HRS s 205A-29 to find the hearing requirement. (<A HREF="#FN8">FN8</A>) See HPC Rule 9-11(B), supra note 2. In fact, the respective county planning commissions for all the neighbor islands are authorized under the Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA), HRS chapter 205A, and in accordance with the Hawa'i Administrative Procedures Act (HAPA), HRS chapter 91, to establish rules governing the grant or denial of a SMA permit. (<A HREF="#FN9">FN9</A>) See, e.g., Chang v. Planning Comm'n, 64 Haw. 432, 436, 643 P.2d 55, 60 (1982). In the City and County of Honolulu, on the other hand, the relevant authority under the CZMA (specifically, the Honolulu City Council) is a legislative body that is exempt from HAPA. Sandy Beach Defense Fund v. City Council, 70 Haw. 361, 368, 773 P.2d 250, 255 (1989). No other law requires the Honolulu City Council to hold hearings on SMA applications. Id. at 376, 773 P.2d at 260. Similarly, in the County of Hawai'i, hearings are not required under the HPC Rules for cases involving SMA minor permit applications. Kona Old Hawaiian Trails v. Lyman, 69 Haw. 81, 734 P.2d 161 (1981). (<A HREF="#FN10">FN10</A>)<BR><BR> Next, we must determine whether the subject hearing determined the rights, duties, or privileges of a specific party. At this stage of the analysis, our inquiry is properly directed at the party whose application was under consideration by the HPC. See Puna Geothermal, 77 Hawai'i at 68, 881 P.2d at 1214; Bush, 76 Hawai'i at 136, 870 P.2d at 1280. During the proceeding initiated by the HPC on Sept. 28, 1990 and resumed on Nov. 8, 1990, Nansay &quot;sought to have the legal rights, duties, or privileges of land in which it held an interest declared over the objections of other landowners and residents&quot; of the area, including persons allegedly having constitutionally protected interests on the development site in Kohanaiki. Puna Geothermal, 77 Hawai'i at 68, 881 P.2d at 1214; Mahuiki v. Planning Comm'n, 65 Haw. 506, 513, 654 P.2d 874, 879 (1982). Consequently, we hold that the SMA use permit application proceeding before the HPC was a contested case. (<A HREF="#FN11">FN11</A>)<BR><BR><CENTER><H3> B. Finality for purposes of judicial review under s 91-14</H3></CENTER> The second element of our analysis requires us to determine whether PASH appealed from either &quot;a final decision and order ... or a preliminary ruling of the nature that deferral of review pending entry of a subsequent final decision would deprive appellant of adequate relief(.)&quot; HRS s 91-14(a). In Kona Old Hawaiian Trails, we held that the HPC's &quot;decision to grant a minor permit (was not) 'a final decision or order in a contested case' from which an appeal to court was possible.&quot; Id. at 90-91, 734 P.2d at 167. In that case, we looked to Hawai'i County Charter section 5-6.3 for the necessary provision granting appeal rights because the HPC Rules do not address judicial review of the grant or denial of a SMA minor permit. (<A HREF="#FN12">FN12</A>) Id. at 91 n. 11, 734 P.2d at 167 n. 11 (providing for appeal to the county zoning board of appeals (ZBA) under section 5-6.3 of the county charter). The appellants in Kona Old Hawaiian Trails did not avail themselves of this procedure; therefore, the courts could not properly exercise appellate jurisdicti  E  &uacute;     ant case, PA &Otilde;  as not required to appear before the ZBA prior to seeking judicial review because HPC Rules 4-6(h) and 9-11(D)(5) provide for direct appeal to the third circuit court. (<A HREF="#FN13">FN13</A>) Furthermore, the HPC has already rendered its final views for the purposes of judicial review. See HRS s 205A-29, supra note 8 (indicating that &quot;(a)ction on the (SMA use) permit shall be final unless otherwise mandated by court order&quot;). Even if we were to accept the Petitioners' claim that PASH does not contest the actual grant of Nansay's SMA use permit, but see supra note 5, we would still hold that the circuit court properly exercised its appellate jurisdiction in this case. HPC Rule 4-6(h); see also In re Hawaii Gov't Employees' Ass'n, 63 Haw. at 89, 621 P.2d at 364 (upholding appellate jurisdiction where the agency's preliminary ruling ended the proceedings with respect to a party seeking intervention in a contested case).<BR><BR><CENTER> <H3>C. Participation, including compliance with agency rules</H3></CENTER> Under the third element of our analysis, PASH must demonstrate that it was involved, or participated, in the contested case hearing that culminated in the unfavorable decision. Puna Geothermal, 77 Hawai'i at 70, 881 P.2d at 1216 (citing Bush, 76 Hawai'i at 134, 870 P.2d at 1278; Mahuiki, 65 Haw. at 514-15, 654 P.2d at 879-80). Moreover, &quot;(a)ppellants seeking judicial review under HRS s 91-14 must ... follow agency rules 'relating to contested case proceedings ... properly promulgated under HRS Chapter 91(.)' &quot; Puna Geothermal, 77 Hawai'i at 67-68, 881 P.2d at 1213-14.<BR><BR> During the September 28, 1990 public hearing held by the HPC, PASH testified against the grant of a SMA use permit for Nansay's proposed development. Pursuant to HPC Rule 4-6(a), PASH also requested implementation of contested case procedures at this hearing as well as at the November 8, 1990 hearing. After the HPC denied its request, PASH sought judicial review under HRS s 91- 14 (as directed by HPC Rule 4-6(h) and pursuant to a discussion between the HPC and its deputy corporation counsel). (<A HREF="#FN14">FN14</A>) Having followed the procedures set forth by the HPC, PASH'S participation in the SMA use permit proceeding amounts to involvement &quot;in a contested case&quot; under HRS s 91-14(a). See Puna Geothermal, 77 Hawai'i at 70, 881 P.2d at 1216. The mere fact that PASH was not formally granted leave to intervene in a contested case is not dispositive because it did everything possible to perfect its right to appeal. See id. at 71, 881 P.2d at 1217 (discussing Jordan v. Hamada, 62 Haw. 444, 616 P.2d 1368 (1980), and East Diamond Head Ass'n v. Zoning Board, 52 Haw. 518, 479 P.2d 796 (1971)).<BR><BR>  D. Standing as a &quot;person aggrieved&quot;<BR><BR> The remaining element in our jurisdictional analysis requires PASH to &quot;demonstrate (that its) ... interests were injured(.)&quot; Puna Geothermal, 77 Hawai'i at 69, 881 P.2d at 1215. Although the HPC Rules allow formal intervention through specified procedures, PASH was denied standing to participate in a contested case hearing because the agency found that its asserted interests were &quot;substantially similar&quot; to those of the general public. The HPC's restrictive interpretation of standing requirements is not entitled to deference. See id. at 67, 70, 881 P.2d at 1213, 1216 (citing Hawaii's Thousand Friends v. Anderson, 70 Haw. 276, 283, 768 P.2d 1293, 1299 (1989); Akau v. Olomana Corp., 65 Haw. 383, 388-89, 652 P.2d 1130, 1134 (1982)). Cf. Mahuiki, 65 Haw. at 515, 654 P.2d at 880 (recognizing that &quot;a decision to permit the (proposed) construction ... on undeveloped land in the (SMA) could only have an adverse effect on&quot; the appellants' &quot;essentially aesthetic and environmental&quot; interests). (<A HREF="#FN15">FN15</A>) Accordingly, we review de novo whether PASH has demonstrated that its interests were injured.<BR><BR> We agree with the ICA's thorough assessment of PASH'S standing. See PASH I, slip. op. at 8-13. Through unrefuted testimony, PASH sufficiently demonstrated that its members, as &quot;native Hawaiian(s) who (have) exercised such rights as were customarily and traditionally exercised for subsistence, cultural, and religious purposes on undeveloped lands(,) (have) an interest in a proceeding for the approval of (a SMA permit) for the development of lands within the ahupua'a which are (sic) clearly distinguishable from that of the general public.&quot; Id. at 8. Although we hold that PASH sufficiently demonstrated standing to participate in a contested case, at least for the purposes of the instant appeal, we observe that &quot;(o)pportunities shall be afforded all parties to present evidence and argument on all issues involved&quot; in the contested case hearing held on remand. HRS s 91-9(c).<BR><BR> For the reasons discussed in subsections III.A. through D., supra, we hold that the circuit court had jurisdiction to determine the issues raised by PASH in this case.<BR><BR> <CENTER><H2>IV. THE OBLIGATION TO PRESERVE AND PROTECT CULTURAL AND HISTORIC RESOURCES</H2></CENTER> Having established the jurisdiction of the courts in this case, we now turn to the substantive arguments advanced by Nansay and the HPC. (<A HREF="#FN16">FN16</A>)<BR><BR> Nansay argues that the HPC has no obligation under the CZMA or any other law to consider, much less require, protection of traditional and customary Hawaiian rights. The HPC concurs, adding that the ICA's opinion in PASH I places an undue burden on the CZMA process. In any event, the HPC contends that it did not disregard protection of gathering rights because the SMA permit contains a condition requiring establishment of a program for preserving and maintaining the anchialline ponds on the development site. Nansay and the HPC also contend that PASH failed to establish a prima facie claim of native Hawaiian gathering rights--specifically, Nansay claims that the evidence only shows shrimp gathering at the ponds as far back as the late 1920's.<BR><BR><CENTER><H3>A. Obligations Under the CZMA</H3></CENTER> Within the scope of their authority, &quot;all agencies&quot; in Hawai'i must ensure that their rules comply with the objectives and policies of the CZMA. HRS ss 205A-4(b) and -5. Moreover, the neighbor island county planning commissions and the Honolulu City Council are specifically required to give &quot;full consideration ... to ... cultural ... (and) historic ... values as well as to needs for economic development&quot; when implementing the objectives, policies, and SMA guidelines set forth in the CZMA. HRS s 205A-4(a) (emphasis added).<BR><BR> In accordance with statutory mandates, HPC Rule 9-11(C) provides that the relevant governmental authority may grant a SMA use permit only upon finding that the proposed development: (1) &quot;will not have any significant adverse environmental or ecological effect&quot;; (<A HREF="#FN17">FN17</A>) (2) &quot;is consistent with (CZMA) objectives and policies ... and the (SMA) guidelines&quot;; (<A HREF="#FN18">FN18</A>) and (3) &quot;is consistent with the General Plan, Zoning Code and other applicable ordinances.&quot; A &quot;significant adverse effect,&quot; for the purposes of deliberations upon a SMA permit application, (<A HREF="#FN19">FN19</A>) includes the expected primary or secondary consequences of a proposed development, as well as the short- and long-term effects or cumulative consequences of the proposal. Accordingly, the HPC may not issue a SMA use permit unless it finds that the proposed project will not have any significant adverse effects. Cf. Hui Alaloa v. Planning Comm'n, 68 Haw. 135, 705 P.2d 1042 (1985). In Hui Alaloa, the Maui Planning Commission (MPC) failed to make the requisite finding that a proposed development on the island of Moloka'i was consistent with CZMA historic protection and preservation objectives. Notwithstanding the inclusion of permit conditions requiring the developer to retain a qualified archaeologist and to substantially comply with the CZMA and HAPA, we vacated the MPC's orders granting SMA permits.<BR><BR> The following factors, inter alia, may constitute significant adverse effects: (a) &quot;an irrevocable commitment to loss or destruction of any natural or cultural resource, including but not limited to, historic sites and view planes&quot;; (b) effects upon &quot;the economic or social welfare and activities of the community, County or State&quot;; and (c) actions &quot;contrary to the objectives and policies of (the CZMA) and the (SMA) Guidelines(.)&quot; HPC Rule 9-10(H)(1), (4) &amp; (10) (emphases added). See also HPC Rule 9-6(A)(2); HRS s 205A- 2(b)(2) (one of the CZMA's objectives and policies is to protect and preserve &quot;those natural and manmade historic and prehistoric resources in the coastal zone management area that are significant in Hawaiian ... history and culture &quot;) (emphasis added). The interests asserted by PASH fall within these broad categories; therefore, they are entitled to protection under the CZMA. (<A HREF="#FN20">FN20</A>) See HRS s 205A-21 (finding that &quot;special controls on development are necessary to avoid permanent losses of valuable resources and the foreclosure of management options, and to ensure ... adequate access&quot;); HPC Rule 9- 11(C) (authorizing the the HPC to attach &quot;reasonable terms and conditions&quot; to SMA permits); cf. Hammond v. North Slope Borough, 645 P.2d 750, 761-62 (Alaska 1982) (holding that Alaska's version of the CZMA requires its agencies to &quot;assure opportunities for subsistence usage of coastal areas and resources&quot; and to issue development permits only where consistent with Alaska's environmental and cultural interests).<BR><BR> In order for any conditions placed on a SMA permit issued by the HPC on remand to be deemed &quot;reasonable,&quot; they must bear an essential nexus to legitimate State interests and must be &quot;roughly proportional&quot; to the impact of the proposed development. See infra section V.B. (discussing the respective requirements from Nollan v. California Coastal Comm'n, 483 U.S. 825, 836 (1986), and Dolan v. City of Tigard, 114 S.Ct. 2309 (1994)). Here, the relevant State interests are reflected in article XII, section 7 of the Hawai'i Constitution (1978) and HRS s 1-1. See infra section IV.B. In other words, the HPC may require dedications appropriately tailored to the special and quantifiable burdens associated with granting discretionary benefits to Nansay, through a SMA permit, which facilitate development of the company's land. Conditions that ensure continued access to the subject property for the legitimate and reasonable practice of customary and traditional rights would presumably comply with constitutional prohibitions against the uncompensated taking of private property. See infra section V.B.<BR><BR><CENTER><H3>B. Obligations Under Article XII, Section 7 of the Hawai'i Constitution and HRS s 1-1</H3></CENTER>In addition to the requirements of the CZMA, the HPC is obligated to protect customary and traditional rights to the extent feasible under the Hawai'i Constitution and relevant statutes. Article XII, section 7 of the Hawai'i Constitution (1978) provides:<BR><BR><BLOCKQUOTE>The State reaffirms and shall protect all rights, customarily and traditionally exercised for subsistence, cultural and religious purposes and possessed by ahupua'a tenants who are descendants of native Hawaiians who inhabited the Hawaiian Islands prior to 1778, subject to the right of the State to regulate such rights.</BLOCKQUOTE>(Emphases added.) HRS s 1-1 (Supp.1992) provides:<BR><BR><BLOCKQUOTE>The common law of England, as ascertained by English and American decisions, is declared to be the common law of the State of (Hawai'i) in all cases, except as otherwise expressly provided by the Constitution or laws of the United States, or by the laws of the State, or fixed by Hawaiian judicial precedent, or established by Hawaiian usage; provided that no person shall be subject to criminal proceedings except as provided by the written laws of the United States or of the State.</BLOCKQUOTE> (Emphasis added.) (<A HREF="#FN21">FN21</A>)<BR><BR>The aforementioned provisions were discussed by this court, in the context of an individual's asserted gathering rights, in Kalipi v. Hawaiian Trust Co., 66 Haw. 1, 656 P.2d 745 (1982). Ten years later, in Pele Defense Fund v. Paty, supra, we recognized that ancient Hawaiian gathering rights may have extended beyond the boundaries of individual ahupua'a in certain cases. 73 Haw. at 620, 837 P.2d at 1272. Nevertheless, neither Kalipi nor Pele precluded further inquiry concerning the extent that traditional practices have endured under the laws of this State. &quot;In Kalipi, we foresaw that '(t)he precise nature and scope of the rights retained by s 1-1 would, of course, depend upon the particular circumstances of each case.' &quot; Pele, 73 Haw. at 619, 837 P.2d at 1271 (quoting Kalipi, 66 Haw. at 12, 656 P.2d at 752).<BR><BR> In order to determine whether the HPC must protect traditional and customary rights of the nature asserted in this case, we shall first review our analysis of gathering rights in Kalipi and Pele. Then we shall clarify the status of customary rights in general, as a result of relevant judicial and legislative developments in Hawaiian history. Finally, we will provide the HPC with some specific, although not necessarily exhaustive, guidelines to aid its future deliberations in the event that Nansay elects to pursue its challenges to the legitimacy of PASH'S claims.<BR><BR><CENTER><H4>1. Kalipi v. Hawaiian Trust Co.: judicial recognition of traditional Hawaiian  gathering rights based upon residency in a particular ahupua'a</H4></CENTER> Kalipi involved an individual's attempt to gain access to private property on the island of Moloka'i in order to exercise purportedly traditional Hawaiian gathering rights. The court prefaced its consideration of Kalipi's claims with a discussion of the State's obligation to preserve and enforce traditional Hawaiian gathering rights under article XII, section 7 of the Hawai'i Constitution:<BR><BR><BLOCKQUOTE>We recognize that permitting access to private property for the purpose of gathering natural products may indeed conflict with the exclusivity traditionally associated with fee simple ownership of land. But any argument for the extinguishing of traditional rights based simply upon the possible inconsistency of purported native rights with our modern system of land tenure must fail.</BLOCKQUOTE> 66 Haw. at 4, 656 P.2d at 748 (emphasis added).<BR><BR>The court then began its analysis of Kalipi's asserted gathering rights by interpreting HRS s 7-1 (1985) (<A HREF="#FN22">FN22</A>) so as to essentially &quot;conform these traditional rights born of a culture which knew little of the rigid exclusivity associated with the private ownership of land, with a modern system of land tenure in which the right to exclude is perceived to be an integral part of fee simple title.&quot; Id. at 7, 656 P.2d at 749 (emphasis added). Accordingly, the court fashioned a rule permitting &quot;lawful occupants of an (ahupua'a) ... (to) enter undeveloped lands within the (ahupua'a) to gather those items enumerated in the statute (HRS s 7-1).&quot; Id. at 7-8, 656 P.2d at 749.<BR><BR><BLOCKQUOTE> The requirement that these rights be exercised on undeveloped land is not, of course, found within the statute. However, if this limitation were not imposed, there would be nothing to prevent residents from going anywhere within the (ahupua'a), including fully developed property, to gather the enumerated items.( (<A HREF="#FN23">FN23</A>)) In the context of our current culture this result would so conflict with understandings of property, and potentially lead to such disruption, that we could not consider it anything short of absurd and therefore other than that which was intended by the statute's framers. Moreover, it would conflict with our understanding of the traditional Hawaiian way of life in which cooperation and non-interference with the well-being of other residents were integral parts of the culture.<BR><BR> Similarly the requirement that the rights be utilized to practice native customs represents, we believe, a reasonable interpretation of the Act as applied to our current context. The gathering rights of s 7-1 were necessary to insure the survival of those who, in 1851, sought to live in accordance with the ancient ways. They thus remain, to the extent provided in the statute, available to those who wish to continue those ways.</BLOCKQUOTE> Id. at 8-9, 656 P.2d at 749-50 (citation omitted) (footnote and emphasis added).<BR><BR> Because Kalipi did not actually reside within the subject ahupua'a, the court held that he was not entitled to exercise HRS s 7-1 gathering rights there. Id. at 9, 656 P.2d at 750. Nevertheless, the court specifically refused to decide the ultimate scope of traditional gathering rights under HRS s 1-1 because there was &quot;an insufficient basis to find that such rights would, or should, accrue to persons who did not actually reside within the (ahupua'a) in which such rights are claimed.&quot; Id. at 12, 656 P.2d at 752 (emphasis added). In other words, Kalipi did not foreclose the possibility of establishing, in future cases, traditional Hawaiian gathering and access rights in one ahupua'a that have been customarily held by residents of another ahupua'a. <BR><BR><CENTER><H4> 2. Pele Defense Fund v. Paty: judicial recognition of traditional access and gathering rights based upon custom</H4></CENTER>Pele involved, inter alia, the assertion of customarily and traditionally exercised subsistence, cultural, and religious practices in the Wao Kele 'O Puna Natural Area Reserve on the Big Island. For the purposes of summary judgment, we held that there was a sufficient basis to find that gathering rights can be claimed by persons who do not reside in the particular ahupua'a where they seek to exercise those rights. Pele, 73 Haw. at 621, 837 P.2d at 1272 (reversing summary judgment and remanding for trial on this issue). We specifically held that &quot;native Hawaiian rights protected by article XII, s 7 may extend beyond the ahupua'a in which a native Hawaiian resides.&quot; Pele, 73 Haw. at 620, 837 P.2d at 1272. In so holding, we explicated the discussion of gathering rights in Kalipi by recognizing that a claim based on practiced customs raises different issues than assertions premised on mere land ownership.<BR><BR><BLOCKQUOTE> Unlike Kalipi, (Pele Defense Fund) members assert native Hawaiian rights based on the traditional access and gathering patterns of native Hawaiians in the Puna region. Because Kalipi based his claims entirely on land ownership, rather than on the practiced customs of Hawaiians on (Moloka'i), the issue facing us is somewhat different from the issue in Kalipi.</BLOCKQUOTE>Pele, 73 Haw. at 618-19, 837 P.2d at 1271.<BR><BR> Although we later mentioned &quot;other requirements of Kalipi &quot; with approval-- implicitly referring to the &quot;undeveloped lands&quot; and &quot;no actual harm&quot; requirements of Kalipi, see 73 Haw. at 621, 837 P.2d at 1272--our holding in Pele was not intended to foreclose argument regarding those requirements in future, unrelated cases involving assertions of customary and traditional rights under HRS s 1-1. &quot;In Kalipi, we foresaw that '(t)he precise nature and scope of the rights retained by s 1-1 would, of course, depend upon the particular circumstances of each case.' &quot; Pele, 73 Haw. at 619, 837 P.2d at 1271 (quoting Kalipi, 66 Haw. at 12, 666 P.2d at 752).<BR><BR><CENTER><H4>3. The &quot;other requirements of Kalipi&quot;</H4></CENTER> In addition to creating the &quot;undeveloped land&quot; requirement, see Kalipi, 66 Haw. at 7-8, 656 P.2d at 749, the court in Kalipi made the following observations concerning claims of traditional gathering rights under HRS s 1- 1: (<A HREF="#FN24">FN24</A>)<BR><BR><BLOCKQUOTE> We perceive the Hawaiian usage exception to the adoption of the common law to represent an attempt on the part of the framers of the statute to avoid results inappropriate to the isles' inhabitants by permitting the continuance of native understandings and practices which did not unreasonably interfere with the spirit of the common law. The statutory exception is thus akin to the English doctrine of custom whereby practices and privileges unique to particular districts continued to apply to the residents of those districts even though in contravention of the common law. This is not to say that we find that all the requisite elements of the doctrine of custom were necessarily incorporated in s 1-1. Rather we believe that the retention of a Hawaiian tradition should in each case be determined by balancing the respective interests and harm once it is established that the application of the custom has continued in a particular area.<BR><BR> In this case, Plaintiff's witnesses testified at trial that there have continued in certain (ahupua'a) a range of practices associated with the ancient way of life which required the utilization of the undeveloped property of others and which were not found in s 7-1.( (<A HREF="#FN25">FN25</A>)) Where these practices have, without harm to anyone, been continued, we are of the opinion that the reference to Hawaiian usage in s 1-1 insures their continuance for so long as no actual harm is done thereby.<BR><BR> Oni v. Meek, (2 Haw. 89, (1858) ), does not preclude this conclusion, for in that case the application of the doctrine of custom was argued and the doctrine itself was not rejected.... Moreover, the language in Oni respecting the conclusiveness of s 7-1 does not necessarily preclude application of the doctrine.</BLOCKQUOTE> Id. at 10-11, 656 P.2d at 751 (citations omitted) (footnote renumbered and internal citation added) (emphases added). (<A HREF="#FN26">FN26</A>) In reaching its conclusion regarding the continued existence of customary rights, the Kalipi court necessarily rejected the appellee's contentions that 1) &quot;any customary rights which might otherwise have been retained by s 1-1 have been abrogated by judicial precedent(,)&quot; and 2) &quot;no customary rights other than those found in ... (HRS s 7-1) survived the (Maehele ).&quot; (<A HREF="#FN27">FN27</A>) Id. at 9-10, 656 P.2d at 750. Oni does not stand for the proposition that customary rights, which had not yet been formally established through judicial proceedings, were extinguished sub silentio by the Ma %ehele or its associated legal developments. Oni merely rejected one particular claim based upon an apparently non-traditional practice that had not achieved customary status in the area where the right was asserted.<BR><BR> The Kalipi court implicitly acknowledged the possibility of recognizing certain customary rights, under HRS s 1-1, to gather items that are not specifically delineated in HRS s 7-1. See supra note 26 &amp; accompanying text (quoting Kalipi, 66 Haw. at 10 &amp; n. 4, 656 P.2d at 751 &amp; n. 4). However, the court did not fully embrace the opportunity to clarify Oni with respect to the potential application of the doctrine of custom. (<A HREF="#FN28">FN28</A>) We believe that the Kalipi court's preoccupation with residency requirements under HRS s 7-1 obfuscated its cursory examination of Kalipi's alternative claim based on customarily and traditionally exercised Hawaiian rights. (<A HREF="#FN29">FN29</A>) Accordingly, we read the discussion of customary rights in Oni and Kalipi as merely informing us that the balance of interests and harms clearly favors a right of exclusion for private property owners as against persons pursuing non- traditional practices or exercising otherwise valid customary rights in an unreasonable manner.<BR><BR> On the other hand, the reasonable exercise of ancient Hawaiian usage is entitled to protection under article XII, section 7. See Pele, 73 Haw. at 618-21, 837 P.2d at 1269-72 (holding that rights primarily associated with residence in a particular ahupua'a under HRS s 7-1 might have extended beyond those bounds through ancient Hawaiian custom preserved in HRS s 1-1); id. at 620, 837 P.2d at 1272 (holding that article XII, section 7 reaffirmed &quot;all such rights&quot;). Traditional and customary rights are properly examined against the law of property as it has developed in this state. Thus, the regulatory power provided in article XII, section 7 does not justify summary extinguishment of such rights by the State merely because they are deemed inconsistent with generally understood elements of the western doctrine of &quot;property.&quot;<BR><BR><CENTER><H4>4. The development of private property rights in Hawai'i</H4></CENTER>Some of the generally understood western concepts of property rights were discussed in Reppun v. Board of Water Supply, 65 Haw. 531, 656 P.2d 57 (1982).<BR><BR><BLOCKQUOTE>The western doctrine of &quot;property&quot; has traditionally implied certain rights. Among these are the right to the use of the property, the right to exclude others(,) and the right to transfer the property with the consent of the &quot;owner&quot;. In conformance with creation of private interests in land, each of these rights were embodied in the delineation of post-(Mahele) judicial water rights. Ostensibly, this judge-made system of rights was an outgrowth of Hawaiian custom in dealing with water. However, the creation of private and exclusive interests in water, within a context of western concepts of property, compelled the drawing of fixed lines of authority and interests which were not consonant with Hawaiian custom.</BLOCKQUOTE> Id. at 547, 656 P.2d at 68. Although the court in Reppun focused on interests in water, its discussion of the development of Hawaiian property rights is enlightening.<BR><BR><BLOCKQUOTE> In 1840 the first constitution of the Kingdom of (Hawai'i) proclaimed that although all property belonged to the crown &quot;it was not his private property. It belonged to the Chiefs and the people in common, of whom (the King) was the head, and had the management of the landed property.&quot; (Hawai'i) Const. of 1840 in Fundamental Laws of Hawaii 3 (1904). Thus, prior to the (Mahele), all land remained in the public domain. However, other laws passed during the same period lay the foundation for the eventual imposition of private property rights in land by limiting the King's and landlords' heretofore unregulated authority to disseize one to whom land had been granted and insuring certain rights of the common people and lesser lords.</BLOCKQUOTE>Id. at 542, 656 P.2d at 65. The 1839 Declaration of Rights, which was incorporated into the 1840 Constitution, provided that &quot;nothing whatever shall be taken from any individual except by express provision of the laws.&quot; Thurston, Fundamental Law of Hawaii 1 (emphasis added) (hereafter Fundamental Law ). See also Kiekie v. Dennis, 1 Haw. 69, 70 (1851) (recognizing that the rights of each hoa'aeina, or ahupua'a tenant, were secured by the 1840 constitution). Several laws enacted in 1839 and 1840, and later compiled in the Laws of 1842, permitted the extinguishment of tenant rights in limited circumstances. See, e.g., Act of Nov. 9, 1840, ch. III, s 7, reprinted in Fundamental Law at 20 (excepting from restoration to previous holders those residuum lands that were separated from their affiliated lands for reasons of public interest); Fundamental Law at 43 (providing compensation for incursions related to road-building); id. at 133- 35 (permitting dispossession of tenants because of idleness, where such idleness is proven at trial).<BR><BR> The 1840 constitution reflected an attempt to deal with chiefs and foreigners who sought to vest land rights without the required consent of the King. See Kuykendall, The Hawaiian Kingdom 1778-1854 (1938) (hereafter Kuykendall). (<A HREF="#FN30">FN30</A>) Gun-boats frequently came to Hawai'i to enforce the claims of foreigners. Levy, &quot;Native Hawaiian Land Rights,&quot; 63 Cal. L.Rev. 848, 852 (1975) (hereafter Levy); Kuykendall at 153. For example, British Consul Richard Charlton claimed a valuable piece of land based upon a 299-year lease supposedly obtained from a Hawaiian named Kalanimoku in 1826. Kuykendall at 208. Kalanimoku was a husband of the dowager Queen Ka'ahumanu and also served as a guardian of the young King Kamehameha III. The lease purportedly covered land occupied by Charlton as well as an adjoining piece, which had been occupied since 1826 by the retainers of Queen Ka'ahumanu. Id. at 208-09. Kamehameha III rejected this claim in 1840 for various reasons, including absence of legitimate authority to make the grant. Id. at 209. Conflicts exacerbated by further adverse decisions of the King and the Hawaiian courts, see id. at 208-12, eventually led to the provisional cession of Hawai'i on February 25, 1843, under threat of violence, to Lord George Paulet, commander of the British warship Carysfort. (<A HREF="#FN31">FN31</A>) Id. at 216; Levy at 852. Although Hawaiian independence was reaffirmed on July 31, 1843, these events would have a profound impact on future socio-political developments in the islands.<BR><BR>The minutes of a Privy Council meeting on October 9, 1845 reveal the continuing belief that &quot;nothing but difficulties, even though we should be without fault, would result from the system of Reports of Foreign Consuls, being supported, and their complaints redressed without inquiry, by the Naval Forces of their nations.&quot; 1 Privy Council Records at 89, 91. Later, during the kingdom's ongoing efforts to resolve Charlton's land claim, additional claims surfaced. The minutes of another Privy Council meeting indicate:<BR><BR> <BLOCKQUOTE>The King remarked, ... give up this new claim, and then the General will claim the whole harbour. They all agreed that in some way or other, not disrespectful to the British Government, an end must be put to these pretensions coming upon them unexpectedly, contrary to all the law and usage among them.</BLOCKQUOTE> Id. at 147 (emphasis added). <BR><BR> Consequently, the development of private property rights was deemed &quot;indispensable&quot; to the &quot;political existence&quot; of the kingdom. L. 1845-46, at 5. Furthermore, the &quot;increase of foreign commerce and the enhanced value of property ... required something more of the Hawaiian courts than mere investigation of facts.&quot; Id. (&quot;The events of the late Provisional Cession to Great Britain conclusively prove that some more minute and extensive judicature was long since requisite.&quot;). See also 2 Privy Council Records 231 (1846-47) (discussing a &quot;compromise for the sake of peace&quot; in another dispute with foreigners). At the time, native Hawaiian subjects frequently petitioned Kamehameha III regarding the dramatic changes taking place in the kingdom. See, e.g., petition signed by 301 residents of Lana'i, dated April 1845, Hawai'i State Archives (HSA), Interior Dept., Miscellaneous File (asking the King not to appoint foreign Ministers, and not to sell any more land to foreigners, because &quot;(w)e are afraid that the wise will step on the ignorant&quot;); The Friend, vol. III, no. XV, August 1, 1845, at 118-19 (reprinting a similar petition, signed by over 1600 people). (<A HREF="#FN32">FN32</A>)<BR><BR><BLOCKQUOTE> The next major step in the evolution of private property rights was the formation in 1845 of the Board of Land Commissioners to quiet land titles. See Law Creating the Board to Quiet Land Titles, in Fundamental Laws of Hawaii 137 (1904). It was the Land Commission's responsibility to ascertain or reject claims of interests in land brought before it. Decisions of the Board were to be made in accordance with the civil law and native customs of the Kingdom. ( (<A HREF="#FN33">FN33</A>)) The Board itself was not empowered to grant fee simple title to land. Rather, its duty was to define each applicant's identifiable interests in land and issue an award describing those interests. Actual title to land could be gained only by a payment of commutation to the Kingdom and issuance of a royal patent. See, Chinen, The Great Mahele: Hawaii's Land Division of 1848 (1958).<BR><BR> To carry out its duties, the Land Commission adopted principles that were to be followed in quieting title to land. The principles were subsequently also adopted by the legislative council of the Kingdom and were made binding rules by which all claims to land would be tested. Laws of 1847, at 81, RLH 1925, Vol. II at 2124. In its statement of principles the Land Commission related the necessity of its establishment to the unenforceability of the laws passed at the time of the Constitution of 1840 noting that:<BR><BR><UL>Neither the laws of 1839 nor of 1840 were found adequate to protect the inferior lords and tenants, for although the violators of law, of every rank, were liable to its penalty, yet it was so contrary to ancient usage, to execute the law on the powerful for the protection of the weak, that the latter often suffered, and it was found necessary to adopt a new system for ascertaining rights, and new measures for protecting those rights when ascertained, and to accomplish this object the Land Commission was formed.</UL> The Land Commission therefore viewed its responsibilities as including the actualization of the laws of 1839 and 1840, among them, of course, the law(s) governing ... (residuum lands and dispossession of tenants, see selected provisions from the compiled Laws of 1842, supra this section).<BR><BR> Thus, when in the next paragraph the Board reserves from allocation to private persons &quot;the sovereign prerogatives&quot; of the King, including the power:<BR><BR><UL>To encourage and even to enforce the usufruct of lands for the common good[,]</UL>it is clear that in accordance with pre-existing civil law and native usage, the Commission intended to reserve to the sovereign the right to regulate ... (undeveloped land) in accord with the needs of the people of the Kingdom.</BLOCKQUOTE> Reppun, 65 Haw. at 543-44, 656 P.2d at 66 (footnote added) (bracketed material inserted in place of references to interests in water). See also McBryde, 54 Haw. at 184-86, 504 P.2d at 1337-38 (indicating that the Mahele proclaimed Kamehameha's intention to &quot;share&quot; the lands with his people, and that confirmation of title was subject to inalienable sovereign prerogatives). Thus, the Land Commission's principles included appropriate provisions intended to preclude the konohiki from &quot;dispos(ing) of the grass land as to leave ... his hoaainas (sic) destitute&quot; and to preclude the government from selling &quot;unoccupied&quot; or &quot;vacant&quot; land so &quot;as to leave the (hoa'aina) destitute.&quot; L. 1847, at 70-72 (citing ss 2 and 6 of Act of November 7, 1846). (<A HREF="#FN34">FN34</A>)<BR><BR> After the Mahele, the Privy Council considered the rights of tenants under the new system of private land ownership and proposed a resolution providing that:<BR><BR><BLOCKQUOTE> the rights of the makaainanas (sic) to firewood, timber for house, grass for thatching, ki leaf, water for household purposes in said land, and the privilege of making salt and taking certain fish from the seas adjoining said lands shall be and is hereby sacredly reserved and confirmed to them for their private use (should they need them) but not for sale ... provided, that before going for firewood, timber for houses and grass for thatching, said makaainanas (sic) shall give notice to the Lord or his luna resident therein.</BLOCKQUOTE> 3B Privy Council Records 681, 687 (1850). (<A HREF="#FN35">FN35</A>) The King responded, however, by expressing his concern that &quot;a little bit of land even with allodial title, if they were cut off from all other privileges, would be of very little value (.)&quot; Id. at 713. Accordingly, the final resolution was passed with the comment that &quot;the proposition of the King, which he inserted as the seventh clause of the law, a rule for the claims of the common people to go to the mountains, and the seas attached to their own particular land exclusively, is agreed to(.)&quot; Id. at 763; see L. 1850, s 7, at 203-04. Provisions of the law requiring the landlord's consent were repealed the following year because &quot;many difficulties and complaints have arisen from the bad feeling existing on account of the Konohiki's (sic) forbidding the tenants on the lands enjoying the benefits that have been by law given them.&quot; L. 1851, at 98.<BR><BR>Given the preservation of Hawaiian usage in conjunction with the transition to a new system of land tenure, see, e.g., supra note 23 (outlining the continued reliance on custom and usage throughout the kingdom's legal history, which was adopted as the law of the territory upon annexation of these islands to the United States); supra note 33 (quoting L. 1845-46, at 109), (<A HREF="#FN36">FN36</A>) it is doubtful that &quot;accept(ance)&quot; of traditional and customary rights was required or that recognition of such rights would have &quot;fundamentally violat(ed) the new system.&quot; Kalipi, 66 Haw. at 11 n. 5, 656 P.2d at 751 n. 5. (<A HREF="#FN37">FN37</A>) See supra section IV.B.3 (indicating that Kalipi implicitly rejected the argument that customary rights were extinguished by the specification of tenant rights in the 1846, 1850, and 1851 legislative enactments).<BR><BR> Our examination of the relevant legal developments in Hawaiian history leads us to the conclusion that the western concept of exclusivity is not universally applicable in Hawai'i. Cf. Stevens v. City of Cannon Beach, 317 Or. 131, 143, 854 P.2d 449, 456 (1993), cert. denied, 114 S.Ct. 1332 (1994) (holding that &quot;(w)hen plaintiffs took title to their land, they were on (constructive) notice that exclusive use ... was not part of the 'bundle of rights' that they acquired&quot;). In other words, the issuance of a Hawaiian land patent confirmed a limited property interest as compared with typical land patents governed by western concepts of property. Cf. United States v. Winans, 198 U.S. 371, 384 (1905) (observing that the United States Congress was competent &quot;to secure to the Indians such a remnant of the great rights they possessed&quot;).<BR><BR> Although this premise clearly conflicts with common &quot;understandings of property&quot; and could theoretically lead to disruption, see Kalipi, 66 Haw. at 8-9, 656 P.2d at 750, the non-confrontational aspects of traditional Hawaiian culture should minimize potential disturbances. See, e.g., supra note 22 and infra note 43. In any event, we reiterate that the State retains the ability to reconcile competing interests under article XII, section 7. We stress that unreasonable or non-traditional uses are not permitted under today's ruling. See, e.g., Winans, 198 U.S. at 379 (noting that the trial court found &quot;that it would 'not be justified in issuing process to compel the defendants to permit the Indians to make a camping ground of their property while engaged in fishing ' &quot;) (emphasis added). (<A HREF="#FN38">FN38</A>)<BR><BR> There should be little difficulty accommodating the customary and traditional Hawaiian rights asserted in the instant case with Nansay's avowed purposes. A community development proposing to integrate cultural education and recreation with tourism and community living represents a promising opportunity to demonstrate the continued viability of Hawaiian land tenure ideals in the modern world.<BR><BR><CENTER><H4>5. Customary Rights under Hawai'i law</H4></CENTER> The Kalipi court properly recognized that &quot;all the requisite elements of the doctrine of custom were (not) necessarily incorporated in s 1-1.&quot; 66 Haw. at 10, 656 P.2d at 751. Accordingly, HRS s 1-1 represents the codification of the doctrine of custom as it applies in our State. One of the most dramatic differences in the application of custom in Hawai'i is that passage of HRS s 1-1's predecessor fixed November 25, 1892 as the date Hawaiian usage must have been established in practice. Compare State v. Zimring (Zimring II ), 58 Haw. 106, 115 n. 11, 566 P.2d 725, 732 n. 11 (1977) (citing State v. Zimring (Zimring I ), 52 Haw. 472, 479 P.2d 202 (1970)), with Oni, 2 Haw. at 90 (implying that the &quot;time immemorial&quot; standard &quot;is entitled to great weight&quot; but declining to express a conclusive opinion). (<A HREF="#FN39">FN39</A>)<BR><BR>Other differences in the doctrine's applicability are readily discernible. For example, under English common law, &quot;a custom for every inhabitant of an ancient messuage (meaning &quot;(d)welling-house with the adjacent buildings and curtilage(,)&quot; see Black's Legal Dictionary 990 (6th ed.1990) ) within a parish to take a profit a prendre in the land of an individual is bad.&quot; Blackstone's Commentaries, at 78 n. 18. Strict application of the English common law, therefore, would apparently have precluded the exercise of traditional Hawaiian gathering rights. As such, this element of the doctrine of custom could not apply in Hawai'i. See supra note 21 (discussing the prominent status of custom throughout Hawaiian legal history). In light of the confusion surrounding the nature and scope of customary Hawaiian rights under HRS s 1-1, the following subsections of this opinion discuss applicable requirements for establishing such rights in the instant case.<BR><BR>   <CENTER><H5>a.</H5></CENTER> Nansay argues that the recognition of rights exercised by persons who do not actually reside in the subject ahupua'a &quot;represents such a departure from existing law ... (that Pele ) should be overruled or strictly limited to its specific facts.&quot; Nansay's Third Supp. Brief, at 2-3 n. 1. Nansay contends further that Pele is inconsistent with the fundamental nature of Hawaiian land tenure, which allegedly recognizes only three classes: government, landlord, and tenant. Id. at 3-4; see Principles adopted by Land Commission (1847), reprinted in 2 Revised Laws of Hawai'i (RLH), at 2124-37 (1925).<BR><BR> We decline Nansay's invitation to overrule Pele; on the contrary, we reaffirm it and expressly deem the rules of law posited therein to be applicable here. In Pele, we held that article XII, section 7, which, inter alia, obligates the State to protect customary and traditional rights normally associated with tenancy in an ahupua'a, may also apply to the exercise of rights beyond the physical boundaries of that particular ahupua'a. Pele, 73 Haw. at 620, 837 P.2d at 1272; see also Palama v. Sheehan, 50 Haw. 298, 300-01, 440 P.2d 95, 97 (1968) (noting that Hawaiians did not necessarily reside in the same place that they exercised traditional rights). Although it is not clear that customary rights should be limited by the term &quot;tenant,&quot; see supra note 27, we are nonetheless aware that the &quot;tenant&quot; class includes at least one sub-class. See 2 RLH (1925), at 2124, 2126 (mentioning a &quot;lowest class of tenants,&quot; &quot;lower orders&quot; and &quot;sub-tenants,&quot; apparently from the Hawaiian terms &quot;loepae ma lalo,&quot; &quot;hoa'aeina ma lalo,&quot; and &quot;loepae&quot;). Therefore, we hold that common law rights ordinarily associated with tenancy do not limit customary rights existing under the laws of this state. <BR><BR><CENTER><H5>b.</H5></CENTER> In the context of an argument challenging the Pele Defense Fund's (PDF) standing to bring its claim, as raised on appeal in Pele, we made passing reference to the circuit court's finding that PDF's membership included persons of &quot;fifty percent or more Hawaiian blood(.)&quot; 73 Haw. at 615 n. 28, 837 P.2d at 1269 n. 28; see also 73 Haw. at 620 n. 34, 837 P.2d at 1272 n. 34 (citing affidavits of persons with at least one-half native Hawaiian blood). Because the lower court's relevant factual determination was not challenged on appeal, we did not disturb this finding in Pele.<BR><BR> Nevertheless, these references in Pele were not intended to imply our endorsement of a fifty percent blood quantum requirement for claims based upon traditional or customary Hawaiian rights. The definition of the term &quot;native Hawaiian&quot; in the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act (HHCA) (<A HREF="#FN40">FN40</A>) is not expressly applicable to other Hawaiian rights or entitlements. Furthermore, the word &quot;native&quot; does not appear in HRS s 1-1. Because a specific proposal to define the terms &quot;Hawaiian&quot; and &quot;native Hawaiian&quot; in the 1978 Constitutional Convention was not validly ratified, the relevant section was deleted from the 1985 version of the HRS. See Kahalekai v. Doi, 60 Haw. 324, 342, 590 P.2d 543, 555 (1979). Consequently, those persons who are &quot;descendants of native Hawaiians who inhabited the islands prior to 1778,&quot; and who assert otherwise valid customary and traditional Hawaiian rights under HRS s 1-1, are entitled to protection regardless of their blood quantum. Haw. Const., art XII, s 7 (emphasis added). (<A HREF="#FN41">FN41</A>) Customary and traditional rights in these islands flow from native Hawaiians' pre-existing sovereignty. The rights of their descendants do not derive from their race per se, and were not abolished by their inclusion within the territorial bounds of the United States. See Organic Act, s 83; Act of April 30, 1900, c. 339, 31 Stat. 141, 157, reprinted in 1 HRS 36, 74 (1985) (as amended).<BR><BR><CENTER><H5>c.</H5></CENTER> The court in Kalipi suggested that the &quot;Hawaiian usage exception in s 1-1 may be used as a vehicle for the continued existence of those customary rights which continued to be practiced(.)&quot; 66 Haw. at 11-12, 656 P.2d at 751-52. See also id. at 10, 656 P.2d at 751 (indicating the court's belief that &quot;retention of a Hawaiian tradition should in each case be determined by balancing the respective interests and harm once it is established that the application of the custom has continued in a particular area &quot;) (emphasis added); Pele, 73 Haw. at 619, 837 P.2d at 1271 (reading Kalipi as upholding the right &quot;to practice continuously exercised rights ... so long as no actual harm (is) done by the practice&quot;) (emphasis added). The court in Zimring II noted further that although &quot;usage must be based on actual practice&quot; and not on assumptions or conjecture, the establishment of traditional usage &quot;would be of little weight&quot; because the practice &quot;would not have carried over into a private property regime within the framework of a private enterprise economic system.&quot; 58 Haw. at 116-18, 566 P.2d at 732-33. On the other hand, the Kalipi court also indicated that the traditional practices enumerated under HRS s 7-1 remain &quot;available to those who wish to continue those ways.&quot; Id. at 9, 656 P.2d at 750 (emphasis added).<BR><BR> Contrary to the dictum in Zimring II, supra, the ancient usage of lands practiced by Hawaiians did, in fact, carry over into the new system of property rights established through the Land Commission. Compare Zimring II, 58 Haw. at 116-18, 566 P.2d at 732-33, with Kukiihau v. Gill, 1 Haw. 90 (1851), and Kiekie, 1 Haw. at 70 (recognizing that ahupua'a tenant's rights were secured by the constitution and could not have been conveyed away &quot;even if the King had not made (the kuleana) reservation(,)&quot; see supra note 24).

In other words, the right of each ahupua'a tenant to exercise traditional and customary practices remains intact, notwithstanding arguable abandonment of a particular site, although this right is potentially subject to regulation in the public interest. See supra note 26 (citing Blackstone's Commentaries for the proposition that continuous exercise is not absolutely required to maintain the validity of a custom).Contrary to the dictum in Zimring II, supra, the ancient usage of lands practiced by Hawaiians did, in fact, carry over into the new system of property rights established through the Land Commission.

Pele, 73 Haw. at 621 n. 36, 837 P.2d at 1272 n. 36 (reiterating &quot;the early holding that article XII, (section) 7 does not require the preservation of ... (undeveloped) lands in their natural state&quot; and that &quot;Kalipi rights only guarantee access to undeveloped lands&quot;); see also Kalipi, 66 Haw. at 8 n. 2, 656 P.2d at 749 n. 2. Our analysis in the instant case is consistent with these cases. (<A HREF="#FN43">FN43</A>)<BR><BR> The Kalipi court justified the imposition of a non-statutory &quot;undeveloped land&quot; requirement by suggesting that the exercise of traditional gathering rights on fully developed property &quot;would conflict with our understanding of the traditional Hawaiian way of life in which cooperation and non-interference with the well-being of other residents were integrated parts of the culture.&quot; 66 Haw. at 9, 656 P.2d at 750 (emphasis added). The court also stated that, without the undeveloped land limitation, &quot;there would be nothing to prevent residents from going anywhere within the ahupua'a, including fully developed property, to gather the enumerated items.&quot; Id. at 8, 656 P.2d at 750 (emphasis added); but see supra note 23. However, the court did not expressly hold that the exercise of customary gathering practices would be absurd or unjust when performed on land that is less than fully developed.<BR><BR> For the purposes of this opinion, we choose not to scrutinize the various gradations in property use that fall between the terms &quot;undeveloped&quot; and &quot;fully developed.&quot; Nevertheless, we refuse the temptation to place undue emphasis on non-Hawaiian principles of land ownership in the context of evaluating deliberations on development permit applications. Such an approach would reflect an unjustifiable lack of respect for gathering activities as an acceptable cultural usage in pre-modern Hawai'i, see HRS s 5-7.5 (Supp.1992), (<A HREF="#FN44">FN44</A>) which can also be successfully incorporated in the context of our current culture. Contrary to the suggestion in Kalipi that there would be nothing to prevent the unreasonable exercise of these rights, article XII, section 7 accords an ample legal basis for regulatory efforts by the State. See also supra note 23 (citing evidence suggesting that ancient Hawaiian usage was self-regulating). In other words, the State is authorized to impose appropriate regulations to govern the exercise of native Hawaiian rights in conjunction with permits issued for the development of land previously undeveloped or not yet fully developed.<BR><BR> Depending on the circumstances of each case, once land has reached the point of &quot;full development&quot; it may be inconsistent to allow or enforce the practice of traditional Hawaiian gathering rights on such property. However, legitimate customary and traditional practices must be protected to the extent feasible in accordance with article XII, section 7. See supra note 43. Although access is only guaranteed in connection with undeveloped lands, and article XII, section 7 does not require the preservation of such lands, the State does not have the unfettered discretion to regulate the rights of ahupua'a tenants out of existence.<BR><BR>Thus, to the extent feasible, we hold that the HPC must protect the reasonable exercise of customary or traditional rights that are established by PASH on remand.<BR><BR> <CENTER><H2>V. NONE OF NANSAY'S PROPERTY INTERESTS HAVE BEEN TAKEN</H2></CENTER> It is a fundamental rule under the United States and Hawai'i Constitutions that the uncompensated taking of private property is prohibited. The recognition and protection of Hawaiian rights give rise to potential takings claims under two theories: judicial taking and regulatory taking.<BR> <BR><CENTER><H3>A. Judicial Taking</H3></CENTER> Under the judicial taking theory, when a judicial decision alters property rights, the decision may amount to an unconstitutional taking of property. See Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy R.R. Co. v. Chicago, 166 U.S. 226, 235 (1897); see also Hughes v. Washington, 389 U.S. 290, 296-98 (1967) (Stewart, J., concurring) (suggesting that a state supreme court's decision--that the state owned accreted land built up by the ocean--amounted to a sudden, unpredictable, and unforeseeable change in state property law, which amounted to an unconstitutional judicial taking). However, the judicial taking theory is &quot;by no means a settled issue of law.&quot; Corporation of the Presiding Bishop v. Hodel, aff'd, 830 F.2d 374, 381 (D.C.Cir.1987) (declining to decide the question whether a judicial taking occurred), affirming 637 F.Supp. 1398 (D.D.C.1986); see also Hodel, 637 F.Supp. at 1407 (rejecting a takings claim based on a decision by the High Court of American Samoa). Assuming, without deciding, that the theory is viable, a judicial decision would only constitute an unconstitutional taking of private property if it &quot;involve(d) retroactive alteration of state law such as would constitute an unconstitutional taking of private property.&quot; Bonelli Cattle Co. v. Arizona, 414 U.S. 313, 337 n. 2 (1973) (Stewart, J., dissenting). (<A HREF="#FN45">FN45</A>)<BR><BR> In the instant case, Nansay argues that the recognition of traditional Hawaiian rights beyond those established in Kalipi and Pele would fundamentally alter its property rights. However, Nansay's argument places undue reliance on western understandings of property law that are not universally applicable in Hawai'i. Moreover, Hawaiian custom and usage have always been a part of the laws of this State. Therefore, our recognition of customary and traditional Hawaiian rights, as discussed in section IV.B., supra, does not constitute a judicial taking.<BR><BR><CENTER><H3>B. Regulatory Taking</H3></CENTER> A regulatory taking occurs when the government's application of the law to a particular landowner denies all economically beneficial use of his or her property without providing compensation. Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, 112 S.Ct. 2886, 2895 (1992). However, not every limitation on the use of private property will constitute a &quot;taking.&quot; For instance, the government &quot;assuredly (can) ... assert a permanent easement that (reflects) a pre-existing limitation upon the landowner's title.&quot; Lucas, 112 S.Ct. at 2900. Furthermore, conditions may be placed on development without effecting a &quot;taking&quot; so long as the conditions bear an &quot;essential nexus&quot; to legitimate state interests and are &quot;roughly proportional&quot; to the impact of the proposed development. Dolan v. City of Tigard, 114 S.Ct. 2309, 2317-19 (1994).<BR><BR>In the instant case, the HPC must consider PASH'S alleged customary rights on remand. As we have held in section IV.B.5.d. of this opinion, if such rights are established, the HPC will be obligated to protect them to the extent possible. This may involve the placement of conditions on Nansay's permit to develop its land. No determination as to the extent of any applicable limitations on Nansay's ability to develop its land may be made until the HPC holds a contested case hearing in accordance with this opinion. For that reason, we agree with Nansay that any claim alleging a regulatory taking would be premature at this time. See, e.g., Williamson County Regional Planning Comm'n v. Hamilton Bank, 473 U.S. 172, 185-86 (1984); cf. Robinson v. Ariyoshi, 441 F.Supp. 559, 585-86 (D.Haw.1977), aff'd, 753 F.2d 1468, 1474 (9th Cir.1985), vacated, 477 U.S. 902, dismissed, 887 F.2d 215 (9th Cir.1989). (<A HREF="#FN46">FN46</A>)<BR><BR><CENTER><H2>VI. CONCLUSION</H2></CENTER> This court has jurisdiction over the instant appeal under HRS s 91-14. Having effectively curtailed PASH from developing a complete record, Nansay and the  HPC cannot complain about a procedural remand. The CZMA requires the HPC to give the cultural interests asserted by PASH &quot;full consideration.&quot; In  addition, both the CZMA and article XII, section 7 of the Hawai'i Constitution (read in conjunction with HRS s 1-1), obligate the HPC to &quot;preserve and protect&quot; native Hawaiian rights to the extent feasible when issuing a SMA permit. Finally, this decision does not effect a judicial taking of Nansay's private property because it is grounded in preexisting principles of State property law.<BR><BR>Accordingly, we affirm the ICA's decision and remand to the HPC for further  proceedings consistent with the foregoing analysis.<BR><BR><HR><BR><BR> In a footnote prior to the conclusion of its opinion, the ICA noted that the  conditional SMA use permit issued by the HPC &quot;requires the Planning Department  to approve an archaeological site preservation plan ... and requires Nansay to cease work if unanticipated archaeological sites are uncovered(.)&quot; PASH I,  slip op. at 15 n. 15. If we were to affirm the entirety of the ICA's ruling,  and assume that relevant archaeological protections will be incorporated in any  SMA permit issued after the HPC holds a contested case hearing, we would not  have addressed Pilago's entitlement to contest other SMA issues in that  proceeding. See HRS s 91-9(c).<BR><BR> Immediately before the roll call vote denying PASH and Pilago's requests, one of Nansay's attorneys reiterated that &quot;(n)othing in this proceeding has come even close to being (an interest) other than that of the general public.&quot; On the other hand, earlier comments made by Office of Hawaiian Affairs Trustee Moanikeala Akaka and County Planning Director Duane Kanuha illustrate the policy reasons for allowing claimants like Pilago into contested case proceedings:<BR><BR> AKAKA: ... if you ... think Angel Pilago ... (and other) native Hawaiians do not have any particular claim or concerns (distinct from the general public) about what is happening to their homeland, ... you ought to be ashamed of (yourselves.) ... (A) Hawaiian right or a Hawaiian concern ... should be addressed relating to this Kohanaiki situation....<BR><BR> KANUHA: (In my analysis of judicial decisions regarding) contested case situations, and in dealing with what constitutes or does not constitute a party ... (I) believe that the definition of a party is usually construed very liberally. Okay, even though you need to find some distinguishing concept about that party which makes them different from the general public, ... I think when there is a doubt, most proceedings have indicated that party should be allowed.<BR><BR> Notwithstanding the archaeological site preservation plan requirement imposed as a condition in the now-void SMA use permit, Pilago sought the active participation of &quot;appropriate federal, state, county and private agencies ... (to provide) as broad an investigative foundation as possible.&quot; PASH I, slip op. at 15 n. 15. The cultural insensitivity demonstrated by Nansay and the HPC in this case--particularly their failure to recognize that issues relating to the subsistence, cultural, and religious practices of native Hawaiians amount to interests that are clearly distinguishable from those of the general public--emphasizes the need for appropriate oversight concerning these significant cultural matters.<BR><BR><A NAME="FN1"> FN1. An &quot;ahupua'a&quot; is a land division usually extending from the mountains  to the sea along rational lines, such as ridges or other natural  characteristics. In re Boundaries of Pulehunui, 4 Haw. 239, 241  (1879) (acknowledging that these &quot;rational&quot; lines may also be based upon  tradition, culture, or other factors).<BR><BR><A NAME="FN2"> FN2. HPC Rule 9-11(B) provides that a &quot;hearing shall be conducted within a  period of ninety calendar days from the receipt of a properly filed  petition (for a SMA permit) ...

A written petition is not required until twenty days after the HPC  determines that contested case procedures are required and publishes notice  in a newspaper of general circulation in the county. HPC Rule 4-6(b)(2). In addition to PASH and Pilago, the HPC also received several requests  concerning an alleged prescriptive easement over a jeep trail fronting the  development area. The HPC postponed its hearing on Nansay's application  for a scheduled sixty days so that these other groups and individuals could  resolve the jeep trail issue through mediation or a declaratory action.  Prior to reconvening the hearing, the other parties settled their claims with Nansay. Only PASH and Pilago, both of whom apparently did not pursue  declaratory actions, had not settled their concerns with Nansay when the  HPC resumed its deliberations on Nansay's permit application.<BR><BR><A NAME="FN4"> FN4. HPC Rule 4-2(6)(B) provides in relevant part:  &quot;Party&quot; ... includes the following, upon the filing of timely requests  (,) ... (a)ny person who has some property interest in the land, who  lawfully resides on the land, or who can demonstrate that that person will  be so directly and immediately affected by the (HPC's) decision that that  person's interest in the proceeding is clearly distinguishable from that of  the general public; provided that such agency or person must be  specifically named or admitted as a party before being allowed to  participate in a contested case hearing.<BR><BR><A NAME="FN5"> FN5. PASH and Pilago did not brief or argue jurisdiction under HRS s 205A-  6, which permits a civil action alleging failure to comply with the Coastal  Zone Management Act, because they believed &quot;that it would have been  inconsistent to have attacked the permit itself while still claiming error  in the (HPC's) denial of a contested case hearing.&quot; Public Access Shoreline Hawaii v. Hawaii County Planning Comm'n (PASH I ), No. 15460,  slip op., at 1 n. 1 (Haw.App. Jan. 28, 1993). See Punohu v. Sunn, 66  Haw. 485, 487, 666 P.2d 1133, 1135 (1983) (holding that a declaratory  judgment action would not lie where a specific remedy was available under  HRS s 91-14). However, assuming that the primary jurisdiction doctrine  does not apply because the HPC's decision-making process has concluded and  there is no administrative appeal process to pursue, see The Aged  Hawaiians v. Hawaiian Homes Comm'n, 78 Hawai'i 192, 202, 891 P.2d 279,  289 (1995), the circuit courts would appear to have original jurisdiction  under HRS s 205A-6 to hear either a procedural or substantive challenge to  the agency's action. Cf. Kona Old Hawaiian Trails v. Lyman, 69 Haw. 81,  92-94, 734 P.2d 161, 168-69 (1987). This would be the case notwithstanding  a particular claimant's designation of the claim as an &quot;appeal&quot; rather than  an original action. In re Eric G., 65 Haw. 219, 224, 649 P.2d 1140, 1144 (1982). In the instant case, we need not further discuss PASH and  Pilago's claims under HRS s 205A-6 because we decide the issue of  jurisdiction under HRS s 91-14. See infra section III.<BR><BR><A NAME="FN6"> FN6. At the hearing before the HPC, Nansay did not directly dispute the assertion that unnamed members of PASH possess traditional native Hawaiian  gathering rights at Kohanaiki, including food gathering and fishing for  'opae, or shrimp, which are harvested from the anchialline ponds located on  Nansay's proposed development site. See, e.g., HRS s 174C-101  (Supp.1992) (indicating that &quot;traditional and customary rights shall  include, but not be limited to ... the gathering of (hihiwai), ('opae),  ('o'opu), limu, thatch, ti leaf, aho cord, and medicinal plants for  subsistence, cultural and religious purposes&quot;). Pilago's similarly  undisputed concern and interest was that the area of the planned  development would destroy important cultural sites, possibly including the  burial site of King Kamehameha I.<BR><BR><A NAME="FN7"> FN7. HRS s 91-14(a) (Comp.1993) provides: Any person aggrieved by a final decision and order in a contested case or by a preliminary ruling of the nature that deferral of review pending entry of a subsequent final decision would deprive appellant of adequate relief is entitled to judicial review thereof under this chapter; but nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent resort to other means of review, redress, relief, or trial de novo, including the right of trial by jury, provided by law. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter to the contrary, for the purposes of this section, the term &quot;person aggrieved&quot; shall include an agency that is party to a contested case proceeding before that agency or another agency. Although the last sentence of this provision did not become effective until May 20, 1993, see County of Hawai'i v. Civil Service Comm'n, 77 Hawai'i 396, 401, 885 P.2d 1137, 1142 (App.1994), that fact does not prevent the HPC from appealing an adverse decision by the circuit court to the ICA or to this court. See Fasi v. Hawai'i Pub. Employees' Relations Bd., 60 Haw. 436, 442, 591 P.2d 113, 117 (1979).<BR><BR><A NAME="FN8"> FN8.

The Maui Planning Commission Rules of Practice and Procedure (MPC Rules) currently provide for formal intervention (see MPC Rules ss 12-201- 39 to -46) and for appeal to the circuit court from denial thereof (see MPC Rules s 12-201-46) but make no provision for appeal of a SMA permit decision. Because Maui County Charter s 8.5.4 specifically restricts appeals to the Board of Appeals from those actions concerning &quot;zoning, subdivision and building ordinances(,)&quot; action on a SMA permit by the MPC is final and, therefore, appealable under the HAPA. See also Lana'i Planning Commission Rules (forthcoming, pursuant to Maui County Charter Amendment, as required by 1992 General Election Question No. 3, calling for a separate planning commission on Lana'i). The Rules of Practice and Procedure for the Moloka'i Planning Commission (Moloka'i PC Rules) currently provide for formal intervention and contested case procedures (see Moloka'i PC Rules ss 12-1-25 to -31), appeal to the circuit court from the denial of intervention (see id. s 12-1-31), and &quot;judicial review of (all other) decisions and orders ... in the manner set forth in HRS s 91-14.&quot; See id. s 12-1-61. The Rules of Practice and Procedure of the County of Kaua'i, Planning Commission (KPC Rules) currently provide for formal intervention. See KPC Rule 1-4-1. Furthermore, &quot;(a)ny person aggrieved by a final order and decision of the Planning Commission may obtain judicial review thereof in the manner pursuant to HRS (chapter) 91.&quot; KPC Rule 1-6-18(i).<BR><BR><A NAME="FN10"> FN10. HPC Rules 9-10(D) and (E) omit the hearing requirement for SMA minor permit applications.<BR><BR><A NAME="FN11"> FN11. Nansay claims that Hawai'i appellate court opinions dealing with judicial review of agency decisions reflect an inconsistent legal analysis. Thus, Nansay suggests that PASH should have pursued alternative judicial measures, such as an action for an injunction or a declaratory judgment, rather than seeking appellate review under HRS s 91-14. See Bush, 76 Hawai'i at 136-37, 870 P.2d at 1280-81; Town v. Land Use Comm'n, 55 Haw. 538, 557, 524 P.2d 84, 96 (1971) (Ogata, J., dissenting, joined by Richardson, C.J.). The disparity perceived by Nansay between court holdings based on procedural and substantive errors in agency decision-making merely reflects application of a two-part test for determining whether a particular proceeding was a &quot;contested case&quot; under HRS s 91-1(5). In their dissent, Justices Ogata and Richardson disagreed with the Town majority's application of this nascent test. The dissent believed that the agency hearing, although required by law, was not a contested case. Town, 55 Haw. at 556-57, 524 P.2d at 96. The dissenting opinion erroneously focused on the appellee's characterization of the hearing as a rule-making procedure. Id. at 556, 524 P.2d at 95. The majority, on the other hand, correctly concluded that the process for boundary amendment is not rule-making because it is &quot;adjudicative of legal rights of property interests in that it calls for the interpretation of facts applied to rules that have already been promulgated (.)&quot; Town, 55 Haw. at 548, 524 P.2d at 91 (emphasis added).<BR><BR><A NAME="FN12"> FN12. HRS s 205A-30 requires &quot;specific procedures ... for the issuance of ... (SMA) minor permits, ... and judicial review from the grant or denial thereof.&quot;<BR><BR><A NAME="FN13"> FN13. HPC Rule 4-6(h) provides that &quot;(a)ny petitioner who has been denied standing as a party may appeal such denial to the circuit court pursuant to section 91-14, (Hawai'i) Revised Statutes.&quot; The HPC Rules apparently provide an alternative means of obtaining judicial review: &quot;Approval or denial of the petition (for a SMA permit) shall be final and appealable to the Third Circuit Court of the State of (Hawai'i) in accordance with Chapter 91, HRS, as amended.&quot; HPC Rule 9-11(D)(5) (emphasis added).<BR><BR><A NAME="FN14"> FN14. Counsel for the HPC suggested that if the contested case request were to be denied, PASH &quot;should probably wait for the decision (of the circuit court); and then the Supreme Court will determine whether (its) participation in the public hearing was sufficient standing for (it) to appeal from that decision.&quot;<BR><BR><A NAME="FN15"> FN15. We stated in Akau that &quot;a member of the public has standing to enforce the rights of the public even though his injury is not different in kind from the public's generally, if he can show that he has suffered an injury in fact, and that the concerns of a multiplicity of suits are satisfied by any means, including a class action.&quot; Akau, 65 Haw. at 388-89, 652 P.2d at 1134. The necessary elements of an &quot;injury in fact&quot; include: 1) an actual or threatened injury, which 2) is traceable to the challenged action, and 3) is likely to be remedied by favorable judicial action. See Puna Geothermal, 77 Hawai'i at 70, 881 P.2d at 1216; accord Pele Defense Fund v. Paty (Pele ), 73 Haw. 578, 615, 837 P.2d 1247, 1257-58 (1992), cert. denied, 113 S.Ct. 1277 (1993). In other words, individuals or groups requesting contested case hearing procedures on a SMA permit application before the HPC must demonstrate that they will by &quot;directly and immediately affected by the Commission's decision(.)&quot; HPC Rule 4-2(6)(B). However, standing requirements are not met where a petitioner merely asserts &quot;value preferences,&quot; which are not proper issues in judicial (or quasi-judicial) proceedings. Puna Geothermal, 77 Hawai'i at 70, 881 P.2d at 1216. Although the HPC Rules do not expressly require petitioners to detail the nature of their asserted interests in writing until after the HPC has determined whether a contested case hearing is required, see HPC Rules 4-6(b) and (c), a petitioner who is denied standing without having had an adequate opportunity to identify the nature of his or her interest may supplement the record pursuant to HRS s 91-14(e). The cultural insensitivity demonstrated by Nansay and the HPC in this case--particularly their failure to recognize that issues relating to the subsistence, cultural, and religious practices of native Hawaiians amount to interests that are clearly distinguishable from those of the general public--emphasizes the need to avoges to administrative determinations through restrictive applications of standing requirements.' &quot; Mahuiki, 65 Haw. at 512, 516, 654 P.2d at 878, 880 (quoting Life of the Land v.

Upon granting certiorari, we allowed the parties to submit supplemental briefs concerning issues raised in the application for writ of certiorari. See HRS s 602-59(d). After reviewing these submissions, we then requested additional briefing on the following issues: (1) to what extent should native Hawaiian gathering rights on undeveloped land be protected when that same land is under consideration for development permits, and does the HPC have legal authority to condition a SMA permit on protection of those rights; (2) what criteria should be considered in determining whether the proposed development would infringe upon native Hawaiian rights; and (3) at what point, if any, does the protection of native Hawaiian rights in the land being developed implicate the &quot;Takings Clause&quot; of the Hawai'i and the United States Constitutions? The extensive briefing of these issues included submissions by numerous amici curiae: the Kona Hawaiian Civic Club, Ka Lahui Hawai'i, the Land Use Research Foundation, Pele Defense Fund, the Office of Hawaiian Affairs, the State of Hawai'i, the 'Ohana Council, and (collectively) Protect Kohanaiki 'Ohana, Inc., the Kalamaula Homestead Association, and the Native Hawaiian Environmental Defense Fund.<BR><BR><A NAME="FN17"> FN17. Limited exceptions to the &quot;(no) significant adverse effect&quot; requirement are available where such impact is minimized to the extent practicable, or is clearly outweighed by public health, safety, or compelling public interest.

HPC Rule 9-7(A) directs certain minimizing efforts where reasonable. HPC Rule 9-7(B) substantially parallels HPC Rule 9-11(C), differing by the addition of a provision that includes the cumulative impact of separate development proposals as potentially significant adverse effects.<BR><BR><A NAME="FN19"> FN19. The definition of a &quot;significant adverse effect(,)&quot; see citations to HPC Rule 9-10(H), infra this section, appears in the context of the HPC's threshold determination of qualification for a SMA minor permit versus a SMA use permit. The Director may issue a SMA minor permit only after the following events take place: (1) the Director determines that a proposed project (a) will not have a significant adverse effect and (b) does not exceed $125,000.00 in valuation; and (2) the Chief Engineer reviews the proposed project and makes a recommendation.

The State, as amicus curiae, asserts title to the anchialline ponds as &quot;public trust&quot; lands by virtue of the fact that they are affected by the tides. Although we do not decide this issue, we recognize that the CZMA clearly requires protection and preservation of public &quot;coastal&quot; areas. See 16 U.S.C. s 1454(b)(7) (1985) (requiring each state to create a planning process that provides adequate protection of such resources before federal approval is granted and funding will be made available); 16 U.S.C. s 1455(d)(2)(G) (Supp.1993) (requiring a Secretarial finding to that effect).<BR><BR><A NAME="FN21"> FN21.

LVII, s 5 (providing for exceptions to the English common law where &quot;established by Hawaiian national usage&quot;) (emphasis added). Although references to the provisions contained in HRS s 1-1 generally focus on the 1892 statute as its predecessor, an examination of historical developments suggests that the principles codified in this statute have much earlier origins. One of the initial attempts to codify the laws of Hawai'i indicated that &quot;(t)he Hawaiian kingdom was governed until the year 1838, without other system than usage, and with a few trifling exceptions, without legal enactments.&quot; 1 Statute Laws of His Majesty Kamehameha III, King of the Hawaiian Islands 3 (1845-46) (hereafter L. 1845-46) (emphasis added). As the kingdom developed further, written laws were promulgated to secure civil liberties and to codify the constitutional monarchy that emerged. See infra section IV.B.4 (discussing the development of private property rights in Hawai'i). For example, the first two Acts of Kamehameha III established the Executive Department, including five Ministers and a Privy Council. These initial acts of Kamehameha III dramatically restructured Hawaiian society, but also retained many cultural elements deemed crucial to the survival of the nation's native people. See infra note 33 (noting that part of the second Act preserved &quot;native usages in regard to landed tenures&quot;); see also infra note 24 (indicating that the titles issued for particular parcels of property typically contained provisions expressly reserving &quot;tenant&quot; rights). The third Act of Kamehameha III created an independent Judiciary. Act of September 7, 1847, ch. I, s IV; 2 Statute Laws of His Majesty Kamehameha III, King of the Hawaiian Islands (1847) (hereafter L. 1847). The Judiciary was given the authority to cite and adopt &quot;(t)he reasonings and analysis of the common law, and of the civil law (of other countries) ... so far as they are deemed to be founded in justice, and not in conflict with the laws and usages of this kingdom.&quot; L. 1847, at 5 (emphasis added). Shortly thereafter, on September 27, 1847, the House of Nobles and Representatives passed a resolution calling for the preparation of a civil code. As eventually codified, chapter III, s 14 of the Code provided: &quot;(t)he Judges ... are bound to proceed and decide according to equity.... To decide equitably, an appeal is to be made ... to received usage, and resort may also be had to the laws and usages of other countries.&quot; The Civil Code of the Hawaiian Islands ch. III, s 14, at 7 (1859) (hereafter 1859 Civil Code) (emphases added). See also id. at 195 (prohibiting &quot;conflict with the laws and customs of this kingdom&quot; in s 823) (emphasis added). Finally, ss 14 and 823 of the 1859 Civil Code were expressly repealed in &quot;An Act to Reorganize the Judiciary Department,&quot; the very same legislation that codified the provision now referred to as HRS s 1-1. See L. 1892, at 123-24.<BR><BR><A NAME="FN22"> FN22. HRS s 7-1, which has not undergone significant change since the 1851 enactment that amended an earlier version of the statute, provides: Building materials, water, etc.; landlords' title subject to tenants' use. Where the landlords have obtained, or may hereafter obtain, allodial titles to their lands, the people on each of their lands shall not be deprived of the right to take firewood, house-timber, aho cord, thatch, or ki leaf, from the land on which they live, for their own private use, but they shall not have a right to take such articles to sell for profit. The people shall also have a right to drinking water, and running water, and the right of way. The springs of water, running water, and roads shall be free to all, on all lands granted in fee simple; provided that this shall not be applicable to wells and watercourses, which individuals have made for their own use.

The 1851 enactment deleted provisions established the previous year, which required that persons wishing to exercise such rights must obtain the &quot;landlord('s) ... consent.&quot; See Act of August 6, 1850, s 7, reprinted in Laws of His Majesty Kamehameha III, King of the Hawaiian Islands 202, 203-04 (1850) (hereafter L. 1850); see also infra section IV.B.4 (discussing both the 1850 enactment and its apparent predecessor, quoted infra note 34, which was enacted in 1846). The term &quot;landlord&quot; appears to be a loose translation of &quot;konohiki&quot; from the Hawaiian language versions of these acts. The word &quot;konohiki&quot; is defined as &quot;(h)eadman of an ahupua'a land division under the chief.&quot; Pukui &amp; Elbert, Hawaiian Dictionary 166 (2nd ed.1986).<BR><BR><A NAME="FN23"> FN23. On the contrary, however, &quot;(a)ll the witnesses who testified regarding traditional custom testified that the custom requires that anyone seeking access to the ahupua'a may only exercise those rights in the uninhabited portions of the ahupua'a where that person is a tenant, always respecting the private areas of other tenants.&quot; Kalipi's Reply Brief (No. 6957) at 11 (emphases added). Furthermore, as Kalipi understood his asserted gathering rights, &quot;custom require(d) that anything planted and cared for by people should be left alone.&quot; Kalipi's Opening Brief (No. 6957) at 49 (emphasis added).<BR><BR><A NAME="FN24"> FN24. The court in Kalipi also addressed the &quot;kuleana&quot; reservation in the title to the lands in question. The &quot;kuleana&quot; reservation provides, &quot;'Koe nae no kuleana a na kanaka moloko,' (which was) translated at trial to mean 'the kuleanas (sic) of the people therein are excepted' ... (, and which thereby states the government's intention to) ' ... hereby declare these lands to be set apart as the lands of the Hawaiian Government, subject always to the rights of tenants.' &quot; Kalipi, 66 Haw. at 12, 656 P.2d at 752 (emphasis added). Although the court withheld comment on the precise scope of this alternative source of gathering rights, see Kalipi, 66 Haw. at 12-13, 656 P.2d at 752, it nevertheless indicated that Territory v. Liliuokalani, 14 Haw. 88, 95 (1902) (holding that a similar reservation did not incorporate any public right to the use of certain shoreline areas included within a grant of land), does not necessarily dispose of the &quot;kuleana&quot; reservation as a source of additional gathering rights beyond HRS s 7-1. Id. at 12, 656 P.2d at 752. The word &quot;kuleana&quot; is defined as, inter alia, &quot;(r)ight, privilege, concern, responsibility, ... (or) small piece of property, as within an ahupua'a (.)&quot; Pukui &amp; Elbert, Hawaiian Dictionary 179 (2nd ed.1986). The word &quot;kanaka&quot; is defined, inter alia, as &quot;person, individual, ... subject, as of a chief; laborer, ... Hawaiian(.)&quot; Id. at 127.<BR><BR><A NAME="FN25"> FN25. These included the gathering of items not delineated in s 7-1 and the use of defendants' lands for spiritual and other purposes. Id. at 10 n. 4, 656 P.2d at 751 n. 4.<BR><BR><A NAME="FN26"> FN26. The elements of the common-law doctrine of custom, as set forth in 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries 76-78 (Sharwood ed. 1874) (hereafter Blackstone's Commentaries) are that the alleged custom must be, or have been: (1)exercised so long &quot;that the memory of man runneth not to the contrary&quot;-- according to subsequent commentators, &quot;long and general&quot; usage is sufficient, see, e.g., State ex rel Thornton v. Hay, 254 Or. 584, 596, 462 P.2d 671, 677 (Or.1969) (citing Professor Cooley's edition of the Commentaries); (2)without interruption (as to the right versus exercise thereof--i.e., continuous exercise is not required: &quot;the custom is not destroyed, though they do not use it for ten years; it only becomes more difficult to prove&quot;); (3)peaceable and free from dispute (i.e., exercised by consent); (4)reasonable--i.e., &quot;of artificial and legal reason, warranted by authority of law&quot; and appropriate to the land and the usages of the community; (5)certain; (6)obligatory or compulsory (when established); and (7)consistent with other customs.<BR><BR><A NAME="FN27"> FN27. Kalipi implicitly rejected the Hawaiian Trust Company's argument, which was based on language in Oni to the effect that the rights provided by the Act of August 6, 1850, were declarative of &quot;all the specific rights of the (hoa'a eina ) (except fishing rights) which should be held to prevail against the fee simple title of the konohiki(.)&quot; 2 Haw. at 95. The English version of the 1850 Act uses the term &quot;people,&quot; which was held to be synonymous with the word &quot;hoa'aeina.&quot; Id. at 96. The word &quot;hoa'aeina&quot; is defined as &quot;(t)enant, caretaker, as on a kuleana.&quot; Pukui &amp; Elbert, Hawaiian Dictionary 73 (2nd ed.1986). Meanwhile, the term &quot;tenant&quot; includes &quot;one who holds or possesses real estate or sometimes personal property ... by any kind of right(.)&quot; Webster's Third New Int'l Dictionary 2354 (1967 ed.) (emphasis added). Therefore, it is possible to construe the term &quot;tenant&quot; so as to incorporate the traditional native Hawaiian concept of a cultural link to the land. See McBryde Sugar Co. v. Robinson (McBryde II ), 55 Haw. 260, 289 n. 29, 517 P.2d 26, 42 n. 29, cert. denied, 417 U.S. 976 (1974) (Levinson, J., dissenting) (suggesting the need for comparative analysis of bilingual statutes because the English version is binding under HRS s 1-13 only when there is a &quot;radical or irreconcilable difference&quot; between the two versions); In re Ross, 8 Haw. 478, 480 (1892) (&quot;(t)he effort is always made to have (the two versions) exactly coincide, and the legal presumption is that they do). See also infra note 35 (discussing the definition of &quot;maka'aeinana&quot;). Nevertheless, we recognize that the Hawaiian language version of this Act actually uses the word &quot;kanaka.&quot; See supra note 24.<BR><BR><A NAME="FN28"> FN28. Immediately prior to its substantive analysis, the court in Kalipi summarily stated: Kalipi asserts that it has long been the practice of him and his family to travel the lands of the Defendants in order to gather indigenous agricultural products for use in accordance with traditional Hawaiian practices. ... A trial was had and the jury, by special verdict, determined that Kalipi had no such right. He now alleges numerous errors in the trial court's instructions to the jury and conduct of the trial. We find, for the reasons stated below, that none of the alleged errors warrants reversal. Kalipi, 66 Haw. at 3-4, 656 P.2d at 747 (emphases added). Nevertheless, the undisputed facts of the case reveal that the jury asked the trial court, &quot;May we please have the book with the 1892 reference to rights in question ... (i.e., Special Verdict Interrogatory Number 8)?&quot; The trial court responded by instructing the jury to disregard Special Verdict Interrogatory Number 8, which read: &quot;Did Hawaiian custom and usage as of 1892 include the right of a tenant of land in an (ahupua'a) to gather native products from his (ahupua'a)?&quot; See Kalipi's Opening Brief (No. 6957) at 14, 53-57; Hawaiian Trust's Answering Brief (No. 6957) at 52-54. Although Jury Instruction No. 21 already contained the 1892 reference (i.e., the text of HRS s 1-1), it is difficult to reconcile the trial court's response, or the appellate court's conclusion that there was no reversible error, with the implicit rejection of related Jury Instruction No. 19 in Kalipi. See supra note 27 &amp; accompanying text (rejecting an argument based on parallel language from Oni ). Jury Instruction No. 19 read: If you find that prior customs, usages and practices with respect to rights of kuleana owners have been superseded or abrogated by the enactment of (HRS) s 7-1 or its predecessor statutes, then you may find that the specific rights which are enumerated in (HRS) s 7-1 are all of the rights ... which Plaintiff may be entitled to exercise. Kalipi's Opening Brief (No. 6957) at 54 (emphasis added); Hawaiian Trust's Answering Brief (No. 6957) at 10 (emphasis added).<BR><BR><A NAME="FN29"> FN29. Kalipi focused on his status as a landowner merely as an attempt to show that he belonged to the class of persons intended to benefit under HRS s 7-1. See Kalipi's Opening Brief (No. 6957) at 28 (citing McBryde Sugar Co. v. Robinson, 54 Haw. 174, 192, 504 P.2d 1330, 1341 (defining &quot;people&quot; in HRS s 7-1 parenthetically as &quot;meaning owners of land&quot;), aff'd upon rehearing, 55 Haw. 260, 517 P.2d 26 (1973), appeal dismissed and cert. denied, 417 U.S. 962, cert. denied, 417 U.S. 976 (1974)). In other words, Kalipi claimed that the statute preserved access and gathering rights as an incident of ownership, so long as these rights were utilized for valid purposes associated with that particular site. Cf. Damon v. Tsutsui, 31 Haw. 678, 687 (1930); Smith v. Laamea, 29 Haw. 750, 755-56 (1928); Haalelea v. Montgomery, 2 Haw. 62, 71 (1858) (interpreting the term &quot;tenant&quot; so as to pass the common right of piscary to the grantee, through sale or other conveyance, as an appurtenance to the land). The claim in Oni involved a purported right of pasturage arising primarily from the claimant's status as a landowner. 2 Haw. at 90. To the extent that Oni's claims might have otherwise been based on ancient tenure, he abandoned these claims by entering into a special contract to provide labor for the konohiki in exchange for the right to pasture his horses. Id. at 91.<BR><BR><A NAME="FN30"> FN30. Before 1820 the foreigners who became residents of Hawai'i and who acquired land were predominantly of a humble status, commonly sailors. They conformed, in matters of property, to the customs of the country. After 1820 conditions changed.... Foreigners began to deal with their property as they would have done in their home countries; in doing so they sometimes violated Hawaiian customs. On the other hand, the native authorities treated the property of foreigners as they did that of their own subjects, thus creating much dissatisfaction.... (A)fter 1830 there were many cases arising out of alleged violations of the land and property rights of foreigners. Foreigners began to deny the right of the government to arbitrarily dispossess them of land or to prevent the transfer of property from one foreigner to another, and they appealed to their own governments for protection--successfully in some instances. Kuykendall at 137-38 (emphases added). &quot;Westerners entered ... land usage patterns (in Hawai'i when certain) ... foreign settlers were 'given' lands by the (K)ing or chiefs in return for services or merely out of traditional Hawaiian generosity.&quot; Levy, &quot;Native Hawaiian Land Rights,&quot; 63 Cal. L.Rev. 848, 850 (1975). See Keelikolani v. Robinson, 2 Haw. 514 (1862) (describing an 1827 agreement involving the grant of rights in a Honolulu wharf, which were provided in exchange for payment of half the expenses of maintaining the wharf and half of any proceeds collected therefrom). However, foreigners who received land in Hawai'i &quot;held it by the same precarious tenure as native subjects, simply at the pleasure of the (K)ing.&quot; Kuykendall at 73; see also 1 Privy Council Records 149 (1845-46) (&quot;we indeed did wish to give Foreigners lands ... but to the natives they are revertable &quot;) (emphasis added). <BR><BR><A NAME="FN31">FN31. Many of the King's advisors urged him to let them fire upon the invading forces, &quot;but the usual pacific course prevailed.&quot; Kuykendall, at 214. After Rear Admiral Richard Thomas rejected the provisional cession and reconfirmed Hawaiian sovereignty, &quot;(t)he King is said to have made use of the expression which became the motto of (Hawai'i), Ua mau ke ea o ka aina i ka pono ('The life of the land is preserved in righteousness').&quot; Id. at 220 n. 47.<BR><BR><A NAME="FN32"> FN32. The accompanying reply from the Privy Council, which was approved without dissent by the nation's legislators, reveals the government's rationale: &quot;formerly there were many difficulties, and the land was taken; it was not taken because the government was really in wrong, but because evil was sought. Here is the difficulty which ruins the government, viz: the complaint of foreign governments followed by the infliction of punishment.&quot; The Friend at 118 (emphasis added). Furthermore, regarding the sale of land to foreigners: it is by no means proper to sell land to aliens, nor is it proper to give them land, for the land belongs to Kamehameha III.; there is no chief over him. But we think it is proper to sell land to his Majesty's people, that they may have a home. But if these persons wish to sell their lands again, they cannot sell to aliens, for there is only one sovereign over those who hold the lands; but if the people wish to sell to those who have taken the oath of allegiance, they can do so, for Kamehameha III is over them.... There has not been much land sold, but foreigners have heretofore occupied lands through favor, without purchasing. It is better to sell. Id.<BR><BR><A NAME="FN33"> FN33. Specifically, the Land Commission was constrained to make its decisions regarding interests in land &quot;in accordance with the principles established by the civil code of this kingdom in regard to ... occupancy, ... (and) native usages in regard to landed tenures (.)&quot; Act of April 27, 1846, pt. I, ch. VII, art. IV, s 7; L. 1845-46, at 109, reprinted in 2 Revised Laws of Hawaii 2123 (1925).<BR><BR><A NAME="FN34"> FN34. The Act of November 7, 1846, &quot;Joint Resolutions on the Subject of Rights in Lands and the Leasing, Purchasing and Dividing of the Same,&quot; also codified certain gathering rights: The rights of the Hoaaina (sic) in the land consist of his own taro patches, and all other places which he himself cultivates for his own use; and if he wish to extend his cultivation on unoccupied parts, he has the right to do so. He has, also, rights in the grass land, if there be any under his care, and he may take grass for his own use or for sale, and may also take fuel and timber from the mountains for himself. He may also pasture his horse and cow and other animals on the land, but not in such numbers as to prevent the konohiki from pasturing his. He cannot make agreement with others for the pasturage of their animals without the consent of his konohiki, and the Minister of Interior. Id., s 1, reprinted in 2 Statute Laws of His Majesty Kamehameha III, King of the Hawaiian Islands 70 (1847) (hereafter L. 1847) (emphasis in original); cf. 3 Kent's Commentaries 404 (12th ed.1989) (discussing &quot;rights of common&quot;).<BR><BR><A NAME="FN35"> FN35. The word &quot;maka'aeinana&quot; is defined as &quot;(c)ommoner, populace, people in general; citizen, subject ... people that attend the land.&quot; Pukui &amp; Elbert, Hawaiian Dictionary 224 (2nd ed.1986). Our observations concerning the interpretation of &quot;hoa'aeina&quot; and &quot;tenant&quot; as incorporating traditional Hawaiian cultural attitudes toward the land, see supra note 27, are further supported by this legislative history. See also Kent, Treasury of Hawaiian Words 386 (1986) (defining &quot;maka'aeinana&quot; as, inter alia, the &quot;laboring class, which was resident on the land they worked and transferred with it when ownership changed&quot;). The bracketed phrase &quot;should they need them&quot; was inserted in the subsequent enactment of August 6, 1850, see L. 1850, at 202, along with the additional requirement that &quot;(t)hey shall also inform the landlord or his agent, and proceed with his consent.&quot; Id. However, these phrases were deleted the following year. See supra note 22.<BR><BR><A NAME="FN36"> FN36. See also In re Ashford, 50 Haw. 314, 440 P.2d 76 (1968) ( &quot;(Hawaiian) land laws are unique in that they are based upon ancient tradition, practice and usage.&quot;).<BR><BR><A NAME="FN37"> FN37. In Kalipi, the court added the following dictum after enunciating its balancing test for retention of HRS s 1-1 rights: &quot;(t)he relevant inquiry is ... whether the privileges which were permissibly or contractually exercised persisted to the point where it had evolved into an accepted part of the culture and whether these practices had continued without fundamentally violating the new system.&quot; Id. (emphases added). As indicated in the text above, we disapprove any additional requirements for the establishment of customary rights that might be inferred from this dictum.<BR><BR><A NAME="FN38"> FN38. The United States Supreme Court has also held that use of the hallucinogenic drug peyote is an unreasonable traditional practice, see Oregon v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872 (1990), as are attempts by religious practitioners to exclude all other uses, including timber harvesting, from sacred areas of the public lands. Lyng v. Northwest Cemetery Protective Ass'n, 485 U.S. 439 (1988).<BR><BR><A NAME="FN39"> FN39. The Zimring I court implicitly disapproved the &quot;time immemorial&quot; standard when it indicated that &quot;the Hawaiian usage mentioned in HRS s 1-1 is usage which predated November 25, 1892.&quot; 52 Haw. at 475, 479 P.2d at 204. The court in Oni also appears to have misconstrued other elements of the doctrine of custom by concluding that the custom urged in that case was &quot;so unreasonable, so uncertain, and so repugnant to the spirit of the present laws(.)&quot; 2 Haw. at 90. See supra note 26 (listing elements 4, 5, and 7). Contrary to the apparent understanding of the Oni court: (1) &quot;consistency&quot; is properly measured against other customs, not the spirit of the present laws; (2) a particular custom is &quot;certain&quot; if it is objectively defined and applied; certainty is not subjectively determined; and (3) &quot;reasonableness&quot; concerns the manner in which an otherwise valid customary right is exercised--in other words, even if an acceptable rationale cannot be assigned, the custom is still recognized as long as there is no &quot;good legal reason&quot; against it. See Blackstone's Commentaries at 76-78. Although the administrative record in this case only contains specific evidence of shrimp gathering as early as the 1920's, the unrefuted  testimony by members of PASH sufficiently established their interests in the SMA permit proceeding for our present purposes. See supra section  III.D. Having effectively curtailed PASH from developing a complete record, Nansay cannot complain about a procedural remand. However, Nansay is not precluded from raising the issue of standing on remand. See HRS s 91-9(c).<BR><BR><A NAME="FN40"> FN40. For the purposes of the HHCA, the term &quot; 'native Hawaiian' means any descendant of not less than one half part of the blood of the races inhabiting the Hawaiian islands previous to 1778(.)&quot; HHCA, 1920, s 201(a)(7); Act of July 9, 1921, c. 42, 42 Stat. 108, 108 (codified as amended at 48 U.S.C. note prec. s 491 (1988) and Haw. Const. art. XII, s 1), reprinted in 1 HRS 167, 167 (1985).<BR><BR><A NAME="FN41"> FN41. We do not decide the question whether descendants of citizens of the Kingdom of Hawai'i who did not inhabit the Hawaiian islands prior to 1778 may also assert customary and traditional rights under the &quot;ancient Hawaiian usage&quot; exception of HRS s 1-1. Furthermore, we expressly reserve comment on the question whether non-Hawaiian members of an &quot;'ohana&quot;-- meaning &quot;(f)amily, relative, kin group; ... extended family, clan(,)&quot; see Pukui &amp; Elbert, Hawaiian Dictionary 276 (2nd ed.1986)--may legitimately claim rights protected by article XII, section 7 of the state constitution and HRS s 1-1. Cf. Morton v. Mancari, 417 U.S. 535, 555 (1974) (&quot;As long as the special treatment can be tied rationally to the fulfillment of Congress' unique obligation toward the Indians, such legislative judgments will not be disturbed.&quot;).<BR><BR><A NAME="FN42"> FN42. The sovereign power to enforce the usufruct of lands may not be lost through inaction, because &quot;there cannot be adverse possession against the sovereign.&quot; State v.

The State's power to regulate the exercise of customarily and traditionally exercised Hawaiian rights, see Haw. Const. article XII, s 7, necessarily allows the State to permit development that interferes with such rights in certain circumstances--for example, where the preservation and protection of such rights would result in &quot;actual harm&quot; to the &quot;recognized interests of others.&quot; Kalipi, 66 Haw. at 12, 656 P.2d at 752. Nevertheless, the State is obligated to protect the reasonable exercise of customarily and traditionally exercised rights of Hawaiians to the extent feasible.<BR><BR><A NAME="FN44"> FN44. In accordance with HRS s 5-7.5(b), we are authorized to &quot;give consideration to the 'Aloha Spirit'.&quot; The Aloha Spirit &quot;was the working philosophy of native Hawaiians(;) ...

The majority in Bonelli mentioned the judicial taking theory, but did not rely upon it, in reversing the judgment of the Arizona Supreme Court. In addition, Bonelli was overruled on other grounds in Oregon v.

<P>
Federal Magistrate Barry Kurren yesterday declared Dennis "Bumpy" Kanahele a danger to the community and ordered him held without bail until his trial on charges of harboring a fugitive tax protester.
<P>
Kanahele, head of the self-<A HREF="proclamsum.html">proclaimed</A> Nation of Hawaii, is expected to stand trial in October.
<P>
His lawyer, Hayden Aluli, said he plans to appeal Kurren's decision Monday to U.S. District Judge Helen Gillmor.
<P>
Aluli and the dozens of Kanahele's followers who crowded the courtroom or waited outside insisted Kanahele poses no danger.
<P>
"The government is really overreacting... to the most outspoken Hawaiian nationalist," said Aluli.
<P>
He said Kanahele is willing to stand trial, offering to put up his house and supporters' money and property as well as abide by any court-imposed conditions for bail.
<P>
But Kurren cited his " record of disregard for the judicial system and the proper role of law enforcement officers" and concluded Kanahele is dangerous and is a "serious risk" not to show up for trial.
<P>
After a 3 1/2 -hour hearing, Kurren cited:
<P>
 *   Kanahele's claims that the state and federal governments are illegal and have no jurisdiction over his nation.
<P>
 *   Kanahele's conviction of threatening a police officer during a 1987 occupation of Makapuu Lighthouse. (Kanahele served 14 months in prison.)
<P>
 *   His failure to answer traffic citations in state court. Assistant Honolulu Police Chief Joe Aveiro testified that Kanahele reneged on an agreement to have his  supporters turn themselves in to clear up those cases,  many of which involve the use of homemade "Hawaiian Sovereign" license plates.
<P>
 *   The allegedly violent nature of the current charges against him.
<P>
 *   Recent notices and warrants accusing federal and state law officers and judges of committing "crimes against humanity," for which they will be sought out, arrested and brought to face "final judgment." Kurren said he received one of the notices and "I consider it a threat."
<P>
During the hearing, Assistant U.S. Attorney Les Osborne listed  allegations against Kanahele and members of his group. Under questioning by Osborne and Aluli, deputy marshal Charles Markle discussed unsubstantiated reports from unnamed sources that Kanahele's group is stockpiling weapons and preparing fortifications near its village on state land in Waimanalo.
<P>
Kanahele's supporters flatly denied those allegations. "There are no bunkers, no weapons," said Duke Sabedong, the Nation's justice minister.
<P>
Kurren said  he would not consider the testimony in deciding Kanahele's bail status, nor would he consider another allegation that Kanahele's group corresponded with "Independent Patriots," a Mainland group that's been linked to the Michigan Militia.
<P>
Kanahele, 41, was indicted and arrested at Honolulu Airport on Wednesday on three counts for allegedly interfering with efforts last year to arrest Hawaiian tax protester Nathan Brown. The most serious charge, harboring a fugitive, carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. Brown still is at large.
<P>
About 50 members of the Nation of Hawaii showed up at the Federal Building yesterday to hold protest signs during the morning rush hour. Their number grew to about 100, including supporters from other groups,  by the time the hearing began at 11:15.
<P>
Many wore colorful kihei - capes - or Sovereign Nation T-shirts.  Young men blew conch shells from time to time.
<P>
Protest demonstrations were also held at the state courthouses in Lihue, Kauai, and Wailuku, Maui, and at the Federal Building in Hilo.
<P>
No incidents were reported.
<P>
By prior agreement, only 31 supporters of Kanahele were allowed in Kurren's courtroom, filling the gallery.
<P>
Kanahele, dressed in a gray suit, did not speak in court.
<P>
After Kurren announced his ruling, Aluli asked that Kanahele be held in Honolulu until his appeal is heard, rather than be sent to a California detention facility, the usual practice.
<P>
Kurren agreed.
<P>
As Kanahele was led away, he motioned for his wife, Iwalani, who went over and embraced him.
<P>
Some of his followers began murmuring angrily over the outcome of the hearing, but they were quickly quieted by leaders such as the Rev. Nani Saffery, 76 , of Maui.
<P>
Saffery had offered to put up $50,000 of her family's real estate on Maui as bail for Kanahele.
<P>
Kanahele's followers went outside and spread the word to the crowd.
<P>
His elder sister, Mahilani Kanahele-Poepoe, who often leads prayers for the Nation, said efforts to educate people about Hawaiian sovereignty won't end with Kanahele's imprisonment.
<P>
"They're using him as a scapegoat.  ...We are not violent and my brother is not a violent person."
<P>
She and Sabedong accused federal authorities of trying to turn the Nation of Hawaii into "another Waco" - a reference to the siege of the Texas compound that ended with the deaths of more than 80 people in 1993, including cult leader David Koresh.

On Kauai, more than a dozen Nation of Hawaii protesters met early yesterday morning in Kapaa, and later at the state court building in Lihue, carrying upside-down Hawaiian flags and a banner.
<P>
They also waved signs that said "Free Bumpy," "Stop Harassing Hawaiians," and "U.S. and State Are Illegal."
<P>
"We're acting as a nation. We served the judges (with the warnings) and now they're getting wild," said Michael Grace.
<P>
Sondra Field-Grace said the Nation of Hawaii decided to hold yesterday's protests on separate islands, but representatives will join together  Aug. 18 for a Waikiki march under the slogan, "No more state in '98."
<P>
"If they think they have financial trouble now, wait until we shut off the flow of money to Waikiki," Michael Grace said.
<P>
Maui members of the Nation of Hawaii said they believe that the federal  action against Kanahele is aimed at silencing him as a leader of their movement as 30 of them picketed peacefully at the Wailuku courthouse.
<P>
"I guess this shows that the they're afraid of him," said Henry Kaililaau, a Kahului officer of the Nation of Hawaii. "The federal government felt they could take him and put him away."
<P>
It won't make a difference to the Nation, he said. He said the nation is led by a kupuna council that directs the spokesmen for the sovereignty group. 
<P>
"He is a high-profile leader. But he has to answer to them," Kaililaau said.
<P>
Ed Lindsey, a school counselor, said Kanahele and other leaders of the Nation of Hawaii made Hawaiians aware of their legal and cultural rights. The Nation claims the state of Hawaii was created illegally from the overthrow of Queen Liliuokalani in 1893.
<P>
"We won't go back being brainwashed so we believe that we must sell <A HREF="aloha.html">aloha</A> for money," Lindsey said.

<H2>UNITED NATIONS</H2>
<H1>DECLARATION ON THE GRANTING OF INDEPENDENCE TO COLONIAL COUNTRIES AND PEOPLES</H1>
<H2>Adopted by the United Nations General Assembly  on 14 December 1960</H2>
<H3>Resolution 1514 (XV)</H3>
</CENTER>
THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY,
<P>
     MINDFUL of the determination proclaimed by the peoples of the 
world in the Charter of the United Nations to reaffirm faith in 
fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human 
person, in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large 
and small and to promote social progress and better standards of 
life in larger freedom, 
<P>
     CONSCIOUS of the need for the creation of conditions of 
stability and well-being and peaceful and friendly relations based 
on respect for the principles of equal rights and self-
determination of all peoples, and of universal respect for, and 
observance of, human rights and fundamental freedoms for all 
without distinction as to race, sex, language or religion, 
<P>
     RECOGNIZING the passionate yearning for freedom in all 
dependent peoples and the decisive role of such peoples in the 
attainment of their independence, 
<P>
     AWARE of the increasing conflicts resulting from the denial 
of or impediments in the way of the freedom of such peoples, which 
constitute a serious threat to world peace, 
<P>
     CONSIDERING the important role of the United Nations in 
assisting the movement for independence in trust and non-self-governing territories, 
<P>
     RECOGNIZING that the peoples of the world ardently desire the 
end of colonialism in all its manifestations, 
<P>
     CONVINCED that the continued existence of colonialism 
prevents the development of international economic co-operation, 
impedes the social, cultural and economic development of dependent 
peoples and militates against the United Nations ideal of 
universal peace, 
<P>
     AFFIRMING that peoples may, for their own ends, freely 
dispose of their natural wealth and resources without prejudice to 
any obligations arising out of international economic co-
operation, based upon the principle of mutual benefit, and 
international law, 
<P>
     BELIEVING that the process of liberation is irresistible and 
irreversible and that, in order to avoid serious crises, an end 
must be put to colonialism and all practices of segregation and 
discrimination associated therewith, 
<P>
     WELCOMING the emergence in recent years of a large number of 
dependent territories into freedom and independence, and 
recognizing the increasingly powerful trends towards freedom in 
such territories which have not yet attained independence, 
<P>
     CONVINCED that all peoples have an inalienable right to 
complete freedom, the exercise of their sovereignty and the 
integrity of their national territory, 
<P>
     SOLEMNLY PROCLAIMS the necessity of bringing to a speedy and 
unconditional end colonialism in all its forms and manifestations; 
<P>
     And to this end 
<P>
     DECLARES that: 
<P>
<OL>
<LI>The subjection of peoples to alien subjugation, domination and exploitation constitutes a denial of fundamental human rights, is contrary to the Charter of the United Nations and is an impediment to the promotion of world peace and co-operation.
<P> 
<LI>All peoples have the right to self-determination; by virtue of that right they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development.
<P> 
<LI>Inadequacy of political, economic, social or educational preparedness should never serve as a pretext for delaying independence.
<P> 
<LI>All armed action or repressive measures of all kinds directed against dependent peoples shall cease in order to enable them to exercise peacefully and freely their right to complete independence, and the integrity of their national territory shall be respected.
<P> 
<LI>Immediate steps shall be taken, in trust and non-self-governing territories or all other territories which have not yet attained independence, to transfer all powers to the peoples of those territories, without any conditions or reservations, in accordance with their freely expressed will and desire, without any distinction as to race, creed or colour, in order to enable them to enjoy complete independence and freedom.
<P> 
<LI>Any attempt aimed at partial or total disruption of the national unity and the territorial integrity of a country is incompatible with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.
<P> 
<li>All States shall observe faithfully and strictly the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the present Declaration on the basis of equality, non-interference in the internal affairs of all States and respect for the sovereign rights of all peoples and their territorial integrity.

In fact, it spurred the U.S. Congress to pass <A HREF="publawsum.html">PL (Public Law) 103-150</A>, which attorney <A HREF="boylesum.html">Francis Boyle evaluated</A> this way:<P><BLOCKQUOTE>  "The USA is admitting that the invasion, overthrow, occupation, annexation, starting in 1893, violated all the <A HREF="treatylist.html">treaties</A>, violated basic norms of international law, and the <A HREF="http://www.law.emory.edu/FEDERAL/usconst/art-6.html">U.S. Constitution</A> ... the overthrow of a lawful government ....  Under international law when you have a violation of treaties of this magnitude, the <A HREF="gopher://gopher.undp.org:70/00/unearth/statute">World Court</A> has ruled that the only appropriate remedy is restitution.<P>  Now, the United States government, after 100 years, has finally and officially conceded, as a matter of United States law, that native Hawai'ian people have the right to restore the independent nation state that you had in 1893 when the United States government came and destroyed it.  And also, as a matter of international law, the native Hawai'ian people have the right to go out now and certainly <A HREF="proclamsum.html">proclaim the restoration of that state</A> ... this resolution clears up all these matters ....  You don't need to petition Congress to do it.  Congress has given you everything you need right here to do it, if that's what you want to do.  The <A HREF="gopher://gopher.undp.org:70/11/unearth">United Nations Charter</A> provides the rest of the authority to do it. <P>Congress is effectively conceding now that the [Hawaiian statehood] vote is meaningless, as a matter of international law and United States domestic law.  So you're not bound by it.  Rather, I'm suggesting you're now free to determine your own fate pursuant to the principle of self-determination."</BLOCKQUOTE><H3>A Bevy of Kings and Queens</H3>  During the 100 years of occupation, the line of descent from King Kamehameha and Queen Lili'uokalani has become blurred and contested.  There are likewise many factions within the Hawai'ian sovereignty movement:  Some build kingdoms in the air and write constitutions in the clouds; some want U.N. recognition for the Nation of Hawai'i before laying the foundations for their own sovereignty; others want cultural sovereignty and reparations for the Hawai'ian people - yet wish to remain impaired U.S. citizens; still others want the "haoles" to go home.<P>  Finally, there are those who claim divine right to the throne - and would establish too many kingdoms to count.  Since recognition of personal sovereignty runs high here, and many recognize that we are all kings and queens, there is little popular support for restoring a monarchy.  Besides, the islands were a constitutional republic before the overthrow, not a monarchy as many believe.<P>  Pu'uhonua "Bumpy" Kanahele and the Nation of Hawai'i have claimed <A HREF="puuhonua.html">64 acres on Oahu</A> as nation land, and <A HREF="political_prisoner.html">Bumpy spent four months in federal prison</A> as a direct result of this claim, although the alleged offense was that he had harbored a tax protester.  Previously a member of the Ohana Council, he claimed to be the sovereign for the Nation of Hawai'i but soon withdrew from that position in favor of a smaller role.<P><EM>Web Editor's note: Kanahele was selected by a council of approximately 200 Hawaiian kupuna (elders) in March 1994 to serve as Head of State for transition of the Nation of Hawaii, and has retained this role ever since.  Kanahele has never claimed to be "the sovereign" for Hawaii, and as the transition proceeds the position of Head of State is open for others to fill according to the will of the kupuna and the Constitution.</EM><P>  The Nation of Hawai'i wrote a preliminary <A HREF="constitution.html">constitution</A> in 1994, presenting it to a mixed council of native Hawai'ians at <A HREF="palace.html">Iolani Palace</A> &amp; White Sands Beach on January 22, 1995.  This was a significant and historic time when the Hawai'ian people united and deepened their commitment to self-government.  The draft of the constitution was inconsistent; seemed to have been written not on the bedrock of knowledge and experience, but in the clouds of good intentions; and was not based on the organic law of the Kingdom of Hawai'i, common law or the law of nations.  Still, it marked the beginning of the true sovereignty movement in Hawai'i.  The framers' intentions were good, and amendments can be considered during the constitutional convention.<P>  Regarding the sham charges against Bumpy, so far the Nation of Hawai'i itself has failed to recognize that he remains an impaired U.S. citizen and that he entered an Article I court and asked for recognition of his sovereignty using a bar-licensed attorney.  That's a winning formula for a losing court battle: impaired status, wrong venue for recognition of sovereign status and transferring one's power of attorney to a foreign agent of the established power structure.<P>  On the other hand, Bumpy and the Nation of Hawai'i have inspired many others to found the<A HREF="http://www.pixi.com/~kingdom/"> Interim Provisional Government Council</A> and begin restoring the constitutional Kingdom of Hawai'i.  They deserve much honor and blessing for their contribution.<P>  Similarly, Mililani Trask, Prime Minister, and her group, <A HREF="http://kalahui.org/">Ka Lahui Hawai'i</A>, deny that any part of the <I>de facto</I> <A HREF="http://www.hawaii.gov/">State of Hawai'i</A> or its <A HREF="http://hoohana.aloha.net/~oha/">Office of Hawai'ian Affairs (OHA)</A> is legal.  Their focus has been on "cultural sovereignty," returning the land to the Hawai'ian people and "haole go home."  Yet, when asked about her citizenship Trask claims to be an American, has retained her impaired U.S. citizenship and is a bar-licensed attorney.  Like Bumpy, she must be sovereign unto herself before she can be sovereign for the Hawai'ians.<P>  <A HREF="http://kalahui.org/">Ka Lahui Hawai'i</A>, with more than 20,000 members, wants land and financial retribution for native Hawai'ians, much like the "nation within a nation" status of the indigenous North Americans, but is playing "democracy roulette" to get it.  A democracy can only offer superficial sovereignty within the <I>de facto</I> international system; it is co-dependent with the very power structure that has committed crimes against the Hawai'ians for more than a century.<P>  There are many other kings &amp; queens besides Bumpy (Lorenzo, Kabuli, etc.) who have made claims to the monarchy.  While these may be valid through bloodlines, the need to maintain order requires that Hawai'ians follow the <I>de jure</I> process established in the Constitution for the Kingdom of Hawai'i for naming a successor.<P>  Of course, anyone willing to take political, economic and legal responsibility for one's own life can be (and is) a king or queen unto oneself.  As inherent sovereign individuals, we can choose to repatriate into a republican form of government already established or create our own.  Presuming to assert sovereignty over someone else, however, without a <I>de jure</I> process, would simply be one more overthrow of legitimate self-government.<H3>Keeping Tabs on the Movement</H3>  In 1993, the Hawaiian Sovereignty Advisory Commission (HSAC) was created to advise the State of Hawai'i governor's office.  HSAC submitted legislation to "acknowledge and recognize the unique status the indigenous Hawai'ian people bear to the State of Hawai'i and to facilitate the efforts of indigenous Hawai'ians to be governed by an indigenous sovereign nation of their own choosing."  (If this sounds innocent, remember that the U.S. Congress admitted in <A HREF="publawsum.html">PL 103-150</A> that the "<A HREF="http://www.hawaii.gov/">State of Hawai'i</A>" has no legality whatsoever.)<P>  The legislature responded by converting HSAC into an "elections" commission and directed it to hold a plebiscite to see whether the indigenous people wish to restore a nation.  Yet, sovereignty is not an issue to be determined by vote; one's decision about whether to repatriate does not hang on "majority rule."  That would be the ultimate mockery, making sovereignty dependent on "democracy."<P>  Since the plebiscite is not binding upon the State, it is nothing more than a straw vote, a poll to inform those in power which way the wind is blowing regarding the various sovereignty options.  They consider this information crucial so they can maintain control and the status quo.  Of course they made sure to run it through the legislature so the taxpayers could pick up the tab.<P>  Although the vote will have no official impact on the direction of Hawai'ian sovereignty, it will generate much commotion and dissension among the groups.  Several sovereignty groups believe that the "elections commission's" ties to the State of Hawai'i have tainted it and that it will interfere with sovereignty efforts.<H3>The <I>De Facto</I> "<A HREF="http://www.hawaii.gov/">State of Hawai'i</A>" and the <A HREF="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">United States Government</A></H3>  Governments are instituted among men to secure the people's rights, not to take them away - at least <I>de jure</I> ones are.  By contrast, the <I>de facto</I> State of Hawai'i must be understood to be nothing more than a political subdivision and administrative agent of the federal United States government.<P>  The truth is, there never was nor ever could be a sovereign State of Hawai'i as part of the Union.  First, this "State" was not created on equal footing with the Union states; instead it was given a "special grant" of Statehood.<P>  Second, before it purportedly "entered" the Union, <A HREF="http://www.afcomm.com/afc">the federal government had declared bankruptcy and moved into a state of national emergency, suspending its constitution indefinitely</A>.  New states cannot be admitted into a constitutional republic which is in that condition.<P>  Third, there is no common border between Hawai'i and the states of the Union, so all of its external commerce is international, not interstate.  Since no admiralty/maritime law exists under "the law of the land" in the united states of America and only the federal government has admiralty jurisdiction on the high seas, Hawai'i would fall exclusively under federal law and admiralty/maritime jurisdiction like the other U.S. territories.<P>  Fourth, Hawai'i was not lawfully annexed in 1898, merely placed under military occupation and rule by a Joint Resolution of Congress.  This highly irregular "annexation" violated international law.<P>  Fifth, the "Republic of Hawai'i" was a fraud imposed on the peaceful people of the kingdom by wealthy landowners who wanted to control commerce in the islands.  The Republic of Hawai'i was created to prepare Hawai'ians for annexation and second-class citizenship.  Many documented irregularities regarding Hawai'i are being brought to the attention of the sovereign people.  The Kingdom of Hawai'i was usurped, not lawfully annexed as a U.S. territory nor admitted as a lawful, sovereign state.<P>  Due to admitted acts of insurgency, rebellion and the overthrow of the constitutional Kingdom of Hawai'i, the <I>de facto</I> State government is under continued impairment and is properly considered irregular. The legislative and judicial branches of government, already well established prior to the invasion, were not overthrown.  Only the executive branch was overthrown and replaced with a territorial government under the federal United States.  Today, the <I>de facto</I> State of Hawai'i is a legal fiction and fabrication, null and void <I>ab initio</I> ["from the beginning"], as documented by the admissions and confessions of <A HREF="publawsum.html">PL 103-150</A>.  The <A HREF="http://www.hawaii.gov/">State of Hawai'i</A> no longer exists.<H3>The Road to Sovereignty</H3>  Quoting further from <A HREF="boyleall.html">Francis Boyle's legal opinion on PL 103-150</A>:<P><BLOCKQUOTE>The <A HREF="http://www.hawaii.gov/">State of Hawai'i</A>, the <A HREF="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">federal government</A>, are ... the civilian arms of the military occupation authority, and ... do not have sovereign powers.  The sovereignty resides in the people. ... An independent sovereign nation state is one way a people who are threatened with extermination by means of <A HREF="genocide.html">genocide</A> can attempt to protect themselves ... What is the best way to protect the existence of your people? ... to <A HREF="proclamsum.html">proclaim</A> your own state, [to restore the inherent sovereignty of the people] and then ultimately seek international recognition and finally <A HREF="gopher://gopher.undp.org:70/">United Nations</A> membership...</BLOCKQUOTE><P>  Boyle's comments are correct until the very last phrase; unfortunately he is too close to the <A HREF="gopher://gopher.undp.org:70/">U.N.</A> for Hawai'ians' comfort.  This kingdom does not need the <A HREF="gopher://gopher.undp.org:70/">U.N.</A>'s seal of approval on its sovereignty. <H3>Indigenous Sovereigns Around the World</H3>  The laws and principles of sovereignty are universal; they arise from Natural Law as expressed in the Law of Nations.  These can be further developed to meet the challenges of the modern colonial world which is still on a collision course with traditional cultures.  The indigenous peoples are beginning to organize effectively and fight back against this continuing encroachment. <P>  The colonial powers have systematically bankrupted themselves - politically, economically, and morally - so the time is ripe for the sovereign nations of the world to gain the upper hand.  If they will form strategic alliances and diplomatic relationships, they can bring forth quite another "world order" from the remains of the old, dying system.<P><HR><P>Johnny Liberty operates the Cascadian Resource Center in Eugene, Oregon.

<P>
A federal jury will resume deliberations Tuesday (sic - Monday) in the trial of Hawaiian sovereignty activist Dennis "Bumpy" Kanahele on charges that he harbored a fugitive.
<P>
The jury of seven women and five men spent almost four hours deliberating yesterday afternoon, then went home for the weekend.
<P>
Earlier yesterday, in closing arguments, Kanahele's attorney, Hayden Aluli, painted the case as a historic political trial: an "overreaction to the Hawaiian sovereignty movement" and to "the most outspoken, and direct-action, prominent leader of a Hawaiian sovereignty organization."
<P>
The prosecutor, assistant U.S. attorney Les Osborne, disagreed.  "This case is all about disrespect for the law, disrespect for authority and disrespect for the safety of others," Osborne said.
<P>
Kanahele is charged with harboring tax protester Nathan Brown and with thwarting two 1994 attempts to arrest Brown on a bench warrant that was issued after he failed to show up to server a 6-1/2 year prison sentence for his tax fraud conviction.  Brown remains at large.
<P>
Kanahele, in custody without bail, contends he was trying to educate police in the first incident and was acting in self-defense to protect his property in the second incident.
<P>
Kanahele, 41, a high-school drop-out, is "head of state" of the self-proclaimed Nation of Hawaii.  Kanahele and his supporters have<A HREF="proclamsum.html"> declared their independence</A> from the state and federal governments, which they say are illegally occupying the Islands.
<P>
Throughout the trial, Judge Helen Gillmor rejected Aluli's attempts to bring <A HREF="sovereignty.html">sovereignty</A> into the case.  Yesterday , she instructed the jurors that the "<A HREF="publawsum.html">apology bill</A>" cannot be used as a justification or a defense of Kanahele's actions.
<P>
Nonetheless, Aluli spent part of his closing statement reading passages from <A HREF="publawsum.html">Public Law 103-150</A>, the congressional resolution apologizing for the U.S. role in the 1893 overthrow of the Hawaiian kingdom.
<P>
Osborne called the overthrow a "great disaster," but said the people of Hawaii voted in 1959 to join the United State and brought themselves under its laws. <EM>(Web editor's note: see <A HREF="art73.html">Article 73</A> for part of the reason why this statement is untrue...)</EM>
<P>
"This is not a political trial," said Osborne.  "It's about helping a felon go free."  
<P>
All 82 seats in the gallery of Gillmor's courtroom were filled for yesterday's closing arguments, most by Kanahele's relatives and supporters.

<H1>Kanahele lands in traffic court</H1>
<H2>3-year-old case ends with fines</H2>

<P>
Despite his lawyer's strong protests, Hawaiian sovereignty activist Dennis "Bumpy" Kanahele went to trail on traffic charges yesterday during a break in his federal trial.
<P>
In the end, Honolulu District judge James Dannenberg acquitted Kanahele of two charges, convicted him of three and fashioned a sentence that could result in Kanahele paying only $10 in fines.
<P>
Nonetheless, his lawyer Hayden Aluli called the trail a "railroad" job and a "travesty of justice" and vowed to appeal the convictions as a matter of principle.
<P>
Aluli asked for a postponement because he is representing Kanahele in his federal trail of felony charges accusing him of harboring a fugitive, Nathan Brown, a Hawaiian tax protester, in early 1994.  Aluli said he didn't have time to prepare for the traffic case.
<P>
But Dannenberg said Kanahele's traffic case - now three years old - had been postponed earlier and that Aluli know that the case was set for yesterday.
<P>
Aluli also asked for postponement of the defense portion until after the federal trail so that the defense could line up witnesses.
<P>
Dannenberg denied the request, indicating that the witnesses - experts on international law and Hawaiian sovereignty issues - would not provide relevant testimony to the traffic case.
<P>
"This is not a political arena," the judge said.
<P>
Kanahele was driving a truck with "Nation of Hawaii" license plates when he was stopped and arrested on Kalanianaole Highway near Aina Haina in 1992.
<P>
Kanahele is head of the Nation of Hawaii sovereignty group.  He and his followers believe the U.S. and state governments are illegal and have no jurisdiction to hear criminal cases against them.
<P>
Colin Lau, the city prosecutor, objected to any postponement.
"The judge really bent over backwards to accommodate the defendant, and when they tried to push him a little further, he stopped and made them go to trial," Lau said.
<P>
Kanahele's federal trial started lasts week and will resume today.

It's not that Mr. Kanahelewould engage in violent acts, but he has a lot of followers.&quot; <BR><BR>Assistant U.S. Attorney Les Osborne had opposed any release, arguing thathe remained a danger to the community and probably would not appear forany court appearances. <BR><BR>He cited Kanahele's three felony convictions, including one in 1988 forthreatening a police officer with a gun, and said Kanahele verbally threatenedpolice as recently as June. <BR><BR>Osborne also said two local federal judges had ruled that Kanahele was adanger and that the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals had upheld the rulings.<BR><BR>&quot;There is no change here,&quot; said Osborne, who relied on previousrulings and transcripts to oppose bail. <BR><BR>The government has charged Kanahele with allegedly obstructing law enforcementagents last year and for harboring federal fugitive Nathan Brown, who isevading a 78-month sentence for tax fraud. The first trial ended in a hungjury, and the government will retry him. <BR><BR>But Aluli called numerous witnesses, including psychiatrists, religiousleaders and sovereignty leaders. Some opposed Kanahele's approach but describedhim as a nonviolent man who deserved bail. <BR><BR>A. Frenchy DeSota, an Office of Hawaiian Affairs Trustee, arrived in a wheelchairand walked with a cane across the courtroom to testify. <BR><BR>&quot;I swear to you, Judge, with everything I hold sacred and decent --including the lives of my grandchildren -- he will not run,&quot; DeSotosaid. &quot;That's why I'm here in my wheelchair.&quot; <BR><BR>DeSota also said that she &quot;wanted to slap his head&quot; when Kanaheleoccupied the Makapuu Lighthouse area in 1987 and pulled a gun on a policeofficer. But she said he had improved himself since then and become peaceful.<BR><BR>Kinau Boyd Kamali'i, also an OHA trustee, said she didn't agree with allof Kanahele's beliefs, but described him as compassionate. <BR><BR>&quot;Some might take that as violent,&quot; she said. &quot;But Mr. Kanahelewill never be a danger to this community.&quot; <BR><BR>She offered $2,000 to enable Kanahele to transfer to the half-way housetoday. Ezra had said the government did not have enough money to pay foranother slot, but said Kanahele could move immediately if he could pay forit. <BR><BR>Aluli, who praised Ezra for his fairness after his ruling, initially triedto postpone Kanahele's detention hearing when he learned Ezra would presideover it. <BR><BR>He said Ezra may have perceived Kanahele as a threat because the Nationof Hawaii had served him with a &quot;public notice,&quot; alleging crimesagainst the nation. <BR><BR>&quot;I don't intimidate that easily,&quot; he said to Aluli. &quot;I don'tfeel threatened. I feel I can give a fair and impartial hearing.&quot; <BR><BR>Kanahele, who asked Ezra if he could &quot;speak straight&quot; with him,said he was scared of him at first. <BR><BR>&quot;You're known as a hanging judge,&quot; Kanahele said, adding thathe thought the federal government was setting him up when he got Ezra forthe detention hearing. <BR><BR>Kanahele also told Ezra that he believed he had been put in prison &quot;tounderstand that I've been too aggressive. It took a break to understandthat I got to work within the system. This is from the heart.&quot; <BR><BR>He said he would return for his second trial, scheduled for Jan. 3. <BR><BR>Aluli said he would file a motion to dismiss charges against Kanahele, claimingdouble jeopardy. <BR><BR><IMG SRC="hrcolor2.gif" WIDTH="648" HEIGHT="11" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN=bottom><BR><A HREF="index.html"><IMG SRC="flagsm.gif" ALIGN=middle BORDER="0" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="19" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A>Return to the <A HREF="index.html">Nationof Hawai`i Home Page</A>, the <A HREF="news.html">News Articles Index</A>,or the <A HREF="political_prisoner.html">Political Prisoner page</A></BODY></HTML>

<H1>THE BIRTH OF A NATION IN PUUHONUA</H1>

<H2>It includes all Hawaii, Kanahele says</H2>

<FONT SIZE=+3>W</FONT>AIMANALO --
Two dozen sheds and huts fringe a sloping wedge of grass at the foot of the Koolaus. Beyond them, amid ohia trees, taro grows in lo`i, the restored paddies.
<P>
For Dennis "Bumpy" Kanahele and his followers, this is Puuhonua Village - the seed of the <A HREF="proclamsum.html">self-proclaimed</A> Nation of Hawaii.  Kanahele's nation has adopted a constitution, claimed the right to try a federal fugitive and embarked on an education campaign that blends radical politics, right-wing economics, Hawaiian discontent and Kanahele's charismatic, populist appeal.
<P>
Kanahele, the nation's head of state, envisions it encompassing all of the <A HREF="archip.html">Hawaiian islands</A>, prospering on international trade and banking, free of "illegal military occupation" by federal and state governments, where Native Hawaiians would have far more political and economic clout than they do now.
<P>
"We're going for the whole nine yards," says Kanahele.  "We've already go the land.  We're occupying the whole archipelago."
<P>
Not all Hawaiian activists share his particular vision.  
<P>
Mililani Trask, head of the rival sovereignty organization Ka Lahui Hawai`i, says: "Everything Bumpy's done has been detrimental to sovereignty.  His approach has been to basically tap into the system by using sovereignty as an excuse to avoid responsibility."
<P>
But Kanahele says, "This is justice.  Justice is sweet."
<P>
It's been a busy year, Kanahele says.
<P>
In addition to building the village, they've changed the organization's name at least twice and tweaked the establishment's nose.
<P>
And now Kanahele spends much of his time delivering educational talks, here and on Neighbor Islands.  One session was last weekend, on his 41st birthday.
<P>
The high school dropout went to prison on weapons charges stemming from the 1987 occupation of Makapuu lighthouse (he had a previous record that included conviction for burglarizing cars as a youth).  Now he deftly wields a marker and microphone.
<P>
About 120 people sat listening under plastic canopies on the village lawn for three hours.
<P>
One of them, Charlene Kilaulani of Waipahu, said she has relatives involved in the nation and she was here to learn more. "We want our `aina back.  That's what it is," she said.
<P>
Her husband, Murphy Kilaulani, said "The wrong that was committed: I like know why nobody got arrested for that, yet they arrest our people."  
<P>
Kanahele stressed the need for Hawaiians to educate themselves and spread the word.
<P>
He explained how the nation seeks to restore political and economic power Hawaiians lost in the 1893 overthrow of Queen Lili`uokalani.  And he described how the Nation of Hawaii is already an independent nation.
<P>
His points during his lecture included:
<P>
<LI> The <A HREF="publawsum.html">1993 congressional resolution apologizing for the U.S. role in the overthrow</A> "was not an apology.  It was a confession to a crime...
<P>
"They apologizing because they know it's wrong.  They know it's just as bad of a holocaust as they had in Germany.  Same thing.  You know what?  We never know we was dying.  Take away your land and the ocean, and your food and supplements, we eat Spam, ham, corned beef."
<P>
<LI> Hawaii's "multi-cultural society was built at the expense of Hawaiians."  But the nation is committed to peace, and its constitution lets non-Hawaiians be citizens.  "We cannot kick everybody off," Kanahele said in a interview, although those who won't follow the new nation's laws will have to leave.  People won't have to give up their personal property or their homes, Kanahele said, but "nobody owns the land, not even the Hawaiian people.  But we were the caretakers."
<P>
<LI> Japan and the United States conspired "to keep the Hawaiians American." His evidence: Elimination of Hawaii from a <A HREF="art73.html">1946 U.N. list of "non-self-governing territories"</A> and remarks in December 1959 by the Japanese delegate at a U.N. meeting, acknowledging Alaska and Hawaii statehood and noting that people of Japanese origin had contributed to Hawaii. "So now you know why the Japanese control our government. That's what the 442nd (Regimental Combat Team) was all about," said Kanahele.
<P>
U.S. Senator Daniel Inouye, a 442nd veteran, later said: "I can't be responsible for what everyone says, but that is the beauty of this country.  The First Amendment gives you the right, even if the statements may be less than correct, even if the statements do malign or cause grief."
<P>
<LI> The Federal Reserve system controls the United States and most of its wealth.
<P>
Kanahele's assistants passed silver coins and "silver certificate" dollar bills through the audience while other distributed an article by the <A HREF="http://www.afcomm.com/afc/afchome.html">American Freedom Coalition</A>, a self-described "national grassroots coalition promoting positive family values and a strong national defense."  The coalition has been linked to the ultra-conservative Rev. Sun Myung Moon.
<P>
Kanahele shares the coalition's view that the Federal Reserve system has bankrupted America.  "Why would we want to be part of one broke country?" asked Kanahele.
<P>
<LI> Kanahele said President Kennedy was assassinated when he tried to return the country to the gold and silver standard.  Inouye said in response, "He must know something about history that the rest of America is not aware of."
<P>
<LI> Kanahele says he's no longer proposing casino gambling, and the nation would pare tourism way back.  There's more to be made - he says $600 billion a year - through tariffs on trade that would have to pass through the nation's 200 mile exclusive economic zone.
<P>
<LI> Members of the nation are "taking the law to the limit."  When they're cited by police (for invalid license plates, for example) or go to court, they invoke their citizenship in the nation.
<P>
Kanahele said two members of the nation, including attorney general Maltbie Napoleon, were sentenced for traffic violations by Circuit Judge Marie Milks to perform community service with the Nation of Hawaii.  Milks last week said she considered the nation a "valid recipient" for community service. [<A HREF="traffic.html">see related article</A>]
<P>
Today, the nation has roughly 60 acres of state land. Kahahele and his followers agreed to lease it in June 1994, ending their occupation of Kaupo Beach Park near Makapuu.  The lease still hasn't been signed because of disagreements over terms.
<P>
Duke Sabedong surveys the village and says, "I love it."
<P>
His home was built last month, a sturdy 16-by-16-foot wooden cube.
<P>
"I get house now.  Can live off the land," says Sabedong, the nation's justice minister.
<P>
Cars or trucks are parked next to most of the houses.  Half of the vehicles - including Kanahele's late-model Cadillac - have state license plates; the rest have yellow "SOVEREIGN" plates.
<P>
In the largest building are the nation's offices.  Computers grace some desks.  A huge photocopying machine stands against one wall of the main office.  Kanahele, who lives elsewhere in Waimanalo, has an office of his own.
<P>
Estimates of the village's population run from 60 to 80.  Kanahele says the nation has 2,400 names on its computer data base, but more have to be punched in.  He estimates the nation has "around 7,000" citizens.
<P>
Village children have classes and outings.  Kanahele says they'll probably keep the kids out of the state school system next year.
<P>
The residents pool their money and resources.  Much of it is donated, says Kanahele.  Some residents work outside; some receive welfare and other government subsidies.
<P>
"Why not?" Kanahele said.  "It's owed to them."

<H1>Nation of Hawaii traffic offender gets unique deal</H1>
<H2>Maltbie Napoleon was allowed to perform his 200 hours of community service with the sovereignty group</H2>

<P>
A member of the Nation of Hawaii convicted of driving without no-fault insurance was ordered to perform 200 hours of community service, and was allowed to fulfill his sentence with the sovereignty group.
<P>
Circuit Judge Marie Milks said she felt the sentence imposed last year on Maltbie Napoleon was appropriate, even though group members have openly defied traffic laws and contend the state's judicial system has no authority over them.
<P>
She sid the idea of letting him do the community service with the Nation of Hawaii emerged during negotiations leading to a plea agreement with prosecutors, with Napoleon respectful stating he would continue his demand for a jury trial unless the recommendation was included.
<P>
"You take all the advantages and disadvantages, and one of the major disadvantages was, without resolution of the case, a jury trial would have been generated at some cost to the state," Milks said, describing herself as comfortable with the outcome.
<P>
But the city prosecutor's office made clear that the recommendation was entirely the judge's decision.
<P>
"If you are asking whether I think his sentence was a punishment, my answer is no," Prosecutor Keith Kaneshiro said in a statement.
<P>
Napoleon, attorney general with the group, was cited for five misdemeanor traffic violations, including driving without a seat belt or registration, in July 1990.
<P>
He pleaded no-contest to the insurance charge in July 1994, and prosecutors dropped the other counts against him.
<P>
According to court papers, he was fined $3,000, which was converted into community service.  The papers include the notation that the service "can be done with the Hawaiian nation" and must be completed within a year.
<P>
The sentencing was raised during a seminar Saturday at the Nation of Hawaii's headquarters in Waimanalo.
<P>
Napoleon, 43, said he spent the time "building our country".
<P>
He said his request to be assigned to his group for the community service was an attempt to set a precedent, and that two other members subsequently got similar sentences.
<P>
"That's a recognition of the Nation of Hawaii," he said.
<P>
When asked if he felt there was no penalty because he was doing work he would have done normally, Napoleon said, "There wasn't really a crime anyway.  If the state is illegal, then they're imposing illegal sentences. If it's illegal, do we have to participate?  No.  You don't have to participate with an illegal entity."
<P>
The group argues that a <A HREF="publawsum.html">U.S. Apology</A> in 1993 for the overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom 100 years earlier is a confession to a crime, and that the state and federal governments consequently are here illegally.  It ratified its own <A HREF="constitution.html">constitution</A> earlier this year.  Courts have not upheld its claims.
<P>
Milks said she was not recognizing the group in a legal or diplomatic sense, but considered it a "valid recipient" for community service.  The judge added she was impressed with and respected the depth of Napoleon's beliefs, and noted that prosecutors did not object to her recommendation.
<P>
"There are people involved, right, so you're serving people of the nation," she said.  "I say fine, whether they're people of the nation of people of the state of Hawaii, you're going to serve people, and I'll honor that request.  That basically is what it boiled down to."
<P>
Although Milks issued two bench warrants in the case when Napoleon failed to appear in court, she said he was admonished and eventually respected the judicial process enough to reach a compromise and enter his plea.
<P>
"Now, if he gets into trouble again, that would be for someone else to decide, another judge will have to deal with it and all the circumstances that comes with it," she said.
<P>
"But as far as the experience I had, everything was well-handled by both the state and the defendant."
<P>
The Judiciary confirmed that part-time District Judge Stanley Ling disqualified himself from hearing a Nation of Hawaii traffic case after being served with papers from the groups in April.
<P>
"It was the first time that the judge received such papers, and he thought it cited him personally, so he did recuse himself from that one particular case." said spokeswoman Marsha Kitagawa.
<P>
"Since then, he has not recused himself from any cases involving defendants claiming to be members of the Nation of Hawaii.
<P>
Sharon Miyashiro, administrative director of the courts, said judges are handling similar cases whether they are named in the papers or not.
<P>
Ling was one of the judges summoned by the Nation of Hawaii to appear before its supreme court to explain his "war crimes" against the Hawaiian people, according to Napoleon.
<P>
A bench warrant later was issued when he failed to appear.
<P>
"Mr. Ling has acknowledged the Hawaii government and shown the proper conduct by excusing himself from the bench in matters concerning Kanaka Maoli nationals," Napoleon wrote in a May letter to the Honolulu Police Department.
<P>
"Please inform all departments and personnel of Mr. Ling's conduct involving citizens of the Hawaii government."

<H2>The sovereignty leader had to take an oath to uphold city, state and U.S. laws

<P>Dennis "Bumpy" Kanahele, head of the sovereignty group Nation of Hawaii, has become a member of the Waimanalo Neighborhood Board.
<P>"It's more important to help the community than really anything else," said Kanahele, noting he sees no conflict between his efforts to establish a sovereign Hawaiian nation and working under city government.
<P>"If everybody was paying attention to our (Nation of Hawaii) <A HREF="constitution.html#art17">constitution</A>, it allows us to do that anyway," he said.
<P>Under terms of his release while awaiting retrial on obstruction of justice charges, Kanahele cannot visit any Waimanalo location other than his home.
<P>But the federal court is allowing him to serve on the neighborhood board, and "I've got to report back to let them know," he said.
<P>"I was also elected to the board of directors of the Waimanalo Health Clinic," and the federal court gave him permission to attend those meetings too, he said.
<P>Greg Field, Waimanalo Neighborhood Board chairman, and other members say they're glad to have him aboard. He was appointed Monday. 
<P>"He was willing to take an oath to uphold the laws and the constitution of the city and state and the United States government," Field said. "That's all that we ask."
<P>Board members are happy he's willing to devote time to make the community better, Field said. 
<P>"He seems willing to do that, and I think let's give him a chance."
<P>Kanahele is <A HREF="political_prisoner.html">accused</A> of obstructing justice for harboring Nathan Brown, a Hawaiian sovereignty activist convicted on federal income tax violations and sentenced to six years and five months in prison. An arrest warrant was issued in November 1993 after Brown failed to show up to serve his sentence.
<P>Kanahele also is accused of foiling two attempts to arrest Brown in 1994. Kanahele's first trial ended in a mistrial, and the retrial has been postponed until the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rules on whether retrying Kanahele constitutes double jeopardy.
<P>Kanahele was held without bail for three months but was released to a halfway house after the mistrial.
<P>Rolf Nordahl, a Kanahele friend and supporter, said Kanahele has made neighbor island visits after requesting and receiving permission.

<H1>Nation of Hawaii warns U.S., state judges</H1>
<H2>Kanahele group cites 'war crimes'</H2>

Advertiser Staff Writer
<P>
The Nation of Hawaii has delivered "public notices" to federal and state judges accusing them of "war crimes" against the Hawaiian people.
<P>
Four Nation of Hawaii "peace officers," clad in military-style black uniforms complete with Sam Browne belts, handed the documents to the federal court clerk's office last week.
<P>
The group's "Supreme Court" has also been issuing subpoenas for police officers, state judges and prosecutors pursuing traffic citations against nation members whose cars have "Hawaiian Sovereign Nation" license plates instead of state tags.
<P>
The Nation of Hawaii claims that the kingdom of Hawaii was illegally overthrown and that the state and federal governments are illegally occupying Hawaii.  The nation <A HREF="proclamsum.html">proclaimed its independence</A> from Hawaii in January 1994, and <A HREF="conprom.html">adopted a constitution</A> this year.
<P> 
Senior U.S. District Judge Samuel King, who was among the officials who received the public notice, said it is a crime to threaten federal judges.  King said he considered the notice to be a threat.
<P>
"Anytime the use language (such as that), I think it should be taken seriously," said King, who is part Hawaiian.  "The implication is that it's attempting to inhibit the judge's free exercise of his own judgment."
<P>
King said he turned the notice over to federal law enforcement authorities.  
<P>
But Dennis "Bumpy" Kanahele, head of the Nation of Hawaii, said: "It's not a threat -- it's just being informed of the law.  If we can educate them, then they know they'd be personally liable."
<P>
Each two-page notice says the addressee and others "have made yourselves personally liable for ...war crimes against humanity."  The alleged "crimes" are not specified.
<P>
"Your acts show contempt towards the Kanaka Maoli People and the international obligations of the world...
<P>
"In the future, you shall be sought out, arrested and imprisoned, to be brought before an international criminal tribunal to answer for your participation in crimes of Apartheid and Genocide.
<P>
"There will be no appeal.
<P>
"Judgment will be final," says the notice, signed by Maltbie Napoleon, attorney general of the Nation of Hawaii.
<P>
Copies of the notice were addressed to Hawaii's federal district judges, the U.S. Attorney's Office, the FBI, the U.S. Marshal's Service and the Internal Revenue Service here.  Some state officials also received similar notices.
<P>
Napoleon said the notices were prompted by recent events surrounding Jack Gonzales.
<P>
Gonzales, the former executive director of the state Campaign Spending Commission, was convicted in federal court in Washington state for helping to defraud the Hawaii labor organization Unity House of $10 million.  He failed to show up for sentencing in Tacoma earlier this month and eluded federal authorities while claiming immunity from federal jurisdiction as a member of the Nation of Hawaii.
<P>
Gonzales finally turned himself in, but he remains the consul general and foreign minister of the Nation, Napoleon said yesterday.
<P>
Napoleon said the nation has also issued about 100 subpoenas and bench warrants since December in the traffic citation cases.  Napoleon and Kanahele would not say yesterday how many vehicles have the Nation's "Hawaiian Sovereign Nation" license plates.
<P>
Kanahele said, "By stopping our people on the road, they're breaking the law ... We're only trying to exercise our rights."
<P>
Napoleon said, "We have to address these problems.  The only way to do it is to bring them in our court and have a record that can be brought our before an international court."
<P>
Marsha Kitagawa, judiciary spokeswoman, said all five Hawaiian Supreme Court justices and a number of other judges were named in the papers.
<P>
The papers were given to the judiciary's staff attorney and sent to the Attorney General's Office, she said.
<P>
That office in looking into the documents, said Deputy Attorney General Ted Baker.
<P>
"Our position at this time is that although these folks disavow U.S. citizenship, we recognize their First Amendment right to express their beliefs," he said.  "Should that expression become conduct that violates criminal law, they will be prosecuted."
<P>
But the Nation of Hawaii's campaign was lauded by A'o Pohaku Rodenhurst, leader of the Nation of Ku, a sovereignty organization with a spiritual theme.
<P>
"They are testing the law to whatever level they are able to," said Rodenhurst.  She and some of her followers also occupied part of Makapuu last year and were willingly arrested when the state cleared the park.
<P>
"Who protects Hawaiians against illegal jurisdiction?  If the state is illegal they have every right (to prosecute state officials).  Maybe people think that's a joke, but I don't."

<TITLE>NEW HAWAI`I CONSTITUTION RATIFIED</TITLE>

<H3>NATION OF HAWAI`I RATIFIES NEW CONSTITUTION</H3>
</HEAD>
<P>
<A HREF="#images"><BLINK><STRONG>Images</STRONG></BLINK></A> of the day
<P>
On Monday, January 16, 1995, a new <A HREF="constitution.html">Constitution</A> was signed and ratified for the independent and sovereign Nation of Hawai`i.  
<P>
Supporters of the Nation, including many Kupuna (elders), gathered at the front steps of the <A HREF="palace.html>`Iolani Palace</A>, the seat of the Hawaiian government, in a Celebration of Restoration.
<P>
The first to sign the Constitution was the <A HREF="puuport.gif">Head of State, Pu`uhonua Kanahele</A>, who was selected by the Kupuna in March, 1994, to guide the Nation to independence. After an address to the crowd calling for forgiveness and <A HREF="aloha.html">Aloha</A>, he placed his signature to the page.  As a symbol of Peace in the Pacific, the pen used was the same pen used by Japanese Emperor Hirohito to sign the surrender that ended World War II.
<P>
Following the Head of State, each Island Po`o (Head) gave an address and signed the document, and then each island's delegation presented a <A HREF="kauaiki.html">cultural ho`okupu</A> (gift) and added their names.  Finally, the signing was opened to the general public as music written by Queen Lili`uokalani played.  A <A HREF="puupress.html">press conference</A> was held, in which <A HREF="puuport.gif">Pu`uhonua Kanahele</A> placed the state of Hawai`i on notice to end its illegal occupation of the <A HREF="archip.html">Hawaiian Archipelago</A> and end the crimes against humanity continuously being committed upon the Hawaiian people.
<P>
The new Constitution is the result of a year of work since the <A HREF="proclamsum.html">Proclamation of Restoration of the Independence of the Sovereign Nation State of Hawai`i</A>, which was also delivered at <A HREF="palace.html>`Iolani Palace</A> on January 16, 1994.  This followed the United States' official <A HREF="publawsum.html>apology</A> to Hawai`i in 1993, for the illegal overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawai`i in 1893.  
<P>
Delegates representing districts from all the main islands created an organic document to restore the inherent sovereignty of na Kanaka Maoli, the Native Hawaiian people, while at the same time including those inhabitants of Hawai`i from all nationalities who call Hawai`i home, so that they can become citizens, enjoy protection of their rights, and participate in the new government.  
<P>
As the backdrop to the event, the <A HREF="palace.html>`Iolani Palace</A> was draped in black bunting, in commemoration of the arrest of Hawai`i's last sovereign, Her Majesty Queen Lili`uokalani, exactly one hundred years ago, by the illegitimate government which had overthrown her two years prior, for attempting to promulgate a new constitution.  At the time of her arrest, documents calling for a new constitution, containing signatures of two-thirds of the registered voters of Hawai`i, were stolen from her home by the chief justice of the illegal government.
<P>
After her overthrow, Queen Lili`uokalani appealed to the good faith and justice of the American people, that their government would right the wrongs that had been done and reinstate her as the legitimate constitutional sovereign of Hawai`i.  She was not to see Hawai`i's independence restored in her lifetime, but she prophesied that it would be restored after one hundred years.  For those present on this day, the event was a highly emotional one, as the dreams and prophesies of the Queen were fulfilled with the ratification of a new <A HREF="constitution.html">Constitution</A> for the independent and sovereign Nation of Hawai`i.
<P>
Now the Nation of Hawai`i will continue to develop comprehensive educational programs for the people of Hawai`i, develop its legislative, executive, and judicial infrastructure, begin to implement home rule on each of the islands, engage the illegitimate state of Hawai`i in a smooth and peaceful transition, and seek formal international recognition to rejoin the world community of nations.

<H2>Defense calls its witnesses today</H2>

<P>
The prosecution presented its last two witnesses against Hawaiian activist Dennis "Bumpy" Kanahele yesterday, then rested its case.
<P>
The defense begins calling witnesses this morning in the trial of Kanahele, head of the self-proclaimed Nation of Hawaii, who's charged with harboring a federal fugitive.
<P>
Gordon Kaaihue, head of the nation's "peace force," is expected to take the stand today.  He is a co-defendant on one of the three charges against Kanahele.
<P>
The charges stem from two failed attempts to arrest convicted tax protester Nathan Brown in 1994.
<P>
Yesterday, Deputy Marshal Charles Markle testified about a March 16, 1994 incident at Kanahele's Waimanalo home.  Markle and Deputy Marshal Lawrence Tice almost caught Brown, but he escaped when Kanahele blocked Tice's entry into the fenced yard.
<P>
Honolulu police Sgt. Ryan Borges testified about his July 1987 arrest of Kanahele at Makapuu Lighthouse.  Kanahele was the leader of the group of Hawaiians who occupied the former Coast Guard station and were evicted by police and the state.
<P>
Kanahele was convicted of terroristic threatening in that case for allegedly pointing a shotgun at Borges and served 14 months in prison.  But, by order of District Judge Helen Gillmor, neither the weapon nor the conviction were mentioned during the questioning of Borges.
<P>
Kanahele has said the 1987 case convinced him to pledge himself to non-violence as he tries to establish his independent nation, which claims the U.S. and state governments are illegally occupying the Islands.
<P>
After Markle testified and the jury was excused, Kanahele hugged Markle, and said, "He, I know, you trying, brah."
<P>
And Kanahele clasped Borges' hand at one break in the proceedings.
<P>
Having called four witnesses, Assistant U.S. Attorney Les Osborne rested his case after Borges testified.
<P>
Kanahele's attorney, Hayden Aluli and Kaaihue's attorney, Sidney Quintal, asked Gillmor to acquit their clients, saying the government had failed to prove their charges.
<P>
Gillmor denied the requests.

The federal jury in Dennis "Bumpy" Kanahele's trial was leaning toward convicting him on two felony charges, one of the jurors said yesterday.
<P>
But another said the split was unclear because the panel didn't know the results of their many votes during the deliberations that spanned 2 1/2 days.
<P>
Matthew Allard, 19, of Makiki, a supermarket clerk, said the panel was in favor of acquitting Kanahele and Gordon Kaaihue on a misdemeanor count of interfering with a police officer, but was deadlocked over convicting Kanahele on his other two counts.
<P>
Allard said only two of three jurors were in favor of acquitting Kanahele.  "They just didn't think the prosecution proved its case," he said.
<P>
Juror Kevin "Chubs" Watanabe said he was not aware of how the votes stood, but "it wasn't just one or two" people holding out against a majority.
<P>
Watanabe, co-owner of an auto-detailing business, said there was sometimes heated disagreement among the jurors on the second and third counts.  
<P>
At one point, he said, discussion in the jury room got so heated that "they had to tell us shut up." 
<P>
Allard said further deliberations would not have helped reach a unanimous decision on those two counts.
<P>
Watanabe, who's part-Hawaiian, and Allard, who's not, said ethnicity played no part in the jury's deliberations.  Nor did Hawaiian sovereignty issues, added Watanabe.
<P>
"Whenever sovereignty came up, it was shut down immediately," he said.
<P>
Most of the jurors declined to talk with reporters after Gillmor thanked them, declared a mistrial without explanation and sent them home.
<P>
"We're drained, completely drained.  I guess we can say that," one woman juror said.

HIFF strives to showcase Hawai'i not only as a place to see movies, but as a place to make them.  In this article, Robert Watts provides a fascinating view of filmmaking in the Islands from two radically different perspectives: Raiders of the Lost Ark, the Stephen Spielberg mega-hit, and an as-yet-unreleased video documentary by and about <A HREF="#nation">The Nation of Hawai'i</A>.

<H2>Raiders of the Lost Ark</H2>

<FONT SIZE=+3>I</FONT>t was in the fall of 1979 that I first came to Hawai'i. I was looking for locations for Raiders of the Lost Ark. At that time the script called for not only the South American jungle location, but also a location set in China. The Chinese location required the exterior of a palace owned by a warlord who had half of the head of the staff of Ra, the other half of which was in the possession of Marion in her bar in Nepal.
<P>
 In trying not to shoot in too many countries, it was decided that we should attempt to find the South American jungle and the Chinese palace in the same place. I had been told that Honolulu had a Chinatown, and was hopeful of finding a Chinese temple that would pass as the exterior of the Palace.
<P>
 Unfortunately, my information was incorrect and try as we would we were unable to find anything that would represent the exterior of the palace. We were much luckier with the South American locations and found everything we needed on the island of Kaua'i. We decided to continue west to Hong Kong to look for the Chinese palace in the hope that we could still shoot the other location in Hawai'i. In Hong Kong it rained continually as we picked our way through endless Chinese temples, the courtyards of which we covered in offerings of food - everything from fruit and vegetables to cooked suckling pigs. It was a fruitless task, none of the temples were grand enough, or else they were surrounded by modern buildings, which did not work for our 1936 period.
<P>
 Where to go next? We heard that the island of Penang in Malaysia had a large Chinese population and also jungle and a river. It was with some relief that we soared away from rain- soaked Hong Kong and into the sunshine above the clouds.
<P>
 In Penang we had luck. We first found a Chinese temple that would pass very well for the warlord's palace. The jungle and river locations were more difficult to find, but eventually we did find locations for these, which were passable. We much regretted that the scenery was nowhere near as spectacular as Kaua'i, but budgets being what they are we could not justify the considerable cost of shooting in two places. So Penang it was going to be, provided Steven Spielberg approved of the photos of the chosen locations.
<P>
 We flew from Penang to Singapore and caught the next flight to London. Shortly after our return to London the news came that the Chinese sequence had been cut from the script, so the locations on Kaua'i became firm. Great relief all around.
<P>
 We shot the Kaua'i sequences last in the schedule and had to move the crew, which was to join the Hawaiian technicians on Kaua'i, from Tunisia in North Africa, no simple task. I came a day ahead to see that all was prepared, but the day the crew traveled the Canadian air traffic controllers decided to call a one-day strike and I found myself with the crew scattered all over North America. The last crew member arrived at nearly midnight the day before shooting ... whew!
<P>
 We shot the trek to the exterior of the South American temple and Indy's flight from the Hovito Indians a few miles up the Hulai'a River from Nawiliwili. The Hovito Indians were played by local Kauaians who were persuaded to have their hair cut in an Indian pudding-basin style. The Waco biplane came from the U.S. mainland. The mountain in the opening shot was Anahola. The exterior of the temple was in a pitlike location about ten miles from Lihu'e, off the road in the direction of Po'ipu. This pit with a pool and waterfall was filled with mosquitos, and despite spraying they made our lives a misery. Thank goodness for insect repellant! The final scene of the airplane flying away was done at sunset over the Menehune fishponds in Nawiliwili.
<P>
 The shooting went well and we found the local Hawaiian crew to be excellent and the cooperation on Kaua'i first-rate. On the last day of shooting we had a wrap lu'au, which was novel for all of us and which we all enjoyed before returning to our various homes. What a wonderful place to spend the last week of shooting - a bonus for the frequent practice of shooting the first scenes of a film last. I so enjoyed the island of Kaua'i that I took my family there on vacation several times over the next few years.
<A NAME="nation">
<H2>The Nation of Hawai'i</H2>

<FONT SIZE=+3>I</FONT>n February of 1994 I visited the island of Maui for the first time. It was a short trip of just four days but it was to be significant. On our second day my partner and I were invited to stay at a house in Kipahulu to meet Dennis "Bumpy" Kanahele, now known as Pu'uhonua Kanahale. Bumpy is, as we learned, the leader of the Nation of Hawai'i, a group seeking independence for Hawai'i from the United States.
<P>
 I was completely ignorant of the recent history of Hawai'i, and sat up most of the night while Bumpy explained about the events that had occurred at the turn of the century, when Queen Liliuokalani had been imprisoned in <A HREF="palace.html">'Iolani Palace</A> and Hawai'i had been seized by the United States. He explained about the <A HREF="publawsum.html">apology bill</A>, signed by President Clinton, which in effect apologized for the takeover of the Hawaiian Islands by United States. We in turn explained that we were heading a company that would make entertainment in all media, with the express purpose of providing product that was not only entertaining, but would also speak to people in an empowering manner. We talked nearly all night and before we parted company the next morning, Bumpy said that he hoped we would base our company in Hawai'i, as we seemed to share many of the same ideals. We had not thought of basing in Hawaii, but it started a train of thought that has culminated in our seriously looking at this possibility.
<P>
 I returned to Hawai'i nine months later, in November 1994. I came for a week but ended up staying for just over two months. I spent the first ten days on Maui and then went to 0'ahu to visit the Nation at its new home. The group had been given a lease on some land above Waimanalo and in a very short space of time had built some basic housing, although some members were still living in tents. I was to spend several weeks living in the village and learning more about the Nation. I spent Christmas and New Year's Eve with the Nation and had a wonderful time.
<P>
 Everyone was very busy in the first days in January as the Nation was due to <A HREF="conprom.html">sign its Constitution on January 16</A>. At this time we decided to shoot a documentary around the signing of the Constitution. When there is no money, this is easier said than done. We would have to shoot mainly on Hi-8 video, but we did have a visitor from the Mainland who had a 16mm camera and film, which we reserved for the beauty shots. It struck me that this was absolutely the other end of the scale from the last time I had shot in Hawai'i.
<P>
 I visited <A HREF="palace.html">'Iolani Palace</A> some days prior to the 16th to work out camera positions. I had hoped to get one camera on the balcony of the palace, but even with the aid of the Hawai'i film commission this was not possible. The film commission did get me permission to shoot from the balcony opposite <A HREF="palace.html">'Iolani Palace</A> so that we could shoot over the statue of Kamehameha toward the palace. We managed to muster six Hi-8 cameras together with the 16mm camera so we would have plenty of varied angles and good coverage. We got all the camera people together the day before the event and planned everyone's positions. The high angle that we had hoped to shoot from the palace balcony we decided to get from the top of the truck that was bringing in the stage from which speeches would be made and on which the Constitution would be signed.
<P>
 We all got up before dawn on January 16 before there was any light in the sky. We went first to the mausoleum, where the kings and queens of Hawai'i are buried or remembered. It was raining quite hard when we arrived at the chapel where a service was to take place. We did not shoot in the chapel and after the moving service we emerged to find the sun coming through even though it was still raining. The mixture of sun and rain delivered the most beautiful double rainbow over the graveyard. We exclaimed at its beauty, but the Hawaiians were not surprised to see it, stating quite simply that the Gods were pleased.
<P>
 By the time we arrived at the palace it was a beautiful sunny day. We positioned the cameras as the Nation's officials prepared for the day's celebrations. The camera people were now on their own to cover the events of the day. What a day it was, with sacred chanting, dances and speeches.
<P>
 There was a special section of seating for the kupuna in front of the stage. The day's events culminated in the signing of the Constitution. When everyone had signed, we packed up and returned to the Nation's village in Waimanalo, where a joyful party began that lasted far into the night.
<P>
 The footage is now safely stored, and although a roughcut has been assembled we still have to find the money to complete the postproduction.
<P>
 After the excitement of the Constitution day filming I sat and reflected on the extreme contrast between the two productions I had worked on in Hawai'i. One was a major studio location with all the necessary financing to deliver everything that was needed. The other was a shoestring affair that was scraped together with no money. I reckoned that the true story of Hawai'i, from its legendary inception to the present-day independence movement deserves the same first-class treatment given to a major feature film. But that is in the future, the not too distant future.

<H3>Epilogue</H3>

 Hawai'i sits in the center of a ring of fire and according to Hawaiian legend, the Goddess Pele is in charge. Within a few hours of the Nation declaring independence on January 16, 1994, a massive earthquake hit Los Angeles. Within a few minutes of the Nation signing its constitution on January 16, 1995, a massive earthquake hit Kobe in Japan.

So Ithink now I can understand conventional politics and that kind of stuffa little bit more clear.&quot; <BR><BR>Kanahele made the comments outside the federal courthouse after being freedfrom prison, where he had been held without bail since Aug. 2 followinghis arrest for harboring and impeding the apprehension of a tax protesterwho was a fugitive. <BR><BR>His case was heard by a jury last month but a mistrial was declared, andU.S. District Judge David Ezra on Monday ruled that the 41-year-old mancan be released to the Miller Hale halfway house on Punchbowl pending anew trial in January. <BR><BR>Among those who spoke in support of the release were members of the Officeof Hawaiian Affairs and Ka Lahui Hawai'i, two groups which have been criticalof Kanahele's clashes with authority and which have been criticized by him.<BR><BR>Kanahele - who said he had more time to read the Bible in prison and proclaimedhe had &quot;seen miracles&quot; during his trial - expressed gratitudefor their support and said he believed a foundation for cooperation hadbeen laid. <BR><BR>&quot;I think it was more for the fact of the Hawaiians than just Bumpy,&quot;he said. &quot;Because it's not about Bumby. I was just an instrument inprobably getting us all put together, and I think that's what's going tohappen.&quot; <BR><BR>He said, &quot;we're going to surprise everybody&quot; at a news conferencetoday. <BR><BR>Kanahele added he would abide by a court order barring him from going tothe Nation of Hawaii's headquarters in Waimanalo, even though it makes hisheart &quot;sore.&quot; <BR><BR>OHA land officer Linda Delaney, who loaned $1,000 to help pay for the firstmonth of Kanahele's stay at the halfway house, said an &quot;incrediblething&quot; arising from the case is the recognition by Hawaiian groupsthat they have more binding them together than dividing them. <BR><BR>Kanahele signed a $50,000 signature bond and emerged from the courthousewearing blue jeans and a purple T-shirt with his group's log on it. <BR><BR>He was greeted by about two dozen supporters and family members who broughtHawaiian food and leis, among them one made of ohia, which Blossom Feiteira,the Nation's acting head of state, said is the only plant which can survivea lava flow and thus represents rejuvenation and new growth to the Hawaiianpeople. <BR><BR>He appeared relaxed and good-natured while checking in at the halfway house,a tidy, compact four-story apartment house with lanias that overlook thefreeway and downtown. He is free to go out during the day but must returnat night: <BR><BR>&quot;I'm just happy to be out,&quot; he said, speaking from behind a lockedwrought-iron fence.<BR><BR><IMG SRC="hrcolor2.gif" WIDTH="648" HEIGHT="11" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN=bottom><BR><A HREF="index.html"><IMG SRC="flagsm.gif" ALIGN=middle BORDER="0" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="19" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A>Return to the <A HREF="index.html">Nationof Hawai`i Home Page</A>, the <A HREF="news.html">News Articles Index</A>,or the <A HREF="political_prisoner.html">Political Prisoner page</A><BR><BR></BODY></HTML>

In 1893, the legitimate monarchy of Hawaii was illegally
              overthrown in an effort to placate the gluttonous
demands of corporate sugar barons. The American press
tried to justify the coup with the racist argument that
Native Hawaiians could not govern themselves. Never
mind the countless centuries of evidence to the contrary. 
<P>
In 1993, the U.S. Senate formally <A HREF="publawsum.html">apologized</A> for this
atrocity. But Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., dissented,
realizing that the logical consequence of the apology
would be independence. 
<P>
In 1994, Native Hawaiians <A HREF="proclamsum.html">declared independence</A> and
wrote their own <A HREF="constitution.html">constitution</A>. Now Hawaiian sovereignty
activist Dennis "Bumpy" Kanahele is in prison. He
explicitly calls for a peaceful and gradual transition to
home rule. 
<P>
Furthermore, he rules out the expulsion of Asian and
European populations as antithetical to the Hawaiian
tradition of "<A HREF="aloha.html">aloha</A>." 
<P>
The chauvinist hypocrisy of the capitalist media has
never been more blatant. The Wall Street propaganda
machine is mollycoddling white power terrorists Timothy
McVeigh and Randy Weaver, while turning a deaf ear to
peace-loving activists like Kanahele. 
<P>
Kanahele was arrested in August on trumped-up
charges of harboring a tax resister. A federal magistrate
denied him bail, calling him a danger to the community.
Federal cops have repeatedly tried to portray the
Hawaiian pacifist as violent, to no avail. 
<P>
Government repression of indigenous activists is nothing
new. Three Puerto Rican Nationalists have been illegally
kept in solitary confinement since the 1970s. When
Lakota Sioux agitator Leonard Peltier declared that all
political boundaries from Alaska to Cape Horn are
meaningless, he was charged with treason. When
President Clinton said the same thing, it was called
NAFTA. 
<P>
Defending Kanahele is in the interest of U.S. workers
because occupied Hawaii serves America's racist rulers
as a stepping stone for genocidal imperialist adventures
in East Asia. These invasions result in sweatshop
colonies, like the puppet regime in Korea, which drive
down our wages. 
<P>
It's time to end the Vasco de Gama era. Let's get the U.S.
and France out of Polynesia and padlock the Pentagon.

Therefore, we request an immediate postponement of application approval and petition for both private and public meetings to be held in Hawaii on this matter.</B></EM><BR><BR><BR><STRONG>Summary of the Reasons for this Protest</STRONG><BR><BR>FRB regulations and the Bank Holding Company Act (12 USC 1842) set forth criteria which the FRB shall consider when acting on an application for merger.  The reasons for this protest are directly applicable to these considerations and are as follows:<BR><BR>  <EM><STRONG>Legal Considerations</STRONG></EM><BR><EM>Compliance with laws and regulations is a precondition to approval. </EM><BR>A) We have reason to believe that First Hawaiian is in noncompliance with the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act and federal antitrust laws (Clayton &amp; Sherman Acts).<BR><BR>  <EM><STRONG>Convenience and Needs</STRONG></EM><BR><EM>The FRB shall take into account the extent to which the merger will affect the convenience and needs of the communities to be served.</EM><BR>B) If approved as currently proposed, First Hawaiian's application would adversely affect the convenience and needs of certain communities served, including the following communities within the Honolulu MSA: Aliamanu, Haleiwa, Kalihi, Kapalama, Kaukonahua, Maili, Mililani, Mokauea, Nanakuli, Niulii, Puuloa, Waiakamilo, Waianae, Waimanalo and Waipahu. Additionally, the convenience and needs of Native Hawaiian leaseholders on Hawaiian Homelands would also be adversely affected.<BR><BR><BR><STRONG>Specific Objectionable Matters</STRONG><BR>As an applicant for acquisition approval to the FRB, First Hawaiian has <EM>not</EM> adequately addressed the following matters:<BR><BR>A) The poor performance of the applicant in serving the convenience and needs of low and moderate income or minority persons.  (CRA assessment factors 5, 6, 8, 9, 10 &amp; 11)<BR><BR>B) How the proposed interstate expansion will improve the applicant's service to communities which are currently underserved.  (CRA assessment factors 5, 6, 8, 9, 10 &amp; 11)<BR><BR>C) Any plans the applicant might have to remedy discriminatory practices. (CRA assessment factors 5, 6 &amp; 10)<BR><BR>D) The fact that First Hawaiian is in noncompliance with a consent decree reached with the U.S. Department of Justice in 1991 regarding federal antitrust laws.  (CRA assessment factors 4 &amp; 7)<BR><BR>E) Adverse effects that the proposed merger would have on the current account holders and borrowers of First Hawaiian, West One, Pacific One, Idaho First and U.S. Bank.  (CRA assessment factors 5, 6, 8, 9, 10 &amp; 11)<BR><BR>F) The current practice by First Hawaiian of employing a disproportionately low number of decision makers from particular minority groups.<BR>(CRA assessment factors 1, 2 &amp; 4)<BR><BR>G) The current practice by First Hawaiian of conducting outreach/marketing which fails to target particular minority groups.<BR>(CRA assessment factors 1, 2 &amp; 4)<BR><BR><BR><STRONG>Facts Supporting the Protest</STRONG><BR><BR>On December 4, 1995, First Hawaiian, Inc. (Nasdaq: FHWN), based in Honolulu, HI, and U.S. Bancorp (Nasdaq: USBC) announced the signing of a definitive agreement for First Hawaiian, Inc. to purchase 30 branches that U.S. Bancorp and West One Bancorp (Nasdaq: WEST) are divesting in connection with their proposed merger.<BR><BR>First Hawaiian Inc. will pay a deposit premium of 5.25% on the approximately $720 million in total deposits.  First Hawaiian will also acquire approximately $457 million in loans, plus certain other assets, at book value.  Based on current deposits, the deposit premium will be approximately $38 million.  The cash transaction will be accounted for as a purchase.<BR><BR>First Hawaiian is purchasing all but one branch included in the original U.S. Bancorp/West One Bancorp divestiture package including 25 in Oregon, 4 in Washington and 1 in Idaho.<BR><BR>U.S. Bancorp announced an agreement, on Oct. 6, 1995, to divest the branches in order to satisfy anti-trust concerns and as a condition of regulatory approval of their pending merger with West One Bancorp. Twenty-nine of the branches are presently owned by West One Bancorp. Two branches, in Washington, are owned by U.S. Bancorp.<BR><BR>The announced acquisitions in the Pacific Northwest were the second Mainland expansion for First Hawaiian last year.  In April, First Hawaiian Bank opened a auto dealer finance operation in southern California.<BR><BR>Because the lending practices of First Hawaiian have been inadequate in the communities it presently serves, the proposed interstate expansion in question has caused significant concern, particularly in the Native Hawaiian and Filipino community.  The services provided by First Hawaiian to persons of Hawaiian and Filipino ethnicity have historically been very minimal compared to services provided to those of Japanese and Caucasian ethnicity.<BR><BR>Hawaii's unique ethnic makeup, in particular, requires an underwriting policy that is sensitive to the local culture.  As Native Hawaiians and Filipinos are included in the HMDA report under &quot;Asian/Pacific Islander,&quot; banks in Hawaii are able to maintain seemingly good &quot;minority&quot; lending records while systematically discriminating against specific ethnic groups. This practice is carried out despite the fact that in many cases these groups are an equal or better credit risk.  <EM><STRONG>In 1994, the Office of Thrift Supervision recognized this problem and ordered Bank of America Hawaii to break down the Asian/Pacific Islander category and collect data on Japanese, Chinese, Filipinos, Hawaiians and other Asian/Pacific Islanders individually.</STRONG></EM><BR><BR>A study of First Hawaiian's lending practices for 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993 &amp; 1994 was undertaken to determine whether the mortgage lending activity of First Hawaiian during 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993 &amp; 1994 differed in any significant way between census tracts which are predominantly Native Hawaiian and/or Filipino, and census tracts which are predominantly Japanese and/or Caucasian.<BR><BR>The loan data from First Hawaiian that were analyzed are <EM>theoretically</EM> available to the public under the provisions of the federal Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (&quot;HMDA&quot;).  Demographic data were obtained from the 1990 U.S. Census.  The initial findings of this study are now available and its results have substantiated our initial concerns:<BR><BR>During 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993 &amp; 1994, the geographic pattern of Conventional Mortgage &amp; Mortgage Refinancing lending activity of First Hawaiian within Metropolitan Statistical Area (&quot;MSA&quot;): 3320 - Honolulu, Hawaii exhibited significant differences between the three census tracts which are most predominantly Native Hawaiian and/or Filipino, and the three census tracts which are most predominantly Japanese and/or Caucasian.<BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Native Hawaiian and/or Filipino Census Tracts</EM></STRONG><PRE>Kalihi Kai          77.8% v 14%    Tract 60Ulana Street        74%   v 19.3%  Tract 64.01Nanakuli-Lualualei  73.8% v 14%    Tract 96.01</PRE><BR><STRONG><EM>Japanese and/or Caucasian Census Tracts</EM></STRONG><PRE>Waikiki Beach       89.1% v 2.9%   Tract 19.01Lanikai             86.5% v 7.9%   Tract 112.02Kapiolani Park      84.3% v 5%     Tract 17</PRE><BR>The <EM>Number of Conventional Mortgage Loans Originated </EM>in Japanese and/or Caucasian Census Tracts was  23 times the number originated in Native Hawaiian and/or Filipino Census Tracts. This difference is highly significant.<BR><BR>The <EM>Number of Mortgage Refinancing Loans Originated</EM> in Japanese and/or Caucasian Census Tracts was 5.125 times the number originated in Native Hawaiian/Filipino Census Tracts. This difference is highly significant.<BR><BR>For all loan categories analyzed (Conventional Mortgage &amp; Mortgage Refinancing), the Japanese and/or Caucasian Census Tracts received 23.86 total &quot;loans originated&quot; per 1,000 households while the Native Hawaiian and/or Filipino Census Tracts received 2.69 total &quot;loans originated&quot; per 1,000 households. This difference is highly significant.<BR><BR>For all loan categories analyzed (Conventional Mortgage &amp; Mortgage Refinancing), the Japanese and/or Caucasian Census Tracts received $7,521 in &quot;loans originated&quot; per household while the Native Hawaiian and/or Filipino Census Tracts received $247 in &quot;loans originated&quot; per household. This difference is highly significant.<BR><BR>It is quite obvious from the above results that, in 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993 &amp; 1994, significant differences in First Hawaiian's mortgage lending patterns existed between Native Hawaiian and/or Filipino Census Tracts and Japanese and/or Caucasian Census Tracts within the Honolulu MSA.  These differences cannot simply be explained by pointing to differences in income and credit qualifications.  On the contrary:<BR><BR>The average <EM>Debt/Income Ratio Index </EM>for the Japanese and/or Caucasian Census Tracts was 226% greater than that for the Native Hawaiian and/or Filipino Census Tracts. This difference is highly significant; and,<BR><BR>The average monthly <EM>Household Income </EM>for the Japanese and/or Caucasian Census Tracts did not differ in a manner significant enough to justify the above gross disparity in lending from the Household Income for the Native Hawaiian and/or Filipino Census Tracts (average monthly income being $3,625 and $3,121, respectively).<BR><BR><EM><STRONG>In conclusion, although households within the Native Hawaiian and/or Filipino Census Tracts possessed, on average, an equivalent income and a much more acceptable debt/income ratio index than Japanese and/or Caucasian Census Tracts, they received a significantly lower proportional share of mortgage lending from First Hawaiian.</STRONG></EM>  Credible field observations and the analysis outlined above, demonstrate that First Hawaiian's lending policies in 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993 &amp; 1994 were overtly discriminatory, resulting in disparate treatment owing to different and unequal assessment or treatment of equally qualified applicants, and that  First Hawaiian's current mortgage lending activity produces a disproportionate adverse effect on a racial or ethnic basis on those of Hawaiian and Filipino ancestry.<BR><BR>In carrying out its current lending activities,  First Hawaiian is failing to fulfill its obligations under the Community Reinvestment Act (12USC  2901 et seq.) to meet the credit needs of its entire community.  Our studies also indicate that First Hawaiian is in substantial noncompliance with the non-discrimination provisions of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (15 USC  1691) and the Fair Housing Act --Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act (42 USC  3605), including discrimination on a prohibited basis and/or inconsistent treatment of loan applications.<BR><BR>The evidence also indicates that First Hawaiian's poor mortgage lending record to Native Hawaiians on Hawaiian Homelands mirrors Blackpipe State Bank's (&quot;Blackpipe&quot;) record with Native Americans on the Rosebud and Pine Ridge reservations.  Because of concerns that several of Blackpipe's policies and practices relating to Indian loan applicants violated federal statutes prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, color and/or national origin, the U.S. Department of Justice filed suit against Blackpipe in November of 1993 (<EM>United States of America v. Blackpipe State Bank, CIV. 93-5115 (U.S. Dist. Ct., D. S. D.)</EM>) The specific discriminatory acts and omissions cited in the United States' Amended Complaint which are applicable to First Hawaiian's practices regarding Hawaiian Homelands include the following:<BR><BR>A)  Adopting a policy of refusing to make any loans secured by collateral located within an Indian reservation;<BR><BR>B)  Excluding area Indian reservations from Blackpipe's targeted lending area; and,<BR><BR>C)  Failing to participate in Farmer's Home Administration or Bureau of Indian Affairs guaranteed loan programs.<BR><BR>On January 21, 1994, Blackpipe entered into a Consent Decree with the United States in which it agreed to a broad range of reforms.  The terms of the Consent Decree which are applicable to First Hawaiian's practices regarding Hawaiian Homelands are as follows:<BR><BR>A)  Blackpipe is enjoined from doing any of the following because an applicant is an American Indian, resides on an Indian reservation, or provides collateral which is located on an Indian reservation:<BR><BR><UL><LI>  Refusing to provide credit<BR><LI>  Discriminating in the terms or conditions of an extension of credit<BR><LI>  Discouraging any person from applying for credit<BR><BR></UL>B)  Blackpipe must also revise its policies regarding secured loans to state that Blackpipe &quot;will make secured loans without respect to whether the collateral for such loans is located on an Indian reservation.&quot;<BR><BR>As stated above, First Hawaiian's poor mortgage lending record to Native Hawaiians on Hawaiian Homelands mirrors Blackpipe's prior record with Native Americans before the Justice Department intervened. Although, unlike Blackpipe, First Hawaiian is not yet required to deal with a native court system, nor does it now need to face questions of sovereign immunity when lending onto Hawaiian Homelands.  However, according to top officials at the Department of Hawaiian Homelands, First Hawaiian's record of lending to Native Hawaiians on Hawaiian Homelands is extremely poor -- despite the fact that First Hawaiian has $20 million on deposit from the Office of Hawaiian Affairs expressly for this purpose.<BR><BR>In addition, as First Hawaiian is already a dominant presence in Hawaii's mortgage lending markets, antitrust provisions of the Sherman and Clayton Acts should also be closely scrutinized.  While First Hawaiian is presently the second largest financial institution in the state, it has a dominate share of the Maui banking market.  The U.S. Justice Department recognized First Hawaiian's monopoly share of certain markets in Hawaii when it objected to its 1991 acquisition of First Interstate Bank Hawaii. Although the Federal Reserve had initially approved the purchase, the Justice Department's Antitrust Division objected and blocked the merger until First Hawaiian entered into a Consent Decree and agreed to divest itself of six branches.<BR><BR>Although First Hawaiian announced on January 5, 1996 that it intends to close two Maui branches and another branch in Hawaii Kai on Oahu (under this plan Finance Factors Ltd. will be purchasing and assuming responsibility for many of the loans and savings deposits now at these three branches), this action does not conform to the terms of the Consent Decree.<BR><BR>The Department of Justice's action against First Hawaiian (United States v. First Hawaiian Inc., 1991-1 Trade Cas. (<EM>CCH) Paragraph 69,457 (D. Haw. 1991). See also Letter from James F. Rill, Assistant Attorney General, to Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve Board Chairman (Oct. 5,1990).</EM>) set a national precedent.  The Justice Department's objections to the merger centered around concerns regarding First Hawaiian's domination of certain markets in Hawaii.  In the opinion of the U.S. Department of Justice, such market domination would be a violation of U.S. antitrust laws.<BR><BR>Federal concerns regarding First Hawaiian's market domination didn't end in 1991.  In 1993, First Hawaiian applied for permission from federal regulators to acquire Pioneer Federal Savings Bank, Honolulu, Hawaii.  Because First Hawaiian's market share resulting from the acquisition would exceed legal limits, the decision was moved from the regional Federal Reserve office in San Francisco to Washington.  The Justice Department mandates that a bank cannot have more than a 35% market share within a given area.<BR><BR>Finding itself somewhat precluded from further expansion in the Hawaii market because of antitrust concerns, First Hawaiian is now seeking regulatory approval to purchase branches in the Pacific Northwest from U.S. Bancorp and West One Bancorp.  U.S. Bank and West One agreed to sell the branches to avoid an antitrust challenge of their own.  The two banks had announced a definitive agreement to merge last May and completed the merger on December 27, 1995.<BR><BR>But First Hawaiian's ongoing monopoly share of certain markets in Hawaii is continuing to have a substantially adverse effect on the competitive environment for banking services in certain regions in Hawaii.<BR><BR>Under the revised Department of Justice Merger Guidelines, 49 Federal Register 26,823 (1984), a market in which the post-merger Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) is above 1800 is considered highly concentrated.  In such markets, the Department of Justice is likely to challenge a merger that increases the HHI by more than 50 points.  It is our contention that if the HHI is properly calculated using relevant market definitions, the index resulting from an analysis of First Hawaiian's current share of certain markets and the lack of mitigating factors will necessitate further intervention by the Department of Justice.  Again, it is also our belief that First Hawaiian is in noncompliance with the Antitrust Consent Decree it entered into with the U.S. Department of Justice in 1991.<BR><BR><BR><STRONG>Adverse Effects on Protestants Resulting from Application Approval</STRONG><BR><BR>The Nation of Hawaii seeks to increase the supply, affordability and accessibility of financing for housing and other consumer needs for <EM>all</EM> residents of Hawaii, as well as for the Native Hawaiian and Filipino members of the Nation in particular.  The Nation also recognizes the impact that inequitable lending policies and practices have upon the neighborhoods in which its citizens live and has therefore decided to undertake this action in order to pursue an end to those policies and practices.  <EM><B>If approved as currently proposed, First Hawaiian's application to acquire Pacific One Bank, Portland, Oregon, and Idaho First Bank, Boise, Idaho would have an adverse effect on the Nation's constituency by serving to solidify, legitimize and expand the existing inequitable and even illegal policies and practices of First Hawaiian.  Therefore, to reiterate, we request that the Federal Reserve immediately postpone application approval and require that both private and public meetings be held in Hawaii on this matter pursuant to 12 CFR  262.25(c&amp;d).  Numerous members of the public wish to speak on the above issues in a public forum, including Native Hawaiian elders who traditionally communicate community matters in an oral manner rather than in written form.</B></EM><BR><P><IMG SRC="hrcolor2.gif"><BR><A HREF="index.html"><IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="flagsm.gif" BORDER="0"></A> Return to the <A HREF="index.html">Nation of Hawai`i Home Page</A> or the <A HREF="first-hawaiian.html">First Hawaiian Page</A><BR></BODY></HTML>

First Hawaiian &amp; First Interstate<P>The Independent and Sovereign Nation State of Hawaii (hereinafter "Nation of Hawaii") was established under customary international law by the <A HREF="proclamsum.html">Proclamation Restoring the Independence of the Sovereign Nation-State of Hawaii</A> on Jan. 16, 1994, following the official apology and admission against interest of the United States, enacted as <A HREF="publawsum.html">U.S. Public Law 103-150</A>, Nov. 23, 1993.  The Nation of Hawaii submits the following comments under <A HREF="consitution.html#art17">Article XVII, Transitional Provisions</A>, of the <A HREF="consitution.html">Hawaii Consitution</A>, ratified at <A HREF="palace.html">`Iolani Palace</A> on Jan. 16, 1995.  A full documenation package on the Nation of Hawaii is being forwarded to you in hard copy for your review and background information.<P>The Nation of Hawaii is in general agreement with the facts, findings and violations outlined in the original complaint filed by the Plaintiff with the Court on December 28, 1990 and hereby incorporates by reference the full contents of this complaint as well as related research carried out by the U.S. Department of Justice into its comments.  The Nation of Hawaii believes that it is not in the public interest to allow First Hawaiian to sell most of the assets and deposit liabilities of the three divestiture branches in question to Finance Factors.<P>The Nation of Hawaii believes that approval of the proposed modification would not adequately address the competitive concerns which the United States raised in its 1990 complaint against First Hawaiian and First Interstate, including the importance of increasing competition in transaction account services for small business consumers.  Since the Final Judgement was first entered, First Hawaiian has substantially increased both its share of the business banking market and the fees it charges small businesses for transaction account services.  Sale of the assets and deposit liabilities in question to Finance Factors would not alleviate these symptoms of a highly concentrated business banking market as Finance Factors does not offer transaction account services as defined by the Final Judgement.<P>Recent revisions to US Interstate Banking laws have increased the field of potential buyers for the three branches in question to the US Mainland. However, First Hawaiian appears to have made no efforts to find a &quot;qualified purchaser&quot; from financial institutions outside of Hawaii.  The Nation of Hawaii believes that selling the branches in question to a qualified purchaser  -- within the meaning of the original Final Judgement -- from the US Mainland would do much more to increase competition and improve the financial services environment for small business than selling them to a unqualified purchaser such as Finance Factors.  However, the Nation of Hawaii would prefer that these branches be sold to a QUALIFIED purchaser in Hawaii.<P>The Nation of Hawaii must question the validity of the Memorandum of the United States in Support of Motion of First Hawaiian to Modify the Final Judgement.  This Memorandum was submitted to the Court on January 19, 1996 by Elliot Enoki as the United States Attorney - District of Hawaii. However, Mr. Enoki is no longer the United States Attorney for the District of Hawaii.  Mr. Enoki was replaced as US Attorney by the Clinton Administration with Mr. Steve Alm.  Steve Alm should be the only individual authorized to file with the Court using the title, United States Attorney - District of Hawaii.  Given the above facts, the Court should consider invalidating the submission of this Memorandum of Support<P>The Nation of Hawaii believes that as the current United States Attorney for the District of Hawaii, Mr. Steve Alm should be more forthcoming regarding his brother's current employment status with First Hawaiian Bank. The brother of US Attorney Steve Alm, Mr. Robert Alm, is currently Senior Vice-President at First Hawaiian Bank and has policy making responsibilities in financial management and other areas which could impact this case.  The Nation of Hawaii is concerned that this situation seems to indicate a possibility for self-dealing and the potential for a serious conflict-of-interest.<P>The Nation of Hawaii wishes to note that the United States submitted its Memorandum of Support to the Court on January 19, 1996 -- less than 48 hours after the Nation of Hawaii had submitted comments to US banking regulators alleging that First Hawaiian was in noncompliance with the Final Judgement. Before this, the last Court proceeding involving Docket 90-00904 occurred on February 17, 1994 -- nearly two years before.<P>The Nation of Hawaii also wishes to note that on page 22 of First Hawaiian's 02-12-96 response to the above mentioned comments submitted by the Nation to US banking regulators First Hawaiian claims that:<P>&quot;The Department of Justice has approved the proposed divestiture to Finance Factors.  The Bank and Finance Factors have scheduled the consummation of the divestiture for March 15, 1996.&quot;<P>In fact, according to documents filed with the Court on January 19, 1996, the United States has only tentatively consented to the proposed modification of the Final Judgement and:<P>&quot;The United States reserves its right to withdraw its consent in light of any comments received from interested persons.&quot;<P>The Nation of Hawaii is concerned as to why First Hawaiian Bank seems to believe that the proposed divestiture to Finance Factors is as good as &quot;approved.&quot;<P>In consideration of the facts outlined above, the Nation of Hawaii urges the following:<P><LI> That an order by the court modifying final judgment not be entered, as this would not be in the public interest.<P><LI> That the Plaintiff (United States) withdraw its consent to the proposed modification.<P><LI> That First Hawaiian be compelled to comply with the original requirements of the 1991 Final Judgement, including sale of the branches in question to a qualified purchaser.<P><LI> That the Court order First Hawaiian to expand its search for a buyer to all qualified purchasers in Hawaii as well as those on the US Mainland.<P>Respectfully submitted,<P>PU`UHONUA KANAHELE<BR>Head of State<BR>Nation of Hawaii<P>Copies to:<P>Anne K.

<H2>Airport arrest on charges of harboring tax fugitive</H2>

Dennis K. "Bumpy" Kanahele, head of state of the self-<A HREF="proclamsum.html">proclaimed</A> Nation of Hawaii, is spending at least two days in jail following his surprise arrest by federal authorities yesterday.
<P>
Kanahele, 41, was arrested at Honolulu Airport on charges of harboring federal fugitive Nathan Brown, a Hawaiian tax protester, and impeding and obstructing law officers who tried to arrest Brown twice in 1994.
<P>
Federal Magistrate Barry Kurren ordered Kanahele held without bail until a detention hearing tomorrow, after U.S. Attorney Les Osborne called Kanahele a flight risk and danger to the community.
<P>
Federal Public Defender Richard Ney, representing Kanahele, disputed the characterization.  But Kurren said that can be debated at tomorrow's hearing.
<P>
Kanahele was indicted by a federal grand jury yesterday morning and arrested less than three hours later at the airport, where the Hawaiian Airlines plane he was on had stopped on a flight from Maui to Kauai.
<P>
"This is kidnapping," Duke Sabedong, one of Kanahele's aides, said after the arraignment.
<P>
Also named in the indictment is Gordon Kaaihue, one of Kanahele's "peace officers," on one count of interfering with Honolulu police Officer T. Carreiro tried to arrest Brown in January 1994.
<P>
Kaaihue was not with Kanahele at the airport and was being sought last night.
<P>
Kanahele and Kaaihue also were arrested last month on state warrants stemming from their failure to answer traffic citations.  They're scheduled for trial in those cases next month.

<H1>Kanahele accused of aiding '90 tax protester</H1>
<H2>Nathan Brown vanished before serving sentence</H2>

<P>
Yesterday's arrest of Dennis "Bumpy" Kanahele, head of the self-<A HREF="proclamsum.html">proclaimed</A> Nation of Hawaii, stems from a 1990 tax protest by a group of Hawaiians.
<P>
Kanahele was indicted by a federal grand jury yesterday for harboring one of those tax protesters, Nathan Brown.
<P>
Brown was convicted in 1991 on 18 felony counts stemming from a scheme in which members of a group called the Royal Kingdom of Hawaii filed false tax returns with the Internal Revenue Service claiming they had paid thousands of dollars to public officials, including then-Gov. John Waihee.
<P>
Brown, Windyceslau Lorenzo and three Mainland men appealed their convictions, but the appeal was rejected in 1993.
<P>
Brown failed to show up to begin serving his 6 1/2-year sentence and is still being sought by federal authorities, U.S. Attorney Steve Alm said yesterday.
<P>
Brown is a member of the Nation of Hawaii, but has stayed away from the group and its headquarters on state land in Waimanalo, said nation spokesman Rolf Nordahl.
<P>
Kanahele is accused of interfering with a Honolulu police officer's attempt to arrest Brown on Jan. 27, 1994, and harboring a fugitive and obstructing a U.S. marshal's attempt to arrest Brown on March 16, 1994.
<P>
The charges were contained in a secret indictment handed down by a federal grand jury yesterday morning.
<P>
Kanahele was arrested at Honolulu Airport less that three hours later.
<P>
He and his wife and three officers of his group had gone to Maui on Tuesday to meet some supporters.
<P>
Kanahele and his entourage all left Maui yesterday on a Hawaiian Airlines flight bound for Honolulu and Kauai.  Kanahele was going to meet supporters on Kauai; the rest were returning to Oahu.
<P>
But when the plane landed at Honolulu, instead of Kauai-bound passengers staying aboard, everyone was asked to get off.
<P>
A Hawaiian Airlines spokesman said later that was done at the request of the FBI.
<P>
Kanahele was arrested by FBI agents and U.S. marshals when he left the plane, "without incident," according to Alm.
<P>
Later yesterday, Kanahele was arraigned before federal Magistrate Barry Kurren, who unsealed the indictment.
<P>
Wearing a green T-shirt, shorts and slippers, a somber Kanahele identified himself as "the head of state of the Nation of Hawaii."
<P>
"There's a conflict of law," he told Kurren.  "I'd like the federal prosecutor to show venue and jurisdiction."
<P>
Kanahele and his supporters, some of whom drive cars with "Hawaiian Sovereign" license plates, claim that the federal and state governments are illegal.  Thus, they say, neither the state nor the federal government has jurisdiction over them.
<P>
Kurren declined to get into that at yesterday's arraignment.
<P>
At the request of Assistant U.S. Attorney Les Osborne, Kurren ordered Kanahele held without bail, at least until a detention hearing tomorrow.
<P>
Later yesterday, Alm held a news conference and said: "Federal laws are enacted to preserve the rights, privileges and freedoms of everyone in the United States - and each person in Hawaii has the responsibility to follow the law.
<P>
"No one is permitted to harbor fugitives convicted of multiple felonies for the purpose of preventing their arrest...."
<P>
Kanahele's supporters questioned why the federal authorities had taken more than a year to bring charges against Kanahele.
<P>
Alm said Kanahele's indictment stemmed from an investigation and evidence turned up in recent months.
<P>
Alm indicated the case did not stem from notices that Kanahele's supporters distributed recently, warning federal and state officials and judges against committing "acts of war" and "genocide" against Hawaiians.
<P>
Nor, Alm said, was the indictment related to the recent case of Jack Gonzales.  The former executive director of the state Campaign Spending Commission was briefly a federal fugitive in another case in June, but turned himself in claiming that as an officer of the Nation of Hawaii, he is exempt from federal law.
<P>
Some of Kanahele's supporters said yesterday's arrest will hasten their challenge of federal authority.
<P>
"It's another stop on the Bumpy road to independence," one said.

<LI>Today's guide to yesterday's life-sustaining plants carried by early <A HREF="#pvs">Polynesian voyagers</A> in their canoes.<P> 
<LI>Trust in a benevolent order is at the heart of the courageous voyages within Oceania's pacific waters. Staying afloat was essential.<P> 
<LI>Imagine a race of beings courageous enough to launch themselves upon the sea of a great ocean nation.<P> 
<LI><A HREF="http://www.hawaii-nation.org/archip.html">The Hawai`i Islands</A> are located thousands of miles from the nearest continent and are the most isolated oceanic islands on our planet.<P> 
<LI>See the wooden hand-hewn canoes of the voyagers sailing until landfall, the skills of their wayfinding guided them to this place, these mountain islands beyond the horizon.<P> 
<LI>Within the canoes were stashed precious cargo. The roots, cuttings, shoots & seeds of plants for food, cordage, medicine, containers, fabric - life's needs, both physical & spiritual, all traveled here.<P> 
<LI>An active relationship and partnership existed between humans and plants. Cultivation occurred through selection & preservation.<P> 
<LI>Imagine a culture without clay or iron, whose people trusted enough in the intrinsic nature of 24 plants to be life sustaining. </UL>

The trunk of this plant is ringed and is often 3-4 inches thick in diameter, rising as high as 4-8 feet.<P>Similar to <A HREF="kalo.html">taro</A>, the underground stem and corm is edible, and as with <A HREF="kalo.html">taro</A>, is only safe to eat after lengthy cooking which breaks down the irritant of the uncooked crystals of calcium oxalate, which can injure internal human tissue.<P>Not a favored food, <STRONG>`ape</STRONG> was eaten only in times of famine when other foods were scarce.<P><EM>`Ai no i ka <STRONG>`ape</STRONG> he nane`o no ka nuku.</EM>  He who eats <STRONG>`ape</STRONG> is bound to have his mouth itch...or, in a proverbial way, he who indulges in some thing harmful will surely reap the result!<P>Originating in southern Asia, <STRONG>`ape</STRONG> (<STRONG><EM>Alocasia macrorrhiza</STRONG></EM>) grows throughout the Pacific and was brought by <A HREF="index.html#pvs">Polynesian voyagers</A> as roots in their canoes to Hawai`i over 1500 years ago.  <STRONG>`Ape</STRONG> thrives in a slightly moist shady and well composted soil.<P>Medicinally, the juice from freshly cut stems can be an antidote on the skin to itchy stinging plants such as <A HREF="ko.html">ko/sugar cane</A>, and nettle.

<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="awa-color.gif" VSPACE=4 HSPACE=8>
<STRONG>`Awa</STRONG> is one of the plants brought in their sailing canoes by the earliest <A HREF="index.html#pvs">Polynesian voyagers</A> arriving in Hawai`i.  <STRONG>`Awa</STRONG> grows wild now and is also cultivated throughout the Pacific Islands, where it is called <STRONG>Kava</STRONG> or <STRONG>Kava Kava</STRONG>.  This plant grows well at low elevations where there is constant moisture and partial sun.  More than a dozen varieties of <STRONG>`awa</STRONG> were known in old Hawai`i.
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="awa-line.gif" VSPACE=4 HSPACE=8>
The sparingly branched, erect shrub grows up to 12 feet high.  It has large, smooth, heart-shaped leaves and green or black jointed stems, with swellings at the joint.  The black <STRONG>`awa</STRONG> is the rare one.  The flower is an inconspicuous narrow yellow-green spike.  The root is thick, soft wooded when fresh, hardening as it dries.  It needs to grow for 2 to 3 years minimum to achieve usable potency.  It is valued as an intoxicating drink and as a medicine.  <STRONG>`Awa</STRONG> is also a narcotic, used as a sacred plant for prayer, as well as appreciated for pleasure, especially in the south Pacific islands.
<P>
As a medicine, the leaves, stems, bark and roots are used for the following: general debility, weary muscles, chills, colds, headaches, lung and other respiratory diseases such as asthma, displacement of the womb, congestion of the urinary tract and rheumatism.
<P>
To make feverish or restless young children go to sleep, the leaf buds are given to the child after being chewed by the mother.  The plant is also used in rituals at the time of weaning.
<P>
<STRONG>`Awa</STRONG> is used principally as a tranquilizing narcotic to induce relaxation and sleep, especially when combined with lomi lomi massage.  It is also used as a tonic when people feel weak, as it is stimulating and refreshing, unless drunk in large quantities.  Over indulgence in <STRONG>`awa</STRONG> use for a period of time can adversely affect the skin and eyes.  The word <STRONG>`awa</STRONG> means bitter.
<P>
In the old days, it is said that the chiefs and priests were the principal users of <STRONG>`awa</STRONG>, but in more recent times it has been taken to use by all the people.  Those who perform strenuous work especially appreciate its properties as a relief for stiffness, tenseness and fatigue in the muscles.  <STRONG>`Awa</STRONG> is a muscle relaxant to weary farmers, fishermen, hunters and paddlers.  Spiritual leaders use <STRONG>`awa</STRONG> ceremonially at appointed times, such as at a ritual following a canoe race-meet.  It is an offering of gratitude to the divine, both before and after events and festivals in the life of the people.
<P>
While living in Western Samoa, I learned that the chiefs and talking chiefs use <STRONG>`awa</STRONG> ceremonially.  These villagers on the island of Savaii met together periodically to decide the issues of the village.  The meetings were preceded by an <STRONG>`awa</STRONG> ceremony, bringing the leaders into one accord and goodwill, as they sat in a decision making circle around the fale.
<P>
<STRONG>`Awa</STRONG> is water soluble.  To prepare the root, it is sometimes used fresh, sometimes sun-dried.  It is washed clean, chopped into small pieces, and then pounded, or in modern times, blended in a blender with water. Traditionally, the root pieces are chewed, usually by a young maiden.
<P>
An <STRONG>`awa</STRONG> drink, good for migraines or P.M.S. can be prepared for one's personal use in the following way.  Put a few small pieces of the clean root in the mouth and chew them.  Add a few more, until a cud the size of the thumb is formed.  When three of these are ready, put them in a bowl and mash with about a cup of fresh water.  Strain the liquid through a cloth to remove woody material.  This will provide you with a drink that can be used for headaches or cramps.  <A HREF="ko.html>Sugar cane</A> juice or honey can be added to sweeten.  Sometimes a spoonful of <A HREF"noni.html">noni</A> juice is added as a chaser, to counter any unpleasant effects.
<P>
In the traditional manner, the chewed <STRONG>`awa</STRONG> is mixed with water or with <A HREF"niu.html">coconut</A> water, sometimes warmed by putting it in a kanoa, calabash, with hot stones.  It is then stirred and strained with a fibrous plant bundle and drunk when it is cool.
<P>
Special cups (`apu `awa), made from <A HREF"niu.html">coconut</A> shell cut lengthwise are often reserved for this brew, and for the ceremony of <STRONG>`awa</STRONG> drinking.  Distinctive bowls are also made and set aside for <STRONG>`awa</STRONG> ceremonies throughout Polynesia.  <STRONG>`Awa/Kava</STRONG> seems to be more widely used outside these Hawai`i islands.  
<P>
When <STRONG>`awa</STRONG> cups are filled, a prayer of gratitude is offered.  <STRONG>`Awa</STRONG> is usually gulped rather than sipped, with some of the liquid being left in the container and poured upon the earth, with thanksgiving.  A chaser is sometimes used to offset the bitter taste: a piece of <A HREF"ko.html">sugar cane</A>, a bite of <A HREF"niu.html">sweet potato</A>, <A HREF"maia.html">banana</A> or fish.  A numbness in the mouth may be noticed after <STRONG>`awa</STRONG> ingestion.
<P>
It is best to harvest the <STRONG>`awa</STRONG> root when the ground is moist from rain, so that it can be easily removed.  For propagation, the stalk can be cut into sections that include the top of one knob and the bottom of the next one down.  These can be planted right side up, with most of the cane being beneath the moist earth, in a shady place.  Another method of planting is to lay a long piece of stem within the earth, allowing several plants to grow from the knobby sections laid down.
<P>
<EM>E hanai <STRONG>`awa</STRONG> a ikaika ka makani.</EM>  Feed with <STRONG>`awa</STRONG> so that the spirit may gain strength.

Throughout the seasons of the year we can appreciate the kahili ginger, crepe ginger, the red ginger called <STRONG>`awapuhi `ula`ula</STRONG>, and the edible root ginger, <STRONG>`awapuhi`ai</STRONG>, also called  <STRONG>`awapuhi pake</STRONG> or commercial Chinese or Jamaican ginger.<P>Lastly, in summertime, are to be found abundant stands of <STRONG>`awapuhi kuahiwi</STRONG>, native wild shampoo ginger, sometimes called opuhi, with the botanical name of <STRONG><EM>Zingiber zerumbot</STRONG></EM>.<P>This plant originated in India, was distributed eastward through Polynesia and introduced to these islands in the <A HREF="index.html#pvs">canoes of early settlers</A>.  The leaves and leaf stalks, which are also fragrant, were used in baking in the imu, underground oven, to enhance the flavor of pork and fish as they cooked.  Traditionally, the aromatic underground roots/rhizomes were sliced, dried and pounded to a powder, then added to the folds of stored <A HREF="wauke.html">kapa/tapa</A> cloth.  The spicy-smelling fresh roots were pounded and used as medicine for indigestion and other ailments.  The roots can be stored in a cool, dark place to keep for use when needed.  In traditional use, the root was ground in a stone mortar with a stone pestle, was mixed with a ripe <A HREF="noni.html">noni</A> fruit and then used to treat severe sprains.  The pulp was placed in a cloth and loosely bound around the injured area.  The dressing was changed daily until the sprain healed.  The warmth of the afternoon sun could also be beneficial to the injured part.<P>For a toothache or a cavity, the cooked and softened <STRONG>`awapuhi</STRONG> root was pressed into the hollow and left for as long as was needed.<P>To ease a stomachache, the ground and strained root material was mixed with water and drunk.  Similarly, <STRONG>`awapuhi</STRONG> pake (Zingiber officinale) is widely cultivated and eaten, or made into a tea for indigestion as well as increased circulation of the blood and an increased sense of well-being.<P><IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="awapuhi-line2.gif" VSPACE=4 HSPACE=8>Finally, perhaps the most common use of <STRONG>`awapuhi kuahiwi</STRONG> is as a shampoo and as a conditioner for the hair.  The clear slimy juice present in the mature flower heads is excellent for softening and brings shine to the hair.  It can be left in the hair or rinsed out, as you wish.  Often we pick or cut the flowerheads of this plant in the forest, as we approach a pool or waterfall for a refreshing summer bath, leave the flowers atop a nearby rock, and then squeeze the sweet juices into our hair and over our bodies when our swim is completed.  The sudsy juice is excellent for massage, too, either by the pool or at home.  <P>This plant can easily be cultivated in home gardens.  The patch in my garden keeps me supplied with hair conditioner and body lotion during the summer.  If you are considering growing it in your garden, be sure to allow a large area.  The <STRONG>`awapuhi</STRONG> tend to form thick stands, following their large underground stems horizontally, just under the earth's surface.  <STRONG>`Awapuhi kuahiwi</STRONG> is best propagated in autumn by planting a piece of rootstock with buds, in a shallow trench of broken and composted soil.<P>`<STRONG>Awapuhi kuahiwi</STRONG> is a perennial, so from autumn until spring it becomes dormant above ground as the leaf stalks die away.  In the spring the plant springs up anew.  The 10-12 blade-shaped leaves grow to 6-8 inches on the approximately 3 foot long stalks.   The leaves grow in an alternate arrangement on the upright, thin, fleshy stalk.  Among the leaf stalks, the conical or club-shaped flower heads burst forth upon their separate and shorter stalks.  These appear in the summer, when the leaf stalks have been growing for awhile.<P>As the 2-3 inch long bracts/flower heads mature, they gradually fill with an aromatic, slimy liquid.  The heads are reddish-green with overlapping scales, producing small yellowish-white flowers that poke out a few at a time.  These tiny flowers are similar in fragrance to the larger and more delicate butterfly-like yellow and white ginger blossoms, growing from the base toward the head.  The flower stalks usually remain beneath the leaf stalks, enjoying the moist shade and warmth provided.  This plant grows abundantly in areas where <A HREF="ulu.html">`ulu</A>, <A HREF="kukui.html">kukui</A> and <A HREF="ohia.html">`ohi`a `ai</A> all thrive, often near or upon abandoned <A HREF="kalo.html">kalo</A> terraces.  <STRONG>`Awapuhi kuahiwi</STRONG> grows wild in patches at low altitudes in the open damp forest.  The juice can be used to quench thirst when out walking in the forest, and makes a lovely lunch when combined with a few mountain apples.<P><IMG SRC="hrcolor2.gif"><BR><P><CENTER><TABLE BORDER="2" CELLPADDING="2"><TR><TD ALIGN="center">The 24 "Canoe Plants" of Ancient Hawai`i</TD><TR><TR><TD ALIGN="center"><FONT SIZE="-1"><A HREF="ape.html">`Ape</A> -<A HREF="awa.html">`Awa</A> -<A HREF="hau.html">Hau</A> -<A HREF="ipu.html">Ipu</A> -<A HREF="kalo.html">Kalo</A> -<A HREF="kamani.html">Kamani</A> -<A HREF="ki.html">Ki</A> -<A HREF="ko.html">Ko</A> -<A HREF="kou.html">Kou</A> -<A HREF="kukui.html">Kukui</A> -<A HREF="maia.html">Mai`a</A><BR><A HREF="milo.html">Milo</A> -<A HREF="niu.html">Niu</A> -<A HREF="noni.html">Noni</A> -<A HREF="ohe.html">`Ohe</A> -<A HREF="ohia.html">`Ohi`a `Ai</A> -<A HREF="olena.html">`Olena</A> -<A HREF="olona.html">Olona</A> -<A HREF="pia.html">Pia</A> -<A HREF="uala.html">`Uala</A> -<A HREF="uhi.html">Uhi</A> -<A HREF="ulu.html">`Ulu</A> -<A HREF="wauke.html">Wauke</A></FONT></TABLE></CENTER><A HREF="index.html"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="canostss.gif" BORDER="0"></A> Return to the <A HREF="index.html">Canoe Plants Home Page</A> or the <A HREF="index.html#contents">Table of Contents</A><P></HTML>

Today it is often called "hau bush" and is termed an invasive plant, as it has taken over some areas where acres are covered high with <STRONG>hau</STRONG>, at the same time creating windbreaks and stabilizing the soil.<P>Seeds and cuttings of <STRONG>hau</STRONG> were brought by early <A HREF="index.html#pvs">Polynesian voyagers</A> to Hawai`i Nei, and planted by the settlers to yield a light-weight tough white wood with a brown heart.  <STRONG>Hau</STRONG> is found and used throughout tropical and subtropical Polynesia, Melanesia and Micronesia and is held in high regard for its usefulness to the traditional life of oceanic people.<P><STRONG><EM>Hibiscus tiliaceus</EM></STRONG> is the scientific name of <STRONG>hau</STRONG>.  The naturally curved branches of this plant's softwood are used to make canoe outriggers.  The three parts are the niako, the two booms, and the float, ama.  To get the proper shapes, the younger branches were sometimes trained into arches or shaped in an imu, underground oven. The bark was stripped from the branches which were then soaked for a few weeks in ocean water.  This treatment would discourage insects and rot.  Wiliwili or `ohi`a lehua were also used for the ama.  These two woods are buoyant and lightweight as is <STRONG>hau</STRONG>, but they are stronger and better suited for larger canoes. <P>Traditionally, <STRONG>hau</STRONG> branches were piled near the shoreline to indicate fishing was kapu, because spawning was occurring in that area.<P>Cork-like <STRONG>hau</STRONG> wood pieces were used as floats on fishnets.  The soft wood was also helpful in making fires.  A pointed piece of <STRONG>hau</STRONG> was rubbed in a groove of a harder wood, such as <A HREF="kukui.html">kukui</A>.  The dust particles of <STRONG>hau</STRONG> that rubbed apart would smolder as the rubbing increased.  Then small pieces of <A HREF="niu.html">coconut</A> fiber or bits of <A HREF="wauke.html">tapa</A> bark cloth were ignited from the <STRONG>hau</STRONG>, and the fire was next put to grasses, sticks and finally to wood.<P>Adze handles were most often made of <STRONG>hau</STRONG>, as were light-weight practice spears, massage sticks, brooms, and the cross-beams for kites.<P><STRONG>Hau</STRONG> cordage, called <STRONG>`ili hau</STRONG>, provided tying material used daily.  The cordage is made by cutting off stems and younger smooth branches, making a slit lengthwise and removing the bark with the hands.  The bark strips are then soaked.  When the outer bark is slipped off, remaining are cream-colored smooth fibers for braiding and twisting into cordage.  For some uses the outer bark isn't removed, eventually falling off with use.  <STRONG>Hau</STRONG> cordage provided ropes for hauling and many other needs: slings; canoe lashing; strings for bows; net bags; carrying handles for <A HREF="ipu.html">water-gourds</A>; fasteners for lauhala baskets; shark nooses; strands for lei making; strainers for <A HREF="niu.html">coconut</A> cream and <A HREF="awa.html">`awa</A> drinks; sewing material to piece together <A HREF="wauke.html">tapa</A> cloth for clothing and bedding; a form of tapa itself; hula skirts of <STRONG>hau</STRONG> bark; sandals; and cord for snapping dyes into line designs onto <A HREF="wauke.html">tapa</A> cloth.<P><STRONG>Hau</STRONG> grows well near the ocean, streams, and in moist sloping areas up to the 2000 foot elevation.  This shrub spreads to form a creeping jungle of interwoven, curved and twisted springy arching branches.  Sometimes trunks up to 12 feet long recline to form roots where they touch the ground.  These become impenetrable places.<P>The leaves are heart-shaped and round, from 2 to 12 inches in diameter.  They are leathery, with a smooth surface, while the underside is velvety and consists of matted white hairs.  Sometimes the leaf edges are scalloped, but usually not.<P><STRONG>Hau</STRONG> is a true hibiscus, with five crepe-like petals with a central column.  The 2-3 inch long bright yellow cup-shaped flowers have reddish centers, and form at the ends of the branches.  As the day goes by, the flower changes color to orange and then to reddish-brown, before it falls off the plant by the next morning.  The inch long dry downy brown fruiting capsule contains 5 valves, each with 3 smooth seeds.<P>In home gardens, <STRONG>hau</STRONG> is propagated from cuttings, and the trunks can be trained to create a garden shelter or arbor called a <STRONG>hau </STRONG>lanai.  This plant is also grown as a natural fence barrier.<P>A slimy juicy sap found in the dome of the flowerbud and in the bark was used as a mild laxative.  For babies and young children, the flowerbuds were used; and, for adults and older children, the small white dome-shaped bump inside the bottom of the flower petals was used.  The buds were also chewed and eaten for dry-throat.  Slime from soaking the bark of the stems was medicine for congested chests.  The lubricant quality of the inner bark was of value as an enema or could assist in the passage of a baby at childbirth.<P>One Hawai`i legend says that <STRONG>hau</STRONG> is a sister of the goddess Hina, changed into a tree.  The people of Tahiti say <STRONG>hau</STRONG> is the grandchild of heaven and earth.

For containers, they grew the beautiful and functional hard-shelled and think-walled hue/<STRONG>gourd</STRONG>, better known as <STRONG>ipu</STRONG>.  Related to the squash, watermelon and cucumber, more than 100 varieties were grown in the old days.<P><STRONG><EM>Lageneria siceraria</STRONG></EM> is a native of tropical Asia and Africa.  Brought by seed in the <A HREF="index.html#pvs">canoes of migrating Polynesians</A>, <STRONG>ipu</STRONG> were used during the voyages as water bottles (hue`wai or `olowai), as canoe bailers and as containers to store fish hooks, fish line, bait, medicine and food.<P>The spirit of fertility that is the god Lono is embodied in the <STRONG>ipu</STRONG>, which is considered kinolau, body form, of Lono.<P>A climbing vine, <STRONG>ipu</STRONG> is traditionally planted after the rainy season, during the Hua moon phase, 3-4 days before the full moon.  The word hua means fruit.  During the flowering stage, when male and female flowers are present, hand pollination is necessary, usually at dusk or night, when the flowers bloom.  The flowers are single, small (1 1/12 inches long) and white.  Wide-spreading vines with downy, branched tendrils bear rounded heart-shaped hairy leaves.  The leaves are 5 lobed and from 4 to16 inches in diameter.  As the vine grows, it needs support, such as a rock wall, a tree, or man-made trellis.  During the 6-9 months that the <STRONG>ipu</STRONG> fruit takes to mature, they must be carefully tended and protected from stinging and biting insects that like to lay their eggs in the young developing fruit.  Coverings of mosquito netting are one way of dealing with this problem.  To prevent mold, supports are used to suspend the fruit and mounds of grass or straw are placed beneath the <STRONG>gourd</STRONG> where it contacts the earth.  Sometimes green, sometimes white or mottled, the <STRONG>gourds</STRONG> vary in shape and size, according to their variety.  They can also be shaped by wrapping or tying them with cord, while they are maturing.  Soft and sometimes hairy, the immature fruit becomes smooth as it matures.  More varieties have been grown in Hawai`i than elsewhere in Polynesia.<P>A sunny site on the leeward side, below the 1500 foot elevation, is the best growing place for <STRONG>ipu</STRONG>, although adequate rainfall or irrigation, good drainage and shelter from the wind are all necessary ingredients for fruitful growth.  Less water is needed in the last few months of growth.  A loamy, sandy soil with crushed lava is best, and of course, lots of room for the spreading vines.  To produce the most <STRONG>gourds</STRONG> from each plant, the central vine is cut off at 8-10 feet or earlier, to stimulate extending branches with more female blossoms.<P>Decorating techniques can begin while the fruit is green.  Incised designs will remain and will be darker after drying.  The <STRONG>gourd</STRONG> is harvested when the stem is dry, by cutting several inches of stem with a sharp implement.  Curing and preserving techniques are being explored and relearned these days.  Many months are necessary for the process of curing.  Most growers leave the <STRONG>gourd</STRONG> intact until it is dry and the seeds rattle inside when shaken.  Other growers open the <STRONG>ipu</STRONG> at the top and scrape out the pulp and seeds, traditionally with an opihi shell, then filling the <STRONG>ipu</STRONG> with a saltwater solution, or with sand.  Sometimes an injection dye is used as a decorative technique.  These dyes can be made from manmade or plant dyes, such as those with tannic acid, like <A HREF="kukui.html>kukui</A> root bark, <A HREF="kukui.html>kukui</A> leaves mixed with alae dirt, coffee or tea, or the oxalic acid of <A HREF="kalo.html">taro</A>.  These later stages of <STRONG>gourd</STRONG> preparation can often be tricky and varied, and some "failures" do occur in the process.<P>Traditional <STRONG>gourds</STRONG> were called <STRONG>`umeke pohue</STRONG>.  Most were simply left their natural color, which is golden brown when dry, but some were decorated with geometric designs, pawhe, and then stained.  This was done only in Hawai`i.  The necks were closed off with a stopper, made from a shell, carved wood, coral or a folded leaf.  Larger gourds, <STRONG>ipu nui</STRONG>, were used to store food and bigger objects, such as folded <A HREF="wauke.html>tapa</A> cloth and feather regalia.  These had lids made from the curved bottom of another <STRONG>gourd</STRONG>.  Where a <STRONG>gourd</STRONG> needed to be carried or lifted, cordage was used, made of <A HREF="wauke.html>wauke</A>, `ahu`awa, <A HREF="olona.html>olona</A>, `aha and other fibers.  With a carry net, koko, they could be carried and swung on `auamo mamaka, a shoulder pole.<P><STRONG>Ipu</STRONG> were used as dippers, syringes for medicinal purposes, as pots and as eating utensils such as dishes, bowls and mugs.  They were also used to store dye, and as burial receptacles for bones.<P>A small pear-shaped nose whistle called <STRONG>ipu hokiokio</STRONG> is unique to Hawai`i.  It is softly played by one lover to another.<P>In hula, the `uli`uli is used.  These are rattles made of small <STRONG>ipu</STRONG> filled with pebbles or the seeds of the canna lily, called ali`ipoe.  With an attached handle, these rattles are usually capped with a disc of cloth, and fringed with feathers.  Another plant, originally from South America, is nowadays often used for `uli`uli.  It is la`amia, (Cresentia cujete), the fruit of the calabash tree.  <STRONG>Ipu hula</STRONG>, <STRONG>pa`ipu</STRONG>, <STRONG>ipu heke</STRONG> are all names for the hula drum.  This musical implement is made by joining a smaller pear-shaped <STRONG>ipu</STRONG> at its top end to the top end of a larger pear-shaped <STRONG>ipu</STRONG> with kepau, the sticky latex sap of <A HREF="ulu.html>breadfruit</A>, <A HREF="ulu.html>ulu</A>.  Of course, man-made glues are most often used today.  Looped at the juncture of the <STRONG>ipu</STRONG> is a braid of cordage of `aha, <A HREF="niu.html>coconut</A> fiber, which can be place around the wrist of the performer.  The <STRONG>ipu</STRONG> bottom is thumped on the ground, usually on a cloth, and slapped with the hand to create a resonance and beat for the dancers or chanters.  A single <STRONG>ipu</STRONG> with a cut open neck, called <STRONG>ipu heke `ole</STRONG>, is also used to accompany hula and chants.<P><STRONG>Gourds</STRONG> were a part of ancient legends, myths and rituals, and were sometimes worn by priests as masks during religious ceremonies.  The cosmology of an <STRONG>ipu</STRONG> is said to be that it spreads and puts forth fruit, like humankind over the earth.  The <STRONG>gourd</STRONG> also represents the earth, with the seeds of all beings contained within.<P><IMG SRC="hrcolor2.gif"><BR><P><CENTER><TABLE BORDER="2" CELLPADDING="2"><TR><TD ALIGN="center">The 24 "Canoe Plants" of Ancient Hawai`i</TD><TR><TR><TD ALIGN="center"><FONT SIZE="-1"><A HREF="ape.html">`Ape</A> -<A HREF="awa.html">`Awa</A> -<A HREF="awapuhi.html">`Awapuhi</A> -<A HREF="hau.html">Hau</A> -<A HREF="kalo.html">Kalo</A> -<A HREF="kamani.html">Kamani</A> -<A HREF="ki.html">Ki</A> -<A HREF="ko.html">Ko</A> -<A HREF="kou.html">Kou</A> -<A HREF="kukui.html">Kukui</A> -<A HREF="maia.html">Mai`a</A><BR><A HREF="milo.html">Milo</A> -<A HREF="niu.html">Niu</A> -<A HREF="noni.html">Noni</A> -<A HREF="ohe.html">`Ohe</A> -<A HREF="ohia.html">`Ohi`a `Ai</A> -<A HREF="olena.html">`Olena</A> -<A HREF="olona.html">Olona</A> -<A HREF="pia.html">Pia</A> -<A HREF="uala.html">`Uala</A> -<A HREF="uhi.html">Uhi</A> -<A HREF="ulu.html">`Ulu</A> -<A HREF="wauke.html">Wauke</A></FONT></TABLE></CENTER><A HREF="index.html"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="canostss.gif" BORDER="0"></A> Return to the <A HREF="index.html">Canoe Plants Home Page</A> or the <A HREF="index.html#contents">Table of Contents</A><P></HTML>

<UL><H1>KALO</UL></H1>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="kalo-color.gif" VSPACE=4 HSPACE=8>
The life of Kanaka Maoli, the indigenous Hawai`i people, is linked closely with <STRONG>kalo</STRONG>, the <STRONG>taro</STRONG> plant.  <STRONG>Kalo</STRONG> is believed to have the greatest life force of all foods.  According to the Kumulipo, the creation chant, <STRONG>kalo</STRONG> grew from the first-born son of Wakea (sky father) and Papa (earth mother), through Wakea's relationship with his and Papa's daughter, Ho`ohokulani.  Haloa-naka, as the son was named, was stillborn and buried.  Out of his body grew the <STRONG>kalo</STRONG> plant, also called Haloa, which means everlasting breath.  <STRONG>Kalo</STRONG> and <STRONG>poi</STRONG> (pounded <STRONG>kalo</STRONG>) are a means of survival for the Hawai`i people.  By eating <STRONG>kalo</STRONG> as <STRONG>poi</STRONG>, one at a time as a ritual around the <STRONG>poi</STRONG> bowl (`umeke) at the center of the diners, the protocol of Hawai`i is maintained.  This is a ceremony of life that brings people together and supports a relationship of `ohana (family) and of appreciation with the `aumakua (ancestors).
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="kalo-line.gif" VSPACE=4 HSPACE=8>
From early times, <STRONG>kalo</STRONG> was the primary food of the Hawai`i people, supplemented by other principal and traditional foods: <A HREF="ulu.html>breadfruit (`ulu)</A>, <A HREF="uala.html>sweet potato (`uala)</A>, <A HREF="uhi.html>yams</A>, greens, ferns, fruit, fish and seaweed (limu).  
<P>
<STRONG>Taro</STRONG> (<STRONG><EM>Colocasia esculenta</EM></STRONG>) came to Hawai`i Nei with the earliest <A HREF="index.html#pvs">Polynesian settlers in their canoes</A> and has been cultivated as a mainstay from ancient times in the tropical and subtropical latitudinal band around the earth.  <STRONG>Taro</STRONG> grows in tropical Africa, the West Indies, the Pacific nations and in countries bordering the Indian Ocean in South Asia.  In Hawai`i, where cultivation has been the most intense, in the early days there were more than 300 varieties of <STRONG>taro</STRONG>.  Approximately 87 of these varieties are still recognized today, with slight differences in height, stalk color, leaf or flower color, size, and root type.  Some of the local varieties are Mo`i, Lehua, Ha`akea and Chinese.
<P>
<STRONG>Taro</STRONG> is cultivated both in the uplands as high as 4,000 feet, and in marshy land irrigated by streams.  The plant is a hearty succulent perennial herb, with clusters of long heart or arrowhead-shaped leaves that point earthward.  <STRONG>Taro</STRONG> grows on erect stems that may be green, red (lehua), black or variegated.  The new leaf and stem push out of the innermost stalk, unrolling as they emerge.  The stems are usually several feet high.  Tiny new plants appear around the base of the root corm.  The pua, inflorescence, is an open yellow-white tube, enclosing a spike covered with flowers.
<P>
Depending on the variety, all parts of this sturdy and vital plant are eaten.  The leaves are cooked as greens, similar to spinach.  The tubers are eaten baked, boiled or steamed, or cooked and mashed with water to make <STRONG>poi</STRONG>.  The fibrous flesh of the tubers is tough and spongy, ranging in color from white, yellow, lilac-purple and pink to reddish.  Most important is the starchy root with enough glutinosity to make quality <STRONG>poi</STRONG>.  The stiffest <STRONG>poi</STRONG> is called locally "one finger" and the most liquid "three finger".  "Two finger" <STRONG>poi</STRONG> is considered the best.  The planters know which kind of <STRONG>taro</STRONG> makes the best <STRONG>poi</STRONG>, which variety has the most tender leaves and which has the necessary medicinal properties.
<P>
<STRONG>Taro</STRONG> is often fed to babies as their first whole and natural healthy food, as well as to the elderly, for its ease of digestion and high vitamin content.  Some people call <STRONG>poi</STRONG> the "soul food" of Hawai`i.  <STRONG>Poi</STRONG> is eaten fresh or allowed to ferment for a few days, often for longer, creating a sour taste considered pleasant, acid, but not alcoholic.  In the old days, a person might consume up to five pounds of <STRONG>poi</STRONG> per day.  Several kinds of <STRONG>kalo</STRONG> had such special flavor and color that they were reserved only for the chiefs.  It is said that Soviet astronauts ate dehydrated <STRONG>taro</STRONG> in space, adding water to the packets...instant <STRONG>poi</STRONG>!
<P>
In the <STRONG>kalo</STRONG> and <STRONG>poi</STRONG>-based agricultural society, the people of ancient Hawai`i were dependent on wetland <STRONG>taro</STRONG>.  Great skills were needed to terrace, cultivate and irrigate the land, along with the social and political skills to maintain it.  The planters of wetland <STRONG>taro</STRONG> were practicing engineers, building walls of earth reinforced with stone to enclose the lo`i (pond field).  Along the banks of the lo`i were planted <A HREF="maia.html>mai`a (banana)</A>, <A HREF="ko.html>ko (sugarcane)</A>, <A HREF="ki.html>ki (ti)</A>, and <A HREF="wauke.html>wauke (paper mulberry)</A> for kapa cloth, also known as tapa.  In the pond field, several varieties of fish were grown, such as `awa, `ama`ama, o`opu and aholehole.  An acre of wet lo`i could produce 3 to 5 tons of food per year.  Dryland <STRONG>taro</STRONG> was grown in the lower forests where the soil was rich and the rainfall sufficient.  
<P>
<A HREF="http://hawaii-nation.org/nation/keanae.html"><IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="http://hawaii-nation.org/nation/keanaesm.gif" BORDER=1 VSPACE=4 HSPACE=8></A>
Today there are still functional lo`i along the <A HREF="http://hawaii-nation.org/nation/keanae.html">Keanae</A>, Wailua and Hana coastlines of Maui, as well as other locations throughout these Hawai`i islands.  
<P>
A <STRONG>taro</STRONG> farmer exemplifies self-sufficient stewardship of natural resources through hard work.  There is wisdom in encouraging and supporting community as well as back-yard cultivation of this valuable food.
<P>
In planting both wetland and dryland <STRONG>taro</STRONG>, the huli, the planting material, consists of a 1/2 inch thick slice of the top of the <STRONG>kalo</STRONG> (corm, from which derives the plant's name) attached to 6 to 10 inches of the leaf-stem.  These protrude above the water or dryland where planted.  The bottom of the corm/root is saved for cooking and eating, making <STRONG>taro</STRONG> a recyclable plant.  In 6 to 12 months, depending upon plant variety along with soil and water conditions, the <STRONG>taro</STRONG> should be ready to harvest.  Each parent tuber produces from two to l5 `oha, side tubers of corms, up to 6 inches in diameter.  `Oha means specifically the suckers or shoots concentrically growing from the corm of the <STRONG>kalo/taro</STRONG> plant.  Knowing this, it is easy to understand why the Hawai`i family as a group is termed `ohana, which literally means "all from the shoots".
<P>
Before <STRONG>kalo</STRONG> can be eaten, all parts of the plant must be cooked, in order to break down the needle-like calcium oxalate crystals present in the leaves, stem and corm.  These could be extremely irritating to the throat and mouth lining, causing a burning and stinging sensation.
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="kalo.gif" VSPACE=2 HSPACE=2>
<STRONG>Lu`au</STRONG> is the name of the edible <STRONG>taro</STRONG> leaf, from the word lau, leaf.  Lu`au supplies high amounts of vitamins A, B and C, as well as calcium, iron, phosphorus, thiamine and riboflavin.  The cooked corm and <STRONG>poi</STRONG> have fewer vitamins, but are an excellent carbohydrate source and have the ability to balance the pH factor in the body, as they are an alkali producing food.
<P>
The following are a few of the medicinal uses of <STRONG>poi</STRONG> and the <STRONG>kalo</STRONG> plant.  <STRONG>Poi</STRONG> is used to settle the stomach.  Mixed with ripe <A HREF="noni.html>noni</A> fruit, it can be applied topically for boils.  <STRONG>Poi</STRONG> can be mixed with <A HREF="pia.html>pia</A> (arrowroot starch) and taken for diarrhea.  Undiluted <STRONG>poi</STRONG> is sometimes used as a poultice on infected sores.  A piece of <STRONG>taro</STRONG> stem, haha, can be touched to the skin to stop surface bleeding.  Some infections respond to the use of <STRONG>taro</STRONG> leaves mashed with Hawai`i salt.  This poultice can be applied to an injury, covered and wrapped with a large <STRONG>taro</STRONG> leaf.  For a sting from an insect, the stem can be cut and rubbed on the afflicted area.
<P>
Mud from the <STRONG>taro</STRONG> patch was used as a black dye for <A HREF="wauke.html>kapa</A> cloth, while some leaf-stem juice yielded red dye.  Also, diluted <STRONG>poi</STRONG> was used as a paste to glue together pieces of <A HREF="wauke.html>kapa</A> cloth.
<P>
The <STRONG>kalo</STRONG> plant is said to be the hiapo, the number one sibling.  It is also said to be the kinolau, the body form, of Kane, the procreator.  The small round depression where the <STRONG>taro</STRONG> stalk meets the leaf surface is called the piko, from whence comes the name for the human belly button.
<P>
If we want to learn more about <STRONG>kalo</STRONG> and how to grow it, it is a good idea to talk to the farmers who already grow it.  Many of these are eager to share their knowledge and expertise and many fascinating stories about this plant so central to the life of Hawai`i and her people.  Exchanging stories and <STRONG>taro</STRONG> varieties with friends and neighbors is the Hawai`i way.
<P>
As kumu Kawaikapuokalani Hewitt said "Our existence depends on Haloa, our elder brother, the <STRONG>Kalo</STRONG>."
<P>
May the mother nation Hawai`i live forever through the <STRONG>poi!</STRONG>

<UL><H1>KAMANI</H1></UL>
<P>
A member of the mangosteen family with the scientific name of <STRONG><EM>Calophyllum inophyllum</EM></STRONG>, <STRONG>kamani</STRONG> was brought north to Hawai`i from the South Pacific islands in early <A HREF="index.html#pvs">migrations of Polynesian settlers</A>.  Also called <STRONG>Alexandrian laurel</STRONG>, true <STRONG>kamani</STRONG> was probably introduced by seed, which is how it is propagated.  This native of the Pacific and of tropical Africa, grows slowly along sandy shores and in lowland forests.  It was cultivated in villages, near houses and also in groves away from villages.  When found growing in windy areas it is sometimes in a picturesque, crooked or misshapen form.
<P>
True <STRONG>kamani</STRONG> is not to be confused with "false kamani", a common tropical almond that grows profusely along the shores of Hawai`i.  This "kamani haole" was introduced after the first white settlers arrived, and has the scientific name of <EM>Teminalia catappa</EM>.  It was planted for shade and as an ornamental, also growing from the edible seed in its corky pod that washes ashore with waves and currents.
<P>
True <STRONG>kamani</STRONG> is a large attractive spreading tree up to 60 feet high, with a rounded head of dense foliage and rough grey bark.  A reddish-brown hardwood is derived from the trunk.  From this was carved many objects including canoes; homes; `umeke la`au, wooden containers or calabash, specifically <STRONG>`umeke kamani</STRONG>, food bowls and trays called <STRONG>pa kamani</STRONG>.  As with <A HREF="milo.html">milo</A> and <A HREF="kou.html">kou</A> wood, there is no bad-tasting taste or odor in <STRONG>kamani</STRONG> wood, so it is perfect for vessels that will be contacting or containing food.
<P>
The leaves of <STRONG>kamani</STRONG> are large, stiff, shiny, leathery and oblong with a blunt tip.  They are 3-8 inches long, arranged opposite each other and have closely placed fine parallel veins running from a prominent raised yellow-green midrib to the leaf margin.
<P>
The delightfully fragrant (when new) flowers are small, 1 inch wide, and white with 4-8 petals.  They smell like orange blossoms and were used to give fragrance to <A HREF="wauke.html">kapa</A> cloth, and also for lei making.  They are waxy and showy with golden yellow stamens and a pink pistil, and grow in clusters of a dozen or so flowers found hanging from a long stalk.
<P>
The fruit begins pinkish-green, rounds out to about 2 inches long and becomes bright green.  When mature, it has a thin leathery dark grey-brownish skin which covers a bony shell that holds a partly poisonous kernel or seed surrounded by a cork-like substance.  A lamp oil for light was produced from the kernel and was used at times instead of <A HREF="kukui.html">kukui</A> nut oil.  The kernel is called a "punnai nut" in some areas of the Pacific, and the oil is dark, green, thick and called "dilo oil".  Sometimes this oil is useful for lomi lomi, massage, especially when enhanced with <A HREF="niu.html">coconut</A> oil or flower fragrances.  The oil may have been useful in waterproofing <A HREF="wauke.html">tapa</A> cloth.
<P>
The seed, leaves, gum and bark are said to have medicinal properties.  In the old days an extract from the fruit was used to make a brown dye to color <A HREF="wauke.html">tapa</A> cloth.
<P>
<STRONG>Kamani</STRONG> was often planted around heiau, temples.  
<P>
<STRONG>Kamani</STRONG> was mentioned in early chants, and considered a sacred tree in parts of Polynesia.  An especially fine grove is to be found on the island of Moloka`i.

It is common from sea level in the lower wetlands up to the 4,000 foot elevation.  <STRONG>Ti</STRONG> is found in shady moist gardens, as a landscaping background plant or as a hedge.  The people of Hawai`i plant it around their homes and churches for good luck.  In the old days <STRONG>Ki</STRONG> was planted around the lo`i, taro ponds.  The botanical or scientific name of this member of the lily family is <STRONG><EM>Cordyline terminalis</STRONG></EM> or <STRONG><EM>Taetsia frucicosa</STRONG></EM>.<P><IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="ki-line.gif" VSPACE=4 HSPACE=8>Introduced to Hawai`i by the earliest <A HREF="index.html#pvs">Polynesian settlers</A>, <STRONG>Ki</STRONG> is considered sacred to the Hawai`i God Lono and to the Goddess of the hula, Laka.  It is also an emblem of high rank and divine power.  The Hawai`i feather kahili is said to be derived from this plant.  The leaves are also worn or carried as protection to ward off evil spirits and to call in good.  The kahuna priests wore <STRONG>ti</STRONG> leaves either as lei or as garments when they conducted ancient ceremonial rituals.  <STRONG>Ti</STRONG> leaves are still used today in religious ceremonies conducted by Hawai`i's multi-racial clergy, especially at opening ceremonies to bless new buildings and projects.<P><IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="ki.gif" VSPACE=2 HSPACE=2>The <STRONG>ti's</STRONG> versatile leaves have many uses, including: roof thatching; as fly whisks or fans; wrappings for cool food storage, preservation and protection; for wrapping of food to be cooked, especially for laulau; as plates or cups; as fishing lures on hukilau nets; as wearing apparel, such as rain capes, sandals and as hula skirts called pa`u; and, more recently, as feed for cattle and horses.  <STRONG>Ti</STRONG> leaves are also decorative; they are braided, twisted or woven into lei for numerous special and celebratory occasions; used as a covering for luau tables; and, they provide Hawai`i's tropical flower industry with a wonderful variety of foliage for impressive floral arrangements.  <P><STRONG>Ti</STRONG> (pronounced tee) has tall, sparingly branched wood stalks 3 to 10 or more feet high.  The tightly spiraled leaf cluster is in a tuft at the top of the ringed stalk.  The plant's green leaves are pointed, oval and blade- shaped, about 4 inches wide and vary from 1 to 2 feet long.  As new leaves form at the center, the outside older leaves turn yellow and fall, leaving a circular ring on the plant's stalk.  The thick, shiny and flexible leaves do not wilt quickly, making them useful for many purposes, some as already mentioned.  Varieties of the <STRONG>ti</STRONG> plant have colored foliage and variously shaped leaves.  Besides the original and sacred green <STRONG>ki</STRONG>, the plant ranges in leaf color from pale white and yellow with green tones, to reds, covering a broad spectrum from pale to pink to a maroon, that appears almost black.<P>The plant's flower stalk emerges in winter.  With the coming of spring, a many-branched drooping cluster of flowers comes into bloom.  Its' hundreds of tiny half-inch whitish purple flowers resemble miniature lilies.<P>This versatile plant has many medicinal uses, either alone or as a wrapping for other herbs needing to be steamed or boiled.  For fever, the entire body of an unclothed prone person is covered from the neck down with large green <STRONG>ti</STRONG> leaves.  After the patient sweats and fever is broken, the leaves are removed.  Drinks of fresh water are given to the patient during this process, which may take several hours.  Cool, freshly washed damp green <STRONG>ti</STRONG> leaves, held and wrapped around the forehead and temples, can be helpful in relieving headache and fever.  The center of <STRONG>ti</STRONG>, mole ki, is often picked and unfurled for this use.  Hot stones are wrapped in <STRONG>ki</STRONG> leaves and used to soothe sore back muscles.<P>A drink from boiled green <STRONG>ti</STRONG> leaves is used to aid nerve and muscle relaxation.  Steam from boiled young shoots and leaves makes an effective decongestant.  The pleasantly fragrant flowers are also used for asthma.<P>A popular use of this plant was in making Okolehau, affectionately called oke, a potent liquor much like a clear brandy.  This brew is distilled from a ferment of baked mashed <STRONG>ti</STRONG> root.  The root is thick, white and sweet, growing very large in older plants.  The baked roots are also an emergency famine food and have been eaten as a confection.<P>Children of old Hawai`i (and modern times, too) enjoyed sliding down steep grassy slopes on <STRONG>ti</STRONG> leaf sleds, holding onto the stem towards the front.  Whistles can also be made from the plant's leaf.<P>New plants propagate easily from cuttings and grow best where sunlight and moisture are both available.  The cutting can be planted vertically for one plant, or horizontally for several.  <P>The <STRONG>ki</STRONG> plant is common, we see and recognize it everywhere throughout this Hawai`i Nei.  It is common, yet it is very special.  It speaks to us of strength and survival, and the abundance of blessings we receive daily here in Hawai`i.<P><IMG SRC="hrcolor2.gif"><BR><P><CENTER><TABLE BORDER="2" CELLPADDING="2"><TR><TD ALIGN="center">The 24 "Canoe Plants" of Ancient Hawai`i</TD><TR><TR><TD ALIGN="center"><FONT SIZE="-1"><A HREF="ape.html">`Ape</A> -<A HREF="awa.html">`Awa</A> -<A HREF="awapuhi.html">`Awapuhi</A> -<A HREF="hau.html">Hau</A> -<A HREF="ipu.html">Ipu</A> -<A HREF="kalo.html">Kalo</A> -<A HREF="kamani.html">Kamani</A> -<A HREF="ko.html">Ko</A> -<A HREF="kou.html">Kou</A> -<A HREF="kukui.html">Kukui</A> -<A HREF="maia.html">Mai`a</A><BR><A HREF="milo.html">Milo</A> -<A HREF="niu.html">Niu</A> -<A HREF="noni.html">Noni</A> -<A HREF="ohe.html">`Ohe</A> -<A HREF="ohia.html">`Ohi`a `Ai</A> -<A HREF="olena.html">`Olena</A> -<A HREF="olona.html">Olona</A> -<A HREF="pia.html">Pia</A> -<A HREF="uala.html">`Uala</A> -<A HREF="uhi.html">Uhi</A> -<A HREF="ulu.html">`Ulu</A> -<A HREF="wauke.html">Wauke</A></FONT></TABLE></CENTER><A HREF="index.html"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="canostss.gif" BORDER="0"></A> Return to the <A HREF="index.html">Canoe Plants Home Page</A> or the <A HREF="index.html#contents">Table of Contents</A><P></HTML>

Simple were the days when <STRONG>ko</STRONG>, <STRONG>sugar cane</STRONG>, began its life here in Hawai`i, brought by <A HREF="index.html#pvs">Polynesian settlers in their canoes</A> sailing forth.  This plant travels well, plants easily, and is a pleasant addition to life.  Only later came the days when other settlers began to grow sugar cane commercially.  Modern-day hybrid sugar production causes concerns: to burn the fields or not, as their heat and the pollutants released all contribute to our personal health and the local and global environment...to eat the white sugar crystals that are processed from the original sap or not, as the overuse of this substance can become addictive and harmful to the health of many people...and, yet, the glorious beauty of fields of green cane waving in the trade winds cannot be denied.<P><STRONG>Ko</STRONG>, <STRONG><EM>Saccharum officinarum</EM></STRONG>, is a perennial grass that grows best at low elevations, but can be cultivated up to nearly the 3000 foot level.  <STRONG>Ko</STRONG> probably originated in Southeast Asia.  The unbranched stems or stalks are 1-2 inches thick and, like <A HREF="ohe.html">bamboo</A>, have clearly marked internodes.  The stems range in color from red to purple, and from a pale green to green with pink or with yellow striations.  The stalks are from 6 to 15-20 feet high, forming clumps as they grow.  The stalks tend to lean as they heighten and are blown by the wind.  Inside the stem is a fibrous and pithy material filled with sugar juice in the mature plant.  The 1-2 foot long leaves are smooth and narrow with a mid-rib, and have saw-toothed edges that can cut the skin if care is not taken in their presence.  The leaves droop and die at the lower stem and can be pulled off.  <STRONG>Ko</STRONG> matures in 12-15 months in the lowlands, and in 18-24 months at higher elevations.  After about 2 years the plant produces a silvery-rosy-lavender colored tassel at the end of the cane stem.  It is usually 1-2 feet long and signals the plant's maturity.  This is in the late autumn, around November-December in Hawai`i.  Sometimes the tassels are cut for decoration around the Christmas holiday season.  <P>In earlier times, the people of Hawai`i grew nearly 40 varieties of <STRONG>ko</STRONG>.  Some of them were grown in clumps near their homes.  These giant grasses were also planted on the embankments of the lo`i, <A HREF="kalo.html">taro</A> ponds.<P>A few varieties were used for medicines.  <STRONG>Ko</STRONG> sweetens many medicinal concoctions, and the juice of pan-toasted sugar cane can be used as a tonic for babies.<P>One of the few varieties used medicinally is kokea, white cane, a native cane with yellowish-green stem and a thin skin that can be easily removed or crushed.  This juice is popular as an ingredient in herbal combinations.  It helps to make bad-tasting medicine taste better.  Honua`ula, red cane, is also considered to have particular healing properties.<P>Young <STRONG>ko</STRONG> shoots were used for lacerations and cuts.  Along with other plants and salt, the shoots were wrapped in <A HREF="ki.html">ti</A> leaves and baked over charcoal.  The juice was then squeezed and placed on a cut.<P>The juices of <STRONG>ko</STRONG> are used to sweeten haupia and kulolo desserts, made of <A HREF="niu.html">coconut</A> and <A HREF="kalo.html">taro</A>, respectively.  The leaves of <STRONG>ko</STRONG> were used for inside house thatching, or for outside of pili grass wasn't available.  The flower stalks of sugar cane were used to fashion a dart, sometimes used during the Makahiki games.<P>This plant makes an effective windbreak, and is also planted as a hedge or border.  To propagate, plant sections of the mature upper portion of the stalk, using those pieces that have several nodes on them.  Each node will create a new stalk.  Dig a trench 6-8 inches deep and plant an 8-12 inch section sideways in the earth.  <STRONG>Ko</STRONG> likes a lot of sunshine and also moisture, and whenever possible, a rich soil.  Traditionally, <STRONG>sugar cane</STRONG> was planted in November-December.<P>For a treat, have a chew on a joint of your home-grown <STRONG>ko</STRONG>, the garden variety which has a thin rind and is easy to chew because of its soft pulp.  Or, when hiking, carry a section of <STRONG>ko</STRONG> along, to slake your thirst.<P><IMG SRC="hrcolor2.gif"><BR><P><CENTER><TABLE BORDER="2" CELLPADDING="2"><TR><TD ALIGN="center">The 24 "Canoe Plants" of Ancient Hawai`i</TD><TR><TR><TD ALIGN="center"><FONT SIZE="-1"><A HREF="ape.html">`Ape</A> -<A HREF="awa.html">`Awa</A> -<A HREF="awapuhi.html">`Awapuhi</A> -<A HREF="hau.html">Hau</A> -<A HREF="ipu.html">Ipu</A> -<A HREF="kalo.html">Kalo</A> -<A HREF="kamani.html">Kamani</A> -<A HREF="ki.html">Ki</A> -<A HREF="kou.html">Kou</A> -<A HREF="kukui.html">Kukui</A> -<A HREF="maia.html">Mai`a</A><BR><A HREF="milo.html">Milo</A> -<A HREF="niu.html">Niu</A> -<A HREF="noni.html">Noni</A> -<A HREF="ohe.html">`Ohe</A> -<A HREF="ohia.html">`Ohi`a `Ai</A> -<A HREF="olena.html">`Olena</A> -<A HREF="olona.html">Olona</A> -<A HREF="pia.html">Pia</A> -<A HREF="uala.html">`Uala</A> -<A HREF="uhi.html">Uhi</A> -<A HREF="ulu.html">`Ulu</A> -<A HREF="wauke.html">Wauke</A></FONT></TABLE></CENTER><A HREF="index.html"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="canostss.gif" BORDER="0"></A> Return to the <A HREF="index.html">Canoe Plants Home Page</A> or the <A HREF="index.html#contents">Table of Contents</A><P></HTML>

This plant grows easily and quickly from seed, preferring sunny warm coastal lowlands on the islands' leeward areas.  It was cultivated near settlements, and is only occasionally found in the wild forests.  Because of its thick wide crown of leaves, <STRONG>kou</STRONG> was a favorite shade tree near home sites.  Beneath its cool shelter, the women beat the <A HREF="wauke.html">kapa</A> cloth or would string lei, as they shared the day together.<P>The straight and erect trunk of <STRONG>kou</STRONG> is pale grey, with grooved and flaky or stringy bark.  Within the trunk can be found a heartwood with beautiful colored markings that are reddish dark brown, sometimes with a hint of purple.  The sapwood is straw color, with a tint of pink.  In the medium soft and durable wood are grain markings, some straight and some of which are wavy with dark and light lines and bands of yellow.  The texture is medium fine, and the density is considered medium.  The wood is long-lasting, and has little shrinkage.  Therefore, large and stable vessels can be made.  These were usually carved by the same men who made the wa`a, canoes.  These men knew how to season and how to gracefully shape the woods they used for the best and most practical purposes, and how to finish them so that a fine patina was achieved and their beauty would endure.  Because of the good workability of <STRONG>kou</STRONG>, it is fashioned into `umeke la`au, containers of wood, crafted with great skill, as well as being aesthetically pleasing.  <STRONG>`Umeke kou</STRONG>, food bowls, and specifically <A HREF="kalo.html">poi</A> bowls called `umeke `ai, platters called <STRONG>pa kou</STRONG>, and serving dishes of <STRONG>kou</STRONG> were all preferred, because there is no unpleasant taste in the sap that would flavor food.  Also made from <STRONG>kou</STRONG> wood were canoes, paddles, back scratchers, calabashes and boxes, fish hook containers and other carved objects, such as images of deities.<P><STRONG>Kou</STRONG> leaves are smooth, large and oval, with a pointed end and rounded base.  They are alternately arranged and are about 4 inches long.  The leaf stem is 1/2 to 3 inches long.  The leaves have wavy edges with prominent midrib and veins.  In the old days <STRONG>kou</STRONG> leaves were used to make a brown dye that was applied in designs on <A HREF="wauke.html">kapa</A>.  It is said that banyan (ficus) fruit was added to <STRONG>kou</STRONG> leaves to make a fine red dye for <A HREF="wauke.html">tapa</A> cloth.<P>The showy orange flowers of <STRONG>kou</STRONG> have no scent, and are one inch long, 1-2 inches across, with 5-7 lobes.  They grow in clusters on short stalks, and are used as a lei flower. <P>The fruit is nearly round, one inch long, growing in small clusters.  The green fruit changes color to yellow and then to black as they dry and become hard.  They contain a "stone" with 1-4 seeds.<P><STRONG>Kou</STRONG> occurs in ancient legends of Polynesia, one of which suggests that <STRONG>kou</STRONG> was one of the first trees created.<P><IMG SRC="hrcolor2.gif"><BR><P><CENTER><TABLE BORDER="2" CELLPADDING="2"><TR><TD ALIGN="center">The 24 "Canoe Plants" of Ancient Hawai`i</TD><TR><TR><TD ALIGN="center"><FONT SIZE="-1"><A HREF="ape.html">`Ape</A> -<A HREF="awa.html">`Awa</A> -<A HREF="awapuhi.html">`Awapuhi</A> -<A HREF="hau.html">Hau</A> -<A HREF="ipu.html">Ipu</A> -<A HREF="kalo.html">Kalo</A> -<A HREF="kamani.html">Kamani</A> -<A HREF="ki.html">Ki</A> -<A HREF="ko.html">Ko</A> -<A HREF="kukui.html">Kukui</A> -<A HREF="maia.html">Mai`a</A><BR><A HREF="milo.html">Milo</A> -<A HREF="niu.html">Niu</A> -<A HREF="noni.html">Noni</A> -<A HREF="ohe.html">`Ohe</A> -<A HREF="ohia.html">`Ohi`a `Ai</A> -<A HREF="olena.html">`Olena</A> -<A HREF="olona.html">Olona</A> -<A HREF="pia.html">Pia</A> -<A HREF="uala.html">`Uala</A> -<A HREF="uhi.html">Uhi</A> -<A HREF="ulu.html">`Ulu</A> -<A HREF="wauke.html">Wauke</A></FONT></TABLE></CENTER><A HREF="index.html"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="canostss.gif" BORDER="0"></A> Return to the <A HREF="index.html">Canoe Plants Home Page</A> or the <A HREF="index.html#contents">Table of Contents</A><P></HTML>

Over the years, I have come to love these ancestors that thrive here in Hawai`i Nei, some so large as 50 feet.  The tree is a symbol of enlightenment.<P>The seeds of this plant were brought to Hawai`i by the first <A HREF="index.html#pvs">Polynesian voyagers</A>.  Today this member of the Spurge family is the official symbol of the `Aha Kupuna, the Council of Elders of the Nation of Hawai`i.  Its scientific name is <STRONG><EM>Aleurites moluccana</STRONG></EM>. It grows wild in the lower mountain forest areas and is used in gardens as a shade tree, although it is a bit messy due to dropping its leaves and nuts.<P>The <STRONG>kukui</STRONG> nut has many uses.  Originally it was most valued for its light, the oil of the white kernels being extracted for its use in stone lamps and in ti leaf sheath torches.  The shelled nuts were skewered on a <A HREF="niu.html">coconut</A> frond mid-rib and lit one by one, from the top to bottom, as they set in a container of sand or dirt, or in the earth itself.  Often the children were given the responsibility for keeping the "candles" lit.  The tree is sometimes called the <STRONG>Candlenut Tree</STRONG>. The nuts are widely used as a traditional lei, both the hard shells of the polished black and the tan or brown, which are more rare.  The white flowers and leaves are also strung as lei, representing Moloka`i, whose symbolic color is silvery green.  The bark, flowers and nuts are all used for medicine.  As food, a small amount of the pounded roasted nuts, plus salt and sometimes chili peppers, is used as a relish and is called Inamona.<P>The small, five-petaled white flowers were chewed by the parents of a young child and given to the child to aid in healing of e`a (thrush) sores inside the mouth and upon the tongue.  Also used for this problem was the juicy sap that fills up the depression left when the stem is pulled off the green fruit.  This is applied with the finger and rubbed inside of the child's mouth and on the tongue.  The green fruit is the part of the plant that contains the nut.  This sap is also a healing application for chapped lips, cold sores and mild sunburn.<P>One mashed nut (sometimes the raw kernel, sometimes the roasted) or the sap of the green nut was often used in combination with other traditional Hawai`i medicinal plants, particularly when a purgative for constipation was needed.  The potency of this plant is so strong that these internal remedies are administered very carefully by those with experience in these matters.  The late Uncle Harry Mitchell of Keanae recommended the use of <STRONG>kukui</STRONG> nut for high blood pressure.  He suggested one teaspoon a day of the ground roasted kernel.<P>For bad cases of ulcers and other skin sores, the baked meat of ripe <STRONG>kukui</STRONG> nuts was pounded and mixed with other plants, such as ripe <A HREF="noni.html">noni</A> fruit.  In the treatment of rheumatic joints or deep bruises and wounds, <STRONG>kukui</STRONG> and <A HREF="noni.html">noni</A> leaves were wrapped around the afflicted places and heat applied by hot packs of salt, sand or rocks wrapped in <A HREF="wauke.html">tapa</A> cloth.<P>The inner bark provided a red-brown dye for <A HREF="wauke.html">tapa</A> cloth, while the gum from the bark strengthened the <A HREF="wauke.html">tapa</A>.  The soot (pau) of burned nuts provided a black dye for tattooing and for painting designs on canoes and on <A HREF="wauke.html">tapa</A> cloth.  The soft light-colored wood of the tree trunk was fashioned into canoes.  The oil provided a varnish similar to linseed oil.  <P>Roasted kernels, pulverized by fishermen while on the reef or in canoes, were blown upon the ocean surface where there were small ripples and waves.  The film increased underwater visibility by creating a lens on the water's surface.  Fishing nets were preserved by a coating of <STRONG>kukui</STRONG> oil.<P>The <STRONG>kukui</STRONG> tree is a classic example of the wisdom of ancient voyaging Polynesians.  The plants that they chose to bring on their canoes had to serve many useful purposes.  The <STRONG>kukui</STRONG> is such a plant.<P><IMG SRC="hrcolor2.gif"><BR><P><CENTER><TABLE BORDER="2" CELLPADDING="2"><TR><TD ALIGN="center">The 24 "Canoe Plants" of Ancient Hawai`i</TD><TR><TR><TD ALIGN="center"><FONT SIZE="-1"><A HREF="ape.html">`Ape</A> -<A HREF="awa.html">`Awa</A> -<A HREF="awapuhi.html">`Awapuhi</A> -<A HREF="hau.html">Hau</A> -<A HREF="ipu.html">Ipu</A> -<A HREF="kalo.html">Kalo</A> -<A HREF="kamani.html">Kamani</A> -<A HREF="ki.html">Ki</A> -<A HREF="ko.html">Ko</A> -<A HREF="kou.html">Kou</A> -<A HREF="maia.html">Mai`a</A><BR><A HREF="milo.html">Milo</A> -<A HREF="niu.html">Niu</A> -<A HREF="noni.html">Noni</A> -<A HREF="ohe.html">`Ohe</A> -<A HREF="ohia.html">`Ohi`a `Ai</A> -<A HREF="olena.html">`Olena</A> -<A HREF="olona.html">Olona</A> -<A HREF="pia.html">Pia</A> -<A HREF="uala.html">`Uala</A> -<A HREF="uhi.html">Uhi</A> -<A HREF="ulu.html">`Ulu</A> -<A HREF="wauke.html">Wauke</A></FONT></TABLE></CENTER><A HREF="index.html"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="canostss.gif" BORDER="0"></A> Return to the <A HREF="index.html">Canoe Plants Home Page</A> or the <A HREF="index.html#contents">Table of Contents</A><P></HTML>

The <STRONG>banana</STRONG> is an essential to Pacific island life.  It is a staple food brought to Hawai`i by the earliest <A HREF="index.html#pvs">canoes of Polynesian settlers</A>.  Although it is said to have originated in India, it is at the heart of myth and stories world-wide.  Some say this plant grew in the garden of Eden.<P>Polynesian legends, proverbs and similes abound about <STRONG>mai`a</STRONG>.  Hawai`i legend tells that a brother of Pele brought the <STRONG>banana</STRONG> to Hawai`i from Tahiti.  It is believed to be bad luck to dream of <STRONG>bananas</STRONG>, to meet someone who carries them, or to bring them on a fishing trip.  Some similes speak of a person's skin being like a ripe <STRONG>banana</STRONG> or of a person being as beautiful as a young <STRONG>banana</STRONG> leaf.  Many tales regard the <STRONG>banana</STRONG> plant as a person.  <STRONG>Mai`a</STRONG> is kinolau, the body form, of Kanaloa, the Hawaiian god of healing.<P>There are more than 50 varieties of <STRONG><EM>Musa paradisiaca</STRONG></EM>.  Descendants of the early plants are now growing wild in protected valleys, stream gullies and mountain slopes.  This common edible fruit native to the tropics ripens all year.  Diseases and pests are rare.<P><STRONG>Bananas</STRONG> are not really a tree, but are a gigantic herb, being a member of the grass family, like wheat, rye and barley.  The fibrous stems, trunks that may be as tall as 20 feet, are up to 8 inches in diameter and are made up of overlapping leaf bases (sheaths).   A cross section of the succulent trunk looks like a huge onion slice.  The leaves are spirally arranged, rising higher than the stems.  Tightly rolled at first, they push their way outward, lubricated by a white waxy powder.  The leaf stems become thick, with smooth large blades, usually 4 or more feet long and 1-2 feet wide.  These are entire at first, appearing as large rounded blades.  They soon split along parallel side veins to appear like a large feather.<P>After the plant reaches full growth, a flower cluster forces its way up through the compressed layers of the leaf sheaths that make up the trunk.  The flowers are borne on a thick erect or drooping stem, issuing from the top of the trunk or at the center of the leaf cluster, commonly in flat groups under a large dark to light colored purple-red or green bract.  Male flowers are at the stem tip, female flowers at the stem base.  The calyx is tubular, soon splitting on one side.  There is a corolla with one petal and approximately 6 stamen.  The flowers set fruit without pollination and then drop their purple leathery petals one by one.  It takes about a year for the plant to produce mature fruit.  Each healthy <STRONG>banana</STRONG> plant bears 5 to 9 rows, or hands, of <STRONG>bananas</STRONG>.<P>To harvest the fruit the entire trunk is cut down, often with one or two swipes of a machete.  This can occur when the first <STRONG>bananas</STRONG> turn yellow, or earlier if the <STRONG>bananas</STRONG> are to be used for cooking, rather than eating while ripe.  The trunk is then chopped up and placed as necessary mulch around the base of the clump.  Before mulching, one might seek out the <STRONG>banana's</STRONG> heart, which is a round cylindrical white tube with a smooth shiny cover.  This lies inside the layers of bark fiber.  It can be cooked and is like celery, with a texture and taste similar to <A HREF="ohe.html">bamboo</A> shoots.  Fruit varies in size, shape, color, quality and quantity.  The pulp may be white, yellow or shades of pink.  The raw mature fruit is a sugar and an easily digested source of carbohydrate.  The cooked fruit becomes a starch.  Green unripe <STRONG>bananas</STRONG> can be boiled or baked in their skins, and are usually eaten as a starch, replacing potatoes, bread or <A HREF="kalo.html">taro</A>.  Surplus ripe <STRONG>bananas</STRONG> can be peeled and frozen for later use.  They can also be sun-dried on screens, or in an indoor oven or dehydrator machine.<P><STRONG>Bananas</STRONG> are a good source of potassium and vitamin A, contain some vitamin B, and a fair amount of vitamin C.  They are a fair source of phosphorus and contain some calcium and iron.<P>Except for two varieties, <STRONG>bananas</STRONG> were kapu, forbidden for women of Hawai`i to eat under penalty of death until the early l800's.<P>New plants develop quickly from underground stems, usually forming clumps of plants.  The new plants are called keiki, children.  The <STRONG>mai`a</STRONG> rhizome puts forth pohuli, suckers.  Cutting out and transplanting excess pohuli helps to promote fruit production.  Keeping two keiki per parent plant seems to work out best.  The Hawai`i way is to give extra plants to a friend's garden or to plant them in the wild for times of scarcity.  Traditionally, <STRONG>mai`a</STRONG> was planted in clumps around the <A HREF="kalo.html">taro</A> lo`i, pond fields, as well as near to dwelling sites.<P>There are many planting rituals, times and beliefs to ensure productivity.  Sometimes planting occurs on the night of the full moon, when the moon is shining straight into the hole.  Some people plant at high noon, so that the <STRONG>banana</STRONG> sill contain the shadow and the strength will go into the trunk and fruit.<P>In order to plant, dig a large deep hole, as large as an arm, from elbow to fingertips, ha`ilima.  This depth is important to support the shallow root system.  For proper propagation, the hole needs good drainage and to be in a place protected from strong winds.  <STRONG>Mai`a</STRONG> appear to be sturdy, but have no wood in them for support.  They are pure fiber and are 80% water.  Copious amounts of water are required to bring these plants to maturity.  They also thrive on humus, mulch and plenty of sunshine. <P><STRONG>Mai`a</STRONG> has multitudinous uses, in addition to food.  Every part of this plant is useful.  Leaves: for house roofs, umbrellas and rain hats, as a truce flag, bowl covers, table cloths and temporary mats, cigarette papers, clothing and temporary sandals, dyes, packing material, cattle feed, and as covering for the earth oven, imu, to hold in the heat.  Leaf buds: as a vegetable.  Leaf sheaths: for water runways, and as containers for lei and plants being transported.  Leaf sheath fiber: thatching, stringing lei, tying, plaiting into clothing, cloth and thread.  Trunks: to aid canoes as rollers enroute from the shore to the sea; and the stalks of a mature felled tree are placed in the imu to add moisture and to create steam in the cooking process.<P>Medicinally, the ripe fruit of <STRONG>mai`a</STRONG> is used for asthma.  Boiled ripe <STRONG>banana</STRONG> fruit can be mashed and taken for constipation, especially when mixed with other recommended plants.  For strengthening babies, vitamin-rich nectar sap is pinched from the flower bud.  Bud juice is used for stomach problems in people of all ages.  In the old days, this juice was also used to dye <A HREF="wauke.html">tapa</A> cloth.  Perhaps the most popular use of <STRONG>mai`a</STRONG> medicinally is as a poultice for wounds.  This can be made of the pounded peels of ripe <STRONG>bananas</STRONG>.  There are antibiotic properties in the inside of the peel that are said to be effective against bacteria.  Wrap the peel, inside out, around a cut or wound in an emergency.<P><STRONG>Bananas</STRONG> teach us patience as they grow and ripen slowly.  <STRONG>Bananas</STRONG> do not fruit in a single day.  <EM>`A `ohe hua o ka <STRONG>mai`a</STRONG> i ka la ho`okahi</EM> .<P><IMG SRC="hrcolor2.gif"><BR><P><CENTER><TABLE BORDER="2" CELLPADDING="2"><TR><TD ALIGN="center">The 24 "Canoe Plants" of Ancient Hawai`i</TD><TR><TR><TD ALIGN="center"><FONT SIZE="-1"><A HREF="ape.html">`Ape</A> -<A HREF="awa.html">`Awa</A> -<A HREF="awapuhi.html">`Awapuhi</A> -<A HREF="hau.html">Hau</A> -<A HREF="ipu.html">Ipu</A> -<A HREF="kalo.html">Kalo</A> -<A HREF="kamani.html">Kamani</A> -<A HREF="ki.html">Ki</A> -<A HREF="ko.html">Ko</A> -<A HREF="kou.html">Kou</A> -<A HREF="kukui.html">Kukui</A> -<BR><A HREF="milo.html">Milo</A> -<A HREF="niu.html">Niu</A> -<A HREF="noni.html">Noni</A> -<A HREF="ohe.html">`Ohe</A> -<A HREF="ohia.html">`Ohi`a `Ai</A> -<A HREF="olena.html">`Olena</A> -<A HREF="olona.html">Olona</A> -<A HREF="pia.html">Pia</A> -<A HREF="uala.html">`Uala</A> -<A HREF="uhi.html">Uhi</A> -<A HREF="ulu.html">`Ulu</A> -<A HREF="wauke.html">Wauke</A></FONT></TABLE></CENTER><A HREF="index.html"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="canostss.gif" BORDER="0"></A> Return to the <A HREF="index.html">Canoe Plants Home Page</A> or the <A HREF="index.html#contents">Table of Contents</A><P></HTML>

It is told that the Waikiki home of Kamehameha I was surrounded by <STRONG>milo</STRONG> trees.<P>Although rare today, in old Hawai`i <STRONG>milo</STRONG> was a commonly found tree, cultivated as a shade plant around homes near sunny coastal areas with loose soil.  It does not grow in the high inland forests.<P>Brought to these islands by early <A HREF="index.html#pvs">Polynesian settlers</A> who carried the seeds, this fast-growing evergreen tree was planted around the temples in Tahiti, as it was said to be spiritually connected to the chant and to prayer.  It is a widespread species throughout Polynesia and Micronesia, as well as tropical Africa.  <P><STRONG>Milo's</STRONG> scientific name is <STRONG><EM>Thespia populnea</STRONG></EM>, and it is also known as a portia tree.  A member of the Hibiscus family, the malvacceae, it is a close relative of <A HREF="hau.html">hau</A>, `ilima, and ma`o, Hawai`i cotton.<P>The bark of <STRONG>milo</STRONG> was used for cordage fiber, similarly to <A HREF="hau.html">hau</A>, but it is inferior in quality to <A HREF="hau.html">hau</A> and to <A HREF="olona.html">olona</A>.  The tree also yields tannin, dye, oil, medicine and gum, from various parts of the plant.  The <STRONG>milo</STRONG> wood was skillfully crafted into <A HREF="kalo.html">poi</A> bowls called `umeke `ai, and into plates, too.  Calabashes/bowls of <A HREF="kou.html">kou</A> wood were more highly prized than those of <STRONG>milo</STRONG>, and were more often used.<P>`Umeke `ai is an honored implement in a Hawai`i home, for through the ceremony of eating <A HREF="kalo.html">poi</A> one at a time from the bowl at the center, the traditions and protocol of Kanaka Maoli is maintained. The `umeke `ai filled with <A HREF="kalo.html">kalo (taro)</A> is considered the means of survival of the people of Hawai`i Nei.  <P>`Umeke la`au is the Hawai`i name for these containers or calabashes of wood, which were used for the storage, transport and serving of food in various stages of preparation.  <STRONG>Milo</STRONG> wood is flavorless, because it is lacking in any unpleasant-tasting sap that could contaminate stored food.<P>The <STRONG>milo</STRONG> tree is a small to medium-sized one, growing to less than 40 feet high.  The trunk can be 2 feet in diameter at full maturity.  The bark is corrugated, with scaly twigs.  The branches are widely spread and usually horizontal, making for an ideal shade tree.  The glossy heart-shaped leaves are 3-5 inches across.  Young leaves are edible.  Bell-shaped pale yellow flowers with maroon or purple centers turn purplish-pink as they with in their short one day hibiscus life.  Following the flowering stage, the one inch diameter seeds grow in globular 5-celled woody cases that have downy hairs on their surface.  These remain on the plant for sometime, and only ripen in areas of dry climate.<P><STRONG>Milo</STRONG> wood has an attractive grain that takes to a high polish and, in addition to food utensils and containers, was fashioned into paddles and other carved objects, as well as for an occasional canoe, although koa was considered to be the most popular material for canoes.<P><IMG SRC="hrcolor2.gif"><BR><P><CENTER><TABLE BORDER="2" CELLPADDING="2"><TR><TD ALIGN="center">The 24 "Canoe Plants" of Ancient Hawai`i</TD><TR><TR><TD ALIGN="center"><FONT SIZE="-1"><A HREF="ape.html">`Ape</A> -<A HREF="awa.html">`Awa</A> -<A HREF="awapuhi.html">`Awapuhi</A> -<A HREF="hau.html">Hau</A> -<A HREF="ipu.html">Ipu</A> -<A HREF="kalo.html">Kalo</A> -<A HREF="kamani.html">Kamani</A> -<A HREF="ki.html">Ki</A> -<A HREF="ko.html">Ko</A> -<A HREF="kou.html">Kou</A> -<A HREF="kukui.html">Kukui</A> -<A HREF="maia.html">Mai`a</A><BR><A HREF="niu.html">Niu</A> -<A HREF="noni.html">Noni</A> -<A HREF="ohe.html">`Ohe</A> -<A HREF="ohia.html">`Ohi`a `Ai</A> -<A HREF="olena.html">`Olena</A> -<A HREF="olona.html">Olona</A> -<A HREF="pia.html">Pia</A> -<A HREF="uala.html">`Uala</A> -<A HREF="uhi.html">Uhi</A> -<A HREF="ulu.html">`Ulu</A> -<A HREF="wauke.html">Wauke</A></FONT></TABLE></CENTER><A HREF="index.html"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="canostss.gif" BORDER="0"></A> Return to the <A HREF="index.html">Canoe Plants Home Page</A> or the <A HREF="index.html#contents">Table of Contents</A><P></HTML>

This tree is strong, resilient and can provide us with our most basic need for life - water!  I am told that the most sterile water on earth is from this nut.  There are stories of island and coastal people surviving months of drought with this the only drinking water available.  Coconut water and fish can provide sustenance.<P><STRONG><EM>Coco nucifer</EM></STRONG>, <STRONG>niu's</STRONG> scientific and botanical name, is slender and tall, up to 100 feet, with a cluster of leaves at the top of a slightly curved stem or trunk.  It has a swollen base which is ringed, making a perfect ladder for the very agile.  These steps mark points of attachment of the fallen leaf fronds, which are from 10 to 18 feet long.  The trunk is very strong and elastic, and is able to bend in heavy winds.  In times of hurricanes the coconut palm has been a life saver.  People lashing themselves to this flexible tree have avoided being swept out to sea.  <P>Hawai`i is on the edge of the coconut belt.  The coconut bears better nearer the equator, where it is more widely used than here.  In Hawai`i there are other plants, native and introduced, that provide as well for people's needs.  <STRONG>Niu</STRONG> was valued cargo on the sailing canoes of the original <A HREF="index.html#pvs">Polynesian voyagers</A> to Hawai`i Nei.  Some of the ancestors of our trees also floated ashore, alive for up to 4 months at sea, still able to germinate. Coconuts grow well near the ocean, thriving in sandy soil near salt spray.  Maui's Hana coast has the remnants of many ancient groves. <P>This palm is the most useful plant of the tropics.  It is said that more uses are made of it than any other tree in the world.  Besides drink, food and shade, <STRONG>niu</STRONG> offers the possibilities of housing, thatching, hats, baskets, furniture, mats, cordage, clothing, charcoal, brooms, fans, ornaments, musical instruments, shampoo, containers, implements and oil for fuel, light, ointments, soap and more.  <P>Traditionally, a coconut palm is planted at the birth time of a kama`aina.  The tree bears fruit around the seventh birthday, for up to 70-100 years, providing food for a human lifetime.  There may be up to 50 fruit a year.  A he`e, octopus, was often planted in the bottom of the hole, furnishing fertilizer and giving the plant the idea of roots that spread and grip, and a body that is fat and round.<P>Nectar-producing fountaining flowers, in a spathe, bloom at any time of year.  The budding flower sprays are tapped for their sap, which can yield sweet syrup, vinegar or wine.  Left untrimmed, the tree continually produces a prodigious number of nuts, with mature fruit constantly available.  It takes 15 months from flower to mature fruit, but the nut (drupe) is usable at about 5 months.  The mature fruit is 10 to 12 inches long, usually with 3 sides, having a thick fibrous husk encasing the hard-shelled, one seeded nut.  There are 3 pores at one end.  One pore may be easily punched to obtain the water.  <P>The perfect drinking nut is full-sized, yet immature.  It is green, with no trace of yellow color, and it must be picked.  Up to one quart of water is inside, but you can't hear it when you shake it.  The yellow or browning coconut is mature when it drops to the ground.  There is still some water in the cavity, which can be combined to make coconut milk.  Coconut milk is a blend of coconut water and the scrapings of the coconut meat.  This milk is a good source of iron and contains calcium, phosphorus, protein and vitamins.<P>Coconut water, like the <A HREF="kalo.html">taro</A>, is an alkali producer in the digestive system and therefore helps in the important balancing of pH in the human body.  Often, a too-acidic body is prone to disease, whereas if the pH is balanced with alkaline-producing foods, the body is more prone to stay in good health.<P>As food, the <STRONG>niu</STRONG> flesh or meat is used for different purposes, depending upon the maturity of the nut.  The jelly-like spoon meat of a green nut is called `o`io.  The next stage is haohao, when the shell is still white and the flesh soft and white.  Half ripe, at the ho`ilikole state, it is eaten raw with Hawai`i red salt and <A HREF="kalo.html">poi</A>.  At the o`o stage, the nut is mature, but the husk not dried.  The flesh of a mature nut at the malo`o stage is used to make coconut cream, which when mixed with <A HREF="kalo.html">kalo/taro</A> makes a dish called kulolo; with <A HREF="uala.html">`uala/sweet potato</A> it is called poipalau; and paipaiee with ripe <A HREF="ulu.html">`ulu/breadfruit</A>.  These delicious dessert-like foods were traditionally cooked in the imu, underground oven.  Haupia is made with <STRONG>niu</STRONG> cream mixed with <A HREF="pia.html">pia/Polynesian arrowroot</A>, traditionally wrapped in <A HREF="ki.html">ki/ti</A> leaves and baked in the imu.  The mature meat of coconut is also grated, squeezed or scraped to be cooked in main dishes with fish, chicken or greens.<P>Medicinally, a small piece of coconut meat was chewed following the ingestion of disagreeable tasting medicines.  Fishermen also chewed the meat and spit the oil onto the water, to produce a glossy calm place, smooth enough to spot the fish below the surface.<P>The malo`o stage is also the stage for planting.  Propagation is by planting the whole coconut, usually at its growing site.  It is easy to determine the top of the nut by floating it in water.  Plant it with this side up, partially cover and keep moist.  Germination occurs in four to five months.<P>If the <STRONG>coconut</STRONG> is to be transplanted, germination should be atop wide screening or loose rocks to prevent the roots from taking hold.  The plant should be moved before it is a foot high.  The plant responds well to organic fertilization and mulching, particularly as it later begins to bear.<P>The <STRONG>coconut</STRONG> heart is sometimes eaten as a vegetable, when a felled tree presents itself.  The heart is located just below the crown of leaves, and can be as long as a human leg.  It keeps fresh for about two weeks.  The iho, spongy pulp, in a sprouting nut is also considered choice food.<P><EM>Wahi ka <STRONG>niu</STRONG></EM>, break open the<STRONG> coconut!</STRONG><P><IMG SRC="hrcolor2.gif"><BR><P><CENTER><TABLE BORDER="2" CELLPADDING="2"><TR><TD ALIGN="center">The 24 "Canoe Plants" of Ancient Hawai`i</TD><TR><TR><TD ALIGN="center"><FONT SIZE="-1"><A HREF="ape.html">`Ape</A> -<A HREF="awa.html">`Awa</A> -<A HREF="awapuhi.html">`Awapuhi</A> -<A HREF="hau.html">Hau</A> -<A HREF="ipu.html">Ipu</A> -<A HREF="kalo.html">Kalo</A> -<A HREF="kamani.html">Kamani</A> -<A HREF="ki.html">Ki</A> -<A HREF="ko.html">Ko</A> -<A HREF="kou.html">Kou</A> -<A HREF="kukui.html">Kukui</A> -<A HREF="maia.html">Mai`a</A><BR><A HREF="milo.html">Milo</A> -<A HREF="noni.html">Noni</A> -<A HREF="ohe.html">`Ohe</A> -<A HREF="ohia.html">`Ohi`a `Ai</A> -<A HREF="olena.html">`Olena</A> -<A HREF="olona.html">Olona</A> -<A HREF="pia.html">Pia</A> -<A HREF="uala.html">`Uala</A> -<A HREF="uhi.html">Uhi</A> -<A HREF="ulu.html">`Ulu</A> -<A HREF="wauke.html">Wauke</A></FONT></TABLE></CENTER><A HREF="index.html"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="canostss.gif" BORDER="0"></A> Return to the <A HREF="index.html">Canoe Plants Home Page</A> or the <A HREF="index.html#contents">Table of Contents</A><P></HTML>

This is a fascinating plant, demanding of our respect.  Its prolific beauty, bearing fruit year round...as if to say, "here I am, please use me."  However, as you may already be aware, few of us are willing to make its intimate acquaintance.  The aroma of its fruit is truly awesome.  Some say "disgusting" or "horrid" or "stinks bad" or worse.  And, it doesn't taste good either!  Yet, it is well-known to be one of the main healers among the traditional Hawai`i medicinal plants.  It is said that this plant food is to be used when we are feeling really ill or really old.
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="noni-line.gif" VSPACE=4 HSPACE=8>
The <STRONG>noni</STRONG>, also known as <STRONG>Indian Mulberry</STRONG>, with the scientific name of <STRONG><EM>Morinda citrifolia</STRONG></EM>, is a small evergreen shrub or tree, usually less than 10 feet high, occasionally up to 20 feet.  The conspicuous large dark green shiny leaves are generally paired, except where forming fruit.  Thick and oval in shape, they are deep veined, short-stemmed and 8 inches or longer.  The flowers form in globose heads, about an inch long and bearing many small white flowers.  The flower heads grow to become mature fruit, 3 to 4 inches in diameter.  The fruits resemble those of <A HREF="ulu.html">`ulu, breadfruit</A>, only smaller.  The surface is divided into somewhat warty polygonal pitted cells.  The <STRONG>noni</STRONG> fruit begins green, turns yellow, and as mentioned, has an unpleasant, insipid, foul or fetid odor, especially as it ripens to whiteness and falls from the tree.
<P>
In the early morning, the best time to pick most plants, I carry  a gallon glass jar like the institutional ones for pickles, and pule (pray with) the plant, thanking it for its food.  I pick the fruit at its yellow stage, filling the jar and capping it tightly.  I place the jar in a sunny spot, letting it set there for five days to a week or more, until the fruit turns to mush and sun-charged juices drain into the bottom of the jar.  It is these juices that can be strained into a cleaner smaller jar, and then refrigerated until used.  
<P>
Another method taught by Hawai`i's healers is to pick the fruit before ripe, letting it ripen within the home.  When soft, place it in a blender with a little fresh water and make into a sauce.  Then mash and strain through a sieve.  This concoction can be refrigerated in a clean glass jar, and the person who wishes the medicine can take a clean straw and slurp two sucks from the jar, in the morning and in the evening.
<P>
As a medicine, the fruit and its juices have been used in the treatment of diabetes, heart troubles and high blood pressure, with different portions prescribed for different illnesses.
<P>
The juices can be diluted with clean water or a fruit juice such as apple, and drunk before meals and at resting periods.  Treatment should always be at a relaxed time, not before going to work.  It is good to seek the advice of an Hawai`i health practitioner before using any plant medicines.  <STRONG>Noni</STRONG> is believed to have been brought here centuries ago by early <A HREF="index.html#pvs">Polynesian settlers</A>, and is a native of the Pacific islands, Asia and Australia.
<P>
The late Uncle Harry Mitchell of Keanae, Maui, suggested using <STRONG>noni</STRONG> with garlic, both being great blood purifiers and cleansers of bacteria from the body.  He also mentioned boiling it for use with diabetes, and using it strained raw for heart problems and high blood pressure, as it is said to increase the flow of blood.
<P>
The young unripe fruit can be pounded thoroughly with salt and the mixture placed carefully on deep cuts and on broken bones.  Sometimes the juice is squeezed out of this mixture, boiled and applied to the wounds.  The ripe fruit can be used as a poultice for facial blemishes, rubbed until the oil disappears, and also to draw out the pus and core from an infected sore or boil, such as with a staph infection.  In the old days, this was tied on with a bandage of <A HREF="wauke.html">tapa bark</A> cloth.  The dressing of <STRONG>noni</STRONG> could be reapplied more than once for difficult cases.
<P>
There are those that eat <STRONG>noni's</STRONG> fruit unripened, either as a food in times of scarcity, or as a tonic when needed.  Other people make a tea using the leaves of this plant.  The fruit was used in a recipe for a reputed remedy against tuberculosis, arthritis, rheumatism and the changes of old age.  The leaves and bark of the stem were pounded and strained, resulting in a liquid drunk as a tonic or for urinary disorders, muscle and joint pain.  The juice of the fruit was applied to the hair to rid it of head lice, uku, followed whenever possible by a fragrant shampoo of <A HREF="awapuhi.html">`awapuhi kuahiwi</A> or <A HREF="niu.html">coconut</A> water.  
<P>
Other uses for this ancient Polynesian plant: the bark yields a red dye, while a yellow dye can be prepared from the root.  Both colors were use to dye the <A HREF="wauke.html">tapa</A> cloth of the chiefs of ancient Hawai`i.
<P>
Cultivation is either by seed or cutting.  <STRONG>Noni</STRONG> is a valuable plant to have nearby the home of anyone wishing to utilize the many natural healing properties of this remarkable life sustaining plant.

<H1>Elders Gather to Discuss Establishment of Hawaii Provisional Government</H1>
<STRONG>Maui Press<BR>
March 18-24, 1994</STRONG>
</CENTER>
<P>
by Robert McCabe
<P>
Hawaiian elders representing each of Hawaii's islands convened at the Kaanapali Beach Hotel for a three-day meeting early this month to discuss the establishment of a provisional government serving an independent and sovereign nation of Hawaii.
<P>
The meeting, hosted by the Maui chapter of the Ohana Council, one of the many groups formed in recent years to promote the restoration of Hawaiian nationhood and sovereign rights, was described as a plenary session, the first of its kind, since the <A HREF="publawsum.html">U.S. government officially apologized</A> for its takeover of these islands more than a hundred years ago.
<P>
The purpose of the convention was to bring together the kupuna (elders) of Hawaii to discuss the formation of the `Aha Kupuna (Council of Elders) as the interim Government of Hawaii Nei.
<P>
Information and decisions regarding the meeting are being withheld for the time being, according to Kekula Bray of the Ohana's Maui Council who issued the following statement:
<P>
"We are not releasing information at this time.  There will be a reconvening of the whole in 90 days.  There will be additional sessions leading up to the `Aha Kanawai Kumu.  We will be prepared to give information at that time."
<P>
The `Aha Kanawai Kumu, Bray explained, is a "coming together to form an organic document of principles and laws."  Such a document will provide the foundation for the new government serving an independent and sovereign Hawaiian nation.
<P>
The March 4-5-6 `Aha Hui No Ea (plenary session) was attended by representatives of the many diverse Native Hawaiian organizations pursuing the sovereignty issue.  These organizations include Ka Lahui, the Kingdom of Hawaii, Laie, and the Big Island's Free Association, as well as elders of the Ohana Council.
<P>
Regarded as one of the most important meetings so far held pertaining to the sovereignty issue, Bray said it brought together 500 people from all the islands.
<P>
Maui was chosen as the site for the conference "because the Maui Council offered to host it," Bray said.
<P>
"We are the only island where we are together on all levels, despite some differences of opinion, but our purpose was also to promote our togetherness and to emphasize a <A HREF="aloha.html">spirit of Aloha</A> in which if love and understanding is spread, we will have an easier time accomplishing our goals," she added.
<P>
Before the conference started, <A HREF="puuport.gif">Bumpy Kanahele</A> of Waimanalo, a leader of the Ohana Council, stressed in an interview with this writer that the convention's main intent was to "get our kupuna together, so that we can unify and develop our nation."
<P>
He said also that the future of a new Hawaiian nation "rests with our elders," and that the Ohana's actions of the past, including measures regarded as highly controversial such as the distribution of leaflets to visitors asking them to stay away, served to stimulate the approaches now being considered.
<P>
"What's going to happen next is that we are all ready to pledge allegiance and alliance to the Kupuna and Akua, and we'd take it from there.  We are also trying to put the horse before the cart, and we'll follow whatever it takes so we can unify and develop our country," Kanahele said.
<P>
He explained also that the process that are undertaking "in necessary so we can deal with the State government, and give them instructions on how to do things, because we understand they are illegal now.  This process enables us to say this is our government.  It gives us authority and jurisdiction, and it's the only measure left other than violence, which we naturally eschew because it's not the way of <A HREF="aloha.html">Aloha</A>."
<P>
Kanahele said the government of a new Hawaiian nation would be based on cultural values dating from the time before western contact in 1778 and that the government of a Sovereign Hawaii would be led by the elders.

Votre Excellence,
<P>
En tant que chef d' Etat de la nation ind&eacute;pendante d'Hawai`i, et conforme &agrave; notre proclamation d'Ind&eacute;pendance et &agrave; notre constitution, je dois protester tr&egrave;s energiquement contre votre d&eacute;cision de reprendre les tests nucl&eacute;aires &agrave; Mururoa.
 C'est un acte criminel contre l'humanit&eacute;, un acte de colonialisme
nucl&eacute;aire et de racisme environmentale.
<P>
L'&eacute;vidence historique nous d&eacute;montre clairement l'effet d&eacute;vastateur des tests nucl&eacute;aires sur l'environment des &icirc;les de l'oc&eacute;an Pacifique et sur les habitants de cette r&eacute;gion. De continuer &agrave; faire ces tests, n'est pas la solution aux crises et besoins complexes de notre plan&egrave;te.
<P>
Le moment est venu pour tous les peuples du Pacifique de s'unifier pour prot&eacute;ger notre oc&eacute;an et les fondementaux droits humains. Le moment est venu pour le monde de vivre en paix!
<P>
Je vous parle avec l'authorit&eacute; morale des Anciens Sages (Kupuna). <EM>Nous ne pouvons jamais &eacute;carter ou  separer notre immortel amour,  notre connection ou  nos attaches sacr&eacute;es de l'Esprit de notre Terre, Aloha `Aina, qui est le coeur et la vie de toutes esp&egrave;ces vivantes. Nous devons prot&eacute;ger notre terre sacr&eacute;e d'une telle invasion et exploitation, de la lib&eacute;rer de ces forces ali&eacute;n&eacute;es destructives et de pr&eacute;server et de prot&eacute;ger notre h&eacute;ritage culturel pass&eacute; par nos g&eacute;n&eacute;rations pr&eacute;c&eacute;dente, contre une extinction d&eacute;vastatrice. </EM> (<A HREF="proclamsum.html">Proclamation, January 16, 1994</A>) 

<P>
En priant, nous vous supplions de retourner sur votre d&eacute;cision et de
laisser le monde savoir que vous allez retirer toute pr&eacute;sence nucl&eacute;aire et militaire dans le Pacifique. Votre contribution dans l'histoire du Monde sera en dessous de toutes calculations. Merci pour consid&eacute;rer l'urgence et l'importance de nos inqui&eacute;tudes.

Your Excellency,
<P>
As Head of State of the independent Nation of Hawai`i, and pursuant to our Proclamation of Independence and our Constitution, I must make the strongest possible protest to your intended resumption of nuclear testing at Muroroa.  It is a criminal act against humanity, an act of nuclear colonialism and environmental racism.
<P>
Historical evidence clearly demonstrates the devastating impact of nuclear testing in the Pacific Ocean/Islands environment and upon the people of this region.  Further nuclear testing is not the answer to resolving our earth's complex needs and crises.  The time has come for the peoples of the Pacific to unify in protection of our ocean continent and fundamental human rights.  It is time for our entire human family to live in peace.
<P>
I speak to you with the moral authority of the Ancient Wise Ones (Kupuna).  <EM>We can never depart or separate our undying love, our connection or our sacred ties from the Spirit of the Land, Aloha `Aina, which is the heart and the life of all living things.  We must protect our sacred `aina (land) from such invasion and exploitation, to liberate it from alien destructive forces and preserve and protect our cultural heritage for generations from the devastation of extinction.</EM>  (<A HREF="proclamsum.html">Proclamation, January 16, 1994</A>)
<P>
We prayerfully appeal to you to reverse your decision and to make known to all the world that you will withdraw all nuclear and military presence in the Pacific.  Your contribution to world history will be beyond calculation.  Thank you for seriously considering the depth and urgency of our concern.
<P>
<UL>
On behalf of the People of Hawai`i,<BR>
Aloha,
<P>
Pu`uhonua B. Kanahele

</HEAD>
<BODY>
<P>
Visitors to Hawai`i's famed Waikiki Beach were
reminded Sept. 3 that tests of humanity's most awesome and
destructive weapons are once again threatening the peoples of the
South Pacific.
<P>
Many tourists cheered and some, particularly Japanese, joined a
1,500-strong column of anti-nuclear marchers as it passed
Honolulu's luxury beachfront hotels. The protesters wound their
way from Ala Moana Park to Kapi`olani Park, where President Bill
Clinton was speaking.
<P>
Some marchers were from Tahiti and other islands of Polynesia
where French imperialism rules with colonial arrogance. At the
time of the protest, France had announced its intention to
explode seven or eight nuclear bombs at Mururoa Atoll beginning
some time in September.
<P>
The first bomb was detonated on Sept. 5.

<H2>Sovereignty and no nukes</H2>

A strong contingent in the Honolulu march came from
the group Nation of Hawai`i, which is struggling for sovereignty.
Its members carried a banner reading "Jail nukes, free Bumpy," in
reference to the <A HREF="political_prisoner.html">recent arrest of their leader, Dennis "Bumpy"
Kanahele</A>.
<P>
Kanahele refuses to accept U.S. government jurisdiction over the
Hawai`ian people.
<P>
Other sovereignty groups were also present. The Pro-Kanaka Maoli
Independence Working Group distributed a special newsletter
devoted to stopping nuclear explosions in the Pacific.
<P>
Many slogans and chants linked the anti-nuclear struggle with the
national rights of the Pacific island peoples.
<P>
The march was called by the <A HREF="http://www.maui.net/~babblero/hcant/">Hawai`i Coalition Against Nuclear
Testing</A> and was endorsed by 46 organizations across the political
spectrum. Coalition leaders wanted to focus only on the French
testing and hoped to get a friendly audience with Clinton, who
was speaking at the Waikiki Shell at a V-J Day Commemoration.
<P>
National Security Adviser Anthony Lake, saying "there was
apparently a mixup" that prevented the president from meeting a
delegation from the coalition, spoke briefly instead with several
elected officials. Lake said he would "pass on their concerns"
about the French testing to Clinton.
<P>
But the Honolulu Advertiser of Sept. 4 had to admit that the
shouts of the demonstrators "turned the heads of many audience
members while Clinton spoke."
<P>
Clinton's trip to Hawai`i was accompanied by an orgy of events
glorifying the U.S. military--which occupies a big percentage of
Hawai`ian land and stores nuclear weapons and waste at Pearl
Harbor, right next to the metropolis of Honolulu.
<P>
<H2>U.S. nuclear threat</H2>
<P>
A statement to the demonstration by Sane Nuclear
Freeze Hawai`i restored some balance on where the main nuclear
threat comes from.
<P>
After supporting the struggle against the French testing, it went
on to point out: "But today, the occasion of Bill Clinton's visit
to Hawai`i, we must face the fact that France is really just a
minor supporting actor in this very real theater of nuclear
terror which has haunted humanity throughout the last half of the
20th century.
<P>
"The main character, the `star of the show,' is and always has
been the United States."
<P>
The vast Pentagon nuclear arsenal and the development of new
weapons systems, the statement said, "has continued under both
Republican and Democratic administrations and Congresses." This
"encourages other countries, especially those in competition with
the U.S. for overseas markets and resources, or those most
immediately threatened by the U.S. quest for global military and
economic hegemony, to build and maintain their own arsenals."
<P>
Yoon Bok-Dong of the U.S. Out of Korea Committee and one of the
organizers of the march also pointed out in a statement that "the
United States opened the nuclear era in the Pacific with the
bombs dropped on civilians at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, its nuclear
testing at Bikini atoll, and the threats by Gen. Douglas
MacArthur to drop the bomb on Korea during the U.S. war against
that country."
<P>
Yoon called for "U.S. troops and nukes out of Korea and Hawai`i!"
<P>
Both groups also strongly supported the struggle for Hawai`ian
sovereignty.

<H1>No bail for Kanahele, federal judge rules</H1>
<H2>Lawyer asks the court not to send the defendant to the mainland</H2>

<P>
Hayden Aluli, attorney for Nation of Hawaii leader Dennis "Bumpy" Kanahele, hopes his client won't be sent to a mainland prison pending his trial in October.
<P>
"We're hoping that he can remain in Hawaii," Aluli said yesterday after U.S. District Judge Helen Gillmor upheld a magistrate's ruling to hold Kanahele without bail until his trial for harboring a fugitive.
<P>
Kanahele could be held at a federal facility in Alameda, Calif., officials said.
<P>
After hearing Kanahele promise he would meet all court appearances and other requirements if released, Gillmor denied defense motions to overturn Magistrate Barry Kurren's earlier decision.
<P>
Character witnesses Mahealani Kamau`u, executive director of the Native Hawaiian Legal Corp., and Marc Oley, former chairman of the Hawaii Paroling Authority, testified that they did not think freeing Kanahele would pose a risk pending his trial.
<P>
FBI Agent Jerry Bogard, the only witness Assistant U.S. Attorney Les Osborne called, testified he rode in a car with Kanahele to the U.S. marshal's office after Kanahele's Aug. 2 airport arrest.  Kanahele is accused of three charges related to harboring tax protester Nathan Brown.
<P>
Bogard said Kanahele told him he did not recognize the jurisdiction and that if anyone should be arrested, it was the federal agents for war crimes.
<P>
Osborne argued against freeing Kanahele, saying he failed to meet earlier court dates.
<P>
"His promise is only as good as the opportunity makes it for him," Osborne said.
<P>
Aluli argued that Kurren should have disqualified himself after saying he previously received a warrant for his arrest from the Nation of Hawaii and viewed it as a threat.  But Gillmor did not agree, saying Kurren showed no prejudice or lack of impartiality.
<P>
Gillmor also sided with prosecution in forbidding the making of any political statements on Kanahele's behalf.  She also ruled against Aluli's attempts to dispute the facts of a 1987 case in which Kanahele was convicted of terroristic threatening of a policeman with a gun during an occupation at Makapuu Lighthouse.
<P>
Oley testified that Kanahele's prison time was reduced because he did well in prison and convinced the parole board he would not touch firearms in the future.
<P>
Later, outside the courtroom, Aluli told reporters he was disappointed.  "I would think that the court would have more compassion."

Senator Daniel Inouye (D-Hawaii) made the following comment regarding Leonard Peltier, who is widely considered a political prisoner of the United States:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG>"As long as the [FBI] misconduct issues in this case are left unresolved, it will be difficult for Native Americans to trust that the U.S. judicial system will accord them with the same justice it accords to other citizens."</STRONG></BLOCKQUOTE> 
<P>
Sen. Daniel K. Inouye (D-Hawaii), then-chairman of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, and three other senators wrote this statement in a July 1993 letter to Attorney General Janet Reno. Inouye has since endorsed clemency or some other legal mechanism to gain Peltier's release, such as reducing his sentence to time already served.
<P>
Is there some sort of <STRONG>double standard</STRONG> operating here?

<H1>Church, community leaders push for Kanahele's release</H1>

<STRONG>Honolulu Advertiser<BR>

<P>
By Mark Matsunaga<BR>
Advertiser Staff Writer
<P>
Some church leaders and an influential law Professor called yesterday for Hawaiian activist Dennis 'Bumpy' Kanahele to be freed on bail pending his federal criminal trial.
<P>
Kanahele, head of the self-proclaimed Nation of Hawaii, is scheduled to go on trial next week on charges that he harbored a federal fugitive, tax protester Nathan Brown.
<P>
Kanahele was indicted and arrested an Aug. 2. Federal Magistrate Barry Kurren ordered him held without bail, saying Kanahele is a danger to the community and a likely no-show for trial.
<P>
Federal courts have turned down two appeals to free him on bail.
<P>
But yesterday, University of Hawaii law professor Williamson Chang, who handled a landmark water rights case in the 1980s, said he will seek a court order for Kanahele's release.
<P>
Meanwhile, other support for Kanahele's release has been growing. About 40 community and religious leaders visited the nation's headquarters on state land in Waimanalo, met with his followers and signed petitions calling for him to be allowed to post bail pending trial.
<P>
Several of them held a news conference at Kawaiahao Church yesterday.
<P>
The Rev. Jim Ledgerwood, pastor of First United Methodist Church, said, "We're a nation that's founded on dissent ... It's for the courts to decide when and whether we've stepped over the line. But a decision has been made before the fact that  Bumpy has stepped over the line. And it seems to me that people of good will, people of good will, people who are interested in real justice issue, must stand up and speak for his release pending his trial."
<P>
The Rev. Mike Young, new pastor of First Unitarian Church, said, "It's entirely unprecedented that someone who's been hanging around in the public eye, not hiding from anyone, should be in jail without bail for what is clearly political speech. That the whole community is not up in arms in indignation is very surprising."
<P>
Elia Loya, of the Church of the Crossroads social action committee, decried Kanahele's imprisonment while "men who have beaten their children and wives" are out on bail.
<P>
June Shimokawa, a member of Harris United Methodist Church and the Hawaii Ecumenical Coalition, said churches and their members must speak out against injustice.
<P>
She added that, "As a Japanese American, for those who experienced injustice in World War II, for us to be quiet at this point in time would be to fail to see what happened to us. We need to be here in solidarity with our host people."

<P>
Although a federal judge tried to remove sovereignty politics from the criminal trial of sovereignty activists Dennis "Bumpy" Kanahele and Gordon Kaaihue, their attorneys threw the forbidden darts in their opening statements.
<P>
Hayden Aluli, Kanahele's attorney, yesterday described the three misdemeanor and felony charges against the leader of the self-proclaimed Nation of Hawaii before asking:
<P>
"Is this case really about criminal conduct or is it about the federal government's reaction to the Hawaiian sovereignty movement?"
<P>
Assistant U.S. Attorney Les Osborne objected to what would be one of numerous characterizations that crossed into sovereignty politics during the first day of the trial.
<P>
Federal Judge Helen Gillmor, who had spent 45 minutes before opening statements reiterating her rulings against political defenses, ordered the jury to disregard Aluli's comment.
<P>
Aluli modified his statement to eliminate sweeping presumptions about government intent but proposed that Kanahele's alleged criminal actions occurred within the context of his political beliefs.
<P>
He also succeeded in reading part of the so-called <A HREF="publawsum.html">"Apology Bill"</A> signed in 1993 by President Clinton into the record, priming the jurors to buy his defense that Kanahele was educating police officers, not obstructing them.  Gillmor reminded jurors they could not view the federal bill as a justification or defense for a crime.
<P>
Federal authorities contend Kanahele and Kaaihue interfered with the serving of a warrant to fugitive Nathan Brown on Jan. 27, 1994.
<P>
They also said Kanahele harbored the fugitive and impeded federal marshals on March 16 from arresting Brown, who had evaded a 78-month sentence for tax fraud.
<P>
Gillmor yesterday also reined in Sidney Quintal, Kaaihue's attorney, for likening his plight to the way "Romans dealt with Jesus Christ" and the way that "South Africans dealt with Nelson Mandela."
<P>
Osborne called the similarities "preposterous" and Gillmor ordered Quintal to refrain from such metaphors.
<P>
But Quintal persisted, setting the trial in the context of Robin Hood and saying the "evil sheriff" would take the stand."
<P>
After Osborne objected, Quintal protested, saying he could describe U.S Marshal Annette Kent as the "evil sheriff."
<P>
Quintal said the government didn't really want Brown in custody but used him to pursue Kanahele and Kaaihue.
<P>
Osborne set the government's stage by describing Kanahele as a man who disregards the law and the safety of others.  He said Kanahele and Kaaihue positioned themselves between police Officer Thomas Carreiro and Brown in January 1994, when Carreiro tried to arrest the fugitive near Laie.
<P>
Kanahele belligerently said he couldn't allow the arrest, Osborne said.
<P>
He said Kanahele also stood in the way of federal marshals in March when they saw Brown leave a van and race into Kanahele's Waimanalo home.  Aluli said Kanahele didn't hear the marshal identify himself and didn't want to let a stranger into his house.
<P>
Carreiro testified that after spotting fugitive Brown at a Jan. 27 Laie meeting, he and five other officers -- most in street clothes -- pulled over Brown's car about a mile from the meeting.  He said he identified himself as an officer and said he had to arrest Brown on a warrant.
<P>
Carreiro said about 20 people came out of two vans that also pulled off Kamehameha Highway with Brown.  He said Kaaihue and Kanahele approached him, and Kanahele eventually handed him a copy of the <A HREF="publawsum.html">"Apology Bill."</A>
<P>
Carreiro said he decided not to arrest Brown, in part because Kanahele said he and Brown planned to beet with federal officials in the near future.
<P>
But Carreiro told Kanahele: "OK, my friend, you and Nathan better make it to that meeting or things are only going to get worse."

<P>
Aloha to all people of Hawaii:
<P>
You may be aware that I am probably the most politically aggressive and outspoken activist in the Hawaiian sovereignty movement today.  In a free society everyone has a right to express their political voice. My political voice and truth are founded in a deep respect for freedom, justice, and non-violence, and are not intended to harm or defame anyone. I am simply attempting to educate the Hawaii general public, state and federal government officials, and interested international organizations regarding solutions to the grave historic and contemporary injustices suffered by native Hawaiians. The time has come to understand and embrace the reality of sovereignty in Hawaii.  
<P>
"Conventional politics" have been the major roadblock deterring the natural process of self-determination for native Hawaiians.  As God is my witness, there is no doubt in my heart and mind that my imprisonment is a "political issue."  One of my respected kupuna "elders" recently told me, "Some people keep banging their heads against the door, when all they have to do is turn the door knob."  I am peacefully and patiently reaching for that door knob.  Will that door now open?  
<P>
In July 1993 I was appointed by the Governor and served on the Sovereignty Advisory Commission.  I was elected by my peers to chair the committee titled "Visioning Beyond the Legislative Mandate."  This committee's purpose was to find the best possible solutions for self-determination beyond the scope of state and federal laws.  In addressing this task my committee discovered that it was the international arena of law that required further exploration and definition. The Commission decided to bring in two qualified experts on international law to educate ourselves as well as the general public.  
<P>
The second expert was <A HREF="boylebio.html">Professor Francis A. Boyle</A>, who gave <A HREF="boylesum.html">his opinion</A> on<A HREF="publawsum.html"> "The Apology Resolution" (Public Law 103-150)</A>, signed by President Clinton on Nov. 23, 1993, apologizing to the Native Hawaiian people for the U.S. participation in the illegal overthrow of the Hawaiian monarch in 1893.  
<P>
Professor Boyle stated, "...now the United States government, after one hundred years, has finally and officially conceded, as a matter of United States law, that Native Hawaiian people have the right to restore the Independent nation State that you had in 1893..."  
<P>
Also that, "...remember, it's important when reading through this act, the so-called whereas clauses, these are official findings of fact and law, by the Congress of the United States.  These findings bind all state and federal courts here in Hawaii."  These findings of fact and law can no longer be contested or denied.  
<P>
The nation of Hawaii bases its legal constitutional foundation on customary and international law as well as <A HREF="publawsum.html">U.S. Public law 103-150</A> passed by the U.S. Congress.  The inherent rights of native Hawaiian people must be respected.  This is the fruit of the 1993 Sovereignty Advisory Commission's committee called "Visioning Beyond the Legislative Mandate."
<P>
We are all now challenged to rise above the history of disregard of international law and flagrant human rights violations in Hawaii. As we educate ourselves and understand the findings and facts of <A HREF="publawsum.html">U.S. Public law 103-150</A>, we can heal the past and begin to face our common future with dignity. Please open your hearts and your minds to the prayers and politics of independence. Please stand together for truth and justice. 
<P>
We can and we will show the world there is a way to overcome colonization without violence and to establish equality and equity for native Hawaiians without disenfranchisement of the status quo. To be successful in ending the oppression and forced occupation of Hawaii's people and lands by the American government, we must learn to be self reliant, to trust one another, rise above racism, and above all to know that we the people of Hawaii have the capacity and authority to determine our own best possible future.
<P>
Aloha Ke Akua,

To the Court:
<P>
I write to urge that bail be granted for Mr. Dennis "Bumpy" Kanahele, who has been imprisoned since August 2. Like the U S. government, our church has a apologized to the Hawaiian People for our predecessors' role in the overthrow of the Hawaiian nation, and we now seek reconciliation by standing with them in their quest for justice. I have personally met Mr. Kanahele and know him to be a trusted and respected community leader -- certainly neither a "flight risk" nor a "danger to the community." 
<P>
Now when the attention of the world community has been focused on issues of human rights and political imprisonment due to the Women's Conference in Beijing, it is a particularly crucial time for the U.S. to release its own political prisoners, of whom Mr. Kanahele is but the most recently-incarcerated of over one hundred men and women incarcerated for their political beliefs and actions. 
<P>
As a person of faith and conscience, I urge you to see that Mr. Kanahele is granted bail pending his trial. 
<P>
Many thanks for your most serious and prayerful consideration. May the God of truth and justice guide and bless you.
<P>
In hope,
<P>
Rev. Dr. C. Nozomi Ikuta

<P>
By Hayden Burgess<P>
Special to the Advertiser
<P>
Am I an American?  How did I "lose" my Hawaiian citizenship?  No act by myself, my ancestors or my national leaders surrendered Hawaiian citizenship or relinquished Hawaii's <A HREF="sovereignty.html">sovereignty</A>.
<P>
<A HREF="cleveland.html">Grover Cleveland</A> said Queen Lili'uokalani's temporary yielding of authority to the U.S. government did not constitute a sufficient surrender.  He declared that an act of war upon a peaceful nation, in violation of international law, was committed by U.S. forces.  The step-by-step conspiracy between the Missionary Party and U.S. government culminating in the "treaty of annexation" is replete with international violations of laws against aggression and unequal treaties and of human rights and fundamental freedoms.  Even the U.S. Constitution was violated!
<P>
How, then, could my country, the Kingdom of Hawaii, recognized in the international community as a sovereign nation, be declared non-existent today?  By whom and with what magic have we been etched out of existence? Is the criminality of the United States to be rewarded by  the denial of the existence of that very nation it invaded?  I cannot accept it.
<P>
Self-Styled  historians have scolded me, pointing out that irrespective of prior illegalities, all was resolved when Hawaii exercised "self-determination," voting to become a "state" of the United States of America in 1959.  
<P>
That event simply escalated U.S. delinquency.  In 1959 (indeed as early as 1945) the United States was under a specific international obligation (<A HREF="art73.html">Article 73(e) of the U.N. Charter</A>) to respect the right to self-determination of Hawaii's people.  Instead of complying with that obligation, the United States manipulated the situation to its advantage.
<P>
<LI> First, the United States altered Hawaii's "self" by transmigrating into Hawaii people loyal to the United States, and brain-washed the rest to loyalty, especially through control of the "education" system.  In 1959, it permitted all Americans residing in Hawaii for at least a year to vote on the question of "statehood."   Hawaiian citizens could not vote.
<P>
This altering of the "self," through population displacement and control over the educational and legal systems, media, economy, and military, is a trick colonial nations use before the international community, pretending that the colony or territory exercised "determination."
<P>
<LI> Second, the United States manipulated the situation by limiting the full range of choices.  Under self-determination, a people is entitled to a range of choices from total assimilation into the colonial state ("statehood" or "territorial status") to emergence as a free and independent country.  In 1959, the choices were either to become a U.S. "state" or remain a U.S. territory.
<P>
There was no choice for independence.  When the United States subsequently reported to the United Nations that Hawaii exercised self-determination, choosing to become a U.S. "state," it defrauded the United Nations and the Hawaiian citizens.   The 1959 "statehood" referendum did not absolve the United States of its delinquency.
<P>
Who are the citizens?  What is Hawaii's "self?"  Hawaiian citizenship is not defined by race, culture, class, religion, or economic status.  It is defined by one's loyalty and allegiance to our nation.  Before the U.S. invasion, Hawaiian citizens came from many races, cultures, etc.  They were Hawaiians through a political act, disavowing any former allegiance and undertaking allegiance to Hawaii.  Today, Hawaii's eligible citizens may come from any racial, ethnic, or religious background.
<P>
Why Hawaiian independence?  To save Hawaii from ruin.  To survive, Hawaiians must govern Hawaii.  Why should we continue under U.S. manipulation?  U.S. design upon Hawaii is to serve as its military fortress in the Pacific and as an economic hand in its Pacific-Asia grab.  It controls all of the vital decisions affecting Hawaii's quality of life and makes those decisions only to further its "national interest."  Hawaii has become a free-for-all destination for immigrants and investors, creating false crises in housing, employment, economy, foreign relations, etc.  We are the United State's captured market:  It decides who we trade with and how much it taxes that trade.  Hawaii's U.S. occupation, (25 percent of O'ahu under military control) makes us a priority target of its enemies.
<P>
Under Hawaiian independence, we, the people of Hawaii, determine our own population size, use of our lands by foreign military, terms of trade with other nations, our environmental quality, our foreign relations, our special and honored place of the indigenous people in our society, etc.  Independence is good for business, for the environment, for military security, for cultural development.  The power to treaty between Hawaii and any foreign country exceeds every U.S. benefit under statehood.  
<P>
Freedom never guarantees a better life.  It provides a better chance of make our own decisions, our own mistakes as well as our own wise choices.  What freedom brings about is a likelihood that those who will face the consequences of their own decisions will make a greater number of right decisions than one who decides for another.  The quest for Hawaiian independence is the only sensible long-range plan for Hawaii.
<P>
Abraham Lincoln said, "No man has the right to rule over another man without his consent."  We Hawaiian citizens never consented.  I never lost my Hawaiian citizenship.  I am not an American.  Hawaii pono'i.

<H1>Letters of Support for<BR>
Pu`uhonua Kanahele</H1>
<H2>- excerpts -</H2>
</CENTER>
The United States authorities in Hawai`i have arrested Mr. Kanahele and are currently holding him without bail, charging that he is a "danger to the community" and a "flight risk."  
<P>
This is what others have to say about Mr. Kanahele and this situation...
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>As a leader in human rights issues worldwide, the United States must set a good example for all nations... Mr. Kanahele has led this movement forward in a complete atmosphere of peacefulness and mutual cooperation.  The arrest of His Excellency Pu`uhonua Kanahele is an affront to human rights as supported by the United States Constitution and the United Nations Charter.  We are dealing here with a legal matter between nations of independent status and not with individuals.. ... We hereby request the immediate release of His Excellency Pu`uhonua Kanahele and advise you that the international community is observing this case.<BR>
<STRONG>- Prince A. E. Agungnugroho Prabuningrat IX, Foundation for Human Rights, Indonesia</STRONG></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Mr. Kanahele was appointed as head of state for the Nation of Hawaii by Na Kupuna O Hawaii, elders from all islands, early in 1994. ... As the Head of State, it was his responsibility to act in behalf of Na Kupuna to secure the nation based on values or honesty, respect, humbleness, steadfastness and alertness.<BR>
<STRONG>- Pua Lindsey, 81, and the Lindsey `Ohana, Lahaina</STRONG></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>True to his name "Pu`uhonua", Mr. Kanahele has been a spiritual refuge for the disaffected within the Hawaiian community.  His rough, burly appearance belies a person who at all times lives and shares a message of compassion and non-violence. ... Mr. Kanahele's sovereignty politics are...predicated upon indisputable facts admitted to by the U.S. government and recited in <A HREF="publawsum.html">Public Law 103-150</A> ... Mr. Kanahele is a person of conscience, behaving in a way which is consistent with the truth.... If anything, he is a spiritual balm to what otherwise might be an extremely volatile community.  He is a principled individual absolutely committed to peace and non-violence.<BR>
<STRONG>- Mahealani Kamau`u, Exec. Director, Native Hawaiian Legal Corporation</STRONG></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Mr. Kanahele is a sincere Hawaiian activist who operates on principles he strongly believes in.  We are at a critical point in the sovereignty movement in Hawaii.  It is time that we, as Hawaiians, begin supporting one another in spite of our differences.<BR>
<STRONG>- Tara Lulani McKenzie, Executive Director, Hawaiian Sovereignty Elections Council</STRONG></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>As Kanaka Maoli and non-Kanaka Maoli members of the Pro-Kanaka Maoli Independence Working Group, Kanaka Maoli Tribunal Komike and Ka Pakaukau, we urge the immediate release without bail of Mr. Dennis Bumpy Kanahele.  ...  The August 2, 1995 arrest and jailing of Mr. Kanahele, more that 19 months after his alleged harboring of a fugitive, and more than 17 months after his alleged obstructing justice are obviously attempts by the U.S. Government to subvert, and divert public attention away from, the larger and main issue -- the U.S.'s illegal occupation of Ka Pae`aina and continuing suppression of Kanaka Maoli inherent sovereignty and right to self-determination.<BR>
<STRONG>	- Dr. Kekuni Blaisdell</STRONG></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Through his persistent input, we have all been enriched with a new experience, knowledge and our horizens have broadened.  These actions were necessary as part of a well-rounded education opportunity.  This is the character and gentleness of the perosn we have come to respect. .... He is an individual of his word and one that will stand by his integrity and truth.<BR>
<STRONG>- Sol Kahoohalahala, Maui County Council / Hawaiian Sovereignty Elections Council Chair</STRONG></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>George Washington had a similar problem with the King of England.  Nelson Mandela had it with the white South Africans. ... Mr. Kanahele is not on trial for breaking the law, but for challenging the right to the lands which is the wealth of any country.  In this instance the country of Hawaii.<BR>
<STRONG>- Kelii "Skippy" W. Ioane Jr., Free Association, Moku O Keawe (Big Island)</STRONG></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Mr. Kanahele is one of the leaders at the forefront of the sovereignty movement.  From what I know of Mr. Kanahele, he has always been an advocate for peace and nonviolence in dealing with the crucial issues past and present of sovereignty.... I do not feel that Mr. Kanahele is a clear and present danger to the community and I do not feel that if allowed bail would be a flight risk.  Mr. Kanahele's commitment is to the Nation of Hawaii where his strength lies. To abandon this cause would be to abandon his life's work and this will never happen.<BR>
<STRONG>- Frank Kawaikapuokalani Hewett, Kumu Hula</STRONG></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>As a result of my experience with Mr. Kanahele, I have come to know him as an upstanding, kindhearted, Hawaiian man.  To his credit, he has provided a sense of vision and purpose to many of our Hawaiian people who do not have the resources to live in a house.<BR>
<STRONG>- Davianna McGregor, Ph.D., UH Manoa, Ethnic Studies Program</STRONG></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Mr. Kanahele has spoken to University of Hawai`i students on his philosophy and experience of nonviolence.  Mr. Kanahele practices nonviolence in his life as he leads the Nation of Hawaii.<BR>
<STRONG>- Lou Ann Haaheo Guanson, UH, Spark M. Matsunaga Institute of Peace</STRONG></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Mr. Kanahele is an integral part of the Waimanalo community.  We have had many opportunities to meet with and observe him in a variety of settings.  He has in many ways contributed positively to the community he calls home.  He has supported and responded to the needs of the homeless, especially the women, children, and the elderly who were living on the beaches.  He has an innate ability to work with, and identify with, our youths.  He encourages them to continue with their education and to understand their inalienable rights.  "Bumpy, a Native Hawaiian man, exemplifies the empathy of his people, the Kanaka Maoli<BR>
<STRONG>- Mabel Ann Spencer, President, Waimanalo Health Center Board</STRONG></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>He teaches us to move in a peaceful and truthful way.<BR>
<STRONG>- Kupuna Patricia Nishiyama, Lahaina</STRONG></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>He is not doing this for himself, he is trying to let the people of Hawaii know about what we should know... I am pure Kanaka Maoli that didn't learn anything about my heritage until now... Mahalo to Bumpy for opening our lives.<BR>
<STRONG>- Kupuna Pearl K. Kamaunu</STRONG></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The only arsenal he has collected in knowledge, and I believe for that knowledge is why is incarcerated.  He has done nothing but help our Kanaka Maoli, and educate us so we can make good sound decisions on our future and the futures of our children.  I stand good for Mr. Kanahele, and I stand behind him, he has my full support and the support of the Nation of Hawaii, of which he is head of state, a position he was elected to, not self-appointed.<BR>
<STRONG>- Kahu (Reverend) Nani Saffery, Lahaina, Maui</STRONG></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>I believe that the claims of the Nation of Hawaii deserve to be addressed in open public, legislative, and judicial forums.... It is not too late to restore and repair public respect and trust in your government and your administrations by working toward the immediate and responsible release of Mr. Kanahele.<BR>
<STRONG>- Rev. Kaleo Patterson, Executive Director, Hawaii Ecumenical Coalition</STRONG></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>As a spokesperson for Ka `Ohana O Kahikinui, I know Pu`uhonua Kanahele is not a threat to our community or any individual residing in this community.  In fact he is an asset to the Hawaiian community in it's struggle for self-determination.<BR>
<STRONG>- Earl "Mo" Moler</STRONG></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Pu`uhonua Kanahele is a peace loving person looking to regain his people's rights, sovereignty, and independence by legitimate means.  I would give him all my support.<BR>
<STRONG>- Robert Watts, Executive Producer, Indiana Jones movies</STRONG></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>We would like to state unequivocally that in our experience no one in Hawaii has shown more sincerity, dedication, and devotion to the advance of conditions of life for all the people of the `aina than Mr. Kanahele and the members of the organization he represents.  We have been greatly impressed by his peaceful yet forceful advocacy for the just and humane treatment of the Hawaiian community as well as all who live in Hawaii.<BR>
<STRONG>- Tom Starchild, Hinalea Group, Haleiwa</STRONG></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>I believe that Bumpy Kanahele is an asset -- not only to Native Hawaiians, but also to the community as a whole.<BR>
<STRONG>- Celeste N. King, PhD, Clinical Psychology</STRONG></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>A genuinely peaceful society must be open and free. Holding a sovereignty activist without bail and spreading "unsubstantiated and unconfirmed allegations" (<A HREF="politpris.html">Honolulu Advertiser, 8-8-95</A>) about "violent intentions" and "arms caches" and "bunkers" are the tactics of a police state afraid of the democratic aspirations of its own people. Therefore, we must demand that the US Free Bumpy Kanahele Now. "Jail nukes, not Bumpy".<BR>
<STRONG>Rick Rothschiller, Sane Nuclear Freeze Hawai`i</STRONG>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Kanahele has been my personal inspiration and mentor in building the foundation of the Chamoru Nation, Guam's counterpart to Hawai`i's movement in the quest for self-determination.  Yet in agreeing to assist me and our founders, he was unequivocal in stating that only peaceful means could be employed in pursuit of sovereign rights. ... I cannot imagine why any element or branch of government would deem forthrightness as a danger. ... If nations under the U.S. flag are forced to champion their own cause, no other issue should even remotely seem to cripple that cause.  Indignities can be endured: injustices cannot.  Therefore, in the name of justice, I respectfully, earnestly, passionately plea for the immediate release of Pu`uhonua B. Kanahele.<BR>
<STRONG>- Senator Angel L.G. Santos, Guam Legislature</STRONG></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE
>In August 1993 I had the privilege of traveling to Hawaii with eight other Maori from Aotearoa. While there I met Bumpy Kanahele.  In the time that I got to speak with him I grew to love, trust and respect him. Knowing the struggles of most indigenous peoples through the world it enrages me to hear that Bumpy has been falsely arrested by a foreign government. While sending the support of the rangatahi here in Tauranga, we still demand the immediate release of Bumpy Kanahele. No reira kia kaha koutou mo to mahi.  Ka whawhai tonu matau AKE!!!<BR>
<STRONG>- Wahine Ngararoa Mate Kite Whenua Moeke Kohu, Tauranga, Aotearoa</STRONG>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Mr. Kanahele is committed to the Nation of Hawai`i, morally as well as physically, and has been working for Hawaiian self determination in the non-violent tradition of Martin Luther King and Mahatma Ghandi. ...  We would urge the United States Government to immediately release Mr. Kanahele, and open a dialogue with the indigenous Hawaiian Peoples who are the most severely affected by this arrest, with the view of establishing peaceful relations between Peoples, as in the obligation of the United States, under the United Nations Charter.  Mr. Kanahele's immediate release would also be consistent with the U.S. human rights obligations and the fundamental human rights and freedoms of all Indigenous Peoples.<BR>

Dennis "Bumpy" Kanahele, head of the self-<A HREF="proclamsum.html">proclaimed</A> Nation of Hawaii, looks forward to his day in court.  But he'd rather be outside preparing for it.
<P>
Kanahele, 41, is being held without bail at Halawa Correctional Facility pending trial in October on federal charges of harboring a fugitive.
<P>
"I'm here for one reason: I'm a political prisoner," Kanahele said in an interview yesterday at the prison.
<P>
His lawyer, Hayden Aluli, plans to seek his release on bail this week.  If the appeal fails, Kanahele will be sent to a federal facility in Alameda, Calif., until his trial, which is tentatively scheduled to begin Oct. 3.
<P>
Meanwhile, Kanahele said "I'm being taken care of, and not special - just like anybody else."
<P>
He met with reporters on a lanai next to a small yard inside the prison.  He wore a green shirt and pants with "Halawa Correctional Facility" stenciled in white.  He shares a cell with another federal detainee, a non-Hawaiian, according to a prison spokesman.
<P>
"It's good to be out and having fresh air," said Kanahele.
<P>
He was secretly indicted last Wednesday on three charges related to his alleged harboring of Hawaiian tax protester Nathan Brown.  Kanahele was arrested Wednesday afternoon at Honolulu airport.
<P>
He said he was "really surprised" by the arrest, which occurred when his flight from Maui to Kauai stopped at Honolulu.
<P>
On Friday, federal Magistrate Barry Kurren ordered Kanahele held without bail pending trial.  Kurren said he considers Kanahele "a danger to the community" and a likely no-show for trial.  This was after federal authorities presented a list of allegations - many unsubstantiated and unconfirmed - to depict Kanahele and has followers as violent and dangerous.
<P>
"That's not true," Kanahele said yesterday.  "I've always advocated non-violence and a peaceful transition, and that's the bottom line."  
<P>
Kanahele said he was convinced to eschew violence when he spent almost a year in prison on a 1987 conviction for threatening a police officer during an occupation of the Makapuu Lighthouse.
<P>
Kanahele was sentenced to five years in the case.  He said yesterday he served 11 months.
<P>
He said he also spent eight months in the youth detention facility as a teen-ager and was on probation for breaking into cars on Maui.
<P>
Aluli said he would appeal Kurren's order to U.S. District Judge Helen Gillmor.
<P>
Aluli said the prosecution of Kanahele appears to be selective, discriminatory, and retaliatory.
<P>
Aluli also said he believes Kurren should have excused himself from Kanahele's case.
<P>
Kurren said during Friday's hearing that he felt threatened by a warning notice served on him and other federal and state officials by Kanahele's supporters.  That, Aluli says, appears to be a conflict of interest.
<P>
Kurren did not return a phone call to his office for comment on the issue yesterday.

August 3, 1995
</CENTER>
<P>
  The <A HREF="http://hawaii-nation.org/nation/iitc/">International Indian Treaty Council (IITC)</A> has been recognized since 1977, as a category II Non-governmental Organization (NGO) with consultative status, by the <A HREF="gopher://nywork1.undp.org:70/1">United Nations</A>. The this capacity, the IITC is concerned with the observance of the human rights of Indigenous Peoples throughout the Americas and Pacific Islands, including the United States.
<P>
 The IITC is profoundly concerned about the arrest of Mr. Pu'uhonua Kanahele, Head of State of the Independent Nation of Hawai`i, who was arrested Wednesday afternoon, August 2, by Federal agents in Honolulu. We are informed that he is being held without bail, and that a bond in the amount of $250,000 is required for his release pending the disposition of the charges.
<P>
 He apparently has been charged with hindering prosecution and harboring a fugitive, stemming from incidents in early 1994 when Nathan Keliikui Brown, a Hawaiian national and at that time Deputy Head of State of the Hawaii Government, was being sought also by federal authorities.
<P>
 Our concern stems from the fact that this arrest was delayed for over a year by federal authorities. His arrest at this late date can only be described as selective prosecution, timed to coincide with the growing momentum for Hawaiian Sovereignty. Head of State Kanahele has been in Hawai`i since early 1994, amenable to a peaceful resolution of any complaint the United States might have had with him. Why did it take federal authorities over a year to raise these charges?
<P>
 We are also concerned that he has not been allowed reasonable bail to secure his release, pending resolution of these charges. Bail or bond, these amounts are only intended to secure the appearance of any defendant or to protect the community from violent criminals. Mr. Kanahele is committed to the Nation of Hawai'i, morally as well as physically, and has been working for Hawaiian self determination in the non-violent tradition of Martin Luther King and Mahatma Ghandi. As the United States is well aware, Mr. Kanahele would not leave Hawai'i under any circumstances, including the threat of arrest or imprisonment.
<P>
 The United States is also aware that a bond of $250,000 is impossible for the historically impoverished Hawai`ian Peoples to meet. We must believe that under these circumstances, Head of State Dennis Kanahele was arrested and is now being held in retaliation for his avowed support and work on behalf of Hawai`ian self determination.
<P>
 We must remind the United States that the <A HREF="gopher://gopher.undp.org:70/00/unearth/ch1-5">United Nations Charter</A> and the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights provide that all Peoples have the right to self determination and the right to freely determine their political status; and that everyone has the right to hold opinions and to freely express them. <A HREF="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.billofrights.html#amendmenti">The Bill of Rights</A> of the <A HREF="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.overview.html">United States Constitution</A> provides for similar rights of speech, association, and opinion.
<P>
 The United States government has already apologized for the theft of Hawai`i, and has again recognized, by authorizing the Hawaiian Sovereignty Commission, that even now, Hawai`i may choose for itself self determination. It would be tragic indeed, if by this arrest and prosecution, the United States would again be required to admit of another crime and offer a similar apology. As in the case of the Nation of Hawai`i, justice delayed is justice denied.
<P>
 The IITC strongly feels that these human rights concerns are well founded and would urge the government of the United States to reconsider its actions in this light. We would urge the United States Government to immediately release Mr. Kanahele, and open a dialogue with the Indigenous Hawaiian Peoples who are the most severely affected by this arrest, with the view of establishing peaceful relations between Peoples, as is the obligation of the United States, under the United Nations Charter.
<P>
 Mr. Kanahele's immediate release would also be consistent with the U.S. human rights obligations and the fundamental human rights and freedoms of all Indigenous Peoples.
<P>
 We look forward to your immediate response.
<P>
Sincerely,
<P>
Alberto Saldamando<BR>

Kanahele is accused of harboring a fugitive and interfering with U.S. marshals when they tried to serve a warrant on the fugitive.<P>Aluli restated his allegation that Gillmor improperly declared a mistrial and asked the court to dismiss the indictment against Kanahele because it can't retry a defendant twice on the same charge. He said Gillmor didn't allow both sides to investigate the accusations of jury tampering before she declared the mistrial.<P>Kanahele, in a brief statement to Gillmor, said "I feel that this court has been biased."<P>"I can't see how I'm gonna get a fair trial - you being the judge. I think you're biased and I think you should recuse yourself."<P>Aluli wanted to know how the tampering allegations came to Gillmor's attention. Gillmor said a phone call from U.S. Marshal Anne Kent alerted her to the conversation about jury tampering. Kent was a witness in the case.<P>Aluli then asked Gillmor to step down from making the ruling, alleging there was an appearance of a conflict and she had been partial in her rulings against the defense.<P>Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Seabright called Aluli's claims "outrageous," and suggested Aluli file a complaint with the Disciplinary Council if he had evidence of prosecutorial misconduct.<P>Gillmor denied Aluli's request that she remove herself from the ruling on the dismissal.<P>She reserved ruling in yesterday's hearing. Attorneys for both sides were given until Wednesday to file written arguments on the issue, after which Gillmor will issue a written ruling.<P>A second trial for Kanahele is scheduled for Jan. 23.<P></BODY><IMG SRC="hrcolor2.gif"><BR><A HREF="index.html"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="flagsm.gif" BORDER="0"></A> Return to the <A HREF="index.html">Nation of Hawai`i Home Page</A>, the <A HREF="news.html">News Articles Index</A>, or the <A HREF="political_prisoner.html">Political Prosecution page</A><P></HTML>

</CENTER>
<HR>
<UL><UL><UL><UL><UL><UL><UL>Department of State<BR>
Washington, October 18, 1893
</UL></UL></UL></UL></UL></UL></UL>
<P>
The PRESIDENT:
<P>
	The full and impartial reports submitted by the Hon. James H. Blount, your special commissioner to the Hawaiian Islands, established the following facts:
<P>
Queen Liliuokalani announced her intention on Saturday, January 14, 1893, to proclaim a new constitution, but the opposition of her ministers and others induced her to speedily change her purpose and make a public announcement of that fact.
<P>
At a meeting in Honolulu, late in the afternoon of that day, a so-called committee of public safety, consisting of thirteen men, being all or nearly all who were present, was appointed "to consider the situation and devise ways and means for the maintenance of the public peace and the protection of life and property," and at a meeting of this committee on the 15th, or the forenoon of the 16th of January, it was resolved amongst other things that a provisional government be created "to exist until terms of union with the United States of America have been negotiated and agreed upon."  At a mass meeting which assembled at 2 p.m. on the last-named day, the Queen and her supporters were condemned and denounced, and the committee was continued and all its acts approved.
<P>
Later the same afternoon the committee addressed a letter to John L. Stevens, the American minister at Honolulu, stating that the lives and property of the people were in peril and appealing to him and the United States forces at his command for assistance.  This communication concluded "we are unable to protect ourselves without aid, and therefore hope for the protection of United States forces."  On receipt of this letter Mr. Stevens requested Captain Wiltse, commander of the U.S.S. <EM>Boston</EM>, to land a force "for the protection of the United States legation, United States consulate, and to secure the safety of American life and property."  The well-armed troops, accompanied by two gatling guns, were promptly landed and marched through the quiet streets of Honolulu to a public hall, previously secured by Mr. Stevens for their accommodation.  This hall was just across the street from the Government building, and in plain view of the Queen's palace.  The reason for thus locating the military will presently appear.  The governor of the Island immediately addressed to Mr. Stevens a communication protesting against the act as an unwarranted invasion of Hawaiian soil and reminding him that the proper authorities had never denied permission to the naval forces of the United States to land for drill or any other proper purpose.
<P>
About the same time the Queen's minister of foreign affairs sent a note to Mr. Stevens asking why the troops had been landed and informing him that the proper authorities were able and willing to afford full protection to the American legation and all American interests in Honolulu.  Only evasive replies were sent to these communications.
<P>
While there were no manifestations of excitement or alarm in the city, and the people were ignorant of the contemplated movement, the committee entered the Government building, after first ascertaining that it was unguarded, and read a proclamation declaring that the existing government was overthrown, and a Provisional Government established in its place, "to exist until terms of union with the United States of America have been negotiated and agreed upon."  No audience was present when the proclamation was read, but during the reading 40 or 50 men, some of them indifferently armed, entered the room.  The executive and advisory councils mentioned in the proclamation at once addressed a communication to Mr. Stevens, informing him that the monarchy had been abrogated and a provisional government established.  This communication concluded:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Such Provisional Government has been proclaimed, is now in possession of the Government department buildings, the archives, and the treasury, and is control of the city.  We hereby request that you will, on behalf of the United States, recognize it as the existing <EM>de facto</EM> Government of the Hawaiian Islands and afford to it the moral support of your Government, and, if necessary, the support of American troops to assist in preserving the public peace.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

On receipt of this communication, Mr. Stevens immediately recognized the new Government, and, in a letter addressed to Sanford B. Dole, its President, informed him that he had done so.  Mr. Dole replied:

<UL><UL><UL><UL><UL><UL><UL>GOVERNMENT BUILDING<BR>
						<EM>Honolulu, January 17, 1893.</EM>
</UL></UL></UL></UL></UL></UL></UL>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
SIR:  I acknowledge receipt of your valued communication of this day, recognizing the Hawaiian Provisional Government, and express deep appreciation of the same.  We have conferred with the ministers of the late Government, and have made demand upon the marshal to surrender the station house. We are not actually yet in possession of the station house, but as night is approaching and our forces may be insufficient to maintain order, we request the immediate support of the United States forces, and would request that the commander of the United States forces take command of our military forces, so that they may act together for the protection of the city.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>Respectfully, yours,</UL>

<UL><UL><UL><UL><UL><UL><UL>SANFORD B. DOLE<BR>
						<EM>Chairman Executive Council</EM>
</UL></UL></UL></UL></UL></UL></UL>

His Excellency JOHN L. STEVENS<BR>
<UL>United States Minister Resident.</UL>
<P>
	<EM>Note of Mr. Stevens at the end of the above communication.</EM>
<P>
The above request not complied with.
<P>
<UL><UL><UL><UL><UL><UL><UL>STEVENS.
</UL></UL></UL></UL></UL></UL></UL>
<P>
The station house was occupied by a well-armed force, under the command of a resolute, capable officer.  The same afternoon the Queen, her ministers, representatives of the Provisional Government, and others held a conference at the palace.  Refusing to recognize the new authority or surrender to it, she was informed that the Provisional Government had the support of the American minister, and, if necessary, would be maintained by the military force of the United States then present; that any demonstration on her part would precipitate a conflict with that force; that she could not, with hope of success, engage in war with the United States, and that resistance would result in useless sacrifice of life.  Mr. Damon, one of the chief leaders of the movement, and afterwards vice-president of the Provisional Government, informed the Queen that she could surrender under protest and her case would be considered later at Washington.  Believing that, under the circumstances, submission was a duty, and that her case would be fairly considered by the President of the United States, the Queen finally yielded and sent the Provisional Government the paper, which reads:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I, Liliuokalani, by the grace of God and under the constitution of the Hawaiian Kingdom, Queen, do hereby solemnly protest against any and all acts done against myself and the constitutional Government of the Hawaiian Kingdom by certain persons claiming to have established a Provisional Government of and for this Kingdom.
<P>
That I yield to the superior force of the United States of America, whose minister plenipotentiary, his excellency John L. Stevens, has caused United States troops to be landed at Honolulu and declared that he would support the Provisional Government.
<P>
Now, to avoid and collision of armed forces and perhaps the loss of life, I do, under this protest, and impelled by said force, yield my authority until such time as the Government of the United States shall, upon the facts being presented to it, undo the action of its representative and reinstate me and the authority which I claim as the constitutional sovereign of the Hawaiian Islands.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
	When this paper was prepared at the conclusion of the conference, and signed by the Queen and her ministers, a number of persons, including one or more representatives of the Provisional Government, who were still present and understood its contents, by their silence, at least, acquiesced in its statements, and, when it was carried to President Dole, he endorsed upon it, "Received from the hands of the late cabinet this 17th day of January, 1893," without challenging the truth of any of its assertions.  Indeed, it was not claimed on the 17th day of January, or for some time thereafter, by any of the designated offices of the Provisional Government or any annexationist that the Queen surrendered otherwise than as stated in her protest.
<P>
In his dispatch to Mr. Foster of January 18, describing the so-called revolution, Mr. Stevens says:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The committee of public safety forthwith took possession of the Government building, archives, and treasury, and installed the Provisional Government at the head of the respective departments.  This being an accomplished fact, I promptly recognized the Provisional Government as the <EM>de facto</EM> government of the Hawaiian Islands.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In Secretary Foster's communication of February 15 to the President, laying before him the treaty of annexation, with the view of obtaining the advice and consent of the Senate thereto, he says:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
At the time the Provisional Government took possession of the Government building no troops or officers of the United States were present or took any part in the proceedings.  No public recognition was accorded to the Provisional Government by the United States minister until after the Queen's abdication, and when they were in effective possession of the Government building, the archives, the treasury, the barracks, the police station, and all the potential machinery of the Government.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Similar language is found in an official letter addressed to Secretary Foster on February 3 by the special commissioners sent to Washington by the Provisional Government to negotiate a treaty of annexation.
<P>
These statements are utterly at variance with the evidence, documentary and oral, contained in Mr. Blount's reports.  They are contradicted by declarations and letters of President Dole and other annexationists and by Mr. Steven's own verbal admissions to Mr. Blount.  The Provisional Government was recognized when it had little other than a paper existence, and when the legitimate government was in full possession and control of the palace, the barracks, and the police station.  Mr. Stevens' well-known hostility and threatening presence of the force landed from the Boston was all that could have excited serious apprehension in the minds of the Queen, her officers, and loyal supporters.
<P>
It is fair to say that Secretary Foster's statements were based upon information which he had received from Mr. Stevens and the special commissioners, but I am unable to see that they were deceived.  The troops were landed, not to protected American life and property, but to aid in overthrowing the existing government.  Their very presence implied coercive measures against it.
<P>
In a statement given to Mr. Blount by Admiral Skerett, the ranking naval officer at Honolulu, he says:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If the troops were landed simply to protect American citizens and interests, they were badly stationed in Arion Hall, but if the intention was to aid the Provisional Government they were wisely stationed.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This hall was so situated that the troops in it easily commanded the Government building, and the proclamation was read under the Protection of American guns.  At an early stage of the movement, if not at the beginning, Mr. Stevens promised the annexationists that as soon as they obtained possession of the Government building and there read a proclamation of the character above referred to, he would at once recognize them as a <EM>de facto</EM> government, and support them by landing a force from our war ship then in the harbor, and he kept that promise.  This assurance was the inspiration of the movement, and without it the annexationists would not have exposed themselves to the consequences of failure.  They relied upon no military force of their own, for they had none worthy of the name.  The Provisional Government was established by the action of the American minister and the presence of troops landed from the <EM>Boston</EM>, and its continued existence is due to the belief of the Hawaiians that if they made an effort to overthrow it, they would encounter the armed forces of the United States.
<P>
The earnest appeals to the American minister for military protection by the officers of that government, after it had been recognized, show the utter absurdity of the claim that it was established by a successful revolution of the people of the Islands.  Those appeals were a confession by the men who made them of their weakness and timidity.  Courageous men, conscious of their strength and justice of their cause, do not thus act.  It is not now claimed that a majority of the people, having the right to vote under the constitution of 1887, ever favored the existing authority or annexation to this or any other country.  They earnestly desire that the government of their choice shall be restored and its independence respected.
<P>
Mr. Blount states that while at Honolulu he did not meet a single annexationist who expressed willingness to submit the question to a vote of the people, nor did he talk with one on that subject who did not insist that of the Islands were annexed suffrage should so be restricted as to give complete control to foreigners or whites.  Representative annexationists have repeatedly made similar statements to the undersigned.
<P>
The Government of Hawaii surrendered its authority under a threat of war, until such time only as the Government of the United States, upon the facts being presented to it, should reinstate the constitutional sovereign, and the Provisional Government was created "to exist until terms of union with the United States of America have been agreed upon."  A careful consideration of the facts will, I think, convince you that the treaty which was withdrawn from the Senate for further consideration should not be resubmitted for its action thereon.
<P>
Should not the great wrong done to a feeble but independent State by an abuse of authority of the United States be undone by restoring the legitimate government?  Anything sHort of that will not, I respectfully submit, satisfy the demands of justice.
<P>
Can the United States consistently insist that other nations shall respect the independence of Hawaii while not respecting it ourselves?  Our Government was the first to recognize the independence of the Islands, and it should be the last to acquire sovereignty over them by force and fraud.
<P>
<UL>Respectfully submitted.

Dennis "Bumpy" Kanahele told a federal judge yesterday that he won't testify in his own defense and offered an explanation for the actions that led to criminal charges against him.
<P>
"As I stand before you, I still believe a grave injustice has been done to our people," the head of the self-proclaimed Nation of Hawaii told U.S. District Judge Helen Gillmor.  The jury was not present.
<P>
Kanahele is charged with harboring federal fugitive Nathan Brown, a convicted tax protester, and thwarting two attempts to arrest Brown last year.
<P>
Kanahele claims the federal and state governments are illegally occupying Hawaii and that he was only exercising his native, sovereign rights.
<P>
He said yesterday he won't testify in his own behalf because Gillmor won't let him raise sovereignty arguments in his defense.
<P>
"My case is based on <A HREF="sovereignty.html">sovereignty</A>," Kanahele, wearing a charcoal-gray suit, told Gillmor politely.  "But there's a lot of elements that's not allowed in the courts....I understand the court's position."
<P>
He added, "I'll be lying if I do testify," a reference to his belief that the U.S. and state governments have no jurisdiction over him.
<P>
"And you don't want to lie," said the judge.
<P>
"No," said Kanahele.
<P>
The exchange came after Kanahele's attorney, Hayden Aluli, rested his case.
<P>
Witnesses for Gordon Kaaihue, a co-defendant on one charge, finished testifying later yesterday.
<P>
The case will go to the jury today, after closing arguments.
<P>
Aluli had planned to have U.S. Marshal Annette Kent testify yesterday. But he decided against it after drawing testimony from other witnesses about a June meeting between Kanahele and Kent.
<P>
After Aluli rested without calling Kanahele to the stand, Gillmor called Kanahele forward and asked him if he understood his rights to choose whether to testify or not.
<P>
Kanahele, who has been held without bail since his Aug. 2 arrest, spoke slowly.   "If the governor had not picked me for the sovereignty commission, I would not be here today....I would not be challenging the United States."
<P>
Gillmor said she understood, but federal laws and rules require her to limit the trial to the specifics of the alleged crimes.
<P>
Then-Gov. John Waihee appointed Kanahele in 1993 to the state commission created to begin work on Hawaiian self-determination or <A HREF="sovereignty.html">sovereignty</A>.
<P>
The commission brought an Illinois law professor, <A HREF="boylebio.html">Francis Boyle</A>, to Hawaii to <A HREF="boylesum.html">speak on sovereignty</A> soon after Congress passed a <A HREF="publawsum.html">resolution apologizing for the U.S. role in the 1893 overthrow of the Hawaiian kingdom</A>.
<P>
Boyle suggested that Hawaiians could reclaim sovereignty by simply declaring it.  That moved Kanahele to quit the commission and <A HREF="proclamsum.html">declared an independent Nation of Hawaii</A>.
<P>
Kanahele told Gillmor yesterday, "<A HREF="boylesum.html">Professor Boyle's position</A> is very important for my beliefs."  But Gillmor declined to allow Aluli to call Boyle as a witness, saying it's irrelevant to the trial.
<P>
Attempts by Aluli and Kaaihue's attorney, Sidney Quintal, to raise sovereignty issues have drawn objections from assistant U.S. attorney Les Osborne and prompted many sidebar conferences with the judge out of the jury's earshot.

Wolfgang Kovacek interviews Hawaiian politician "Bumpy" Kanahele
<P>
<EM>How do you see the Hawaiian way of life at this point in time and what can you do for it?</EM>
<P>
Well, the culture is alive and growing.  Today a lot of people live by, and practice our culture, religion, language and arts.  We are already protecting our culture, by claiming our independence and restoring the Hawaii Constitution.
<P>
<EM>Do you have special plans to support cultural projects or culture in general?</EM>
<P>
Yes, we do.  In fact, we already have a budget plan.  We have cost analyses for agriculture, etc.  We are starting fish ponds, and we have a whole set-up of plans on every island, also hospitals.
<P>
<EM>How does the model of selfsustaining communities fit into your picture of the Hawaiian state?</EM>
<P>
If you look at the <A HREF="publawsum.html">U.S. Public Law</A>, and if you read the first paragraph of the <A HREF="publawsum.html">apology bill</A>, you can read how special the Hawaiian people were.  They lived in a self-sufficient social system based on communal land tenure, with a sophisticated language, religion and culture.  So, we are used to self-sufficiency, and sustainable technologies, which they talk about today because we had our eco-system then.  I think we are the pioneers of sustainable technologies.  The modern sustainable technologies which are available today can help us clean up the environment again and get back to the way it was.  Personally, to tell you how deeply I feel about cleaning up the environment, I would take all the coal and put it back into the earth, and I would take all the oil in the world and do the same thing.
<P>
<EM>What can be done, in your view, to promote exchanges of culture, tourism and information between Hawaii and Europe?</EM>
<P>
We had that - a long time ago.  We were recognized by all European countries as an independent nation.  So what we need now is not just exchanges, but to have the governments of these countries recognize our independence and the legitimate <A HREF="constitution.html">constitution of Hawaii</A>.  That's more important than exchanges.  We are serious about independence.  It is the only way to go.  Austria has its independence, other countries have theirs - ours was stolen.  My question to the European peoples is, shall we open up the treaties again that we have with countries like Austria, Finland, Germany, etc.?
<P>
<EM>How do believe economics and ecology can come together and finally become one?</EM>
<P>
In order for a country to prosper, the individuals themselves as citizens have to prosper financially.  In our situation, what we have to take care of is economic stability, and the only way to do that is to understand about the money that flows around.  The U.S. Dollar no longer has the value that it had before.  It used to be backed by silver and gold, and now it's backed by somebody's assets.  What we would like to do for our economic situation is go back to being a tax haven, go back to substance banking.  Hawaii can do that.  It would attract billions and trillions of dollars as an offshore bank for other countries.  I believe that should be taken care of right away because once we do that we can do anything to take care of the ecological problems. 
<P>
<EM>So your way of solving that problem would be: first get the economy right by means of offshore banking, so that the money can come in, and then the ecology?</EM>
<P>
It's not just the banks, but once the economic situation looks up, we shall have more time for the ecological situation.  We need to take care of the individual, the people, now.  The only way to do that is to educate them.
<P>
<EM>Is the sovereignty movement only political, or does it also connect with the sovereignty of the human being and the soul?</EM>
<P>
It's not just political.  Although, you see, "political" means having a voice - the voice of a people that wants independence, free association, or integration.  If politics is without a voice, the economy, society and culture cannot work.  It is a whole, a balance of the whole person, the whole human being that we are talking about, and about the rights of that human being.
<P>
<EM>One last question.  What do you think about children and their importance for the future, and the family?</EM>
<P>
The children are our love.  The children are the truth.  The children are the future.  Since there has been a communication gap between the generations, we have to close that gap among ourselves and with the children of the future - which we are doing.  We work a lot with the children and with our elders, and we are starting to bring the generations closer together.

<H1>Judge tells Kanahele jury: Keep deliberating</H1>

<H2>Despite an impasse and defense protests, she orders jurors to press on</H2>

<EM>Star-Bulletin</EM>
<P>
A federal judge today told jurors they have a duty to try to reach a verdict in the trial of sovereignty activists Dennis "Bumpy" Kanahele and Gordon Kaaihue.
<P>
Judge Helen Gillmor said jurors, who declared yesterday that they were at an impasse on the two felony counts against Kanahele, should not hesitate to change their opinions during future deliberations.
<P>
But she also said as she read from federal appellate instructions that they shouldn't change an honest opinion "for the mere purpose of returning a verdict."
<P>
Jurors submitted the impasse communication after meeting for about a day, saying they were unable to agree on a verdict against Kanahele, leader of the self-<A HREF="proclamsum.html">proclaimed</A> Nation of Hawaii.
<P>
Hayden Aluli, Kanahele's attorney, urged Gillmor to declare a mistrial and objected to her ordering the jury back to deliberate, calling the practice "coercive."
<P>
Aluli said a mistrial was the second-best thing to an acquittal and said most jurors ordered to keep deliberating return with a verdict.
<P>
"I'd rather have a bird in the hand," he said this morning, adding that he didn't know which way the jurors were leaning.
<P>
Sidney Quintal, Kaaihue's attorney, wanted Gillmor to seal the verdict jurors reached in the charges against his client.  He said he believed that jurors had acquitted him.
<P>
But he also said jury instructions were the most appealed issue in trials and that Gillmor played it safe by not sealing one count and keeping the remaining two open.
<P>
Les Osborne, assistant U.S. attorney, wanted jurors to continue to try to reach a verdict, adding that about a day of deliberations was not much for a three-week trial.
<P>
The government has charged Kanahele and Kaaihue with interfering with a police officer trying to serve a warrant in January 1994 on Nathan Brown, a federal fugitive evading a 78-month sentence for tax fraud.
<P>
Federal officials also charged Kanahele with harboring Brown and obstructing federal marshals in their pursuit of him three months later at Kanahele's Waimanalo home.
<P>
If convicted, Kaaihue could serve one year and Kanahele nine years.
<P>
If Gillmor had declared a mistrial, Kanahele, who has been in custody since his August arrest, may have been released, Aluli said.  "He wants to go home tonight and do tricks and treats with his family."
<P>
Kaaihue, free on $1,000 bond, also said he wanted the trial over and said he believed the evidence showed he was not guilty.  He distributed a statement outside the courthouse this morning, thanking the jury.
<P>
But he also said they had heard only half the case, saying he and Kanahele had not been allowed to explain "our side concerning our cultural and political beliefs."
<P>
Gillmor had ruled that she would not allow jurors to hear sovereignty defenses in the case against sovereignty activists.  She had said she would rule on <A HREF="sovereignty.html">sovereignty</A> questions, but would not allow jurors to hear the debate.
<P>
Aluli said he believed jurors reached an impasse because they were confused by jury instructions that did not permit Kanahele to use self-defense as a defense in the felony charges.
<P>
Kanahele did not testify, but Aluli said in opening statements that Kanahele did not hear the two U.S. marshals identify themselves and did not want to let strangers on his property.
<P>
Aluli also said two witnesses provided evidence that Kanahele acted in self-defense.  The witnesses attending a June meeting with Kanahele and federal officials and testified to what Kanahele said.
<P>
But Gillmor ruled that the testimony of the witnesses was hearsay and did not qualify as evidence.
<P>
She also agreed with Osborne's argument, based on U.S. Supreme Court decisions.
<P>
He said a U.S. marshal in hot pursuit of a federal fugitive may enter onto the property of a third party to make an arrest.
<P>
He also said that the law did not require that the property owner know the identification of a marshal.
<P>
In a Friday communication, jurors asked: "Does the last paragraph (of the instructions mean we exclude facts and evidence presented, because it appears the instruction is saying we have to allow anyone to enter our private property because they may be marshals?"
<P>
The instruction said the government need not show that the defendant had any intent to injure the U.S. marshal at the time of the alleged action.

<B>The Maui News  <BR>
State News In Brief<BR>
Friday, August 30, 1996</B></CENTER>
<P>
HONOLULU (AP) -- It's been threats and a ``steady diet'' of angry phone calls for the lone man responsible for counting the Native Hawaiian Vote ballots. 
<P>
Russell Mokulehua said since he took the job of counting the ballots from the Native Hawaiian Vote, he's had to encounter an unexpected number of Hawaiians angry because they can't change the way they voted. 
<P>
``Now that I look back, I think perhaps I was a little naive,'' Mokulehua said. 
<P>
The mail-in ballot asked Hawaiians whether they wanted to elect delegates to propose a Native Hawaiian government. Mokulehua said that since the beginning of August, he's been getting calls from people who wanted him to reverse their votes. 
<P>
When he explains he can't tamper with the ballots, callers often turn obscene and their frustrations have turned to threats, he said. 
<P>
The results of the vote may or may not be released since they are being challenged in federal court. A hearing was scheduled today. 
<P>
Judge David Ezra said he will rule next week whether the results can be released. 
<P>
Mokulehua, who has been an observer of state election since 1988, said he doesn't want to be the only one to ever know the results of the vote -- he is eager to tell. 
<P>
``It's been sitting on my mind,'' he said. ``It feels very burdensome.'' 
<P>
Critics have said the state-run vote is illegal because it discriminates by not letting other races become involved. 
<P>
But supporters say it is an essential step toward Hawaiian sovereignty. 
<P>
One other person, Sol Kaho`ohalahala, chairman of the <A HREF="http://hoohana.aloha.net/hsec">Hawaii Sovereignty Elections Council</A>, is the only other person who knows the results of the vote. He is the only person Mokulehua can legally tell.

<H2>KANAKA MAOLI WANT ISLANDS BACK</H2>
<P>
<H2>Hawaii is holding a plebiscite this year on its future.<BR>
But the natives already claim complete sovereignty.</H2>
<P>
<B>National Geographic News Service, January 1995</B>

<P>
By Joy Aschenbach
<P>
Far out in the Pacific Ocean, "kanaka maoli," descendants of Native Hawaiians, have come closer that ever to taking back control of the island lands they say were stolen from them.
<P>
"This is the first time people with any amount of Hawaiian blood have been able to participate in and make decisions for themselves.  It's quite a monumental event," says Tara Lulani McKenzie, executive director of the Hawaiian Sovereignty Elections Council, created by the state to facilitate a 1995 plebiscite.
<P>
About 200,000 native Hawaiians in the state of 1.1 million residents, and 74,000 more on the U.S. mainland, will be eligible to cast a ballot late this year.  Native Hawaiians are those who trace their ancestors back before 1778, when the first Europeans, led by English Capt. James Cook, reached their islands.
<P>
Ballots will be mailed out Nov. 15 and must be returned by Dec. 29.  The single yes-no proposition will ask the native people whether they want to elect delegates to a convention that could recommend some form of native Hawaiian government.  The results will be announced Jan. 17, 1996.
<P>
That will be the 103rd anniversary of the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii by American sugar planters and businessmen, who wanted duty-free trade with the mainland.  They were backed by U.S. Marines.
<P>
The self-proclaimed Nation of Hawaii, which has its own constitution, scorns the coming vote.  A spokesman says the nation is "absolutely opposed to the administration of a so-called plebiscite by the illegitimate state of Hawaii."
<P>
The plebescite, according to the Nation of Hawaii leaders, is "a direct interference with the recognized inherent rights of the people and their process of self-determination, a deliberate attempt to confuse the issue and suppress the rightful process of restitution and restoration."
<P>
On Jan. 17, 1893, Queen Liliuokalani yielded "to the superior force of the United States."  The islands were annexed by Congress in 1898 and became a state in 1959.
<P>
In November 1993, President Clinton signed a <A HREF="publawsum.html">resolution from Congress formally apologizing</A> to Native Hawaiians for the 1893 overthrow and acknowledging its illegality.
<P>
The U.S. Navy followed up in May 1994 by returning to the state the island of Kahoolawe, which had been commandeered during World War II for use as a bombing and target range.  Congress has authorized $400 million to clean up and restore the deserted island, smallest of the eight main islands is the Hawaiian chain.
<P>
"The <A HREF="publawsum.html">apology</A> is an admission that the United States stole Hawaii," says <A HREF="boylebio.html">Francis A. Boyle</A> of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, an international law expert who is now advising some native Hawaiians.
<P>
"The Hawaiians have the right under international law to restore the independent nation they had in 1893 when the U.S. government came and destroyed it," he contends.  "This is their right, if that's what they want to do."
<P>
The recent federal and state actions have given the sovereignty movement "more legitimacy that ever," Boyle says.  "It is the culmination of a long struggle."
<P>
But what form sovereignty might take is wide open: an independent Hawaiian nation, completely separated from the United States; a nation-within-a-nation, similar to some of the America Indian nations on the mainland; a commonwealth like Puerto Rico's; or status quo, but with greater control over native lands.
<P>
The legally complicated issue of Hawaiian lands ceded to the United States at annexation and turned over to the state in 1959 is at the heart of the sovereignty matter.
<P>
The most aggressive of the half-dozen major sovereignty groups, the Ohana Council, <A HREF="proclamsum.html">declared independence</A> from the United States in January 1994, both for its 10,000 members and for all native Hawaiians.
<P>
U.S. Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, says he hopes that "the sovereignty of the Hawaiian people will be restored in my lifetime."  He envisions an independent Hawaiian government within the framework fo the federal and state jurisdictions.

<H1>HO`IKE I KA PONO</H1>
<H2>"WITNESS FOR JUSTICE"</H2>
<H3>CALL FOR THE RELEASE OF MR. DENNIS "BUMPY" KANAHELE</H3>
</CENTER>
</HEAD>

On August 31, 1995, forty-two persons who belonged to various churches and religious and community organizations participated in a "Witness for Justice" tour of the Nation of Hawaii's Pu`uhonua O Waimanalo village.
<P>
The purpose of this visit was to understand first hand the situation involving the arrest and imprisonment of Nation leader Mr. Dennis "Bumpy" Kanahele.  We listened to the issues and concerns from members of the nation.  We heard from Mr. Hayden Aluli, attorney for Mr. Kanahele.
<P>
We believe Mr. Kanahele when he says that he has become, and continues to be, committed to the principles of non-violence.  Along with the hundreds of reputable persons who have written on his behalf, we do not believe him to be a "danger to the community."  Moreover, we do not believe that Mr. Kanahele is a "flight risk."  Everything he stands for is here in his homeland.
<P>
Further, we read the <A HREF="let_ipcp.html">letter from the Rev. S. Michael Yasutake, Ph.D., Director of the Interfaith Prisoners of Conscience Project of the National Council of Churches</A>, which concluded that according to its criteria for determining who is a "political prisoner," Mr. Kanahele is indeed a political prisoner or a prisoner of conscience.  We would not argue the justice or injustice of the particular charges brought before Mr. Kanahele.  However, we have come to believe that his denial of bail and his continuous incarceration without having been proven guilty of the charges are a violation of his Constitutional rights and a serious miscarriage of justice.
<P>
It is incredible that a nation as big and powerful as the United States of America would react in such fear of Mr. Kanahele and the things for which he stands, and that the United States of America would seek to silence him and remove him from his people and his community.
<P>
We ask all who stand for the First Amendment right of freedom of speech, and the right of every citizen for equal justice before the law, to join us in petitioning the Federal Court of the United States of America to grant Mr. Kanahele his:
<P>
<OL>
<LI> Right to bail
<li> Release from imprisonment
</OL>

<STRONG>WE ARE HEREBY REMINDED THAT THE UNJUST IMPRISONMENT OF ANY ONE PERSON DIMINISHES THE FREEDOM OF ALL</STRONG>

<P>
As an ecumenical faith based support organization of prisoners of conscience or political prisoners in the United States, we as Interfaith Prisoners of Conscience Project extend our support to the Honorable Pu`uhonua B. Kanahele.  We define a political prisoner or a prisoner of conscience as a person imprisoned - awaiting trial, serving a sentence, or held without trial - for reason of acts, associations or beliefs based on a concern for justice and human rights.
<P>
We consider Mr. Kanahele's being charged with "harboring a fugitive" as a miscarriage of justice directed against one who is an advocate of Hawaiian sovereignty.
<P>
We join others in protesting the abuse of power by the government and pray for and seek Mr. Kanahele's release.

<H1>Turmoil surrounds Kanahele mistrial</H1>
<H2>Juror suspected of misconduct; jury tampering question raised</H2>

<P>
The federal trial of Dennis "Bumpy" Kanahele ended abruptly yesterday when U.S. District Judge Helen Gillmor declared a mistrial because of the jury's impasse, one juror's misconduct and a suggestion of jury tampering.
<P>
Assistant U.S. attorney Les Osborne said there was "absolutely no doubt at all" that the government will try the case again.  A hearing to set the date is scheduled this afternoon.
<P>
Kanahele's attorney, Hayden Aluli, said he will seek to have the charges dropped because the mistrial was declared over his objections.
<P>
Aluli said Gillmor's ruling was "clearly an abuse of discretion" that ended the case without "sufficient reason."
<P>
Kanahele - who is head of the self-proclaimed Nation of Hawaii, which says it is independent of the federal and state governments - was charged with harboring a federal fugitive, convicted tax protester Nathan Brown, and with foiling two 1994 attempts to arrest Brown.
<P>
Gordon Kaaihue, head of the Nation of Hawaii's "peace force," was a co-defendant on one count, a misdemeanor.
<P>
Yesterday, two jurors said the jury had agreed to acquit Kanahele and Kaaihue on that count, but was deadlocked on the other two felony charges against Kanahele. Another juror said a majority favored conviction.
<P>
Kanahele remains in Halawa prison, where he has been held without bail since he was secretly indicted and arrested on Aug. 2.  Aluli will attempt to have him released on bail pending the next trial.
<P>
Osborne, who prosecuted the case, said the government will oppose such a move because Kanahele is "a danger to the community."
<P>
Kanahele has pledged that he's nonviolent and says he was singled out for prosecution because of his activism for Hawaiian independence.
<P>
Gillmor, on her first anniversary on the federal bench, declared the mistrial only a few hours after she had ordered the jurors to reconsider their positions in hopes of breaking their impasse on two of the three counts against Kanahele.
<P>
The jury sent her its fourth question yesterday morning:  "Can we make a decision using a law from the Constitution of the United States and from the Bill of Rights (Article IV)?"
<P>
The Fourth Amendment is the one that prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures by government.
<P>
The jury's question heartened Aluli, who had claimed that Kanahele was only acting to protect his property against an unknown intruder when he blocked deputy marshal Lawrence Tice from chasing Brown onto Kanahele's property.
<P>
Osborne said, "It's very interesting ... when one of the parties claims to represent a sovereign state which renounces the Constitution of the United States and now wishes to use that Constitution as a sword."
<P>
Gillmor set a hearing for 1:30 p.m. to discuss how to respond to the jury's question.  But when the hearing finally began, more than a half-hour late, Gillmor revealed that the question apparently stemmed from some research done by one juror, Robert DeCosta, on his own in the federal court's law library one floor below the courtroom.
<P>
Librarian Patricia Butson said DeCosta asked to see "Article IV of the Bill of Rights" and checked out a thick law book on the Constitution for about a half-hour that morning. 
<P>
Gillmor's instructions to the jury at the start of the trial had included standard language warning the jurors not to conduct any research or investigation into the case beyond what they had heard and seen in the courtroom.
<P>
Osborne, Aluli and Kaaihue's attorney, Sidney Quintal, debated how to proceed.
<P>
Then Gillmor dropped a bombshell, saying that at lunchtime one of the jurors had approached the deputy marshal who was shepherding them and asked "whether we've had any problems with jury tampering" and whether it had been serious.
<P>
Gillmor said that when she learned of this, she questioned the marshal privately in her chambers.
<P>
She indicated it was unclear whether the juror's questions were harmless or something more than that.  Without elaborating, she said it would be impossible to question that juror without a mistrial.
<P>
Osborne and Aluli said the tampering revelation took them by surprise, and they had no further information about it.
<P>
Osborne said, "Jury tampering is a crime," and he speculated that Gillmor decided not to question the juror out of concern for his rights against self-incrimination.
<P>
An investigation was expected to begin.
<P>
Osborne said, "It's unfortunate that because of outside difficulties, the jury was unable to complete its job.  But in view of the outrageous events that occurred, the judge had no choice but to declare a mistrial."
<P>
Aluli said he will be reviewing whether his client can be retried because it was the court that declared the mistrial over the defense objections. Another trial, he said, might violate his client's constitutional rights against double jeopardy or being tried twice for the same offense.
<P>
Aluli initially wanted a mistrial when the jury reported Monday it had reached an "impasse" on the two counts against his client.  He said the panel's questions yesterday "showed me that the jury was really a smart jury and could have been possibly leaning toward the defense."
<P>
Quintal, Kaaihue's attorney, had asked Gillmor to have the jury return a verdict on the one misdemeanor count in which Kaaihue and Kanahele were both charged, but Gillmor declined.

Michael Grace, my husband, and I, among severalothers, have represented ourselves in these same events for nearly 10 years.We came to the conclusion that there was no possible justice because therules and laws are employed in ways that do not allow the truth to be heard.<BR><BR>Whether de facto or de jure, as the lawyers would say, Judge Gillmor isin &quot;bed&quot; with U.S. Prosecutor Les Osborne. We attended most ofthe trial and were horrified to see such a kangaroo court. <BR><BR>I had hoped that qualified lawyers, committed to seeing justice being done,could find a way to get the truth before a jury that seemed to be made upof Bumpy's peers. <BR><BR>A'ole, no way. It was even worse because it was so blatant. The U.S Prosecutorcould just stand up, without needing to say one word, and Judge Gillmorwould say &quot;sustained.&quot; &quot;Sidebar,&quot; the new judicial jargonfor &quot;come to the bench,&quot; seemed like 50 percent of the trial.<BR><BR>You've all read that the question of sovereignty is not allowed in the defense.The &quot;s&quot; word was a &quot;question of law,&quot; not a &quot;matterof facts,&quot; and that's where I finally saw the process of self-determinationbeing manipulated by the power structure. <BR><BR>Our case, Bumpy's case, Nathan Brown's case, and at least 100 more haveeverything to do with Kanaka Maoli's &quot;full and inherent right and anational land base&quot;, as codified in <A HREF="publawsum.html">U.S. PublicLaw 103-150, the &quot;Apology Bill</A>.&quot; <BR><BR>We all tried to raise the question of the illegal status of the U.S. andthe state of Hawaii in the instances where we were occupying lands and servingconstructive notices on judges and other officials. We tried a common lawcourt action where the governor, attorney general and other defendants weregiven 1099 tax forms for default judgments that got the IRS &quot;up inarms.&quot; <BR><BR>Citizens of the U.S., what should be of even more concern in Bumpy's trialis that Judge Gillmor ruled and put into the 32 plus &quot;jury instructions&quot;that no &quot;self-defense&quot; defense could be argued by the defendants.This ruling has a direct relationship to the felony count and the questionof Bumpy having a right to have the U.S. marshals identify themselves beforebeing allowed on his property. <BR><BR>The specter of the Waco disaster and the violations against the Weaver familywere even present. Especially when U.S. Prosecutor Osborne referred to ourPu`uhonua in Waimanalo as a &quot;compound.&quot; To portray our villageas such and to continually argue that Bumpy is a danger to the communityis an attempt to distort the facts and history of our movement. <BR><BR>Today, there will again be a bail hearing. The National Council of Churchesis providing the $200,000 for the bail, and many mainstream leaders willspeak out for Bumpy. Our prayers for a release may become a reality. <BR><BR>But because Judge Gillmor ordered a mistrial, Bumpy and Gordon Kaaihue haveto go to trial again in January. We raised the money for the first trialthrough the help of so many ohana and friends. <BR><BR>We must again ask for help. If you can see the potential danger of a precedentthat will infringe on your rights, not just our nation's rights, to exist,please mail a check to: Hawaii Social Justice Fund, P.O.

<P>
Unless his lawyer can persuade the courts to change their mind, Dennis "Bumpy" Kanahele will be in jail at least until January, when his second trial on federal charges is scheduled to begin.
<P>
And unless he's allowed to go free on bail, the head of the self-<A HREF="proclamsum.html">proclaimed</A> Nation of Hawaii could be behind bars much longer even if he's not convicted, while his attorney, Harden Aluli, appeals the case, Aluli said yesterday.
<P>
Kanahele was secretly indicted, then arrested, on Aug. 2.  he is charged with jarboring a federal fugitive, convicted tax protester Nathan Brown, and with foiling two 1994 attempts to arrest Brown.
<P>
He has been held without bail since his arrest, deemed a "danger to the comunity" and a likely no-show for trial.
<P>
His three-week trial on the charges ended Tuesday when U.S. District Judge Helen Gillmor declared a mistrial.
<P>
She cited the jury's impasse on two felony counts against Kanahele, a juror's improper research on his own and possible taint after a juror asked a deputy marshal some questions about jury tampering.  (Jurors indicated later that they had agreed to acquit Kanahele and co-defendent Gordon Kaaihue on the other count, a misdemeanor.)
<P>
Yesterday, federal Magistrate Barry Kurren scheduled a new trial for Kanahele to begin Jan. 3.  Gillmor is scheduled to preside over the case again.
<P>
Aluli said he will file a new request that Kanahele be allowed to go free on bail.  New parties have come forward to vouch for Kanahele, said Aluli, who hopes for a hearing on the matter next week.
<P>
Aluli said he will also ask the courts to drop the case against Kanahele because of constitutional prohibitions against "double jeopardy."  Aluli objected to Gillmor's declaring a mistrial, calling it "an abuse of the court's discretion" and claiming that Kanahele can't be tried again.
<P>
Aluli said that if the court turns him down he'll appeal - a process that could take a year.
<P>
Meanwhile, he said, "Bumpy wants to go home.  He wanted a (new) trial before the holidays."

</CENTER>
<P>
HONOLULU (AP) -- <A HREF="http://planet-hawaii.com/hsec/">The Hawaiian Sovereignty Elections Council</A> is proposing a November 1997 election of delegates to a convention to propose some form of Native Hawaiian government. 
<P>
The council will hold a meeting Saturday at Blaisdell Arena to receive input from the community. About 1,000 people -- Hawaiians and non-Hawaiians -- are expected to participate. 
<P>
The council estimates it will cost $1.1 million to hold the election and $7.2 million to hold the convention. 
<P>
The council also is recommending that the <A HREF="http://planet-hawaii.com/oha/">Office of Hawaiian Affairs</A> and the Legislature each pay one-third of the cost, and the Hawaiian community raise the other third. 
<P>
During Saturday's meeting, speakers will have three minutes each to comment on the proposal. However, they won't be given any time for long presentations on alternative proposals. 
<P>
Council Executive Director Lulani McKenzie said the intent is to focus the meeting ``on a subject matter so it doesn't go all over the place.'' 
<P>
Opponents of the council and the Native Hawaiian Vote will be among those participating in the Saturday meeting. Among the opponents are the sovereignty groups <A HREF="http://kalahui.org">Ka Lahui Hawaii</A> and Ka Pakaukau. 
<P>
Kekuni Blaisdell, leader of Ka Pakaukau, said at a news conference Wednesday that Princeton University professor of international law Richard Falk has reviewed the Native Hawaiian Vote and concluded that it is invalid.

The state trial of Dennis "Bumpy" Kanahele, head of the self-proclaimed Nation of Hawaii, on traffic and contempt-of-court charges was postponed yesterday until Thursday.
<P>
Meanwhile, he's staying in Halawa prison.
<P>
His lawyer, Hayden Aluli, said the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals this week rejected the final attempt to get Kanahele freed on bail pending an Oct. 3 trial in federal court on charges that he harbored a fugitive.
<P>
In a 2-1 split decision, the appeals panel in San Francisco upheld last month's ruling that Kanahele be held without bail until his federal trial.
<P>
"The government has shown, by clear and convincing evidence, that appellant poses a danger to the community," the appeals court stated.  "The government has also shown, by a preponderance of evidence, that appellant constitutes a flight risk."
<P>
Kanahele and his supporters deny that and say that welcome the chance to publicly present their case that the U.S. and state governments are illegally occupying Hawaii.
<P>
Aluli said Kanahele is being targeted for "politically motivated selective prosecution."
<P>
Aluli said, "I'm troubled by the way the state and federal governments are using - abusing - the process just because he's the most outspoken Hawaiian activist."
<P>
Aluli said the appellate decision was handed down Tuesday and that he learned about it Thursday.
<P>
The federal case against Kanahele accuses him of harboring fugitive tax protester Nathan Brown last year and interfering with efforts to arrest Brown, who was convinced of felony tax fraud but failed to show up to serve his prison sentence.
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="csmplate.gif" VSPACE=2 HSPACE=5>The state charges stem from a 1992 case in which Kanahele was cited for driving a truck without a state driver's license, license plates, registration tag and no-fault insurance.  The vehicle had a homemade "Hawaiian Sovereign" license plate link the ones used by many of his followers.  When Kanahele failed to answer the citation in court later that year, a bench warrant was issued for contempt of court.
<P>
He was arrested on the warrant in July.
<P>
Earlier yesterday, Gordon Kaaihue, a "peace officer" for the Nation of Hawaii who had been arrested in a similar traffic case, pleaded no contest to driving without a license or reconstructed vehicle permit and refusing to show identification.
<P>
In exchange, nine other charges against him were dropped.  Judge James Dannenberg sentenced Kaaihue to perform 23 hours of community service.

<H1>What meaning does the sovereignty vote have for our community?</H1>
 
<A HREF="http://www.maui.net/~haltimes">Haleakala Times</A>, September 17 - 30, 1996
</CENTER>
<P>
By Richard LaFond, Jr.
<P>

"Hawaiians are a sovereign people without a sovereign government," Davianna Pomaika`i McGregor, Vice-Chairperson of the <A HREF="http://planet-hawaii.com/hsec/">Hawaiian Sovereignty Elections Council</A> stated in a press release. Ironically, Native Hawaiians and the general voting populace seem to react similarly to democratic governance opportunities. Out of 80,000 Native Hawaiian voters, 37.5% participated in the sovereignty vote, while 36.7% of Maui County's 55,000 voters cast ballots in the recent Primary election.
<P>
Yet among the Hawaiians, there is a solid majority in agreement with the sovereignty process  73% gave a mandate to hold elections for delegates who will propose a Native Hawaiian government. In Maui County, 79% voted `ae, with Maui's 11th (Kihei and Kula) and 12th (Haiku and north Kauai) representative districts leading the state with 84.4% and 82.8% approval, respectively.
<P>
On the day that the results of the vote were announced, leaders in Maui's Native Hawaiian community conducted a candidate forum at Maui Community College, in association with the MCC Student Government Association.
<P>
Na Kapuna O Maui invited candidates in two winner-takes-all primary contests to attend. Sol Kaho`ohalahala, Chairman of the Native Hawaiian Sovereignty Elections Council and a Maui County Council member seeking a second term was the only incumbent on the panel. His challenger Riki Hokama made his first and only forum appearance in the campaign. Half the candidates for the 5th State Senate District accepted the invitation: Ian Chan Hodges and John Wayne Enriques. Incumbent Joe Tanaka and challenger Jay Nakasone did not attend.
<P>
Though the Primary has occurred and the two incumbents have been reelected, the discussion held fast on the heels of news of the Sovereignty vote provided a glimpse of the work ahead for anyone playing or wanting to play a public policy role.
<P>
Candidates responded to questions asked by Tasha Kama, <A HREF="http://www.hookele.com/storyteller">Charlie Maxwell</A>, and the Haleakala Times, and later, the general public in attendance. Focus topics were economic stability, Hawaiian Sovereignty, education, land and water and Hawaiian rights, and health and safety.
<P>
At this event the big question was, "What next?" Now that Hawaiians have voted overwhelmingly to convene and propose a form of self-determination, the responsiveness of existing political structures and governance systems will surely be tested. As Chan Hodges said, it is the most significant economic and social issue for the State of Hawai`i. Kaho`ohalahala very clearly stated that addressing the issue should not be limited to Hawaiian people. "Everyone is responsible and should participate in the process," he said.
<P>
Land and water resources now controlled by State and private interests, are vital to a re-emerging Hawaiian nation. Recent court rulings have seriously and broadly acknowledged Native Hawaiian rights to natural resources, including access through private property for traditional uses such as hunting and gathering. Contrarily, the State Department of Land and Natural Resources has locked both Hawaiians and non-Hawaiians out of Makena Beach during the night, for an indefinite term.
<P>
Kaho`ohalahala reminded everyone that Hawaiian rights are inherent rights, and the Admissions Act that granted Hawai`i statehood established the State as trustee, not as owner, of resources. There is also a cloud over the State's title of ownership because of admissions by the U.S. Congress and the President under <A HREF="publawall.html">public law 103-150</A> that the <A HREF="mauidemo.html">ceded lands</A> were illegally acquired by an illegal government. A State court has already ordered the State to stop the sale of public lands because of Hawaiian sovereign claims to those lands.
<P>
There was surprising consensus among Na Kapuna forum candidates to restore all ceded land and water to Hawaiians. Kaho`ohalahala suggested inclusion of the base of Hawaiian Homelands and offered an ecological elaboration. In his view, the community should apply its visions to resources rather than the reverse as is now common practice, and water should be the context for development decisions.
<P>
When asked to describe the responsibility of State and County elected officials to the mandate of the sovereignty vote, Kaho`ohalahala cited his own programs for the county council and administration as an example that the first step is education, elected officials must become educated and must help educate the general public.
<P>
McGregor says that the Hawaiians must also choose good leaders and find the leverage needed to endow a sovereign Hawaiian government with lands and assets. She said that certain interest groups, though, want the legislature to regulate Hawaiian rights. Since the State Supreme Court reaffirmed the <A HREF="pash.html">access rights of Native Hawaiians over private property</A>, bankers, realtors, investors, and title insurers claim to be reluctant to invest in Hawai`i. Chan Hodges declared that legislative bodies ought not try to control the process, but rather consider the impacts of sovereignty within the context of their responsibility to the people of the state as a whole, and prepare to assist in a smooth transition from present ways to a new relationship with sovereign people.
<P>
"Only a process of recognition, redress and settlement of Hawaiian claims and rights can address these situations," said McGregor. "What the governor, the legislature, the bankers, lawyers and investors must ultimately acknowledge is that only a sovereign Hawaiian government can represent the Hawaiian people in such a process of redress and settlement," she added.
<P>
When asked what could be done immediately to facilitate the change, Kaho`ohalahala  said there should be an immediate moratorium on the lease and sale of ceded lands, and an inventory conducted of revenue producing and conservation lands, to help the Hawaiians identify their assets. Chan Hodges agreed, and said that, given the ramifications of the sovereignty vote, the Hawaiian Affairs Committee of the State Legislature should become the new Ways and Means Committee. He noted that the Legislature has treated Hawaiian Affairs as a Siberia for insubordinate members.
<P>
When asked how government might promote economic stability for all residents of Hawai`i, Kaho`ohalahala responded that it must focus on sustainability. He also suggested that there are creative ways for government to help reduce the cost of living, such as assisting businesses to collaborate for lower costs.
<P>
As an example he cited two neighboring grocery stores on Lanai that carry the same brand of milk, but bring it in independently; if they collaborate on shipments, they could attain lower shipping costs.
<P>
Chan Hodges pointed out that a major factor in the high cost of living in Hawai`i the shipping rates set by three appointed individuals that constitute the Public Utilities Commission.
<P>
Education was also an important topic for Na Kapuna. Maxwell wanted to know if it would be important to the candidates to maintain funding for <A HREF="http://www.olelo.hawaii.edu/">Hawaiian language</A> and cultural immersion programs. Kaho`ohalahala said that the essence of a person is in their language, and he would like to see such programs broadened to include other ethnic groups so that they may also experience the benefits of the native language and tradition. This would also increase cultural understanding, tolerance, and respect, beneficial virtues for all of Hawai`i's residents as they come to terms with the sovereignty process.
<P>
Among Hawaiians, the next step is the business of apportionment and the election of delegates to a convention that will discuss and propose a form of self-determination. Several groups are conducting open public meetings to discuss the vote and how to make every step toward sovereignty an inclusive process.

<H1>TOURISM</H1>
<H2>IN INDEPENDENT HAWAI`I</H2>
</CENTER>
Tourism is the primary source of Hawai`i's economic vitality, and will be for some time.  However, tourism is also the source of extensive cultural and environmental damage that jeopardizes our quality of life and our future.  The visitor industry must undergo a steady transition, paralleling our political transition, into a different kind of tourism which will be more beneficial to both our visitors and our residents.  
<P>
"Independence" means more than just political independence.  Right now, we are a very "dependent" society, depending on outside sources, primarily the United States, to meet most of our basic needs such as food and energy, despite the fact that we are living on the most isolated land mass in the world.  Therefore we are subject to the control of outside forces.  We lack self-reliance and suffer from great vulnerability.  Hawai`i must become more independent in many ways to ensure the future stability and security of our land and people.
<P>
Tourism here creates a "flow-through" economy where money comes in and goes out without much benefit for the local people.  So first we need to diversify our economy with community based enterprises to meet more of our own needs locally, with markets in the visitor industry.  The money that does come in through tourism must stay and circulate in the local economy, multiplying its effect and enhancing the self-sufficiency of our communities.  
<P>
There are many other options to decrease our over-reliance on the tourism industry.  Only as an independent country can we take full advantage of Hawai`i's unique global position in the center of the Pacific Rim, controlling our 200 mile Exclusive Economic Zone, and becoming a center for international trade and the development of global ethical banking.  
<P>
At the same time, the nature of tourism itself must transform.  We need to focus on quality over quantity, and emphasize Hawai`i's unparalleled value as a source of health and well-being, cultural sharing, natural beauty, and spiritual rejuvenation, through the true essence of <A HREF="aloha.html">Aloha</A>.
<P>
Only when the independent Nation of Hawai`i is fully restored will <A HREF="aloha.html">Aloha</A> be truly restored.  Only when the original people of this land are returned to their natural position as sovereign human beings in their homeland will their <A HREF="aloha.html">Aloha</A> be free to flow to all humanity.  Then Hawai`i can share the unique spirit of this land with the world, to spread the essence of light and love necessary to help create Akua's true world order.

<H1>US tipped to face territorial challenges from tiny Pacific states</H1>

<B>BY    Michael Field<BR>
Agence France-Presse<BR>
(Copyright 1996)</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
AUCKLAND, March 28 (AFP) - Some of the world's smallest states are poised
to challenge United States territorial claims over lonely Pacific atolls, a
leading South Pacific political scientist claims.
<P>

        Professor Ron Crocombe, emeritus professor of the Fiji based
University of the South Pacific (USP), says he believes Hawaii, by early
next century, may leave the United States.
<P>
        "I don't know if we will call it full independence, I don't even
know what independence these days means, but the relationship is changing,"
he said in an interview from the Cook Islands Wednesday.
<P>
        In his book, "The Pacific Islands and the USA," Crocombe says the
Marshall Islands, Kiribati and Tokelau are beginning to press their claims
on neighbouring American atolls.
<P>
        Eventually Washington's only Pacific territory will be American
Samoa, he says.
<P>
        The most intriguing claim comes from Kiribati, a central Pacific
Micronesian state. Its capital, Tarawa, is etched into US history as the
site where in 1943 US Marines staged a seaborne invasion to capture the
island from the Japanese.
<P>
        There is an element of the revenge of history in some of the
claims. Last century the US claimed the Cook Islands, Kiribati, Tokelau and
Tuvalu and it was not until the late 1970s that Washington got around to
renouncing the claims.
<P>
        Kiribati includes the Line Islands, except for three atolls,
Palmyra, Kingman and Jarvis. The US claims them and while nobody regularly
lives on them, a Hawaiian developer wants to build a resort on Palmyra.
<P>
        Palmyra was last in the news in 1974 when an American seized a
couple's luxury yacht, murdered them and sailed away. In an test of
sovereignty a Hawaiian court convicted him of homicide and the drama was
captured by Hollywood in "And the Sea Shall Tell," a minor thriller.
<P>
        "Some I-Kiribati (Kiribati nationals) claim those islands belong to
them, and the Kiribati government will probably claim them within a
generation," Crocombe says.
<P>
        "Kiribati is desperately short of land and trading that land (which
the USA does not use) to Kiribati is likely to occur in the context of some
concession, support or favour USA wants from Kiribati in the future."
<P>
        Crocombe said Kiribati had refused to negotiate an exclusive
economic zone (EEZ) maritime boundary with the US in respect of the islands
and Howland and Baker Islands, part of the Phoenix Group in Kiribati,
claimed by the US. Kiribati, claimed by the US.

<H1>Cashing in on Sovereignty</H1>
<P>
<STRONG>Honolulu Weekly<BR>
September 27, 1995, p. 5</STRONG>

</HEAD>
<BODY>
August 1995 was a watershed month for Hawaii.  In the economic arena, layoffs
of 600 state workers went into effect, record numbers of visitors from Asia
were reported and Hawaii's banks enjoyed their last month of safety from the
threat of interstate banking.  In events of significance to sovereignty, the
State Supreme Court reaffirmed the right of access by Native Hawaiians to
private property, the deadline passed for filing individual claims for
breaches of the Hawaiian Homes trust and Nation of Hawaii leader Bumpy
Kanahele was arrested by the federal government for allegedly "harboring a
tax fugitive" and then denied bail -- twice.  
<P>
Although economics and sovereignty may sometimes seem only peripherally
related, they are actually fundamentally connected.  Amidst the controversy
over Kanahele's arrest, Maui Mayor Linda Lingle expressed her concerns that
the sovereignty movement is creating a level of uncertainty that may be
hurting Hawaii's economy.  While blaming Hawaii's economic problems on the
sovereignty movement is definitely an exaggeration, it is true that questions
raised by sovereignty are inextricably linked to the economic future of
Hawaii.
<P>
Hawaii is certainly not unique in facing the issue of sovereignty.  Quebec
has been considering secession from Canada for some time now.  The current
uncertainty over sovereignty there is cited as a major reason that Quebec
lost out to Salt Lake city in its bid to host the 2002 Winter Olympics.  A
referendum on the issue is expected this fall and recent polls show that it
will pass if provisions for economic association with the rest of Canada are
included.  
<P>
Uncertainty comes into play in various questions about sovereignty around the
world.  This is due to concerns regarding heritage, property rights, legal
systems, control over natural resources, citizenship status and sovereign
immunity.
<P>
On August 16 voters in Bermuda, fearing the loss of offshore investment,
rejected independence and chose to remain a British crown colony by a margin
of nearly 3-to-1.  Their uncertainty, however, was minor compared to the
anxiety that is occurring in Hong Kong.  Many Hong Kong investors are now
inserting clauses in new partnership contracts declaring that the agreements
will not be subject to Hong Kong court jurisdiction after sovereignty is
transferred to China in 1997.  By June, close to half of the companies listed
on the Hong Kong stock exchange had shifted their legal domiciles to Bermuda
in order to take of advantage of the island's corporate attractions.  
<P>
The link between sovereignty and economics is perhaps most vividly
demonstrated by the current situation in the Falklands.  It seems that after
losing a brief but bloody war with Britain over the Falkland Islands in 1982,
Argentina is still eager to claim the islands as its own.  Earlier this year
the Argentine government went so far as to consider paying each of the
Falkland Islands' 2,000 residents $100,000 if they would vote to transfer
sovereignty from Britain to Argentina.
<P>
What makes control over the desolate Falklands worth some $200 million?  The
answer lies in the waters surrounding the Falklands where geologists have
recently discovered the existence of late Jurassic/Early Cretaceous anoxic
marine claystones -- certain signs of oil.  So far Falkland residents have
rejected the idea that their sovereignty is for sale and their local
government announced last month that it would open bidding for oil
exploration rights on October 3.  Argentina has threatened to hold a
competing bidding round, also claiming rights to the Falkland's coastal
waters.
<P>
Back home in Hawaii, another sovereignty dispute is scheduled for a showdown
on October 3 -- Bumpy Kanahele's trial for "harboring a tax fugitive."  Given
the extraordinary decision to hold him without bail, the validity of
Kanhele's claim that he's a <A HREF="political_prisoner.html">political prisoner</A> has been recognized by persons
ranging from the <A HREF="let_editor.html#shapiro">managing editor of the Star-Bulletin</A> to the <A HREF="let_ipcp.html">director of the
national Interfaith Prisoners of Conscience Project</A>.  
<P>
In order to maintain its sovereignty, a government needs to be the "supreme
legitimate authority within a territory," and the actions of Mr. Kanahele and
the Nation of Hawaii have certainly challenged the supremacy and authority of
both the state and federal governments in Hawaii.  Challenges such as these
tend to undermine confidence that the current government is capable of
securing and protecting property rights. Whether or not one agrees with
Kanahele and the Nation of Hawaii is almost irrelevant.  The questions raised
by their assertions of sovereignty will not just go away and it is the lack
of satisfactory answers to these questions that poses the greatest threat to
economic stability.  
<P>
Whether one is looking at Hong Kong, the Falklands, Bermuda, Quebec or
Hawaii, the eventual resolution of sovereignty questions can have immediate
economic benefits.  A prime example of this can be found in South Africa.
 Foreign investment in property there has gone up dramatically since the
country held its first all race elections in April of 1994.  In the month
leading up to the elections, agreements were reached to protect the right to
self-determination of white Afrikaners and to assure a level of sovereign
status for the Zulu monarchy.  Since a model of sovereignty for all South
Africans has been established, uncertainty has decreased and the pattern of
divestment has been reversed.
<P>
In the United States, a recently resolved sovereignty dispute has led to
predictions by both sides of future economic benefits.  In 1991 the Chickasaw
Nation sued the state of Oklahoma over the state's gasoline tax.  Three
months ago, on June 14, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled unanimously that a fuel
tax imposed on gas stations located in the Chickasaw Nation improperly
interfered with the tribe's sovereign right to self-government.  Within weeks
of the supreme court's decision, both the president of the Oklahoma State
Chamber of Commerce and the governor of the Chickasaw Nation were pointing to
the potential competitive economic benefits of having a sovereign nation in
Oklahoma.  Among the advantages highlighted were the opportunity for companies
 to "move offshore while staying at home" and the Chickasaw Nation's ability
to create a regulatory environment from scratch -- one that would be friendly
to businesses, people and the natural surroundings.
<P>
Although the Chamber of Commerce here in Hawaii remains somewhat apprehensive
about sovereignty, both the Hawaii Hotel Association and the <A HREF="http://www.visit.hawaii.org/">Hawaii Visitors
Bureau</A> claim to be sovereignty supporters who view the creation of a Hawaiian
nation as economically beneficial.  In the interests of its own economic
survival, Hawaii's business community is beginning to learn about
sovereignty.  From a purely economic point of view, supporting the creation
of a sovereign nation is a strategy that is certainly preferable to jailing
the movement's leaders.

<H2>Kanahele, Hawaiians aren't treated fairly</H2>
<STRONG>Honolulu Advertiser<BR>
Thursday, August 10, 1995</STRONG>
<P>
 It's strange that Dennis "Bumpy" Kanahele is being held in jail without bail, while our courts routinely release suspected murderers, rapists, robbers and arsonists pending trial.
<P>
 It's obvious that the state and federal governments are working to silence Kanahele and destroy his "Nation of Hawaii" movement.
<P>
 Kanahele is not a danger to the community and he should be released on bail until his trial.

 Concerning the arrest of Bumpy Kanahele, it was truly inspirational to watch U.S. Attorney Steve Alm reassert the absolute authority of the U.S. govemment over these islands.
<P>
 I can tell he's practiced saying 'no one's above the law.' Obviously. Mr. Alm is a true scholar of Hawaiian history and the many 'lawful' U.S. actions here since 1893.
<P>
 The Democrats must be proud that President Clinton appointed such a politically astute U.S. attorney. Mr. Alm is surely going to show us natives who's boss.

 He is passionate about the message of restoring the Hawaiian people to dignity, His answer to the question, 'What role does school play in the community,' is as follows: 'Education is on top of our list, but what we want our kids to know and understand is Akua (God) and our culture.'

<P>
Dennis "Bumpy" Kanahele is a committed Hawaiian who has worked tirelessly in his effort to educate others about sovereignty and the mission of the group he leads.
<P>
In the past couple of years, more legitimate, credible information has become available on the rights of sovereign citizens and an increasing number of people have become aware of the misuse of power in this country.
<P>
Federal institutions that perceive themselves to be negatively affected by the flow of this information will act to suppress those who deliver it.  I believe Bumpy's arrest is a direct example of this suppression.
<P>
His arrest is not really about harboring a fugitive.  It is another grave example of the gross injustice perpetrated on those who have the courage to stand up for what they believe.
<P>
Bumpy has not committed a crime and should not be in jail.  Furthermore, he is not a danger to the community.
<P>
It is time that we, as Hawaiians, begin supporting one another despite our differences.  While I may not agree with everything Bumpy does, I certainly support the work that he's doing.

<STRONG>Honolulu Star-Bulletin<BR>

<P>
The Nation of Hawaii movement, led by 'Bumpy' Kanahele, may have established validity, drawing retribution from the government and political opponents. What better way to disarm a movement than to practice lawlessness, to remove the opposition from the arena and to discredit it?
<P>
There certainly seems to be a parallel in these tactics with the misuse of power by China and other government dictatorships. Possibly the government's handling of this situation is an alternative to its Waco, Texas, tactics.
<P>
It is difficult for me to believe the federal prosecutor's assertion that Kanahele's arrest had nothing to do with the sovereignty movement.

It makes me wonder if our constitutional rights are being circumvented by bureaucratic whims, and that alarms me.

<H2>Arrest of 'Bumpy' Kanahele is unfair to Hawaiian nation</H2>
Pu`uhonua "Bumpy" Kanahele is an enigma to most people in Hawaii.  His often referred to "history of human rights advocacy" has been labeled by uninformed persons as "criminal civil resistance" or worse. The arrest and no-bail detainment of Kanahele by federal law-enforcement officials speaks in a loud voice of the fear of truth that plagues government in America and other nations that violate human rights under hidden political agendas.
<P>
We the people of Hawaii deserve to know the truth about members of our larger community regardless of their particular politics.  I have known "Bumpy" for many years.  He is a deeply spiritual family man wholly committed to advancing truth, justice and peace for all people in Hawaii.  His true character and Hawaiian ancestry are clearly reflected in his self-determined style of leadership.
<P>
This man has taken a nonviolent stand, calling for greater accountability by state and federal government in the affairs of his people.  For this he is incarcerated and separated from his loved ones.  Wake up, Hawaii; the next political prisoner could be you or someone you love.

Some, especially those who are not entirely familiar with the Nation of Hawaii or the nuances of Hawaiian history, may find the philosophy of Dennis 'Bumpy' Kanahele somewhat extreme.  
<P>
However, I have found few (if any) activists whose position is as logically consistent and as vigorously pursued as that of Bumpy. If the initial premises of the illegality of the overthrow of Queen Liliuokalani and the annexation of Hawaii by the United States are granted, then the philosophy and action of Kanahele will appear consistent and justifiable.
<P>
Despite the best attempts of federal prosecutors to prejudice Federal Magistrate Barry Kurren against Kanahele on the basis of unsubstantiated hearsay, he is most decidedly not a "danger to the community." 
<P>
Why are Hawaiians being treated differently? All of this suggests that Bumpy may be right when he says that he is a political prisoner.

If Kanahele's situation motivates more people to step out of their own Western-oriented paradigm to learn and understand history from the viewpoint of the Kanaka Maoli, perhaps he and his followers will have achieved a small success.

<P>
 What ever happened to the American precept that people are innocent until proven guilty in a court of law? 
<P>
I do not agree with "Bumpy" Kanahele's political views, but I am deeply disturbed that he is being held in jail without the opportunity of bail - not because he has been convicted of a crime, but because members of a federal agency and a federal judge suspect that he might commit a crime.
<P>
 In all the 40 years I have lived in Hawaii, I have never heard of Kanahele's being a threat to the security of the community. On the contrary, many of the Hawaiian sovereignty situations in which he has been involved might have degenerated into violence without his peacemaking efforts.
<P>
 Federal agency and judicial actions in this case raise a serious concern. Are federal agencies required to observe the constitutional rights of the people or are they free to act on their own, supported by judges who seem to observe political correctness more than the upholding of American freedoms?
<P>
 If federal agencies have information that they feel makes Kanahele a "danger to the community" they should make these data available to the public. Otherwise, we see yet another erosion of American laws of protection for its citizens. If this is true, Waimanalo will be our next Waco.

<H2>Kanahele should be released until trial</H2>

<STRONG>Editorial by David Shapiro, Managing Editor of the Honolulu Star-Bulletin<BR>
Aug. 26, 1995</STRONG>
<P>
It's time to end the judicial silliness and set "Bumpy" Kanahele free.  The Nation of Hawaii leader has been held without bail since his arrest Aug. 2 on federal charges of harboring a native Hawaiian tax fugitive and obstructing his arrest. He faces trial Oct. 3.
<P>
Bail would be routine on such charges, but two federal judges have ruled Kanahele should remain incarcerated because he is a flight risk and potentially violent.
<P>
They fear that he won't show up for trial because he believes U.S. laws don't apply to him as a citizen of a sovereign Hawaiian nation. His "arrests" of state and federal officials for violating Nation of Hawaii laws set off the violence alarms. 
<P>
Kanahele certainly should have to face the consequences of crimes he commits. The nature of civil disobedience is that you commit a crime to make a political point and expect to be arrested and possibly jailed for it. But if Kanahele is going to do time, let it be for crimes he is convicted of - not for crimes authorities fear be might commit. To put it perspective, even suspected murderer Eugene Barrett initially had bail set.
<P>
The extraordinary decision to hold him without bail leaves Kanahele and his followers with a credible case that he is a political prisoner. ...

 Kanahele is an extremely competent leader, and because he believes so strongly in the cause of sovereignty, he has made it his responsibility to see that there are many others as knowledgeable as he is about the movement.

Even suspected murderers merit bail and yet Bumpy is held without bail.

 Perhaps Kanahele has discovered key political, economic, social and cultural rights of the Hawaiian people that vested interests fear.

 The Nation of Hawaii is attempting to educate the state and federal governments with appropriate information that dispels unfounded fears and opens the doors of meaningful communication. In time, truth, justice and common sense will resolve historic and contemporary injustices.

The trial of Dennis Kanahele is not only an obvious ploy by the federal government to suppress the sovereignty movement in Hawaii, but a waste of taxpayer dollars.  Kanahele is being tried as a political prisoner in his own homeland.  By "harboring a fugitive," i.e. educating strangers about Hawaiian history, and deterring strangers who failed to identify themselves from entering his property, Kanahele did what most would have done under the circumstances.  He was educating strangers about where they reside and protecting his property.
<P>
The absurdity of not allowing Kanahele bail because he is "a danger to the community" depicts a government bent on exercising absolute authority, regardless of reason.  Kanahele and the Nation of Hawaii are committed to Gandhian principles of nonviolence and peaceful resistance.  In fact, the sovereignty movement in Hawaii has always been peaceful and nonviolent.  So why is Goliath so intimidated and fearful?  Release Kanahele.

<H3>We call ourselves <STRONG>Kanaka Maoli</STRONG>.</H3>
We are the original people of Hawai`i who have inhabited these islands since time immemorial.
</CENTER>
<P>
The population of the <A HREF="archip.html">Archipelago of Hawai`i</A> is estimated to have numbered as many as one million people when Europeans first arrived in 1778.  At that time, the Kanaka Maoli lived in a "highly organized, self-sufficient, subsistent social system based on communal land tenure with a sophisticated language, culture, and religion."  <A HREF="publawsum.html">(US Public Law 103-150)</A>
<P>
The arrival of explorers and later missionaries began a catastrophic chain of events that nearly destroyed the Kanaka Maoli culture.  Foreign exploitation forced the Kanaka Maoli to radically alter their spiritual and societal relationships.  It challenged their traditional customs, beliefs, and practices, and led to the dislocation of the people from the land that had sustained their ancestors from the time of origin.  Within one hundred years from the time of contact, the population of Kanaka Maoli had been reduced by over 90%, to less than 40,000 people.  
<P>
Kanaka Maoli had shared their land with each other, and had no idea of privately owning part of Papa, the Earth Mother.  In 1848, however, the Western concept of land ownership was implemented in the "Great Mahele" with the influence of foreign business interests, and the land was divided for private and foreign ownership for the first time.  This act disenfranchised the majority of Kanaka Maoli, placing them in the dire circumstance of being landless in their homeland.
<P>
Despite foreign subjugation of the original culture, the surviving Kanaka Maoli adapted well and excelled as a people and a nation.  For example, in two generations from the establishment of a written language, Hawai`i had the highest literacy rate of any country in the world.  From 1826 until 1893, the United States "recognized the independence of the Kingdom of Hawaii, extended full and complete diplomatic recognition to the Hawaiian Government, and entered into treaties and conventions with the Hawaiian monarchs to govern commerce and navigation."  <A HREF="publawsum.html">(US Public Law 103-150)</A>  
<P>
Then in 1893 the internationally recognized independent Kingdom of Hawai`i was illegally overthrown with American support, and the <A HREF="sovereignty.html">sovereignty</A> of the people was stolen.  
<P>
These historic facts are now considered acts of war and genocide.

WAIMANALO - It's happening under the wall of green cliffs back of Waimanalo, an impossible dream that's less impossible now that it was a year ago.  They call it the "Hawaiian Nation."
<P>
This "nation" is more complicated that just a controversy over sovereignty.  Or the refusal of sovereignty activist Dennis "Bumpy" Kanahele to pay income tax because it's "the collection of an illegal debt."
<P>
What else is happening under the cliffs is an attempt to create a new way of life in Hawaii.  This is not a return to ancient times.  This is the catamaran compared to the outrigger canoe.
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.aloha.net/epf/dsg/">Chris Belknap and Paul Ponthieux</A> are architects.  Belknap said he wasn't satisfied with designing tourist hotels.  He believes Hawaii's environment must be sustainable or it won't survive.  But developers aren't much interested in his ideas because high density is more profitable.
<P>
The Hawaiian Nation is giving him and Ponthieux a chance to design a sustainable community.
<P>
"We believe in this concept," said Kanahele.  "I've known Chris for three years.  Until we got the land, I wasn't interested.  Not it gets real."
<P>
There there's Kiha Pimental, a general contractor in steel construction who isn't quite satisfied with the way Hawaii is going.  He'd like to be part of something better.
<P>
<A NAME="kamakahi">
<A HREF="kamakahi.html"><IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="kamakasm.gif" VSPACE=2 HSPACE=8></A>
There's also Uncle George Kamakahi, 73, from Waianae who drives all the way to Waimanalo every day to open up old taro patches up the valley.  Why?  "For the people," he said.
<P>
And there's also Patty Maukele, a resource teacher for the Hawaiian language immersion program at Koko Head Elementary School.  She lives under the cliffs and holds a class there every Thursday night.
<P>
At the moment, there are fewer than 100 people living in shacks under the cliffs on 35 acres of land that members of this "Hawaiian Nation" claim as their own.  They are there on agreement with the state.
<P>
How can 100 people create a new way of life?
<P>
The concept that Belknap envisions and that Ponthieux has drawn in three dimensions on his state-of-the-art computer is that of a self-sustaining community based on old Hawaiian concepts but making use of high technology:
<P>
HOUSES: People will live in round, two-story houses six units to a floor.  The units will have one, two and three bedrooms to accommodate different-sized families.
<P>
If a grandmother of another relative wants to live with the family, the units can be opened to make larger ones.
<P>
COOKING: Each living unit will have a kitchen.  There will also be community kitchens.  (See accompanying story about living in the Hawaiian village.)
<P>
PARKING: Each house will have a covered garage for parking cars.  On the roofs will be greenhouses for growing vegetables.
<P>
In this way, the parking space will not be wasted and the gardens will produce income for the village.
<P>
Roof space will also be used for panels that convert sunshine into electricity.  "We wouldn't have to hook up to Hawaiian Electric," said Kanahele.
<P>
EDUCATION: Each house would have what Belknap and Ponthieux call a "vision center" - a unit where people can hold community meetings, where classes can be held, where information can be stored in books and tapes.
<P>
The science classes would be conducted outdoors, as the Hawaii Nature Center now conducts its classes.
<P>
ECONOMY: The goal will be for the community to be as self-sustaining as possible.  Food would be grown not only to eat but to sell.  Mechanics might fix cars.  Other people might sew.
<P>
It is hoped such a close-knit community would create fewer traffic jams, would be more socially stable, would pollute less, would use fewer resources and would commit fewer crimes.
<P>
These dreams have brought a wide variety of people together, from Hawaiian activists to avant garde architects.

<H2>Kanahele contempt trial scheduled for Sept. 15</H2>

<P>

Dennis "Bumpy" Kanahele will have his day in court on Sept. 15.
<P>

After spending a night in the police cell-block, Kanahele, head of the self-proclaimed Nation of Hawaii, and one of his supporters were arraigned in Honolulu District Court yesterday on contempt charges for failing to show up in court previously to answer traffic citations.
<P>
District Judge Colette Garibaldi assigned Kanahele and Gordon A. Kaaihue to trials on Sept. 15 and freed the pair on their own recognizance, without bail.
<P>
"I've been waiting for this," Kanahele said.  He expects his trial to force a showdown between the state and his claim that the state and federal governments are invalid and have no authority in the Islands because the 1893 overthrow of Queen Lili`uokalani was illegal.
<P>
Duke Sabedong, the nation's justice minister, said they'll challenge the state's jurisdiction before the trial.
<P>
The nation, formerly known as the Hawaiian sovereignty organization the Ohana Council, claims several thousand members.  Some of them openly flout state traffic laws, driving cars with "Hawaiian Sovereign" license plates.
<P>
Kanahele was cited in 1992 and Kaaihue in 1993 for those and other infractions, including lack of valid driver's licenses and insurance.  When they failed to answer the citations, bench warrants were issued for their arrest.
<P>
Kaaihue, a lieutenant colonel in the nation's "peace force," was arrested Tuesday afternoon at the main police station.
<P>
He and other peace officers from the nation had gone there, as they had many times in recent months, to issue summonses from the nation's court to police who had cited nation members.
<P>
This time, Kaaihue was arrested on the bench warrant and Kanahele's son, Westin, was arrested for interfering in Kaaihue's arrest.
<P>
Kanahele said that when he learned of the arrests, he called police to say he was coming to free his people.  He said he arrived with two supporters and was immediately arrested on the contempt warrant by 30 or more police officers.
<P>
Bumpy Kanahele and Kaaihue were held overnight Tuesday in the police cell-block.  Kanahele's son posted bail and was released.
<P>
About 40 of Kanahele's supporters and relatives showed up early at the District Court.  Several were dressed in the black military-style battle dress uniforms used by peace officers of the nation.
<P>
They joined hands in a circle to pray and chant in the lobby of the Alakea Street courthouse, then headed upstairs for the arraignment.
<P>
More supporters arrived, packing the gallery of Garibaldi's courtroom.  During a break, Sabedong told the nation members to remove caps and sunglasses from their heads.  "We want to show respect, so they respect our head of state."
<P>
Garibaldi entered the courtroom and the bailiff ordered, "All rise."  They did.  When Kanahele and Kaaihue came in, the nation members in the gallery rose again.
<P>
"You're standing for a prisoner," another member of the audience muttered incredulously.
<P>
Maltbie Napoleon, the Nation of Hawaii's attorney general, challenged the state's authority to try Kanahele and Kaaihue.
<P>
Garibaldi said, "I understand your concerns.  However, this is an arraignment court, and these matters cannot be resolved today."
<P>
The two defendants declined to recognize the court by entering pleas, so Garibaldi entered "not guilty" pleas for them and scheduled trials.

The islands could again be a nation within the decade.</H3><B>The Orange County Register<BR>November 9, 1996</B></CENTER><P>BY TERI SFORZA<P>It's the only royal palace on American soil. Fragrant flower leis adorn its imposing iron gates, framing the emblem of a nation that is no more: Hawaii.<P>It was here, at <A HREF="palace.html">Iolani Palace</A>, that American sugar farmers executed their coup in 1893, deposing Queen Liluokalani and imprisoning her inside.<P>It was here, at Iolani Palace, that the queen's loyal subjects wept bitterly as the Hawaiian flag was lowered  - forever  - in 1898, and the U.S. flag hoisted high in its stead.<P>And it is here, at Iolani Palace, that many Hawaiians are certain the queen's royal descendants will rule again. Soon.<P>Tropical Hawaii  - prime honeymoon and holiday spot for 1.4 million Californians every year  - could  secede from the Union.<P>(<I><B>Web Editor'sNote</B>: Hawaii will not technically "secede" because there was never a legal cession of sovereignty or territory - a more appropriate term is restoration, not secession.</I> )<P>What was viewed from afar as a fringe movement took a giant leap forward in September: Hawaiians voted 3-1 in favor of sovereignty, in a controversial election open only to "Native Hawaiians" (20 percent of the state's population) but paid for by the state government.<P>Some denounced the election as racist and illegal. Others boycotted it as a tool of the colonial invaders, read federal and state governments. Nonetheless, leaders boldly predicted that Hawaii will be its own nation within the decade  - which could mean Californians might need passports and visas for those snorkeling trips to Maui.<P>The way the secessionists (sic) see it, the United States owes Hawaiians about $150 billion in back rent, plus $10 billion a year for those 1.8 million acres of government-owned land.<P>A strange discomfort possesses the 800,000 people in Hawaii who are not Native Hawaiians: What of the land they own? What of their rights? What of their U.S. citizenship? What will become of them in the new Hawaii?<P>"Instead of going backward and having a monarch again, we should go forward," said Annie Young, 21, a psychology major at UC Irvine who grew up in Honolulu. Young and her family are of Chinese descent; they did not get to vote in the election.<P>"I see both sides," Young said. "It was wrong to supress the Hawaiian culture the way they did. It should be brought back and taught in the schools. But, in a way, when the U.S. did take over, it helped us economically."<P>Young's family still lives on Oahu, but she plans to stay on the mainland  - her right now as a U.S. citizen, which could evaporate if Hawaii breaks away. "I love it there, but it's such a small area," she said. "You can't go very far. That's the reason I came here. There's more opportunity."<P>A veritable war is erupting among Hawaii's some 40-odd independence groups over what the new nation should be  - a battle almost invisible to tourists languishing on beaches, except for those sunning themselves at Waikiki when activist Dennis "Bumpy" Kanahele stomped along the shoreline, yelling "Go home!"<P>(<I><B>Web Editor'sNote</B>: This is not an accurate description of this event, which took place in 1994. A group of Hawaiians and supporters led by Mr. Kanahele walked peacefully down the beach handing out copies of the <A HREF="publawall.html">Apology Bill</A> along with a plea to boycott Hawaii's tourism and return home, educating those who were interested as to the economic oppression caused on Native Hawaiians by the visitor industry.</I> )<P>There are four possibilities for the new Hawaii:<UL><LI>  A complete divorce from the U.S., where Hawaii would again become a nation unto itself. That would require a vote of everyone in the state, not just Native Hawaiians.<P><LI>  A "nation-within-a-nation," such as the American Indian tribes on the mainland. These would essentially be Indian reservations, sovereign on their own territory. The federal and state governments couldn't tell them what to do. That would require a majority vote of Native Hawaiians.<P><LI>  A commonwealth, mirroring Puerto Rico.<P><LI>  Status quo, but with greater native control over native lands.</UL><P>"The election was a very big step, because it was the first and only formalized vote in over 100 years strictly for Hawaiians," said Tara Lulani McKenzie, executive director of the <A HREF="http://planet-hawaii.com/hsec">Hawaiian Sovereignty Elections Council</A>, which spent $2.2 million on the effort.<P>The question was simply, "Shall the Hawaiian people elect delegates to propose a Native Hawaiian government?" Seventy-three percent said yes. The next step is to elect delegates to something like a Constitutional Convention, to figure out what form a Native Hawaiian government could take.<P>"Clearly, Hawaii has the right under international law to declare itself an independent nation," said <A HREF="boylebio.html">Francis A. Boyle</A>, an international-law expert at the University of Illinois at Champaign. "There's no way to avoid dealing with that. It's not going to go away. It's just going to gain more and more momentum."<P>Hawaii has something big going for it that the Confederates would have coveted: <A HREF="publawall.html">A formal apology from the United States of America</A>, expressing "deep regret" for the illegal overthrow of the sovereign Kingdom of Hawaii by a conspiracy of American businessmen, diplomats and military in the twilight of the 19th century.<P>That apology  - issued by Congress on Nov. 23, 1993, and signed by President Clinton  - admits that "the indigenous Hawaiian people never directly relinquished their claims to their inherent sovereignty as a people, or over their national lands, to the United States," and that "the economic and social changes in Hawaii over the 19th and early 20th centuries have been devastating to the population and to the health and well-being of the Hawaiian people."<P>The apology could prove to be Hawaii's ticket to nationhood.<P>"The U.S. government basically says, `We stole Hawaii in violation of international legal standards. We inflicted genocide upon its people, and the Native Hawaiians have a right to self-determination that has never been exercised,' " said international-law expert Boyle, who has advised Hawaii on the burgeoning sovereignty movement.<P>Resistance to the "occupying colonial power" is mounting, said P.K. Laenui, once known as Hayden F. Burgess.<P>"In the schools, children are refusing to join in the morning flag Pledge of Allegiance to the United States. People are refusing to file tax returns or to pay income taxes. More and more defendants charged with criminal offenses are denying the jurisdiction of the American courts over them," Laenui said. "For many of us, the challenge is to overcome the fear of freedom."<P><HR NOSHADE><P><CENTER><B>(SIDEBAR) </B><H2> The plight of Native Hawaiians</H2></CENTER><P>Much like the mainland's American Indians, Native Hawaiians suffered great losses after the Europeans landed and have never caught up.<UL><LI>  MONEY: 14 percent of Native Hawaiian families live below the poverty level and receive some form of welfare, compared with 6 percent of all families. The unemployment rate for Native Hawaiians is 1.5 times higher than for Hawaiians overall.<P><LI>  LAND: The government owns almost 40 percent. The remaining 60 percent is concentrated in the hands of six major owners, such as the Dole Food Co. An effort to give land back to natives came in the 1920s with the Hawaiian Homestead Act, which set aside 200,000 acres for Native Hawaiians. But less than 22 percent of that land is used by Native Hawaiians today.<P><LI>  POPULATION: The Native Hawaiian population plummeted from 1 million to 10,000 one century after European contact. Today, 200,000 people claim a trace of Hawaiian ancestry.

<H1>Hawaii's annexation a story of betrayal</H1>

BY TERI SFORZA
<P>
<A HREF="mailto:plaenui@pixi.com">Poka Laenui</A> pledges his allegiance to the sovereign nation of Hawaii, not to the United States government.
<P>
"To understand how and why, you will need to know the history of Hawaii, particularly that part dealing with the `annexation' of Hawaii to the United States," wrote Laenui, a director of the <A HREF="http://www.ohana.com/sovereignty">Institute for the Advancement of Hawaiian Affairs</A>. "You will also have to understand something about growing up in Hawaii and the sense of betrayal and anger one feels at learning the history.
<P>
 "For me, the movement began with the awakening of my spirit when I read Queen Liliuokalani's `Hawaii's Story.' I read first with curiosity, followed by confusion, then much anger and finally resolve of what needed to be done."
<P>
It's a story of money, power and betrayal.
<P>
Hawaii was a proud and independent nation when <A HREF="cook.jpeg">Capt. James Cook</A> waded ashore in 1778. Hawaiians had run their own affairs for some 2,000 years. The kingdom signed <A HREF="treatylist.html">trade and peace treaties</A> with the United States, England and other foreign nations, each recognizing Hawaii's independence.
<P>
Flocks of American missionaries began arriving from Boston in 1820 and were welcomed warmly; many decided to stay on the islands rather than return to the frigid Northeast. Their new roots in paradise went deep: The missionaries became powerful sugar planters and politicians, often serving as advisers to the king.
<P>
The monarchy was weakened. The planters' powers were strengthened.
<P>
The United States was the biggest market for Hawaii's sugar. The transplanted planters longed for Hawaii to become part of the United States so they wouldn't have to worry about tariffs. The U.S. minister to Hawaii, John L. Stevens, was anxious to annex the islands as well.
<P>
Sensing this, Queen Liliuokalani was on the verge of imposing a <A HREF="constitution-1893.html">new Constitution</A> shifting power back to the monarchy - but she never got the chance.
<P>
On Jan. 16, 1893, U.S. Marines landed in Honolulu armed with Howitzer cannons and carbines. A group of 18 men - mostly American sugar farmers - staged a coup, proclaiming themselves the "provisional government" of Hawaii. Stevens gave immediate recognition to them as Hawaii's true government.
<P>
Imprisoned in <A HREF="palace.html">Iolani Palace</A>, Queen Liliuokalani issued a statement: "I yield to the superior force of the United States of America, whose minister, his excellency John L. Stevens, has caused United States troops to be landed at Honolulu. ... Now, to avoid any collision of armed forces and perhaps the loss of life, I do, under this protest, and impelled by said force, yield my authority until such time as the government of the United States shall undo the action of its representative and reinstate me."
<P>
President Grover Cleveland investigated the coup and fired Stevens. He apologized to the queen. And on Dec. 18, 1893, he <A HREF="cleveland.html">briefed Congress</A> on his findings:
<P>
"By an act of war, committed with the participation of a diplomatic representative of the United States and without authority of Congress, the government of a feeble but friendly and confiding people has been overthrown," Cleveland said. "A substantial wrong has thus been done, which a due regard for our national character, as well as the rights of the injured people, requires we should endeavor to repair."
<P>
Cleveland refused to approve the annexation of Hawaii. Soon, however, he was out of office, and President William McKinley gave it his blessing.
<P>
Said <A HREF="mailto:monet@aloha.net">Sam Monet</A>, a staunch independence proponent: "The Kingdom of Hawaii has never ceased to exist. No peace treaty between the U.S. and the kingdom of Hawaii has been signed. A state of war between the U.S. and the kingdom of Hawaii exists today."

<H1>Ex-parole chief, legal group back Kanahele bail</H1>

<H2>Despite pleas, judge rules he's a danger</H2>

<P>
The prosecution portrays Dennis "Bumpy" Kanahele as a danger to the community.  His supporters claim he's a peace loving political prisoner.  
<P>
U.S. District Judge Helen Gillmor bought the prosecution's view yesterday, upholding a ruling that Kanahele be held without bail until his trial on charges of harboring a federal fugitive.
<P>
Gillmor's ruling came despite testimony on Kanahele's behalf from Mahealani Kamau`u, executive director of the Native Hawaiian Legal Corp., and Marc Oley, former chairman of the state Paroling Authority.
<P>
Kamau`u, who has known Kanahele for years and served with him on the Sovereignty Elections Council, described him as "a person of deep and enduring compassion for his people; definitely not a danger to the community."
<P>
Oley, now with a real estate development company, said he came forward because he was "disturbed" by Kurren's description of Kanahele as a "danger to the community" and a likely no-show for trial.
<P>
Oley said he met Kanahele in 1988, when the Paroling Authority set a one-year minimum term for Kanahele's conviction on a felony charge of threatening a police officer during the occupation of Makapuu Lighthouse, and the following year, when Kanahele was paroled.
<P>
"We were impressed with his sincerity and his dignity," said Oley, who recalled Kanahele's vowing not to use firearms again.  "He promised he wouldn't and, to my knowledge, he never did."
<P>
Assistant U.S. Attorney Les Osborne hammered on Kanahele's failure to live up to an agreement with Honolulu police to resolve warrants for traffic citation issued to him and his followers for using homemade "Hawaiian Sovereign" license plates, and for other offenses.
<P>
And Osborne cited the nature of the charges against Kanahele.  Two of the three counts against him are felonies involving an incident on March 16, 1994, in which Kanahele allegedly blocked two deputy U.S. Marshals who had gone to his home to arrest fugitive Nathan Brown, who remains at large.
<P>
The federal attorney said that if Kanahele were to renege on his promise to appear for trial, "the consequences of having to go out into the community to arrest him again would present a clear and present danger to the people of the state."
<P>
Kanahele's attorney, Hayden Aluli, described the incident as "a scuffle."  And while the charges against him are serious, he said, they don't warrant his being held without bail.
<P>
Aluli also asked Gillmor to overturn Kurren's ruling because Kurren was one of the federal officials who had received a Nation of Hawaii "warning notice" accusing them of war crimes and genocide against Hawaiians.
<P>
Gillmor said that while Kurren said he considered the notice to be a threat, his ruling was not affected by it.
<P>
Through Aluli, Kanahele had offered, as a condition of his release, to have his supporters stop issuing notices or "arrest warrants" to officials.
<P>
After yesterday's hearing, Duke Sabedong, the nation's minister of justice, said that action might resume.
<P>
Several dozen Kanahele supporters packed Gillmor's courtroom yesterday.
<P>
Afterward, they filed out in glum silence, except for one woman - one of several kupuna (elders) who showed up in white dresses and pink capes - who said bitterly, "This is justice?"

We also have residents on Ni`ihau, Moloka`i and Lana`i.  <A HREF="#fn2">[2]</A> The <A HREF="http://www.maui.com/~ohana/">Island of Kaho`olawe</A> is inhabited part time for restoration, recovery and future rehabitation. <BR><BR>The population of Hawai`i comprises one of the most diverse ethnic mixtures in the world, with many races of people having gathered and lived relatively harmoniously for over a century.  Along with their Kanaka Maoli (Native Hawaiian) hosts, Caucasian, Japanese, Filipino, Chinese, Portuguese, Vietnamese, Korean, and Pacific Island peoples are all well-represented. Unfortunately, the Kanaka Maoli have benefitted the least and suffered the most of all populations in Hawai`i from the island's forced incorporation with the United States and the current system of economics, politics, and land administration.  Kanaka Maoli suffer the most negative statistics across the board in indicators of economic and social wellbeing, including mortality rate, suicide rate, disease, unemployment, poverty, undereducation, illiteracy, houselessness, substance abuse, domestic violence, etc. <A HREF="#fn3">[3]</A>  Addressing these realities and providing for the betterment of the lives of the original people of Hawai`i is an immediate essential priority for the Nation of Hawai`i, and will result in the betterment of the society as a whole.<BR><BR><A NAME="culture"><STRONG>Cultural Heritage<BR></STRONG><BR>Within Hawai`i's broad ethnic population there exists a strong awareness and community participation in the perpetuation of  cultural heritage in all aspects of life.  The Kanaka Maoli, as the host people, have developed governing systems of culture and traditions guiding the direction of native cultural affairs in Hawai`i, and providing the basic fabric of life into which all other cultures are woven. Other ethnic groups in Hawai'i are generally comfortable with the local host culture and excel in the understanding of it through education, preservation, entertainment, lifestyles and in the common dealings of everyday life of society.  Hawaiian cultural values and traditions embodied in such words as aloha (love), `ohana (family), and aloha `aina (love of the land) are understood and respected widely throughout the society. Conversely, there is a deep appreciation among the Kanaka Maoli for other ethnic traditions and cultures. Racial intermarraige is common and easily accepted, and mutual tolerance and respect among different cultures is exceptionally high.  Modern Hawai`i, with its roots in the Kanaka Maoli culture, has branched out to include the best of the many different traditions which have blessed these shores.<BR><BR><BR><A NAME="religion"><STRONG>Religion<BR></STRONG><BR>The host religion of Hawai`i is a highly organized belief system founded in Natural Law. The arrival of Europeans brought a strong impact of missionary Christendom, and later, along with the immigrant plantation workers, came many other religions of Eastern belief systems.  Today there is a variety of religious and spiritual expression, with no major conflicts among the diverse beliefs and practices.  There is however a disenfranchised system of belief found in the Kanaka Maoli peoples, where Customary practice and Christian practice clash on certain cultural and traditional levels.  It is intended that we shall mend these differences with the restoration of the peoples concerned in the Nation of Hawai`i.<BR><BR><BR><A NAME="language"></A><STRONG>Language<BR></STRONG><BR>`Olelo Hawai`i, the Hawaiian language, is the first official language of the Nation of Hawai`i, and English and Pidgin English are also official languages. The use of 'olelo Hawai`i is increasing as more classes and immersion programs are developed, and this process will be accelerated under the Nation of Hawai`i.  English is the most widely spoken language, and is used in most formal and business settings.  Pidgin English, a distinct mixture of languages that is spoken to some degree by much of the local inhabitants, is prefered by many for conversing informally.  A wide variety of other languages are also spoken in the various ethnic communities, including Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, Spanish, Portugese, Vietnamese, Tonga, Samoan, etc.<BR><BR><HR><A NAME="history"></A><CENTER><H3>HISTORICAL SUMMARY</H3></CENTER>Prior to the arrival of the first Europeans in 1778, the Native Hawaiian people lived in a highly organized, self-sufficient, subsistent social system based on communal land tenure with a sophisticated language, culture, and religion.  A unified monarchical government of the Hawaiian Islands was established in 1810 under Kamehameha I, the first unifying King of Hawaii in several centuries.  From 1826 until 1893, the Kingdom of Hawaii was recognized as a sovereign and independent nation among the world community of nations, with full diplomatic protocol. <A HREF="#fn4">[4]</A>  The Kingdom of Hawaii entered into treaties, conventions, and agreements with the following countries: Belgium (1862), Bremen (1854), Denmark (1846), France (1839, 1846, and 1858), German Empire (1879-80), Great Britain (1836 and 1846), Hamburg (1848), Hong Kong (1884), Italy (1863), Japan (1871 and 1886), Netherlands (1862), New South Wales (1874), Portugal (1882), Russia (1869), Samoa (1887), Spain (1863), Swiss Confederation (1864), Sweden and Norway (1855), Tahiti (1853), United States of America (1826, 1842, 1849, 1875, and 1887).  Hawaii was also party to the Universal Postal Union (1886).  [Archival copies available]<BR><BR>In 1893 the Hawaiian government was illegally overthrown in a conspiracy with participation of citizens, agents, and the military force of the United States.  In 1898 the United States annexed Hawaii without a treaty, unilaterally and unlawfully abrogating all of Hawai`i's existing treaties.  In 1900 the Territory of Hawaii was falsely established with the imposed Organic Act.  In 1946 Hawaii was placed under the <A HREF="art73.html">United Nations Charter, Article 73</A>, as a non-self-governing territory under the administering authority of the United States.  In 1959 Hawaii became the 50th state of the United States through an invalid special vote.  In 1993, the United States <A HREF="publawsum.html">apologized</A> for the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii in 1893, and recognized the unrelinquished inherent sovereignty and right of self-determination of the Native Hawaiian people. <A HREF="#fn4">[4]</A><BR><BR><HR><A NAME="restoration"><CENTER><H3>RESTORATION AND TRANSITION</H3></CENTER><A NAME="money"><STRONG>Money<BR></STRONG><BR>Hawai`i is currently incorporated into the independent Federal Reserve System utilizing Federal Reserve Notes rather than substance certificates, gold or silver.

It is obvious that the existing political and economic systems of the State of Hawaii, aside from being illegal, are not responsible to the just and timely advancement of peoples' rights and livelihoods, nor the sustainability of our environment.  In fact, the existing government by and large represents the interests of entities which destroy our future without regard for the eventual costs to our children.  Discontent with the government is at an all time high.  If we keep going in the same direction, we'll certainly end up where we're headed, which would be most unfortunate.  This is not a specific critique of individuals in office; it is a call to awaken responsible and ethical participation in the inevitable transition of governing authority in Hawai`i.<BR><BR>In Hawai`i and globally, our human `ohana (family) is an a crisis of living, unable to meet the basic needs of the people in a sustainable manner. We the people of Hawai`i are in a process of non-violent positive change designed to prevent further economic and environmental crisis in our region and in our world.  Working together we can co-evolve a relatively corruption-free form of self-government that implements natural laws in a manner consistent with the realization of equality and liberty for all people in Hawai`i.<BR><BR>Independence means more than just political independence.  Currently we live in a highly dependent society, relying on outside sources, primarily the United States, to meet most of our basic needs.  We import over three quarters of our food, and even more of our energy, despite the fact that we inhabit the most isolated land mass in the world.  Therefore Hawai`i is subject to the control of outside forces, lacking self-reliance and suffering great vulnerability. Hawai`i must become more independent in many ways to ensure the future stability and security of our land and people. <BR><BR>Once one shifts perspectives from U.S. domestic law to international law, the range of rights and of options for self-determination expand dynamically. The opportunity exists to evolve quickly in a positive direction with independent political status.  Life won't change drastically overnight, but can change steadily for the better.<BR><BR>Economically, Hawai`i will capitalize on the advantages of our unique position in the center of the Pacific Rim, controlling our 200 mile Exclusive Economic Zone, becoming a center for international trade, ethical investment banking and related secure financial services. The inauguration of international tax haven banking in Hawai`i will produce funding for the initial diversification of our local economy with profitable innovative community based projects, producing meaningful employment and furthering local and national self-sufficiency.  Utilizing the judicial powers of Hawai`i to design and enforce equitable trade tariffs and taxes applied to trusts, financial institutions and high profit centers in our economy will eliminate the burden of income tax for the citizens of Hawai`i. <BR><BR>If there is any place in the world capable of evolving politically, economically, socially, and culturally in a peaceful transition toward a truly equitable and sustainable future, it is Hawai`i.  In the process, we will become an example and evolving model of self-determination and goodwill for the common benefit of all our Earth's peoples.<BR><BR>As we remember and integrate the wisdom of our ancestors, we begin to reflect on the wise and just way to honor the past, perfect the present, and prepare for a peaceful future.

authority of either the U.S. government or the state of Hawaii.
<P>
Members fasten "Nation of Hawaii" license plates onto their cars
to substitute for state plates. They have repeatedly defied state
authorities' threats to move against their community.
<P>
They have actually distributed legal warrants against state and
federal officials. The warrants declare that the officials are
violating Hawaiian law and committing "crimes against humanity"
by harassing Hawaiian people.
<P>
When Kanahele was denied bail, U.S. Attorney Les Osborne accused
the Nation of Hawaii of stockpiling weapons near its village in
Waimanalo on Oahu. Many Hawaiians consider this charge both false
and ludicrous. Waimanalo is a stone's throw from the giant Marine
base in Kaneohe. There, U.S. soldiers conduct round-the-clock
maneuvers with the most modern, destructive weapons.
<P>
Last year, the U.S. government finally apologized for illegally
taking over the Hawaiian Islands in the 1890s. But the racist
denial of the right of indigenous Hawaiian people to
self-determination continues.
<P>
On Aug. 4, hundreds of people demonstrated in support of Kanehele
at the Oahu Federal Building and on the neighboring islands of
Kauai and Maui. They demanded his immediate release.

In a persistent effort to raise sovereignty issues in the trial of activist Dennis "Bumpy" Kanahele, his attorney subpoenaed about two dozen original treaties between the Kingdom of Hawaii and the United States from the state archives.
<P>
But federal judge Helen Gillmor ruled yesterday that Kanahele could not present the fragile documents to jurors, repeating her stand that only the court could decide Kanahele's claim that the federal government does not have jurisdiction over the leader of the self-proclaimed Nation of Hawaii.
<P>
In doing so, she said she would review only copies of the historic treaties, dating from about 1850 to 1897 (sic).  Every time you touch them you age them," she said.
<P>
Jolyn Tamura, state archivist, said the treaties had been removed from the archives only one other time for an exhibit at the Honolulu Academy of Art.  Tamura said the documents were treaties addressing friendship, commerce, and navigation.
<P>
In proceedings away from the jury, Gillmor warned Hayden Aluli, Kanahele's attorney, that he could not mention the content of the treaties to the jurors or ask witnesses how they felt about native Hawaiian <A HREF="sovereignty.html">sovereignty</A>.
<P>
The government has accused Kanahele and Gordon Kaaihue of interfering with a police officer who tried to serve a warrant in January 1994, on Nathan Brown, a fugitive evading a 78-month sentence for tax fraud.  Kanahele also faces felony charges that he harbored Brown and impeded his arrest three months later at his Waimanalo home.
<P>
Aluli said Kanahele was educating the police officer about <A HREF="sovereignty.html">sovereignty</A> during the first incident in which the officer tried to arrest Brown.  He also said Kanahele didn't hear the federal marshals identify themselves and initially didn't want to let them on his property.
<P>
Federal officials have said Kanahele struggled with the marshals and attempted to intimidate them in their efforts to apprehend Brown, who they said escaped while on Kanahele's property.
<P>
Aluli said many of the treaties never have been broken and that the 1993 so-called "<A HREF="publawsum.html">Apology Bill</A>" signed by President Clinton acknowledged the overthrow of the kingdom was illegal.  He said some legal experts argue that the bill means the kingdom is still intact.

<STRONG>Honolulu Advertiser, Letter to the Editor<BR>
September 26, 1995</STRONG>
</HEAD>
<P>
The glorification of war this past week allows one to rethink the American military role in Hawaii. Hawaii has been viewed and used by the U.S. government and military strategists as merely an economic and military stepping stone to Asia and the Pacific. 
<P>
Hawaii is obviously seen as a first-line of defense for the West coast and as a playground for military war games.
<P>
The rhetoric often used to justify the military presence here is "to protect" the people of Hawaii has been largely a myth. When World War II was in full gear with Japanese colonialism rampant In the Pacific, why weren't American forces in Hawaii on alert in December 1941? They were certainly not here "to protect" us. The American military presence was the reason for the Japanese attack.
<P>
Although the military does provide jobs for local residents and supposedly a large sum of economic assistance, the military was principally responsible for the illegal overthrow of the Hawaiian nation in 1893 and now controls over 10 percent of land statewide.
<P>
Today, Pearl Harbor is a dumping ground by the military for toxic and hazardous wastes. Is it any wonder an increasing number of people in Hawaii want independence from the United States?

<P>
Two dozen priceless treaties between the United States and the Kingdom of Hawaii left the air conditioned safety of the state Archives for the first time in almost a century yesterday to make a brief appearance in federal court.
<P>
Bound in fancy cloth covers, the documents were written in the late 1800s in elegant cursive with quill pens on parchment now yellowed with age.  The writing is legible, and many signatures are accompanied by wax seals.
<P>
The treaties concern mutual friendship, commerce, navigation and postal agreements between the two countries.
<P>
They were subpoenaed by Hayden Aluli, attorney for Dennis "Bumpy" Kanahele, head of the self-proclaimed Nation of Hawaii, who's on trial for harboring a fugitive.
<P>
"Usually, people are content with certified copies of the treaties," said state Archivist Jolyn Tamura.
<P>
But Aluli said he wanted the originals because "they're living treasures of our Hawaii history and the best evidence to be presented to the jury.
<P>
"Part of Bumpy's educational theater is to take these issues and make them alive.  ...These agreements were made by our ancestors, nation to nation.  They were still alive in 1893 (when the kingdom was overthrown), and Bumpy's case wants to breath new life into them."
<P>
But U.S. District Judge Helen Gillmor declined to let Aluli have Tamura testify and show the treaties to the jury.
<P>
The judge has tried to confine Kanahele's trial to the specifics of the charges.  She ruled from the outset that it will not turn into a "mini-trial" on Kanahele's contention that the federal and state governments are illegally occupying the Islands.
<P>
Gillmor has said the sovereignty issue is a matter for her, not the jury, to decide in this case.
<P>
Kanahele is charged with harboring federal fugitive Nathan Brown and thwarting two attempts to arrest Brown in 1994.  Gordon Kaaihue, head of the nation's "peace force," is a co-defendant on one charge.
<P>
Testimony yesterday, the fourth day of the trial, came from two defense witnesses who gave accounts of the night of Jan. 27, 1994, when police stopped a car containing Brown.
<P>
But the center of attention was the treaties.
<P>
"It's the first time -- at least in modern times -- that they've been exhibited outside our buildings," said Tamura.
<P>
The documents are believed to have been in the archives since the facility was established in 1905 on the <A HREF="palace.html">Iolani Palace</A> grounds, except for one that was put on display in a 1992 exhibit, Tamura said.
<P>
Tamura said she was nervous about the risk of damaging the fragile papers, "but on the other hand, the whole purpose (of the archives) is public access."
<P>
Aluli arranged for members of Kanahele's nation to drive Tamura the three blocks to the Federal Building and provide security.  "We were very, very careful," Aluli said.
<P>
While he didn't get to show them to the jury, he said, "We're excited that we were able to get them out and walk them around town.... I don't know if it's <EM>mana</EM> (spiritual force that Hawaiians believe rests in all things), but I was really moved when I saw them."
<P>
Judge Gillmor said she'd be happy to look at copies of the treaties, rather than risk damaging the originals.

<BODY>
<HR>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1>U.S. business and sugar barons backed by U.S. Marines overthrew the sovereign Kingdom of Hawai`i in 1893.  And despite the message of trust they preached, missionary families, their descendants and friends, invoking the name of God, took over the land.  The deaths of indigenous Hawaiians can never be redressed.  But their lost land can be returned.  It's time to do the right thing, embracing the true spirit of reconciliation...</FONT>
<P>
The Hawaiian Islands have a secret history unknown to most visitors and carefully suppressed by the island's missionary-inspired educators for more than a century.
<P>
It is a history different from any other star in the U.S. flag.  It is a history which demands redress for past crimes and present injustice - a history which mocks the true spirit of aloha, but which must be revealed if we are to promise a brighter future to all the peoples of Hawai`i.

<H2>1. Paradise Found.</H2>

The Hawaiian Islands were settled be seafarers from the South Pacific over 2,000 years ago.  They founded a unique and elaborate culture that flourished wholly undisturbed for 1,800 years before the first European ships encountered the islands.
<P>
These encounters coincided with the unification of the island by their first monarch, King Kamehameha.  Hawaiian sovereignty, initially threatened, was guaranteed by treaty with Europe's great powers and with the United States.  As an independent nation, Hawai`i survived intact the imperialist frenzy which overtook so many other Pacific peoples in the 18th and 19th Centuries.

<H2>2. Paradise Stolen.</H2>

It turned out that the danger to Hawai`i would come from within.  American traders serving Yankee whalers early established themselves on Maui.  New England missionaries soon followed.  both vied for influence with the Hawaiian monarchy.  By the late 19th century, missionaries and their heirs had cleared vast plantations for sugar and pineapple, importing much of their labor from China, Japan, and Portugal.  Native Hawaiians, the Kanaka Maoli, were slaughtered by sexually transmitted diseases, smallpox and other epidemics brought from overseas.  As their numbers fell, their lands were absorbed by foreigners' plantations and missionary families.
<P>
The Hawaiian monarchy rallied to resist these encroachments, but militancy among the traders and plantation owners grew.  Finally, leading American businessmen organized an armed militia and on January 17, 1893, launched a coup d'etat with support of the U.S. military forces anchored in Honolulu Harbor.
<P>
The plotters sought annexation by the U.S., but <A HREF="cleveland.html">President Grover Cleveland</A>, citing violations of treaties of friendship with the Kingdom of Hawai`i, ordered them to restore Queen Lili`uokalani.  
<P>
Instead, the coup leaders declared a Republic of Hawai`i in 1894 and confiscated Crown Lands and Hawaiian Government Lands, parceling out the best among themselves and offering the rest to the U.S. Government in exchange for annexation.
<P>
Torn between lobbying by the U.S. sugar industry and bribes from Hawaiian sugar barons, the U.S. Senate never achieved the two-thirds majority required for annexation.  Instead, in 1898 a joint Congressional resolution made Hawai`i a U.S. territory.  Arable land taken from the Kanaka Maoli was never returned.  More labor was imported from the Far East to work the land.  By the 1950's, the Kanaka Maoli had become a minority on their own islands.  In 1959, the authorities felt it safe to hold a plebiscite on statehood.  The only majority Kanaka Maoli community, the Island of Ni`ihau, voted solidly against it.

<H2>3. Paradise Regained?</H2>

Visitors on a package tour of Hawai`i don't know its shameful history.  But you can be sure that the Kanaka Maoli, one-third of whom live in poverty, their own land off-limits, never forget.
<P>
Over the last generation, Kanaka Maoli have struggled to reclaim their heritage.  They have <A HREF="http://www.maui.com/~ohana/">campaigned against military bombing ranges</A> and geothermal projects.  They have organized politically to fight land evictions and gain access to Hawaiian Home Lands, government and public lands.  Today, a growing sovereignty movement calling for nation status has sparked widespread debate throughout the islands.
<P>
The centennial of the coup against the Kingdom of Hawai`i coincided with the 1993 U.N. International Year for Indigenous Peoples.  It also brought an official apology from the U.S. Government (<A HREF="publawsum.html">Public Law 103-150</A>).
<P>
For the Kanaka Maoli, however, the only apology is action.  It is time to return Hawai`i to its true spiritual keepers.
<P>
It is as a peaceful people that the Kanaka Maoli lost their home.  It is as a peaceful people that they seek its return.  Please join with us.
<P>
<HR>
<P>
<CENTER>
<EM>WHO ARE THE KANAKA MAOLI?<BR>
The original people of Hawai`i, the Kanaka Maoli, numbered 800,000 when Captain Cook landed in 1778.  A century later, only 40,000 survived.  Kanaka Maoli now make up 20% of the Hawaiian population.  After 200 years of racism and systematic impoverishment, the Kanaka Maoli lead Hawai`i in mortality and homelessness.</EM>

Honolulu (AP) -- Hawaiian soverignty leader Dennis "Bumpy" Kanahele has won a legal round in state court.
<P>
Last October, Honolulu District Judge James Dannenburg found Kanahele guilty of driving without a valid driver's license.
<P>
On Wednesday, the state Supreme Court overturned the misdemeanor conviction.
<P>
Kanehele had originally been charged with driving with a suspended or revoked license.
<P>
The basis of the appeal was that the original charge was orally amended the day of the trial.
<P>
Even the state admitted the conviction couldn't stand because of the error.

Despite jury questions that appeared to favor sovereignty activist Dennis "Bumpy" Kanahele, most jurors appeared to want to convict him of two felony charges, jurors said after they were dismissed.
<P>
But they also said that the 12 jurors in the controversial case could not have reached a verdict and that sovereignty concerns did not play a role in their deliberations.
<P>
"A couple jurors tried to bring up sovereignty, but it really didn't pertain to the case," said juror Kevin Watanabe, an Aina Haina auto detailer.
<P>
Jurors, who began deliberating Friday, quickly decided to acquit Kanahele, leader of the self-<A HREF="proclamsum.html">proclaimed</A> Nation of Hawaii, and Gordon Kaaihue of the misdemeanor charge against them from the January 1994 incident.
<P>
The government charged them with interfering with a police officer trying to serve a warrant on fugitive Nathan Brown, who had evaded a 78-month sentence for tax fraud.
<P>
Juror Matthew Allard, a Makiki grocery store clerk, said he thought Kanahele and Kaaihue were not guilty because the officer serving the warrant didn't say that Brown was under arrest.
<P>
"Count one was definitely acquittal," Watanabe said.
<P>
But jurors split early on the felony charges against Kanahele and reached an impasse Monday afternoon after about a day of deliberations.
<P>
The government charged that Kanahele harbored Brown and interfered with deputy marshals trying to arrest him at Kanahele's Waimanalo home in March 1994.
<P>
Allard, who said he was leaning toward conviction of both counts, said that jurors appeared split 10 to 2, with most wanting to convict Kanahele of interfering with the marshals and 9 to 3 in favor of conviction for harboring Brown.
<P>
He said those who favored conviction tended to believe Kanahele had heard the marshals identity themselves because they were so close to him.
<P>
Kanahele's defense had been that he did not hear the marshals and was protecting his property from strangers.
<P>
Watanabe, who said he was leaning toward acquittal, said he was unaware of vote totals.  He said more jurors appeared to favor conviction, but not a sound majority.
<P>
Neither Watanabe nor Allard knew about anyone who tampered with the jury or which juror raised the question.

Defense witnesses in the federal trial of Dennis "Bumpy" Kanahele yesterday give accounts of events that differed substantially from the prosecution's version.
<P>
Kanahele, head of the self-proclaimed Nation of Hawaii, is charged with harboring a fugitive - convicted tax protester Nathan Brown - and interfering with two attempts to arrest Brown last year.
<P>
Kanahele supporter Duke Maikai testified yesterday about an encounter with police on Kamehameha Highway in Hauula the night of Jan. 27, 1994.
<P>
Prosecution witness Thomas Carreiro, a Honolulu police officer, had testified earlier that Kanahele earlier that Kanahele and more than 20 of his supporters thwarted his attempts to arrest Brown that night.
<P>
Carreiro said there were six of seven police there at the time and he decided not to force the issue.
<P>
Maikai said that at most, seven men, five women and about seven children from the Kanahele group were present when Carreiro pulled over the car in which Brown was riding.  He and an earlier defense witness, Mike Hikalea, said eight or nine police officers were present.
<P>
Maikai said that, on Kanahele's orders, he gave each police officer a copy of the <A HREF="publawsum.html">1993 congressional resolution apologizing for the U.S. role in the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy</A> a century earlier.
<P>
Maikai said he told the officers they were committing "<A HREF="genocide.html">genocide</A>," that the penalty could be death or a million dollar fine and that they would be held accountable.
<P>
That testimony sparked a series of sidebar debates out of the jury's hearing among the attorneys and Judge Helen Gillmor.  The judge earlier had ruled she would not allow the trial to become a debate over Hawaiian sovereignty or Kanahele's claim that the state and federal governments are illegally occupying the Islands.
<P>
Maikai's testimony was allowed to stand, however.
<P>
Later yesterday, Maltbie Napoleon, the sovereignty group's attorney general, described a meeting in June between U.S. Marshal Anne Kent and Kanahele at the nation's village on state land in Waimanalo.
<P>
Kent asked Kanahele for help locating Brown and former state official Jack Gonzales, who was also a fugitive at the time, Napoleon said.
<P>
Kanahele told Kent, "We would if we could," but he didn't know where the men were, Napoleon said.
<P>
Kent told them, "If you're not going to help, we're going to have to take it to a higher level," Napoleon said.
<P>
He said she did not elaborate.
<P>
Kent is among the witnesses the defense expects to call to the stand.

<P>
A burst of white noise and a digital connection is made, linking the tents, shacks and taro patches of the self-proclaimed Nation of Hawaii with the world's largest computer network.
<P>
"We've got a ramp now to the information highway, we're on the Internet,"  said  Pu'uhonua "Bumpy" Kanahele, head of the Waimanalo-based Hawaiian sovereignty group.
<P>
The former Kaupo Beach occupants have established a new home on 69 acres of ceded lands offered by the state, and are ready to reach out to the rest of the world, he said.
<P>
The group now posts a World Wide Web home page on the Internet, a kind of electronic newspaper.
<P>
Those "on the Net" can use their computers to read a variety of sovereignty-related articles prepared by Kanahele's organization.
<P>
"This will allow us to educate people about the present state of sovereignty,"  Kanahele said.  "The more people we reach the better, and this reaches all over the world."
<P>
It's the latest electronic step taken by the Nation, said Scott Crawford, who helped design the system.
<P>
"We've been accepting electronic mail messages for about six months,"  he said, adding the group has also been broadcasting information on Hawaii-based computer networks.
<P>
"We get a lot of feedback this way, people wanting more information about sovereignty or our work here,"  he said.
<P>
Internet navigators can access the World Wide Web system at:  [<A HREF="http://hawaii-nation.org/nation/index.html">http://hawaii-nation.org/nation/index.html</A>].  E-mail for the Nation can be directed to:  <A HREF="mailto:exec@hawaii-nation.org">exec@hawaii-nation.org</A>
<P>
The computer connection is just part of the group's multi-pronged efforts to garner support from sources outside of Hawaii, Kanahele said.  The Nation also wants to use local  resources to foster Mainland and international relationships, he said.
<P>
An example is a meeting held last night in Waimanalo with two Mainland experts on Martin Luther King Jr.'s philosophies on nonviolent social change, arranged by the <A HREF="http://www2.hawaii.edu/mip/mip_homepage.html">Spark Matsunaga Institute for Peace</A>, he said.
<P>
Bernard Lafayette and Charles Alphin, of the Martin Luther King Center for Nonviolent Social Change in Atlanta, met with Kanahele to discuss peaceful means to achieve sovereignty.
<P>
Lafayette said Kanahele's group must find ways to work cooperatively with the state and federal government in order to achieve sovereignty.  
<P>
"One thing universal for all peoples struggling for liberation is the need for continuing negotiations, you must always keep the door open," Lafayette said.
<P>
Using office space donated by a California law firm, the group has also established a liaison office in Los Angeles, Kanahele said.
<P>
"It's there so we can reach out, stay in contact with our supporters, make friends,"  he said.
<P>
Plans are being laid to open a similar operation in New York -- possibly near the <A HREF="gopher://nywork1.undp.org:70/1">United Nations</A> headquarters -- "But that's still in the works,"  he said.
<P>
Kanahele said he hopes to continue the pattern of global networking.
<P>
"Before, all we had was this,"  he said, holding up a fist.  "Now we've got computers, now we've got better ways."

<P>
The federal trial of Dennis "Bumpy" Kanahele, head of the self-proclaimed Nation of Hawaii, has drawn a wide range of Hawaiians to the koa-paneled courtroom of U.S. District Judge Helen Gillmor.
<P>
In addition to several dozen of Kanahele's relatives and closest supporters, yesterday's visitors to the fourth floor of the Prince Kuhio Federal Building included <A HREF="http://lei.net/DigitalHI/h3o/Bu_Main.html">comedian Bu La`ia</A>, showed up without his costume.  "I coulda worn my stuff, but that woulda been too much," he said.
<P>
As a member of the "nation of Hawai`i" he said he supports all sovereignty efforts.  He has a special link to Kanahele, however, because Hill said he "lived on the beach for a week" during the 1993-94 occupation of Makapuu and Kaupo by Kanahele's supporters.
<P>
Kanahele is charged with harboring a federal fugitive - convicted Hawaiian tax protester Nathan Brown - and interfering with two 1994 attempts to arrest Brown, who's still at large.
<P>
Hill said he hoped to get a chance to talk with Kanahele.  "I'm trying to get `em all together," Hill said of the various sovereignty efforts.
<P>
<A HREF="http://hoohana.aloha.net/~oha/">OHA</A> trustee Samuel Kealoha and sovereignty council member Olani Decker were also in the gallery, as concerned Hawaiians.
<P>
After listening to some testimony, Decker said of the federal case against Kanahele, "I think it's a set-up.  ...They think of him as a potential threat."
<P>
Hank Fergerstrom, Kona area representative for Kanahele's nation, said, "The government's wasting a lot of time and a lot of money on this case."
<P>
Fergerstrom, who gave up a career as a computer technician to embrace his Hawaiian culture, came to Honolulu from Kona to see the trial.
<P>
He's a member of Na Koa O Puukohola Heiau on the Big Island.  The malo-clad warriors frequently grace Hawaiian events and are devoted to traditional Hawaiian culture.
<P>
Fergerstrom said, "If you're going to stand up and say you're a warrior, you have to go to the battle front."
<P>
As they did on the first day of trial Thursday, about a dozen members of the Nation of Ku picketed in front of the courthouse steps, calling for Kanahele to be freed.
<P>
Their, leader, A`o Pohaku Rodenhurst, said, "This court has no right to judge a sovereign."
<P>
Testimony yesterday afternoon came from Deputy U.S. Marshal Lawrence Tice.  He described a March 16, 1994, incident in front of Kanahele's Hawaiian homestead house in Waimanalo, which he and Deputy Marshal Charles Markle had staked out in hopes of catching Brown.
<P>
Questioned by Assistant U.S. Attorney Les Osborne, Tice gave this account:
<P>
Brown arrived in a van driven by Kanahele about 11:30 a.m. Tice and Markle - in plain clothes - drove up, Tice got out and yelled at Brown to stop.
<P>
Brown squeezed past a gate, Tice ran toward him and got within a foot, only to have Kanahele bump into him and block his way.  They scuffled.  An unidentified man appeared and held Tice's arms.
<P>
Tice saw Brown run through Kanahele's carport and toward the back of the lot.  More Kanahele supporters appeared.  Their numbers reached 20 or 30 at one point.
<P>
Tice and Markle were eventually allowed onto the property, but Brown was long gone by then.
<P>
Kanahele's attorney, Hayden Aluli, tried to get Tice to admit that Kanahele couldn't have known Tice was a U.S. marshal and that Kanahele was just protecting his property against a non Hawaiian stranger.
<P>
But Tice said, "I didn't see him as protecting his property.  I saw him as stopping me."
<P>
The trial continues today.

On the 100th anniversary of Queen Lili`uokalani's arrest, sentiment for Hawaiian sovereignty yesterday surrounded <A HREF="palace.html">Iolani Palace</A>, which was draped in mourning black.
<P>
<LI> Several Hundred members and supporters of the Independent Nation State of Hawaii gathered in front of the palace for a colorful and at times emotional ceremony to sign a constitution.
<P>
It's a step in the group's march towards nationhood, explained leader <A HREF="puuport.html">Dennis "Bumpy" Kanahele</A>; next comes international recognition.  The group, formerly known as the 'Ohana Council,' also marked the first anniversary of its <A HREF="proclamsum.html">declaration of independence</A>.
<P>
<LI> A handful of Hawaiians associated with Hui Na`auao, the Hawaiian sovereignty education consortium, began a round-the-clock vigil at a spot under the second-floor palace suite where the queen was imprisoned for eight months a century ago.  The vigil will continue until Sep. 6, the centennial of the queen's release, and groups are still being signed up to participate.
<P>
<LI> Later yesterday, on the mauka side of the palace, members of various Hawaiian societies had a private preview of the imprisonment room exhibit, which opens to the public tomorrow.
<P>
The exhibit includes the quilt that Lili`uokalani began sewing during her days in custody at the palace.
<P>
Members of the societies, many of them women in black or white dresses, with big hats or leis adorning their heads, waited quietly for their turn to see the palace room the way it appeared a century ago.
<P>
One was Theresa Mews, a member of Hale O Na Ali`i O Hawaii and a descendent o Robert Wilcox, who led the unsuccessful rebellion against the Republic of Hawaii in early January 1895.
<P>
"This is very important to me because I haven't forgotten the illegal overthrow of the queen," said Mews.  She shares "the hurt and anger" that other, more vocal Hawaiians feel about that.
<P>
While her order's rules forbid political activity, she said, "We're struggling for sovereignty just like everybody else is."
<P>
<LI> Ka Lahui Hawaii, the sovereignty organization that claims 21,000 members but drew less than 200 to the palace in heavy rains on Sunday, held the second of three scheduled evening vigils near the Iolani Barracks.
<P>
  * * *   
<P>
One of the kupuna (elders) who signed the (Nation of Hawaii) constitution yesterday was Sala Kealoha Camacho, a great-grandmother from Maui.
<P>
Camacho was moved to tears as she addressed the crowd in Hawaiian, and said how humble she felt to be present on such a great occasion.  And she urged the crowd to make sure their children learn Hawaiian as well as English.
<P>
In an interview after, Camacho, who teaches fourth- and fifth-graders in the state's school systems kupuna program, recalled how she spent much of her childhood with her hand over her mouth - a response to being pinched and beaten for speaking her native Hawaiian in school.
<P>
She said she was given the English name Sarah by her second-grade teacher, who didn't like Camacho's given name, Sala.
<P>
"Our culture didn't leave us.  We left our culture behind," she said.

<P>
Rebuild a true Hawaiian culture and transform the State of Hawaii into an independent nation and tourists will come, and love what they see, says Pu'uhonua "Bumpy" Kanahele.
<P>
"I  foresee that when Hawaii becomes independent, the tourists will look at this place as more of a sacred place,"  Kanahele said in a recent interview at the headquarters of the Sovereign Nation-State of Hawaii in Waimanalo.
<P>
Perhaps not as many, but a better quality of tourist would come with a sincere interest in the place and its people, Kanahele said.
<P>
Kanahele doesn't want Hawaii to be as dependent on tourism as it is now but he said tourism and the Hawaiian culture can exist hand in hand to the benefit of both.
<P>
He said his comment at the recent Tourism Congress, which sounded as if he was suggesting violence directed at  tourism, was misunderstood.
<P>
He meant quite the opposite, said Kanahele, who said he has in fact forestalled possible violence by advising against it.
<P>
What he did mean, he said, was that if the Hawaiians do not get what they want,  things could get violent.  But rather than let that happen, his organization would once again go to the tourists and tell them their presence is lending support to an economy that is based on an illegal government in land improperly seized from the Hawaiians.
<P>
For two days in February, the Ohana Council, led by Kanahele, had its supporters in Waikiki handing out leaflets to tourists saying that Hawaiians are being oppressed and tourists are helping that oppression by their presence and their spending.
<P>
What do Kanahele and his followers want?  They have already established a nation, which is legal under <A HREF"publawsum.html">U. S. Public Law 103-150</A>, signed by President Clinton in November 1993, he said.
<P>
In the <A HREF"publawsum.html">apology resolution</A>, Congress recognized that the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii in January 1893 was illegal.  The Kanahele group's constitutional lawyer, <A HREF"boylebio.html">Francis Boyle</A>, has advised the group that it doesn't need an act of Congress or anyone else to determine its rights because the resolution has done that.
<P>
"What I want is some day for all the Hawaiian organizations to have an opportunity to determine what government we choose,"  he said.  The Hawaiians should be left alone to decide for themselves just how that will be done and should be encouraged and aided in that effort.  Such decisions should not be made by the state or the Legislature or a native Hawaiian elections commission, Kanahele said.
<P>
He also believes the Hawaiians should be given back their land.
<P>
Meanwhile, his group is working hard to develop its nation, on the 50 acres of ceded land granted to it by the state.
<P>
Nestled in the trees up against the Koolaus, the site is a cluster of tents, including a couple of American Indian teepees, some wood-canvas dwellings and the main house, used as an office, which was donated to the group.
<P>
About 100 people live at the site and they have learned the hard way, by hard labor, how to build homes and cultivate land.
<P>
And "When you occupy the land, make sure you have a plan,"  Kanahele said.
<P>
There is a plan and it is already being carried out, he said.  One example is the recultivation of ancient Hawaiian <A HREF="/nation/canoe/kalo.html">taro</A> fields higher up the hill behind Pu'uhonua Waimanalo, the name the group has given its village that means place of refuge, or place of peace and safety.
<P>
Hawaiians don't need handouts, he said.  What they need is a chance to work for themselves, in their own society, bringing back traditional values.  That's what they are doing at Waimanalo, Kanahele said.
<P>
"Lots of our people work.  They're carpenters, truck drivers, mechanics, schoolteachers.  We have Hawaiian language classes here. We're starting to grow Chinese <A HREF="/nation/canoe/kalo.html">taro</A>, vegetables.  We're raising turkeys."
<P>
Some think Hawaiians are lazy, Kanahele said, but the hard work going on at Waimanalo proves how wrong that image is, he said.
<P>
"We're not out there talking about all the good we're doing.  We're too busy doing it."
<P>
And the group is by no means restricted to native Hawaiians.  Kanahele's executive secretary is a New Zealander.  Another executive is of American Indian heritage. 
<P>
"This is a whole different world," he said, looking in awe at the mountains, the view that goes as far as Rabbit Island, the trees and old cultivation sites.  "There were once hundreds of thousands of Hawaiians living all along the base of the Koolaus,"  he said.
<P>
Despite the back-to-nature direction of the new community, it is in the modern world too.  In the main house there are seven computers.  The Nation of Hawaii is hooked into the Internet, letting some 20 million subscribers around the world view a colorful reproduction of the nation's flag, review the law that the group uses as its basis for the claim that sovereignty is already here, and get a description of how the society is set up.
<P>
Kanahele said tourism is the source of extensive cultural and environmental damage and the industry must undergo a transition into a different kind of tourism that respects and works with the Hawaiian native culture.
<P>
At the same time, the economy must be diversified with community-based enterprises filling more of the needs of island people, to make Hawaii less dependent on outsiders, he told the Tourism Congress last month.
<P>
Tourism, in the long run, can only benefit from independence and the creation of a new Hawaiian nation, he said.  Meanwhile, the tourist industry must change.  "We need to focus on quality over quantity and emphasize Hawaii's unparalleled value as a source of health and well-being, cultural sharing, natural beauty and spiritual rejuvenation, through the true essence of <A HREF="aloha.html">aloha</A>,"  he told the Tourism Congress.

<H1>International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the International Crime of Apartheid</H1>

<H3>Adopted and opened for signature and ratification by General Assembly resolution 3068 (XXVIII) of 30 November 1973</H3>
<P>
<B>Entry into force: 18 July 1976, in accordance with article XV</B>
<P>

The States Parties to the present Convention,
<P>
Recalling the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations, in which
all Members pledged themselves to take joint and separate action in
cooperation with the Organization for the achievement of universal respect
for, and observance of, human rights and fundamental freedoms for all
without distinction as to race, sex, language or religion,
<P>
Considering the <A HREF="univdec.html">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</A>, which states that
all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights and that
everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in the
Declaration, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour or
national origin,
<P>
Considering the <A HREF="1514.html">Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial
Countries and Peoples</A>, in which the General Assembly stated that the
process of liberation is irresistible and irreversible and that, in the
interests of human dignity, progress and justice, an end must be put to
colonialism and all practices of segregation and discrimination associated
 therewith,
<P>
Observing that, in accordance with the International Convention on the
Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, States particularly
condemn racial segregation and apartheid and undertake to prevent,
prohibit and eradicate all practices of this nature in territories under
their jurisdiction,
<P>
Observing that, in the <A HREF="genocide.html">Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the
Crime of Genocide</A>, certain acts which may also be qualified as acts of
apartheid constitute a crime under international law,
<P>
Observing that, in the Convention on the Non-Applicability of Statutory
Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity, "inhuman acts
resulting from the policy of apartheid" are qualified as crimes against
 humanity,
<P>
Observing that the General Assembly of the United Nations has adopted a
number of resolutions in which the policies and practices of apartheid are
condemned as a crime against humanity,
<P>
Observing that the Security Council has emphasized that apartheid and its
continued intensification and expansion seriously disturb and threaten
international peace and security,

Convinced that an International Convention on the Suppression and
Punishment of the Crime of apartheid would make it possible to take more
effective measures at the international and national levels with a view to
the suppression and punishment of the crime of apartheid,

<H1>Kanahele:<BR>
Nation of Hawaii to prosecute lawbreakers</H1>
<STRONG>Honolulu Star-Bulletin<BR>
Thursday, July 13, 1995</STRONG>
</CENTER>
<P>
By Debra Barayuga
<P>
The Nation of Hawaii will press criminal charges against those who violate their laws and police who arrest their members, vows the sovereignty group's leader, Dennis "Bumpy Kanahele.
<P>
"This is not a game - I'm head of this nation," he said.  "Justice gotta be served."
<P>
A subdued Kanahele and Gordon Kaaihue greeted supporters with hugs and handshakes outside a Honolulu District Court room yesterday after they were released following their court hearing.
<P>
Both faced contempt-of-court charges for failure to appear in court for traffic violations that date back to 1992.
<P>
About 50 supporters rose in the courtroom when Kanahele and Kaaihue were ushered in.
<P>
Duke Sabedong, the nation's minister of justice, and Maltbie Napoleon, the group's attorney general who represented the two at yesterday's hearing, declined to enter a plea, saying the court had no jurisdiction over the Nation.  
<P>
District Judge Colette Garibaldi entered not-guilty pleas for Kanahele and Kaaihue, and released them on their own recognizance pending a Sept. 15 court date.
<P>
Bail was waived because the two appeared despite their refusal to recognize the court's proceedings, Sabedong said.
<P>
The court is expected to take up the matter of jurisdiction at the trial, Garibaldi said.
<P>
Kanahele and Kaaihue, a colonel with the Hawaii Peaceforce - the Nation's law enforcement arm - spent the night in the Honolulu Police Department's Alapai cell-block after declining to post bail.
<P>
Posting bail - $500 for Kanahele and $300 for Kaaihue - was tantamount to paying ransom, Sabedong said.
<P>
Although the Nation of Hawaii does not recognize U.S. authority, their constitution allows working with the state and federal government toward sovereignty, Kanahele said.
<P>
Bail was posted, however, for Kanahele's son, Westin, who was booked for allegedly interfering with Kaaihue's arrest.  He was released on $100 bail and is to appear in District Court on that charge Wednesday.
<P>
Kanahele was served with an outstanding warrant Tuesday after he and several of the nation's peace officers showed up at the Honolulu Police Department's main station.  
<P>
Kanahele cited the "<A HREF="publawsum.html">apology bill</A>" signed by President Clinton in 1993 acknowledging the U.S. role in the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy a century ago as grounds for the Nation's claim.
<P>
"They admitted to the crime, now they gotta pay," he said.

<TITLE>Federal priestess enforces tyranny by hiding the Bill of Rights</TITLE><A HREF="index.html"><IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="flagsm.gif" BORDER="0"></A> Return to the <A HREF="index.html">Nation of Hawai`i Home Page</A>, the <A HREF="news.html">News Articles Index</A>, or the <A HREF="political_prisoner.html">Political Prosecution page</A><BR><IMG SRC="hrcolor2.gif"><BR><HEAD><P><CENTER>FROM MOUNTAIN MEDIA SYNDICATIONS<P>NOV. 19, 1995<P>THE LIBERTARIAN, By <A HREF="#vin">Vin Suprynowicz</A><H1>Federal priestess enforces tyranny by hiding the Bill of Rights</H1></CENTER>In the Middle Ages, peasants not only weren't <EM>able</EM> to read the Bible; they weren't <EM>allowed</EM> to.<P>It's only been in living memory that the Catholic church has allowed the use of a liturgy translated into the vulgate.<P>While this is usually attributed to a preference for the beautiful sound of the Latin mass, and to a lesser extent the benefits of universality, in fact it descends directly from the medieval doctrine that the commoner has no business trying to figure out the scriptures for himself.<P>This not only rendered all those priestly middlemen indispensable, it also dealt a pre-emptive blow to that lone troublemaker who will always insist on looking things up.<P>Few today would tolerate a return to the days when they were forbidden to consult the scriptures of their own religion. But oddly enough, we tolerate a precisely parallel prohibition on looking up the original words of a set of documents which can be of far more immediate importance to a fellow citizen's life and liberty.<P>When American jurors are asked today to decide whether a fellow citizen shall lose his life or liberty for violating a specific law - a law which is invalid if it violates the Bill of Rights - they are widely forbidden to actually read the law, or the Bill of Rights.<P>In 1993, the United States Congress passed as law an "<A HREF="publawsum.html">apology</A>" to the people of the Hawaiian Islands for wrongly seizing their kingdom a century before.<P>Prompted in part by this acknowledgment, members of the Hawaiian sovereignty movement gathered in 1994 to adopt a new <A HREF="constitution.html">constitution</A>, and elect a new head of state: <A HREF="puuport.gif">Dennis "Bumpy" Kanahele</A>.<P>On Aug. 3, 1995, a federal grand jury secretly indicted Kanahele for harboring a federal fugitive. He was thrown in prison, bail denied.<P>Anyone familiar with the travesty of justice perpetrated on Jerry and Darlene Span of Phoenix - arrested and tried for "resisting" plainclothes federal marshals who came onto their property, jumped them, and  beat them up without ever properly identifying themselves, will start nodding around this point.<P>"Government claims that its agents could not find and arrest convicted tax protester and political prankster Nathan Brown are nonsense," wrote <A HREF="appropriate.html">columnist Brett White in the Honolulu Advertiser Nov. 9</A>. "I saw Brown around Honolulu on numerous occasions - as did hundreds of other folks who know him - during the times that the feds say he was 'hiding and being harbored' by Kanahele. ...<P>"Kanahele's detention is as classic an example of political imprisonment as America has seen in many years," White continues, intended to "silence the most powerful and troublesome sovereignty activist in modern Hawaiian history."<P><A HREF="let_ipcp.html">The Interfaith Prisoners of Conscience Project of the National Council of the Churches of Christ agrees</A> that Kanahele is a "political prisoner or a prisoner of conscience."<P>Kanahele's defense argued the man Kanahele stopped from entering his property had gotten out of an unmarked car wearing an aloha shirt, and had presented no identification as he ran for Kanahele's gate.<P>Naturally, when the trial finally started last month, the Honolulu Advertiser reports Judge Helen Gillmor of the federal district court "ruled she would not allow the trial to become a debate over Hawaiian sovereignty or Kanahele's claim that the state and federal governments are illegally occupying the islands."<P>Barred from presenting his defense - or even arguing self-defense - Kanahele did not address the jury, at all.<P>Judge Gillmor sent the jury out on Oct. 27. They immediately started coming back with questions. Were they to "exclude facts and evidence presented, because it appears the instruction is saying we have to allow anyone to enter our private property because they <EM>may</EM> be marshals?" the jurors asked.<P>On Oct. 31 the jurors sent the judge their fourth question: "Can we make a decision using a law from the Constitution of the United States and from the Bill of Rights? (Article IV)?" - the "unreasonable searches and seizures" Amendment.<P>That afternoon, the Advertiser reports, "Gillmor revealed that the question apparently stemmed from research done by one juror, Robert DeCosta, on his own in the court's law library one floor below the courtroom. Librarian Patricia Butson said DeCosta asked to see 'Article IV of the Bill of Rights' and checked out a thick law book on the <A HREF="http://www.house.gov/Constitution/Constitution.html">Constitution</A> for about a half-hour that morning. Gillmor's instructions to the jury at the start of the trial had included standard language warning the jurors not to conduct any research or investigation" of their own.<P>Citing this, the fact juror DeCosta possessed a copy of the "<A HREF="http://sunsite.unc.edu/fija/fijahome.htm">Jury Rights Handbook</A>," and a further unsubstantiated suspicion of "jury tampering," Gillmor declared a mistrial. Bumpy Kanahele remained in Halkawa Prison until Nov. 13, when a different judge remanded him to a halfway house to await a new trial.<P>Juror DeCosta did not sneak out to the scene of the crime to play amateur detective. He simply looked up the highest law of the land.<P>Laws are not supposed to be written in some code, interpretable only by robed priestesses. If common folk are to obey them, then they must be written for common folk to read and understand. Jurors have every right to do so.<P>Defense attorney Hayden Aluli says he'll object to a re-trial, since the mistrial was declared over his objections. The panel's questions "showed me that the jury was really a smart jury and could have been possibly leaning toward the defense."<P>Except, of course, that the high priestess in the black robes caught them trying to look up the "scriptures" for themselves.<P>Contributions for Kanahele's defense: Hawaii Social Justice Fund, P.O.

<P>
The day after a federal court jury failed to determine the judicial fate of Nation of Hawaii leader Dennis "Bumpy" Kanahele, I attended his press conference at the Halawa Correctional Facility.
<P>
Kanahele asked everyone to "tell the truth" about his comments. He laid out his feelings about why he should be granted bail pending any retrial on the charges against him.
<P>
Having interviewed him and having hung out with him on numerous occasions, I believe I know Kanahele just about as well as any of the mainstream media workers do.
<P>
It is implausible to me that any rational person could deem Kanahele a threat to the public safety. Any violent act that he may have committed years ago has long since been atoned for through his previous 11 month imprisonment and his subsequent spiritual awakening and rebirth. I place the chances of Kanahele ever again committing a violent act at exactly zero.
<P>
It is clear to me that the only threat the activist poses is a political one to the economic status quo enjoyed by the suborners and beneficiaries of one of the most corrupt land grabs ever perpetrated by America - the theft of the Nation of Hawaii.
<P>
Kanahele's detention is as classic an example of political imprisonment as America has seen in many years. The charges against him are ludicrous on their face and can be seen to be political in both nature and season when reviewed in even the most perfunctory manner.
<P>
I believe that federal agents - and their state lackeys - theorized that the arrest of Kanahele would do three things:
<P>
<LI> Silence the most powerful and troublesome sovereignty activist in modern Hawaiian history.
<P>
<LI> Send a warning message to other sovereignty promoters not to get "too radical and too uppity."
<P>
<LI> Leave Kanahele's followers fractured, without a leader, and vulnerable to absorption by proponents of the kind of sellout solution to the "sovereignty problem" that would best serve the preservation of business as usual.
<P>
Government claims that its agents could not find and arrest convicted tax protester and political prankster Nathan Brown are nonsense. I saw Brown around Honolulu on numerous occasions - as did hundreds of other folks who know him - during the times that the feds say he was "hiding and being harbored" by Kanahele.
<P>
As is typical when half-baked fascist tactics born of tyranny-based scheme are employed under color of law, the state and federal governments' intended goals have not been realized. Their tactics have merely created an icon of freedom to be heralded, and given birth to a semi-martyr in the eyes of Kanahele's supporters.
<P>
With governments at all levels facing budget restraints, all working folks should hope that no more public money is squandered on the political prosecution of a man whose only real crime was in challenging what he now knows is not a mere paper tiger. It is time for America to do the right thing, the generous thing, if you insist and dismiss its complaint against Kanahele.

<H2>Abstract</H2>

<EM>The swiftly evolving information and communication technologies and networking infrastructures are playing an expanding role in supporting the self-determination of peoples and emergent nations.  
<P>

Internally, access to information and facilitation of communication provides new and enhanced opportunities for participation in the process of self-determination, with the potential to accelerate political, economic, social, educational and cultural advancement beyond the scope of traditional institutions and forms of governance.  
<P>

Externally, regional and global information networks expand the voice of emergent nations and peoples with electronic forums to focus international attention and support toward specific self-determination issues and efforts.

This paper assesses the current trends and resources in this area, with examples of successful utilization of communications models and technologies for direct peaceful empowerment of peoples, particularly indigenous peoples.
<P>

Finally, we examine the potential for Hawaii to play a distinctly important role in the transition to the information age, including serving as an initial example of a launch point or hub of networks, links, and resources to model and facilitate this development process, and to serve as the host to a new virtual gathering of self-determined nations and peoples allied for a secure and sustainable future.

<A NAME="sec1">
<H2>1. Introduction</H2>

	The ''information age'' is upon us, as we convene for this conference with people from all around the world to discuss the future role of information technologies in our lives and the lives of our people.  As we consider the technologies, we must always keep central in our minds the purpose, the reason for their use.  Interactive media such as the World Wide Web are so engaging as to almost be worthwhile just for their own sake, it seems.  Almost, but not really.  The technology is only a tool, and is only as useful as the information that it carries.
<P>

	Thus we must continually be aware of the need for content.  We cannot get so entranced by the magic of how we put information into cyberspace, that we forget that what we are putting there is what really matters.  The medium is not the message.

<A NAME="sec2">
<H2>2. Self-Determination</H2>

	We submit that one of the most valuable and essential processes that humanity can engage in, and which is therefore essential to look at in terms of information technologies, is the process of ''self-determination.''
<P>
<A NAME="up1">
	The principal of self-determination of peoples was embodied as a central purpose of the United Nations in its Charter in 1945. ''The Purposes of the United Nations are... To develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples, and to take other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace...'' <A HREF="#ref1">[1]</A> 
<P>
<A NAME="up2">
	The resolution 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960, containing the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, stated: ''All peoples have the right to self-determination; by virtue of that right they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social, and cultural development.'' <A HREF="#ref2">[2]</A>
<P>

	By this we see that self-determination is tied in with all aspects of life - political, economic, social, and cultural - and is ultimately about how we choose to live, and allow others to live, together on this planet.
<P>
<A NAME="up3">
	In 1995, these issues continue to be highly relevant as numerous peoples around the world strive for the fulfillment of this basic right of self-determination.  On February 7, 1995, the UN General Assembly again adopted a resolution regarding the ''Universal realization of the right of peoples to self-determination,'' in which the General Assembly reaffirms ''the importance, for the effective guarantee and observance of human rights, of the universal realization of the right of peoples to self-determination'' and welcomes ''the progressive exercise of the right to self-determination by peoples under colonial, foreign or alien occupation and their emergence into sovereign statehood and independence.'' <A HREF="#ref3">[3]</A>
<A NAME="up4"><A NAME="sec3">
<H2>3. Indigenous Peoples and the Wisdom of the Fourth World</H2>

	The UN has also declared the Decade of Indigenous peoples, and has recognized ''the value and the diversity of the cultures and the forms of social organization of the world's indigenous people, and the ''vital role of indigenous people and their communities in the interrelationship between the natural environment and its sustainable development..., including their holistic traditional scientific knowledge of their lands, natural resources and environment.'' <A HREF="#ref4">[4]</A>
<P>
<A NAME="up5">
	In The Meaning of 'Nation' and 'State' in the Fourth World, Dr. Richard Griggs of the University of Capetown defines  ''Fourth World'' as ''Nations forcefully incorporated into states which maintain a distinct political culture but are internationally unrecognized.'' <A HREF="#ref5">[5]</A>
<P>

	Griggs also provides a more detailed description as follows: ''A convenient shorthand for the Fourth World would be internationally unrecognized nations. These are the 5,000 to 6000 nations representing a third of the world's population whose descendants maintain a distinct political culture within the states which claim their territories. In all cases the Fourth World nation is engaged in a struggle to maintain or gain some degree of sovereignty over their national homeland.''
<P>

	In many cases, it is indigenous peoples of the fourth world who are engaged in the self-determination process, seeking to assert their political voice and integrity along with their economic, cultural and social perpetuation and development.  Increasingly we are recognizing that these voices that must be heard, and for them to be heard in the electronic realm is essential.  The voices of the indigenous peoples of the world engaged in the process of self-determination can help provide the content that makes the use of the technology meaningful and useful in a real way.
<P>

	A hierarchy of information has been proposed, from bottom to top, as follows: data, information, knowledge, intelligence, wisdom.  The Indigenous people of the world already hold the ancient wisdom. The question is, can their wisdom be translated into data and information in a way that preserves its essence, while allowing us to take advantage of the modern technologies that are available to distribute and share this wisdom in the form of data, to make a real difference in the future of humanity.
<A NAME="sec4">
<H2>4. Information Communication for Self-Determination</H2>

	It is our premise that the swiftly evolving information and communication technologies and networking infrastructures are playing an expanding role in supporting the self-determination of peoples and emergent nations, and in this paper we look to explore the present reality and future possibilities in this regard.
<P>
<A NAME="up6">
	In his essay ''Cyberocracy is Coming,'' David Ronfeldt describes the importance of information technologies in terms of politics and power.  ''The distribution of power and the prospects for cooperation and conflict are increasingly seen as a function of the differing abilities of governments and other political entities to utilize new technologies.'' <A HREF="#ref6">[6]</A>  'Other political entities' would certainly include self-determination movements.
<P>

	Access to information and facilitation of communication provides new and enhanced opportunities for participation in the process of self-determination, with the potential to enhance political, economic, social, educational and cultural advancement beyond the scope of traditional institutions and forms of governance.
<P>

	We assess the current resources, trends and potentials in this area, with examples of successful utilization of communications models and technologies for direct peaceful empowerment of peoples, particularly indigenous peoples, along with some limitations that must also be considered.
<A NAME="sec5">
<H2>5. The Virtual Nation</H2>

	Self-determination struggles may benefit from the ability to form ''virtual communities.''  The situation of peoples who are involved with these struggles is often one of dispersion, having been forced away from their homeland for military, political or economic reasons.
<P>
<A NAME="up7">
	In the discussion on the International Relations and National Sovereignty Listserv discussion group, Kurt Mills, writes that: ''The most obvious impact of communications technology is that it makes possible new kinds of communities, or at least provides the possibilities for a certain level of cohesion among a dispersed community which may be necessary for any kind of SD movement to form and assert itself.  Alongside this, it creates new centers of authority, relocating authority away from traditional authority structures -- i.e. the state -- toward more ambiguous and fluid confluences and loci of authority.  It also means that territoriality, in one sense, is not nearly as important in the creation of feelings of community.  That is, dispersed communities can form and remain cohesive a lot easier with advent of telephones, the Internet, e-mail, communications satellites, etc. ... One can think of many other dispersed communities and such communications capabilities might aid them in various self-determination activities, by being able to exchange information, strategize, etc.''  <A HREF="#ref7">[7]</A>
<P>

	Thus the body of people capable of participating in the self-determination process may be expanded through access to communications technology.
<P>
<A NAME="up8">
	As a direct illustration of this, Jeff Delisio, who works with the Free Tibet Home Page, writes that: ''There is an effort underway now to improve the online services in Dharamsala, the home of the Tibetan Government-in-Exile. This will enable a more direct link between Tibet supporters and the officials and organizations where the bulk of Tibetans reside. Tibetan writers are grouping together to inform and educate people on modern Tibetan culture and are looking to disseminate information across countries and oceans. There is a lot of work underway to preserve Tibetan religious texts in electronic form and on CD-ROMs. Most of that is being done in monasteries transplanted to India.'' <A HREF="#ref8">[8]</A>
<P>

	Tibet forms a clear example of a situation where both politically and technically, access from within the territory itself is extremely limited, but by the government-in-exile working in partnership with its people and various supporters around the world, a vital cyberspace community is being established to further the purposes of the people of Tibet.
<P>
<A NAME="up9">
	Dan Pacheco gives another example of the successful use of telecommunications technology by Native people, for educational purposes.  ''In Barrow, Alaska, the Inuit (also known as Eskimos) have built a $48 million system that allows two-way interactive video... When the temperature is 40 below zero, high school teachers in Barrow can continue teaching the kids at their homes.'' <A HREF="#ref9">[9]</A>
<A NAME="sec6">
<H2>6. Indigenous Networks</H2>

	Each indigenous people and fourth world nation has its own distinct history and current political situation, yet there is much in common between all in their struggles for political identity, voice, and recognition, and sovereignty over their land and natural resources.  Each group on it's own may feel isolated and disempowered if unable to see themselves in the larger picture.  But the establishment of relations between various fourth world peoples can provide benefits in a number of ways, by sharing experiences, resources, and insights so that those who have learned in one way or another can share their knowledge, and by coordinating actions for solidarity and enhanced effectiveness.
<P>

	The electronic media provides vast opportunities for such networking.  As David Ronfeldt writes, as new ''organizational networks are built, cutting across ... national borders and interests, influential sub- and supra-national actors may increasingly compete for influence with national actors.  As political and economic interests grow in protecting and expanding the networks, the networks themselves may increasingly take precedence over nation-states as the driving factor in domestic and foreign affairs.'' <A HREF="#ref7">[7]</A>
<P>

	Native communities have been actively engaged in creating and utilizing such networks with increasing participation and sophistication.
<P>

	Dan Pacheco quotes Turtle Heart, a native American artist who uses the Internet: '''There's been so much written about native people, but none of it by native people. The Internet is the best tool in 500 years to give native peoples a voice,' he said. Like many across the country, Turtle Heart sees the information superhighway evolving into a tool for Native Americans to strengthen their communities and convey their culture to the world. Organizations devoted to the plight of native peoples - and a few tribes themselves - are creating electronic community networks, World Wide Web home pages and on-line discussion groups in surprising numbers.'' <A HREF="#ref9">[9]</A>
<P>

	One prime example is the NativeWeb (<A HREF="http://ukanaix.cc.ukans.edu/~marc/nativeweb.html">http://ukanaix.cc.ukans.edu/~marc/nativeweb.html</A>), which contains extensive information about a range of native subjects, geographic regions, and cultural groups, along with material on native literature, languages, newsletters and journals, organizations, and bibliographies.  NativeWeb also provides pointers to other native information resources, including WWW sites, Gopher and FTP Sites, UseNet Newsgroups, and Listserv lists. There are well over two dozen newsgroups and Listserv lists related to indigenous issues, including education, health, language, law, spirituality, and ecology.
<P>

	Glenn Welker is one of the principle maintainers of NativeWeb, and contributes extensive information on the situation in Chiapas, Mexico.  He writes about his work networking indigenous people together, that they have ''so much beautiful literature, stories, fables, etc. that not many people know about. Also, my hope is that what I am doing is helping to educate non-native people. In doing that, I hope there can be better understanding between their 2 worlds. Based on the number of e-mail messages and contributions of poetry, stories, etc., I definitely know that my work is being appreciated.'' 
<P>
<A NAME="up10">
	Welker continues: ''From what I see, Native Americans are gaining more and more recognition on the Internet each day. I know this due to all of the pointers that I have discovered. It will benefit them most because they will be better able to communicate with their different groups. When used correctly the Internet is a powerful tool that can definitely change the status of many people. We all know how much native peoples can use all of the help they can. It is long overdue in my opinion.'' <A HREF="#ref10">[10]</A>
<A NAME="sec7">
<H2>7. Access to Information Resources</H2>

	Another positive benefit is the access to informational resources which are invaluable for those people engaged in self-determination struggles.  
<P>

	As peoples seek to increase their self-governance and control over their land and natural resources, and for some to gain recognition as sovereign countries, access to international legal tools is essential, and being able to access these documents instantaneously can provide significant advantages.  For example, advocates can access directly into the United Nations for relevant materials, such as those resolutions mentioned above.  
<P>

	Numerous other sources also exist to access valuable international information.
<P>
<A NAME="up11">
	Microstate Resources is a virtual library on the World Wide Web, ''designed for decision makers, business people, scholars, tourists--anyone interested in the affairs of very small countries, autonomous territories, colonies and similar domains. Through MR, microstate cybernauts gain immediate access to the widest range of online data available pertaining to microstates.'' <A HREF="#ref11">[11]</A>
<P>
<A NAME="up12">
	Documents specifically related to indigenous issues can be found at the Fourth World Documentation Project, organized by the Center For World Indigenous Studies (CWIS) out of Washington State, USA, in 1992. Its mission is to ''document and make available to tribal governments, researchers and organizations, important documents relating to the social, political, strategic, economic and human rights situations being faced by Fourth World nations and create an historical archive of the political struggles waged by Indigenous Peoples to assert their rights as sovereign nations.'' <A HREF="#ref12">[12]</A>
<P>

	Human rights information is available from a wide range of sources electronically to help people understand their rights and combat abuses of those rights by having the proper information. One Human Rights Gopher includes information from the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), Amnesty International (AI), Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), Human Rights in China (HRIC), Human Rights Watch (HRW), PEN, and Physicians for Human Rights (PHR). (<A HREF="gopher://gopher.humanrights.org:5000/">gopher://gopher.humanrights.org:5000/</A>)
<P>

	A vast range of resources regarding sustainable development can be accessed electronically, to assist the self-determination process on the very tangible level of providing sustenance to the people in a sustainable manner.  One resource, developed here in Hawaii as part of the Earth Day effort, is the Earth Wave Directory, which provides links to numerous other sites for environmental and sustainable development resources.
 (<A HREF="http://www.aloha.net/epf/dsg/directory.html">http://www.aloha.net/epf/dsg/directory.html</A>)
<P>

	Finally, resources which can be accessed via the net include not only the files which reside in cyberspace, but also the contacts with the people who put them there, and the growing number of experts, scholars, attorneys, etc. who also have access to cyberspace. For example, the Nation of Hawaii regularly communicates via e-mail with our international legal counsel, Prof. of International Law Francis A. Boyle, at the University of Illinois College of Law.  Requests for advice and opinions on important matters can be handled in an efficient and timely manner using the network, and Prof. Boyle can stay effectively involved in the development of the Nation from a distance in a way that would be much less convenient without these technologies.
<A NAME="sec8">
<H2>8. Electronic Voices</H2>

	Politics is voice.  Political independence means having one's own voice, representing one's own people, in the international arena.
<P>

	Having a presence on regional and global information networks expands the voice of emergent nations and peoples with electronic forums to focus international attention and support toward specific self-determination issues and efforts. 
<P>

	The Nation of Hawaii, as an example, established our presence on the World Wide Web (<A HREF="http://hawaii-nation.org/nation/">http://hawaii-nation.org/nation/</A>) in December of 1994, in order to provide information regarding the legal foundation for the restoration of Hawaiian independence, along with cultural perspectives from the people of Hawaii.  The site includes legal documentation, current and historical information, news articles, and links to related resources in and about Hawaii on the World Wide Web.  We now receive an average of around 600 hits per week to our home page, and through our guest book registrations we have developed an electronic mailing list of hundreds of people (predominantly from North America and Europe) who now form a network of supporters who we can keep informed and activate when needed.  We also have set up an automated document retrieval system (<A HREF="mailto:exec@hawaii-nation.org">info@hawaii-nation.org</A>) to provide legal and related information about the Nation to those who don't have access to the Web.  We post materials in related newsgroups as well, such as <A HREF="news:alt.culture.hawaii">alt.culture.hawaii</A>.
<P>

	One noteworthy aspect of the Nation's guest book is the number of United States government representatives from a variety of offices who have signed in and let us know that they have visited our site.  For each one that has signed in, certainly many others have seen the information and chosen not to register.  Because many U.S. government offices now have access to the Web, this seems to be quite an effective medium to share this important information.  By signing in to our guest book they are also in a sense acknowledging the legitimacy of what they have seen there.  This positive education within the occupying government is essential for a smooth and peaceful transition to restore independence.  
<A NAME="sec9">
<H2>9. Military Power versus Informational Empowerment</H2>
<A NAME="up13">
	Regis Debray has stated that ''We are witnessing a historic transformation of the traditional modes of power.  Power today is becoming less based on physical and material parameters (territory, military forces) and more on factors linked to the capability of storing, managing, distributing, and creating information.'' <A HREF="#ref13">[13]</A>
<P>

	As David Ronfeldt suggests, ''recognition is spreading in governments around the world that the new technologies may profoundly alter the nature of political power, sovereignty, and governance.'' <A HREF="#ref6">[6]</A>
<P>

	While numerous self-determination struggles have included armed resistance on one side against police/military oppression by occupying colonial forces on the other side, it is becoming obvious that armed violence on either side rarely, if ever, produces a lasting resolution to the issues of sovereignty or betters the conditions of the people.  
<P>

	It may be possible that the increasing use of computers and communications technologies can help to reduce the physical confrontations, and bring the battles more into the virtual realm where effective access to and dissemination of information become the best ''weapons'' a people can have.  From the movements' perspective, violence is often resorted to when all other avenues seem exhausted, and by providing empowerment through information, the range of options that are available to make progress without violence is expanded.  From the states' point of view, military or police action seems much less attractive when the world is watching, and information networks allow the world to watch in new and often relatively uncontrollable ways.  For these reasons, it is hoped that the use of these technologies can assist in the peaceful resolution of sovereignty conflicts and the positive expression of the self-determination of peoples.
<P>

	Kurt Mills writes that ''...for a wide range of communities and activities, emerging technologies provide a direct line to worldwide public sentiment.  As much as anything, it seems, Tienanmen Square was a revolution by fax, and I would bet that people outside of China had a better idea of what was going on there than most within the country, and the insurgents were able to get information in and out beyond the reach of official censors...'' <A HREF="#ref7">[7]</A>
<P>

	In this case access to the communication did not prevent violence, but increasingly, as a movement can notify supporters and the world at large instantaneously of potential violence against it, the more likely they are to prevent that violence by bringing worldwide attention and pressure to bear.
<P>

	As Jeff Delisio of the Free Tibet Home Page writes, ''It is clear that little non-violent pressure can be applied if people are in the dark about a conflict.  After an initial outpouring of sympathy the Tibetans were largely left to languish by the rest of the world. Only through the deliberate perseverance of the Dalai Lama and others did their cause begin to bubble to the surface again. I think that will only increase dramatically by coordinated sharing of information, electronic petitions, etc.'' <A HREF="#ref8">[8]</A>
<P>

	The limitation of this is that those regimes most likely to enact violence are also those least likely to provide access to communications technology to those who might oppose it internally, for this very reason.  The technologies are a double edge sword.  To the degree that these technologies are restricted to those already in power, they may serve to keep them in power.  But to the degree that the world community is able to distribute these technologies and provide access to the grassroots and progressive elements of society, the more they may contribute to the peaceful and positive resolution of sovereignty and self-determination issues.
<P>

	Hawaii is one example today of a peaceful self-determination process, in which the de facto occupying governments - the United States and the State of Hawaii - have conceded their illegitimacy and are willfully engaging the re-emerging Nation of Hawaii in a peaceful process of transition.  No guns have been fired, no bombs have exploded, yet the people's assertions of their rights to freely determine their political status are being heard and taken seriously, and are being put into effect as an operational model of self-governance. Our ''weapons'' are Macintoshes with fax/modems, firing off international law and self-determination information, and with that the movement has successfully and peacefully advanced.  
<P>

	While it is difficult to say exactly to what degree the use of information and communications technologies have affected this process, clearly they have played a positive role, and in this we hope that Hawaii can serve as an example for the world.
<A NAME="sec10">
<H2>10. Cyberplomacy and Internetional Relations</H2>

	In his essay ''Cyberocracy is Coming'' David Ronfeldt coined the term ''cyberocracy,'' meaning ''rule by way of information'' to describe possibilities of new forms of governing in the information age.  He posits that information and it's control will become a dominant source of power, as a natural next step in our political evolution.  <A HREF="#ref6">[6]</A>
<P>

	We would add to this another related term: ''cyberplomacy,'' diplomacy via the information media, the interaction of governments in cyberspace.
<P>

	For self-determination struggles attempting to emerge (or reemerge) as nations, one place that a presence as a nation can exist is in cyberspace, to enhance legitimacy and visibility as a real entity.  
<P>

	One criterion for independence, for being a sovereign country, is having a territory.  In cyberspace, the parallel could be drawn of a virtual territory, the presence on the WWW, the Home Page being the capital and all the related documents being the territory.  A number of recognized countries have such a territory in cyberspace, and increasingly unrecognized nations are mapping out their own cyber-territories.
<P>

	Another criterion for independence is international relations, and the parallel here would be ''internetional relations.'' Many peoples and nations with limited ability to travel and conduct diplomatic affairs may utilize the electronic ability to initiate and/or develop relations with other governments, both recognized and unrecognized.
<P>

	Tibet provides a good example of cyberplomacy.  Though the Tibetan government's territory is currently occupied by China, the government-in-exile is able to have a presence or territory in cyberspace, along with their physical presence in India, where they can organize their people and carry on relations around the world.
<A NAME="sec11">
<H2>11. Limitations of Accessibility</H2>

	While it is tempting to expound on the potential benefits of electronic communications for a freer and more self-determined world, we must also temper the enthusiasm for these technologies with a realistic view as to the limitations, particularly regarding access in less developed regions of the world.  While there may be CD-ROM development going on in monasteries in India and interactive video in sub-zero Alaska, many areas of the world which could certainly benefit greatly from this access do not have it.
<P>

	Ronfeldt warns of the need for distribution of these technologies and freedom of access.  ''A new distinction is emerging between the information 'haves' and 'have-nots.'  Some actors may become global information powers, but others, notably in the Third World, fear 'electronic colonization' and 'information imperialism.' '' <A HREF="#ref6">[6]</A>  If this is true of Third World countries in relation to First World, then Fourth World nations are at an even greater disadvantage, and in greater need of assistance to gain access and make positive use of the technologies.
<P>
<A NAME="up14">
	Dr. Keith Webb wrote in the International Relations and National Sovereignty Listserv discussion group that, ''I believe that some of the hyperbole surrounding the effect of the internet needs to be toned down, at least for the immediate future. I have just returned from China, and last year was in Eritrea, and in both cases looked at the potential of the internet from an educational point of view.  What is true of the educational context is probably also true of other contexts.
<OL>
<LI> In many/most Third World countries the basic infrastructure required to access internet is just not available.  Here I am talking about such basics as electricity! And, of course, telephone lines!
<LI> In many such countries, only the educational (which is also the social) elite will have the basic literacy, etc. to cope with the internet.
<LI> In a number of countries access to the internet will be limited due to political reasons, e.g. the Singapore government controls the only gateway.  While the top 100 universities in China are being linked to an email network this year, it is difficult to see the Chinese government allowing completely free access to the world network. The consequence of these points seem to me to point to an increasing dichotomisation of the world of information, deepening north-south splits rather than leading to liberation.'' <A HREF="#ref14">[14]</A>
</OL>

	Webb also points out that based upon his experience working in the developing world, he projects that the potential take-up of any internet services will be predominantly male, urban and probably major/capital city oriented, as well as socially elite. 
<P>
<A NAME="up15">
	Webb proposes that support by the developed countries is essential for the effective distribution and use of these technologies.  He suggests that, in terms of nodal development, ''If it is to have any effect, it has to be through the good offices of donor nations, i.e. a form of aid.  Hence, the British Council, the US ISIS, might be better employed in providing banks of terminals and relevant tuition rather than investing so much in third world libraries.'' <A HREF="#ref15">[15]</A>
<P>

	This leads to another aspect of providing access beyond the elite, and that is public terminals that can be widely used for communication and research.  While the ubiquity of computers with modem lines in each household is becoming a reality in some of the most technically advanced areas, public terminals are much more realistic for most areas, even in developed countries, and offer a relatively economically and technically feasible and efficient method to provide the possibility of broader access.  Locations such as libraries, schools, universities, postal offices, community centers, cafes, and other meeting places can be equipped with terminals designed for ease of interface and durability of use.  Training for the use and maintenance of these services would also be important.
<P>

	One other issue limiting access is language, and it is important to consider this as material is developed for the Web and other information servers. This includes both the valuable efforts to perpetuate native languages electronically (through special fonts, sound files, software applications, etc.) and the mirroring of sites in different languages.  Part of NativeWeb, for example, is also provided in Spanish, and a number of other examples exist as well.
<A NAME="sec12">
<H2>12. Partnerships for Access</H2>

	One solution to the issue of access, which depends more on personal relations and less on institutional actions by first world entities, is to develop effective partnerships between those with the technical ability and the access and those with the issues and the content.
<P>
<A NAME="up16">
	For instance, Karen Strom has provided WWW presences for a wide range of Native American tribes, organizations, museums, and projects, all of which are hosted on her server at the University of Massachusetts.  Similarly, the NativeWeb, including extensive information about the indigenous peoples of Mexico and Ecuador, is hosted on a server at the University of Kansas and mirrored at the University of Massachusetts.
<P>

	Strom sees setting up and hosting Web pages as a valuable service, but also as only the first step.  ''One of my goals obviously is to somehow obtain access for all of these groups so that they will have local editorial control and feel freer to change things when they wish. In fact, the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum saw that need immediately and are also in the process of getting their own access, using the work I did for them as a basis for getting much more material up online.'' <A HREF="#ref16">[16]</A>
<P>

	Partnerships are a good first step to get information up remotely.  A range of services could be provided, in various combinations, depending on the resources and needs, including providing the physical site and/or the HTML design work or other systems design.  The long term goal is to provide assistance toward each entity having it's own server. Seeing the material online, and receiving the positive feedback and experiencing the direct results of this presence, can provide the incentive to move into a more active participation with the net.  Further technical and financial support systems can then be employed for this step, utilizing and expanding on the partnerships that are already in place.
<A NAME="sec13">
<H2>13. Hawaii's Contribution</H2>

	Hawaii's unique political, economic, technical, and geographic situation provides the opportunity to play a distinctly important role in the transition to the information age.
<P>

	The Nation of Hawaii is moving from the fourth world to the third/first world politically, yet is on the forefront of the current technology explosion.  Hawaii seeks to align with countries and peoples who are in a similar position politically but without the same advantages technically, in order to provide high-tech services for those nations not currently capable, and to act as a clearinghouse of information to facilitate contact with others who could assist in the process, wherever they may be in the world.
<P>

	As discussed above, the physical site to host Web pages and other information servers could reside in Hawaii to carry material from Pacific island nations and other native peoples.  For example, the Nation has recently begun hosting a site (and formatting documents) for the International Indian Treaty Council (<A HREF="http://hawaii-nation.org/nation/iitc/">http://hawaii-nation.org/nation/iitc/</A>) to provide a presence for information on the Draft Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the Indigenous Treaty Study currently being carried out by a special rapporteur of the United Nations.  We have been contacted by the Chamorro people of Guam to host some of the materials relating to their self-determination efforts, and have discussed working with Land Rights Queensland (Australia) on Aboriginal issues, until they are able to establish their own server, and perhaps continue to mirror their site.  Such assistance could include the HTML design work, converting source material into an interactive presence.
<P>

	Again, the long term goal would be to move these materials onto their own servers in full control of those directly responsible for their content, but to help provide the technical assistance, incentive, and training to progress one step at a time as they are able.
<P>

	Another useful service would be the creation of a page of links pointing to good places to register new pages, as a resource to assist those who are just getting their virtual presence established.  Web pages are useless if no one knows they are there, and there are no strands put in place to link them to the rest of the Web.  Rather than leave it up to each new webmaster to figure out how to promote their pages, a service could be provided to help establish links to new pages so they will be found by those interested in seeing them.
<P>

	The Nation of Hawaii also plans to develop a comprehensive links center for Fourth World and newly emerging nations as they come online, and to initiate appropriate corresponding newsgroups and listservers to facilitate the development of networks to empower self-determination movements with access to information.
<P>

	Through such cyberplomacy, the Nation of Hawaii hopes to facilitate the peaceful resolution of sovereignty issues and the positive expression of self-determination efforts, and perhaps even to serve as the host to a new virtual gathering of self-determined peoples and nations allied for a secure and sustainable future.

"He just snapped," says Henry Smith.  "If they hadn't kept hassling him, he wouldn't have set the house on fire."<P>And if law enforcement officers hadn't physically restrained him, Henry says, he might have been able to talk to his brother into coming out of the house alive.<P>As it was, Kahale perished in his burning home last Thursday morning and, says Henry, "the department of Hawaiian Home Lands said the Commissioners murdered my brother."<P>It was a standard Hawaiian Homes eviction gone crazy.  A crowd had assembled at Kahale's Anahola home, DHHL officials, law enforcement officers, movers and a deputy attorney general were at the scene.  One minute Kahale, 59, was cooperating, the next the house was in flames.<P>The first time he was ordered to vacate.  In 1984, Kahale, a gentle giant of a man, chained his 300-pound frame to a wooden railing on the front porch of the home he purchased in 1977 on property leased from DHHL.  He won that battle and another in 1986 when the state Supreme Court ruled that he could stay until a settlement in his dispute with DHHL could be reached.<P>He was ordered to vacate again on September 30, 1993.  He lost appeals to both the Circuit and State Supreme courts and was ordered again to vacate in April 1995.  A court order finally set the date for January 5, 1996.  Officials showed up on January 18.<P>Kahale never gave up.  The house he had bought from DHHL in 1977 was defective and he wanted it fixed.<P>Even after years of receiving notices to vacate and losing appeals, no one was prepared when officials finally showed up to evict.<P>Henry said Kahale called him at 8:00 a.m. and said officials and movers had arrived to move him out.  When Henry got there he found his brother frantically trying to save personal property and important legal papers such as tax returns that he was preparing for clients.<P>"DHHL people were all over his case for moving too slow,"  Henry says.  All of a sudden, Kahale just headed for the house.  Two or three minutes later it was on fire.<P>Sometimes people snap over something they could have handled a day or an hour later.  But Kahale had been handling his frustration for years.  In fact, says Henry, his brother had been released from the hospital only a few days earlier.  "Chest pain,"  says Henry.  "Stress."<P>The stress stemmed from something Kahale didn't believe was right.  He had been sold a defective house.  So had some of his neighbors.  DHHL sued the contractor, was awarded a settlement and agreed to fix the faulty homes.<P>"They told him they would fix his window, shower and the roof,"  Henry says, Kahale got an estimate for repairs that totaled $65,000.  He got another estimate for a new house.  That came to $46,000.  He wanted either a complete repair job or a new house.  Windows, showers and roof weren't satisfactory.<P>Henry says as the dispute went on, his brother kept paying a little on his mortgage.  A little wasn't enough.  That's why DHHL officials showed up last Thursday ready to evict.<P>Kahale knew he was fighting a lopsided battle.  Last summer, he told the Kaua'i Times his ship was sinking but he was determined to stay with it.<P>That's why it's not hard to link him to martyrs like the Buddhist monk who went up in flames in protest of the Vietnam War.  Kahale's private war erupted last Thursday morning.  He was out-numbered and overpowered.  Chaos reigned and no one would listen to him.<P>But, says Henry, his brother wasn't trying to be  a martyr.  He just snapped.<P>I wouldn't call Kahale a martyr either.  I'd call him an unsung hero, a man who represented hope to more native Hawaiians who have stood up despite overwhelming odds to fight for their rights.<P>The Reverend Kaleo Patterson had called for an end to Hawaiian Home evictions until DHHL can get its own house in order.  That's a sane piece of advice.<P>For years, DHHL has found excuses for playing by a duplicitous set of rules.  Challenge to those rules is met with force against homesteaders like Kahale, force that leads to retaliation and sometimes tragedy./<P>Sure Kahale snapped.  His house was falling apart.  He wanted to have something to leave one day to his wife and four children.  He'd been given a take it or lose it remedy by the department.  He'd lived under the threat of eviction for more than a decade.  And the stress was taking its toll.<P>Kali Watson, Hawaiian Homes Commission chair, has expressed shock and sympathy at the recent events surrounding Kahale's death.<P>Mayor Maryanne Kusaka announced her regret.  "I knew him as a good, mature, gentle individual, positively involved in community projects.  He was particularly proud of what he contributed to Anahola park."  She said in a press release, "It is a tragic end to Kahale's life". <P>Tragic unfair but in a very real sense a heroic statement that reflects the frustration of generations of homesteaders who, in their beliefs have never quite accepted the white man's rules.<P>Slowly, slowly the outlook for Hawaii's native people is brightened.  But for Kahale time ran out.<P><IMG SRC="hrcolor2.gif"><BR><A HREF="index.html"><IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="flagsm.gif" BORDER="0" HSPACE=4 VSPACE=4></A> Return to the <A HREF="index.html">Nation of Hawai`i Home Page</A>, the <A HREF="kahale.html">Kahale Smith Memorial Page</A> or the <A HREF="news.html">News Articles Index</A></BODY></HTML>

<CENTER>
<H1>Official Protest to the Treaty of Annexation</H1> 
<H2>Presented by Lili`uokalani in Washington D.C.</H2>
<STRONG>June 17, 1897</STRONG>
</CENTER>
<P>
 I, Liliuokalani of Hawaii, by the will of God named heir apparent on the tenth day of April, A.D. 1877, and by the grace of God Queen of the Hawaiian Islands on the seventeenth day of January, A.D. 1893, do hereby protest against the ratification of a certain treaty, which, so I am informed, has been signed at Washington by Messrs.  Hatch, Thurston, and Kinney, purporting to cede those Islands to the territory and dominion of the United States.  I declare such a treaty to be an act of wrong toward the native and part-native people of Hawaii, an invasion of the rights of the ruling chiefs, in violation of international rights both toward my people and toward friendly nations with whom they have made treaties, the perpetuation of the fraud whereby the  constitutional government was overthrown, and, finally, an act of gross injustice to me.        
<P>
Because the official protests made by me on the seventeenth day of January, 1893, to the so-called Provisional Government was signed by me, and received by said government with the assurance that the case was referred to the United States of America for arbitration.       
<P>
Because that protest and my communications to the United States Government immediately thereafter expressly declare that I yielded my  authority to the forces of the United States in order to avoid bloodshed, and because I recognized the futility of a conflict with so formidable a power.       
<P>
Because the <A HREF="cleveland.html">President of the United States</A>, the <A HREF="gresham.html">Secretary of State</A>, and an envoy commissioned by them reported in official documents that my government was unlawfully coerced by the forces, diplomatic and naval, of the United States; that I was at the date of their investigations the  constitutional ruler of my people.        
<P>
Because neither the above-named commission nor the government which sends it has ever received any such authority from the registered voters of Hawaii, but derives its assumed powers from the so-called committee of public safety, organized on or about the seventeenth day of January, 1893, said committee being composed largely of persons claiming American citizenship, and not one single Hawaiian was a member thereof, or in any way participated in the demonstration leading to its existence.        
<P>
Because my people, about forty thousand in number, have in no way been consulted by those, three thousand in number, who claim the right to destroy the independence of Hawaii.  My people constitute four-fifths of the legally qualified voters of Hawaii, and excluding those imported for the demands of labor, about the same proportion of the inhabitants.        
<P>
Because said treaty ignores, not only the  civic rights of my people, but, further, the hereditary property of their chiefs.  Of the 4,000,000 acres composing the territory said treaty offers to annex, 1,000,000 or 915,000 acres has in no way been heretofore recognized as other than the private property of the constitutional monarch, subject to a control in now way differing from other items of a private estate.
<P>
Because it is proposed by said treaty to confiscate said property, technically called the crown lands, those legally entitled thereto, either now or in succession, receiving no consideration whatever for estates, their title to which has been always undisputed, and which is legitimately in my name at this date.
<P>
Because said treaty ignores, not only all professions of perpetual amity and good faith made by the United Staets in former treaties with the sovereigns representing the Hawaiian people, but all treaties made by those sovereigns with other and friendly powers, and it is thereby in violation of international law.
<P>
Because, by treating with the parties claiming at this time the right to cede said territory of Hawaii, the Government of the United States receives such territory from the hands of those whom its own magistrates (legally elected by the people of the United States, and in office in 1893) pronounced fraudulently in power and unconstitutionally ruling Hawaii.
<P>
Therefore I, Liliuokalani of Hawaii, do hereby call upon the President of that nation, to whom alone I yielded my property and my authority, to withdraw said treaty (ceding said Islands) from further consideration.  I ask the honorable Senate of the United States to decline to ratify said treaty, and I implore the people of this great and good nation, from whom my ancestors learned the Christian religion, to sustain their representatives in such acts of justice and equity as may be in accord with the principles of their fathers, and to the Almighty Ruler of the universe, to him who judgeth righteously, I commit my cause.
<P>
Done at Washington, District of Columbia, United States of America, this seventeenth day of June, in the year eighteen hundred and ninety-seven.

<H1>MALAMA `AINA</H1>
<H2>Hawaiian Independence<BR> 
and a <BR>
 Sustainable Future</H2>
</CENTER>
The truth of humanity's relationship to our natural environment and planet home is at the root of the movement for Hawaiian independence.
<P>

One meaning of "<A HREF="sovereignty.html">sovereignty</A>" is control over land and natural resources: the land, the water in the land, the ocean (including a 200 mile Exclusive Economic Zone) and the air we breathe.  We know well that the indigenous approach to "managing" these "resources" is fundamentally different from the Western colonial approach, emphasizing balance, reciprocity and sustainability versus domination, exploitation and exhaustion.  
<P>

As stated in <A HREF="publawsum.html">U.S. Public Law 103-150</A>, the "Apology Resolution" to Native Hawaiians, "prior to the arrival of the first Europeans in 1778, the Native Hawaiian people lived in a highly organized, self-sufficient, subsistent social system based on communal land tenure" which supported a population estimated by some to have been as much as one million people, in the same range as the number who inhabit Hawaii today.
<P>

While we cannot and do not seek to return to 1778 and pre-contact Hawai'i, the traditional Kanaka Maoli (Native Hawaiian) values are still intact and as relevant as ever, and can still be applied as the basis of national policy today, and in the everyday lives of the people of the Nation, including fundamentally new and innovative approaches to land administration and land tenure.
<P>

At the heart of Hawaiian values is the concept of <STRONG>Malama 'Aina</STRONG>, to care for the land.  These words are very strong and present with Kanaka Maoli people who practice their values every day.  Many non-Hawaiians who have lived close to this precious land for a time have also come to deeply appreciate this way of being.  
<P>

Independence is more than just a political status.  In the same way that one might seek an independent home - off the grid, self-sufficient, and less vulnerable to the economic, political, and environmental turbulence of the surrounding world - Kanaka Maoli seek an independent homeland.  
<P>

Hawaii now imports more than three-quarters of its food, and over ninety percent of its energy.  This is dependence.  Being one of the most isolated land masses in the world with thousands of miles of ocean between us and the nearest continent, it is only common sense to move toward real independence.  
<P>

Hawaii has a major role to play as an international trading port and financial center, and will certainly participate actively in the global economy.  At the same time, we also realize the essential need for local self-reliance, local control of resources, and community based planning and economic development as part of the overall vision of a sustainable and bountiful future.  Political independence is one necessary step toward real economic and material independence, toward real sustainability and security.
<P>

As we ponder the transition to an alternative vision for Hawaii's future, the opportunities for a harmonic blend of the past and the future abound.  Hawai`i's traditional agriculture and aquaculture were some of the most advanced in the world, multiplying nature's productivity manifold in truly sustainable reciprocal systems.  The knowledge and use of these systems remains, and the movement to clear the fallow taro fields and restore the unused fishponds is growing daily.  
<P>

At the same time, innovative future technologies that make appropriate use of energy, resources and "waste" have a great potential in Hawaii.  The availability of such technologies is increasing, and the independent Nation of Hawai`i will seek to take full advantage of these, both for our own benefit here at home, and also as a model for the rest of the world.  
<P>

Hawaii is imagined around the globe as paradise, and millions of people from all nations visit here every year to share a bit of <A HREF="aloha.html">Aloha</A>.  The closer Hawai`i actually comes to being paradise - sustainable, bountiful, secure - the more that possibility will be shared with its multitude of visitors to be carried back into their visions of their own communities.
<P>

There is no place in the world like Hawai`i - no place that more needs to be truly independent, and no place that would more benefit the world by becoming so.
<P>

<P>
The attorney for sovereignty activist Dennis "Bumpy" Kanahele will not be allowed to claim that federal officials vindictively pursued his client as the trial for Kanahele proceeds.
<P>
Hayden Aluli, Kanahele's attorney, said he wanted to use "vindictive prosecution" as a defense theory during opening statements, which were to be presented this morning before Federal Judge Helen Gillmor.
<P>
But he said Gillmor ruled against the theory before jury selection, which took about seven hours yesterday from a jury pool expanded from about 60 to 98.
<P>
Federal officials have charged Kanahele, leader of the self-proclaimed Nation of Hawaii, with interfering with the serving of a warrant in January 1994.
<P>
Charges also include harboring federal fugitive Nathan Brown and impeding his arrest in March 1994.  Brown, wanted on tax evasion charges, remains at large.
<P>
Gordon Kaaihue also is on trial with Kanahele for allegedly interfering with the serving of a warrant in January 1994.
<P>
Kaaihue, free on $1,000 bail, wore a Nation of Hawaii t-shirt in the courtroom yesterday.
<P>
Kanahele, in custody without bail since his August arrest, wore a suit.  He had pursued release on bail, but the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld local rulings that he was a danger to the community and a flight risk.
<P>
Assistant U.S. Attorney Les Osborne said he planned to present six witnesses: U.S. Marshal Annette Kent, two deputy marshals and three police officers.
<P>
Aluli said he would call about 12 witnesses during the trial, expected to last 4 or 5 days.
<P>
The 14-member jury includes eight women and six men in what Aluli described as a "good cross section of the community."
<P>
He also said five jurors were dismissed because they had feelings about sovereignty.
<P>
Aluli said he had wanted to use "vindictive prosecution" as a defense in part because of the government's timing in Kanahele's arrest more than 18 months after the incidents.
<P>
He said Kanahele had embarked on an aggressive sovereignty awareness campaign in which the Nation of Hawaii issued "warrants" naming certain federal officials as criminals.
<P>
Osborne had cited the warrants in his arguments against granting bail for Kanahele.
<P>
Osborne also cited Kanahele's admission that the federal government lacks jurisdiction over him, Kanahele's criminal record, which includes threatening a police officer, and recent threats to federal officials.
<P>
Kanahele faces an 11-year prison term and up to $750,000 in fines if convicted on this three charges.

<P>

After deliberating a little more than one day, the jury in Dennis "Bumpy" Kanahele's federal trial yesterday indicated it can't reach a verdict on two of the three counts.
<P>
Judge Helen Gillmor said she would decide overnight whether she'll declare a mistrial or have the jury continue deliberating.  She will make an announcement today.
<P>
Kanahele, head of the self-<A HREF="proclamsum.html">proclaimed</A> Hawaiian group the Nation of Hawaii, is on trial for harboring federal fugitive Nathan Brown and thwarting two attempts to arrest Brown.
<P>
The jury began deliberations Friday afternoon and resumed mid-morning yesterday.  They sent two noted to the judge asking for clarification about the case.
<P>
At 3:10 p.m., the jury sent a another message to Gillmor saying, "We are at an impasse.  We have voted and are unable to come to an agreement as to a verdict on counts 2 and 3."
<P>
Gillmor called the attorneys before her, heard their arguments on what to do next and said she would announce her decision this morning.
<P>
Assistant U.S. Attorney Les Osborne said the jury has not been deliberating very long and urged Gillmor to instruct it to continue deliberations.
<P>
Kanahele's attorney, Hayden Aluli, said that would be improper.  He asked the judge to declare a mistrial on the two counts.
<P>
Osborne said the jury "really hasn't deliberated any time at all" - not enough time to go over almost three weeks of testimony.
<P>
Aluli said, "We don't want to coerce any juror into reaching or rushing to judgment."  The judge has the authority to declare a mistrial at this point and should accept the jury's note and do so, he said.
<P>
If a mistrial is declared, Kanahele could be retried on two counts.  The counts carry maximum penalties of three and five years in prison, although those maximum terms are rarely meted out under federal sentencing guidelines.
<P>
Aluli assumed the jury has reached a verdict on count 1 because it wasn't mentioned in the note to the judge.
<P>
That count, a misdemeanor, involves Kanahele and his head of security, Gordon Kaaihue, who are accused of blocking a police attempt to arrest Brown in January 1994.
<P>
But there was no indication yesterday if a verdict was reached on that count or what it might be.
<P>
Aluli says Kanahele is a victim of "selective, vindictive prosecution" by the federal government because of his prominent activism for Hawaiian independence.
<P>
Kanahele was chosen "head of state" by a council of elders for the nation, which claims at least 2,500 members and <A HREF="proclamsum.html">declared its independence</A> from the state and federal governments last year.
<P>
The federal government says this trial involves clear violations of federal laws and that Kanahele's political beliefs have nothing to do with the case.
<P>
Kanahele has been held without bail since he was secretly indicted and arrested Aug. 2.

<H2>Charges in Kanahele trial</H2>
Dennis "Bumpy" Kanahele is charged with:
<P>
 <LI> Knowingly and willfully obstructing, resisting or opposing" police officer Thomas Carreiro when he tried to arrest fugitive Nathan Brown, a convicted tax protester, on a bench warrant on Jan. 27, 1994, in Hauula.  Following a public hearing in Laie (at which Brown testified), police stopped the car Brown was in and tried to arrest him.  Kanahele and his supporters - who were in vans in front of and behind the Brown car - got out and stood by his car.  Police let them all go rather than force the issue.  Defense claims no attempt was made to arrest Brown, and Kanahele and his people offered no resistance or threats.  Gordon Kaaihue, head of security for the Nation of Hawaii, is a co-defendant only on this count, a misdemeanor.
<P>
 <LI> "Forcibly resisting, opposing, intimidating and interfering" with Deputy U.S. Marshal Lawrence Tice on March 16, 1994, when Time and another deputy marshal, Charles Markle, tried to arrest Brown at Kanahele's Waimanalo homestead house.  Tice and Markle had staked out the house and saw Brown and Kanahele drive up in a van.  Brown got out and ran onto Kanahele's property.  Kanahele blocked Tice from following him, but later allowed him onto the property.  Brown was gone by then.  Defense claims Kanahele was only protecting his property from strangers.  Prosecution says Kanahele deliberately delayed the marshals to allow Brown to escape.  This is a felony count.
<P>
 <LI> Harboring Brown "for the purpose of preventing his discovery and arrest" in the March 16 incident.  Also a felony.

<P>
U.S. District Court Judge Helen Gillmor yesterday upheld a ruling that Hawaiian activist Dennis "Bumpy" Kanahele be held without bail pending trial on charges of harboring a fugitive.
<P>
Gillmor ruled despite a personal promise from Kanahele, head of the self-proclaimed Nation of Hawaii, that he would appear for trial, tentatively set for Oct. 3.
<P>
U.S. Marshal Annette Kent said she's uncertain whether Kanahele will be transferred to a California facility or remain at the state's Halawa prison until then.
<P>
Most pretrial federal detainees are sent to California because of a lack of jail space here.  But there are routine exceptions, Kent said.  She added that Kanahele's trial is not far off, so it might not be worth sending him to the Mainland.
<P>
Kanahele told Gillmor, "I have no intention of running and hiding.
<P>
"Anything you want me to do for my release, you go my word that I will do it, so help me, God."
<P>
Gillmor, however, said she found a "sound factual and legal basis" for Friday's ruling by Magistrate Barry Kurren that Kanahele be held without bail because he is a "danger to the community" who would likely fail to show up for trial.
<P>
Kanahele was arrested Aug. 2 by federal agents at Honolulu Airport, on his way from Maui to Kauai.  He is charged with three counts involving two 1994 incidents in which he thwarted law enforcement officers seeking to arrest tax protester Nathan Brown.

<P>
The Independent Nation of Hawaii was at a crossroads six months ago when its members were forced from state-owned land at Makapuu Beach to higher ground in Waimanalo Valley.
<P>
Today, the people of Pu'uhonua o Waimanalo have turned the area at the end of Waikupanaha Street into a new beginning.  Their leader,  Pu'uhonua "Bumpy"  Kanahele, offered a glimpse at their world yesterday.
<P>
"I think what's most important is how families here have worked together (toward) the commitment of sovereignty and the commitment to all peoples of Hawaii of what we are trying to do,"  Kanahele said.
<P>
Nation of Hawaii members have carved out a home for themselves in the rough, hilly terrain, conquering the forest and brush.  Those who have witnessed the transformation -- with its emphasis on sovereignty, education, restoration of <A HREF="/nation/canoe/kalo.html">taro</A> patches and reclamation of stream waters -- say working at the 65-acre site is a reward in itself.
<P>
"Generally, when the Hawaiians make the news -- unless it's a cultural event -- it's on what's not working,"  said David Po, a Nation member since about 1990. 
<P>
The state-owned land, leased to the Nation, is now home to 22 small wooden houses, a few larger buildings and a handful of makeshift tent sites along the dirt road that begins where Waikupanaha Street ends.  Electricity and water are limited, and portable commodes are used in lieu of a sewage system.
<P>
Yesterday,  the campsite buzzed with activity as workers erected  a wooden house frame and a truck replaced the portable commodes.  A child played in a swing at a newly created playground -- a Christmas gift built by the community -- while turkeys and chickens gobbled and clucked in cages at the upper end of the road.
<P>
From that vantage point, members also have a clear view of Waimanalo and the ocean.
<P>
Po said the nation has plans for a self-sufficient village where all food and energy, as well as a cottage industry to earn money, will be produced right on the land.
<P>
And he expects things will only get better next year.
<P>
"It's working because of Ohana's own resourcefulness.  Self-determination is creating a success story for the Hawaiians,"  Po said.
<P>
"This is a peaceful process to restore the rights of the people.  We're going about it in a right way, in a way that makes sense.
<P>
The success has attracted two movie producers interested in taking the story to the big screen.  North Tower Films owners Steve Staples and Robert Watts expect to begin shooting within six months.
<P>
 "We think its a fantastic thing that's going on here,"  Staples said.  "What's happening here on a human level is very much the subject matter of the kinds of stories we want to produce in film."
<P>
Watts, who helped produce films such as the "Star Wars" and "Indiana Jones" trilogies, "Who Framed Roger Rabbit"  and "Alive," has been living with Nation members for three weeks.
<P>
"The producers, along with Honolulu resident Matthew Kresser, have contributed more than $100,000 to the Nation in supplies and donations," Kanahele said.
<P>
Kanahele said any movie based on the sovereignty movement will serve to promote the plight of native Hawaiians.  Also helping their cause is the group's Internet tie-in, through which millions of computer users learn about the movement.
<P>
"When you start to create something like this that's good, then you start to bring in people who are inquisitive about what's going on," Kanahele said.

"I want a record of what was going on when the court declared a mistrial."<P>U.S. District Judge Helen Gillmor yesterday had agreed to unseal the transcript of the marshal's testimony.<P>The government has accused Kanahele of harboring a fugitive and interfering with serving a warrant on the fugitive.  Gillmor rescheduled Kanahele's new trial to Jan. 23.<P>She declared a mistrial Oct. 31, in part because of concerns of possible jury tampering.  she had cited testimony she took in her chambers of a federal marshal, who said that a juror asked him if he had seen cases of jury tampering.<P>In the transcript, the marshal said:<P>"And he (the juror) asked me - I believe he asked if it was serious - was it a serious offense, and I said absolutely. As far as we're concerned, that and tampering with witnesses are tow very serious offenses in the judicial system, and it's dealt with very harshly.  And it was really kind of dropped after that.<P>The marshal also said that on that same day, a couple of people pointed at jurors as they ate in the cafeteria.<P>"I'm appalled at how the trial was terminated," Aluli said.<P>The juror who asked the question was the same one who may have violated jury instructions by seeking information from the federal law library.  Gillmor told jurors not to do their own research.<P>Aluli also said Gillmor should have included him and the prosecution when she took the marshal's testimony.<P>Aluli has alleged that Gillmor improperly declared a mistrial and that the court should dismiss the indictment against Kanahele because it can't retry the same defendant twice for the same charge.<P>Gillmor ended yesterday's hearing prematurely after Aluli asked several times to make his point orally in court.  She had told Aluli to put his concerns in writing.<P>Aluli said he will appeal if Gillmor denies his request to allow Aluli to interview jurors, saying such information was not relevant in deciding a motion to dismiss Kanahele's indictment.<P>She said she was concerned about picking a new jury if the public fears jurors will be pressured.  "The privacy interest of jurors is paramount," she added.<P></BODY><IMG SRC="hrcolor2.gif"><BR><A HREF="index.html"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="flagsm.gif" BORDER="0"></A>  Return to the <A HREF="index.html">Nation of Hawai`i Home Page</A>, the <A HREF="news.html">News Articles Index</A>, or the <A HREF="political_prisoner.html">Political Prosecution page</A><P></HTML>

<H2>Illinois Prof's legal opinions another basis</H2>

<P>
WAIMANALO - The Nation of Hawaii's claims to legitimacy rest largely on a 1993 congressional resolution and the legal opinions of an Illinois law professor.
<P>
<A HREF="publawsum.html">The resolution</A>, drafted by Sen. Daniel Akaka, apologizes for the U.S. role in the overthrow of Queen Lili`uokalani a century earlier.  The Senate and House approved it and President Clinton signed it in November 1993.
<P>
The measure is not simply an apology, says Dennis "Bumpy" Kanahele, the Nation of Hawaii's head of state.  "It was a confession to a crime."
<P>
And that admission, he says, invalidates everything that followed the overthrow, including U.S. annexation of Hawaii in 1898 and statehood in 1959.
<P>
Sen. Daniel Inouye, who helped win Senate approval for the measure, says: "It was not intended to suggest that the United States agreed there was a claim (for Hawaiian redress)."
<P>
But that idea was presented in a <A HREF="boylesum.html">December 1993 speech</A> given by <A HREF="boylebio.html">Francis Boyle, University of Illinois law professor</A>.  Boyle was invited to speak in Honolulu by the state's Hawaiian Sovereignty Advisory Commission, recommended by sovereignty advocate Dr. Kekuni Blaisdell, who had met him on the Mainland.
<P>
Boyle said that's when he met Kanahele, a commission member at the time.
<P>
Boyle had been to Hawaii before, to testify as an expert witness for Lance Cpl. Jeff Paterson, the Kaneohe Marine who refused to be sent to the Persian Gulf in 1990.
<P>
In the 1993 speech, he suggested Hawaiians could proclaim independence on their own, now that America had acknowledged the illegality of the overthrow.
<P>
Boyle said he has been a legal advisor to the Palestinians and represented Bosnia before the World Court, winning two cease-and-desist orders against Serb genocide.  "Unfortunately, no one's paying attention," he said.
<P>
A month after Boyle's speech, Kanahele's Ohana Council was <A HREF="proclamsum.html">proclaiming its independence</A> and began the process of building a nation, as prescribed by Boyle.
<P>
He advised the Ohana Council on what was needed to be an independent nation: distinct borders and people, a government and international recognition.
<P>
And he gave them advice as they drafted a <A HREF="constitution.html">constitution</A>, which was adopted last January, when the council proclaimed itself the Nation of Hawaii.
<P>
Kanahele said he's in almost daily telephone [e-mail] contact with Boyle.
<P>
Boyle said, "I want to make it clear that I'm not their attorney.  I do give them legal advice and counsel."  And all without payment.

From that time until his releaseon November 14, the Head of State of the Nation of Hawai'i (NOH) was heldwithout bail for three full months, and 12 days. This, despite the factthat on October 31, Judge Helen &quot;Hang 'em high&quot; Gillmor declareda hung jury and a mistrial in Mr. Kanahele's court case, wherein he wascharged with harboring a fugitive, Native Hawaiian tax protester NathanBrown, and obstructing justice in the attempted arrest of Mr. Brown. Mr.Kanahele reportedly could have faced up to 11 years in prison. <BR><BR>In other words, Mr. Kanahele was imprisoned, despite the fact that he hasnot been convicted of any crime as of late. This flies in the face of thetraditional American judicial standard that in the United States, one isconsidered innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt by a juryof one's peers. However, keeping a dark-skinned person who has not beenfound guilty of a crime behind bars is in keeping with another old Americantradition called slavery. And the plight of brown political prisoners, likeRobert Wilcox and Queen Lili'uokalani, is a century-old repressive traditionin Hawai'i. <BR><BR>The prosecution, of course, contended that Mr. Kanahele is Dennis the Menaceto society, and they pointed to previous convictions on other offenses asevidence that the Sovereignty activist is a threat to mom, apple, pie, andcivilization as we know it, not to mention the community-at-large. Mr. Kanaheleis the first to admit that he is an ex-con who, in his wayward youth, committedcriminal offenses that he was convicted of. <BR><BR>Although NOH contends that it pursues non-violent methods, somewhat similarto Ghandi and King, in its struggle for independence from the U.S.A., itdoes seem that the NOH poses a threat to the U.S.'s ruling class. <BR><BR>And that is the core of the matter. Dennis Kanahele appears to be a reformedex-con. Nobody in Waimanalo has to be afraid of Mr. Kanahele swiping theirvehicles or busting into their homes. But in another, very real sense, asfar as the federal/state powers-that-be are concerned, he is Dennis theMenace to society. <BR><BR>Mr. Kanahele has stated that during the 1987 Native land occupation at Makapuu,Oahu, he armed himself and that a shootout with SWAT team was narrowly avertedwhen he saw keikis and wahines in the line of fire. Mr. Kanahele droppedhis gun and surrendered. He was reportedly convicted of terroristic threatening,although he was released from prison early due to good behavior and wasnot subsequently charged with violating the conditions of his parole. <BR><BR>&quot;Bumpy&quot; Kanahele is a 300 lb. (well, before he lost so much weightin prison) unafraid brown man who is now armed with the UN charter, andU.S. Public Law 103-150, detailing the guilt and complicity of the U.S.in the illegal overthrow of an independent Hawai'i which the NOH is seekingto restore. <BR><BR>In the unstable era of widespread discontent in the U.S. (don't forget,the biggest unrest and worst domestic terrorism this century has taken placein just the last few years), as militias sprout up across the Continent,the authorities view the Nation of Hawai'i as another militia-like challengeto the federal and state government. <BR><BR>Indeed, at the August 4 hearing, Assistant U.S. Attorney Les &quot;Wizardof&quot; Osborne brought out a deputy &quot;dawg&quot; U.S. marshal's allegationsagainst NOH that it had links to the &quot;Independent Patriots&quot; groupand was stockpiling weapons at its Waimanalo site, setting the stage fora Waco or Ruby Ridge-style confrontation and siege. This was denied by NOH,and federal magistrate Barry Kurren said he wouldn't consider the unsubstantiatedcharges while considering Mr. Kanahele's bail (which was denied anyway).<BR><BR>If the Nation of Hawai'i is the 50th State's equivalent of a continentalmilitia, it is certainly a militia with a difference. NOH is certainly notcomposed of angry middle-aged white males, but of brown people who weredispossessed by illegal U.S. covert actions and military invasion that helpedmaintain an illegal white, elitist government in the aftermath of the 1893coup. Furthermore, while the Michigan militia, among other militias, hystericallyoppose the United Nations and its supposed goal of imposing &quot;one worldgovernment&quot; that would take away U.S. sovereignty, the NOH sees theU.N. as a source in the decolonization process that could help restore Hawaiiansovereignty. <BR><BR>The NOH's contention that the federal and state government has no authorityover it and other Hawaiians is a more legitimate claims with compared tothe Continental militias'. But similar to those militias, NOH has organizeda uniformed &quot;peace&quot; or &quot;security&quot; force. The state,in particular, is terrified that Hawaiian militancy, even the guerrillawarfare that was predicted in Kiana Davenport's novel, &quot;Shark Dialogues&quot;,would destroy the tourist industry. NOH's &quot;security&quot; force delivered&quot;warrants&quot; against politicians and judges (including MagistrateKurren), warning them that they would be held accountable for &quot;warcrimes&quot; and &quot;genocide&quot; against Kanaka Maoli. In this context,it is interesting to note that Mr. Kanahele's co-defendant (solely on themisdemeanor charge of interfering with federal authorities in their attemptto arrest Mr. Brown) is Gordon Kaaihue, who is head of NOH's uniformed &quot;peace&quot;force and played a personal rule in issuing the &quot;warrants.&quot; <BR><BR>During the trial, the defense fought back with one hand tied behind itsback by the feds. It's clear that these charges stemming from incidentsalmost two years old against someone publicly known who could have beenarrested innumerable times over the past many months are politically motivated.Lawyers Hayden Aluli and Syd Quintal were forbidden by Judge Gillmor frommaking courtroom arguments regarding sovereignty. Furthermore, Judge Gillmorconsistently sided with the offense when it objected to the defense, sustainingtheir objections and regularly overruling the defense's objections to theprosecution. <BR><BR>Upon his November 14 release, without having to pay bail, Mr. Kanahele isrequired to follow conditions set down by the state as a part of restrictinghis movements: In what apparently is a forced exile, Mr. Kanahele has tostay at the Miller Halfway House in Makiki, and is not allowed to set footon any site in Waimanalo as well as being forbidden to visit the NOH. <BR><BR>In conclusion, kanes and wahines of the court of public opinion: Not onlymust these restrictions against Dennis Kanahele be lifted, but all chargesagainst him must be officially dropped. Hayden Aluli's double jeopardy motionshould be upheld. If not, the defense should look into charges of persecutorialmisconduct, and overzealous and malicious prosecution, against &quot;Bumpy&quot;Kanahele's persecutors. Remember, &quot;If you don't convict, you must acquit.&quot;<BR><BR><IMG SRC="hrcolor2.gif" WIDTH="648" HEIGHT="11" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN=bottom><BR><A HREF="index.html"><IMG SRC="flagsm.gif" ALIGN=middle BORDER="0" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="19" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A>Return to the <A HREF="index.html">Nationof Hawai`i Home Page</A>, the <A HREF="news.html">News Articles Index</A>,or the <A HREF="political_prisoner.html">Political Prisoner page</A><BR><BR></BODY></HTML>

<H1>Supporters planning bail for 'Bumpy' before retrial</H1>

<H2>And his attorney also plans to file motions to acquit him of all charges</H2>

<P>
Supporters of Dennis "Bumpy" Kanahele plan to offer a substantial amount of money to get the leader of the self-<A HREF="proclamsum.html">proclaimed</A> Nation of Hawaii out on bail before his next trial Jan. 3.
<P>
Hayden Aluli, Kanahele's attorney, also said he would file motions to acquit Kanahele of his misdemeanor charge and to dismiss all charges following the mistrial declared Tuesday over his objections.
<P>
He said jurors told news reporters that they had acquitted Kanahele of interfering with the service of a warrant in January 1994.
<P>
Aluli also said the court should have pursued less drastic alternatives to a mistrial and that a second trial would create double jeopardy for Kanahele, in custody since his Aug. 2 arrest.
<P>
"The government has one and only one shot at getting a conviction," he said yesterday after the hearing to set a date for a new trial.
<P>
But Les Osborne, assistant U.S. attorney who prosecuted the case, said he would oppose Aluli's motions.
<P>
Osborne also said jurors never returned a verdict and that they frequently re-evaluate their position until they sign the verdict form and turn it into the court.
<P>
Two jurors said Tuesday that all the jurors had agreed to acquit Kanahele and Gordon Kaaihue of the misdemeanor charge. But they also said jurors were leaning toward convicting Kanahele of the federal charges of harboring a fugitive and interfering with deputy marshals trying to arrest him (sic).
<P>
U.S. District Judge Helen Gillmor Tuesday declared a mistrial, citing potential juror violations and the jury's likely impasse.
<P>
She said a juror had gone to the federal law library to seek information on the 4th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and that a juror had asked a deputy marshal about jury tampering.
<P>
Gillmor said she had ordered jurors not to do their own research and that the question about jury tampering put a cloud over the jury.
<P>
Aluli said Gillmor abused her discretion and that he would seek a judge from outside the district to rule on his motions.
<P>
"Gillmor is not the right judge to determine if she abused her discretion," he said. "Can any judge here be fair and unbaised?"
<P>
Osborne said no procedure exists to allow Aluli to seek a judge outside the district. He said Aluli can make a motion to disqualify Gillmor and she will rule on the motion.
<P>
He said that if she disqualifies herself, Aluli could go through the same process with other judges.
<P>
Sidney Quintal, Kaaihue's attorney, said he would also move to acquit his client of his misdemeanor charge.
<P>
He said he also was skeptical about the ability of federal judges to be objective in the case involving two native Hawaiian sovereignty activists. He said some judges felt threatened by "warrants" they received from the Nation of Hawaii, saying they may be guilty of crimes against the nation.
<P>
Aluli questioned the role of deputy marshals in the mistrial, saying it was inappropriate for the marshal to answer the juror who asked about jury tampering.
<P>
U.S. Marshal Anne Kent said the marshal answered the question because it was general. But she also said he reported it to her because he thought it was unusual. She said she in turn reported it to Gillmor, who interviewed the marshal.

It was just an instrument in probably gettingus all put together and I think that's going to happen,&quot; Kanahele said.<BR><BR>&quot;We have a foundation now, to start from.&quot; <BR><BR>Kanahele, wearing a purple T-shirt, blue jeans and blinding white runningshoes, walked out of federal court after posting a $50,00 signature bond.His family and supporters greeted him with leis and a Hawaiian takeout lunch.<BR><BR>Federal Judge David Ezra ruled Monday that Kanahele could stay at MillerHale halfway house on the slopes of Punchbowl while awaiting a second trialin January. He is charged with harboring convicted tax protester NathanBrown and allegedly thwarting two attempts to arrest Brown last year. <BR><BR>Kanahele was held without bail since his arrest Aug. 2. He stood trial onthe charges last month, but a mistrial was declared over the jury's deadlockand one juror's misconduct. <BR><BR>At Monday's hearing, Hawaiian leaders with opposing views on sovereigntysupported Kanahele's release, saying he is neither a danger to the communitynor a flight risk. <BR><BR>Office of Hawaiian Affairs Trustee Kinau'u Kamali'i and OHA staff memberLinda Delaney each lent Kanahele $1,000 to cover a month's worth of expensesat Miller Hale. Judge Ezra said yesterday he hopes a federally funded roomwill become available by them. <BR><BR>Under Ezra's ruling, Kanahele must stay nights at Miller Hale. <BR><BR>Kanahele is free to travel about Oahu during the day--but he will not beallowed to set foot in Waimanalo, where he has a family homestead and wheresupporters of the self-proclaimed Nation of Hawaii have established a settlement.<BR><BR>&quot;My heart's sore from not going back (to Waimanalo), but it's worthit,&quot; Kanahele said. &quot;Waimanalo is in my heart. It ain't ever goingaway.&quot; <BR><BR>When asked if he still rejects U.S. jurisdiction over his nation, Kanaheledeferred to his attorney, Hayden Aluli. <BR><BR>Aluli said his client reserves the right to challenge the federal court'sjurisdiction at any time, but will abide by Ezra's order that he returnto face trail in January. <BR><BR>&quot;I gotta,&quot; Kanahele agreed. &quot;I gotta.&quot; <BR><BR><IMG SRC="hrcolor2.gif" WIDTH="648" HEIGHT="11" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN=bottom><BR><A HREF="index.html"><IMG SRC="flagsm.gif" ALIGN=middle BORDER="0" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="19" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A>Return to the <A HREF="index.html">Nationof Hawai`i Home Page</A>, the <A HREF="news.html">News Articles Index</A>,or the <A HREF="political_prisoner.html">Political Prisoner page</A><BR><BR></BODY></HTML>

K.&quot;Kahale&quot; Smith blamed his &quot;broken down&quot; house for ruining hishealth, destroying his marriage.<P>Still, he loved his Anahola home and vowed to torch itrather than turn it back to the Department of Hawaiian HomeLands.<P>And during an eviction yesterday morning, Smith did justthat, burning to death in flames that engulfed the house. HawaiianHomes was trying to repossess the house, saying Smith wasdelinquent on lease payments.<P>&quot;It's a tragedy,&quot; said Kauai police Lt. Martin Curnan. &quot;Hewas burnt beyond recognition.&quot;<P>The house, the focus of an 18-year fight between Smithand Hawaiian Homes, was gutted. Only the metal roof and frameremain of the home that Smith claimed had been cursed by faultyworkmanship since he moved in.<P>The state attorney general has begun an investigation,said Kali Watson, chairman of the Hawaiian Homes Commission.He set a meeting today to debrief his department employees.<P>Curnan said Smith, 58, reportedly was cooperating withthe surprise eviction when he suddenly went back inside thehouse, where he apparently had earlier poured gasoline. Smithwas seen lighting a match about 9:50 a.m., Curnan said, and thewooden structure was quickly engulfed. &quot;He made no attempt toget out.&quot;<P>Police are unsure whether Smith intended to kill himselfor got caught in the blaze and couldn't escape.<P>Curnan said an autopsy may help answer that question.<P>But Smith's brother, Henry, who witnessed the eviction,said he doesn't think the fire was planned. &quot;He had too manydocuments that I know he wouldn't burn,&quot; said Henry Smith, whowas evicted by Hawaiian Homes last October after a similarhousing repair dispute. A valuable old coin and paper moneycollection also was in the house.<P>Henry Smith said his brother initially was &quot;in a joyousmood&quot; during the eviction, &quot;but there were too many bossestelling him to do this, do that. They were touching a lot of stuff he  <BR>didn't want them to, and it was getting him upset, depressing him.<P>&quot;I believe they drove him to that, to the point of noreturn.&quot;<P>Once the fire started, he said, he tried to reach hisbrother but was blocked by law enforcement officers.<P>&quot;If they hadn't blocked me, I know I could have gottenhim out. They didn't do anything, and nobody came up to me tosay so much as 'I'm sorry.' They had 20 guys there. Don't tell methey couldn't prevent this.&quot;<P>Ten sheriff's deputies joined Hawaiian Homes and theattorney general's office in serving the eviction papers.<P>Smith told deputies that he needed gasoline to start upand move his cars, said Gregg Takayama, spokesman for thestate Department of Public Safety.<P>&quot;They allowed him to get the gasoline to pour into thecars,&quot; Takayama said.<P>&quot;It happened very quickly. There wasn't much they coulddo once he set himself on fire.&quot;<P>Takayama said none of the deputies knew that Smith hadpreviously threatened to burn the house rather than turn it over.<P>Smith threatened to set the house afire when he wasinterviewed in June and October by a Star-Bulletin reporter, whotold Hawaiian Homes officials Chad Taniguchi and John Hirotaabout the threat.<P>Watson said he could not comment on whetherdepartment staffers were forewarned.<P>&quot;I don't know what was said or conveyed to departmentpersonnel. We are in the process of investigation to find out thecircumstances leading up to this tragic incident,&quot; Watson said.<P>Curnan said Kauai police were never told that Smithintended to burn his house. Police didn't respond until the call of a fire came in, he said.<P>Kauai attorney Ken Carlson, who represented Smith inhis last legal fight against Hawaiian Homes, knew of Smith'sthreat to burn his house but said he didn't go to Anaholayesterday because &quot;there have been so many false alarms that Ididn't think that this time it would be anything otherwise. Still, it <BR>doesn't really surprise me, because how many years has he beengoing through this frustration?&quot;<P>Kay Smith, married to Smith's second cousin, wasstunned to learn that the man who once baby-sat for her childrenhad perished in the flames. She found it difficult to believe hisdeath was planned. &quot;He's like the most congenial, wonderfulperson,&quot; she said. &quot;He's always been a real happy guy.&quot;<P>      Carlson said Smith called him about 8 a.m. yesterday andalerted him to the eviction. &quot;He sounded pretty up,&quot; Carlson said,certainly not like someone who planned &quot;to do himself in.&quot; Hesaid Smith was talking about moving his cars, &quot;like he was tryingsave his assets.&quot;<P>Henry Smith said his brother had been hospitalizedrepeatedly because &quot;of the stress he was going through with this,&quot;and was under the care of a cardiologist and psychiatrist.<P>&quot;His avenues were exhausted and I think he saw thatthere was nothing for him after this,&quot; Carlson said. &quot;He's madethis issue his life and now they've defeated him.&quot;<P>Hawaiian activist Harold Jim, who had aided Smith in hisfight for more than a decade, said he believes his frienddeliberately took his own life because he was &quot;disgusted, sick ofHawaiian Homes. They drove a man insane, to kill himself andburn himself. That's how they treat Hawaiians.&quot;<P>Jim said he believes some Hawaiian Homes officialswere waging a personal vendetta against Smith.<P>&quot;I'm very, very angry,&quot; Jim said. &quot;It was totallyunnecessary what the commission did to him. They just wantedto get rid of his ass. They cost him his wife, his job, his kids,everything.&quot;<P>Carlson said: &quot;He had no other avenue but to give his lifeso maybe somebody would review what DHHL has done.<P>&quot;Kahale has played the ace in the hole here.&quot;<P><HR><P>See related sidebar: <B><A HREF="kahale-anatomy.html">A step-by-step anatomy of a tragedy</A></B><P><IMG SRC="hrcolor2.gif"><BR><A HREF="index.html"><IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="flagsm.gif" BORDER="0" HSPACE=4 VSPACE=4></A> Return to the <A HREF="index.html">Nation of Hawai`i Home Page</A>, the <A HREF="kahale.html">Kahale Smith Memorial Page</A> or the <A HREF="news.html">News Articles Index</A></BODY></HTML>

As nearly everyone in Hawaii knows, the so-called "Trial of the Century" ended last week with a verdict of not guilty.  After nine months of testimony from 120 witnesses, 45,000 pages of transcripts and 1,100 exhibits, it's over and O.J. Simpson is a free man.  The announcement of the jury's verdict created such a media sensation that both the State Department and two members of President Clinton's cabinet chose to delay their news conferences rather than risk being drowned out by the close of the Simpson trial.
<P>
Though Bumpy Kanahele's trial will certainly gain less attention -- even in Hawaii, its impact on our lives here will be much more significant.
<P>
The O.J. Simpson trial was about whether a celebrity former football star was guilty of murder.  In a poll taken on the day of the verdict announcement, only 33 percent of Americans agreed with the jury's verdict of not guilty and 56 percent disagreed.  The most important thing about the poll was not its results --that most people thought O.J. was guilty -- but the nature of the question itself.  Everybody's major concern throughout the trial has been whether or not O.J. "did it."  Although the jury may have made its decision to make a political statement -- some are saying so -- the primary focus of the trial was on O.J.'s guilt or innocence.
<P>
Determining exactly what Mr. Kanahele's trial is about is a little more difficult.  He has been charged with impeding the arrest of a Native Hawaiian tax protester and has been held without bail ever since his arrest at on August 2.  Interestingly, a poll of Hawaiian voters conducted on the day of Kanahele's arrest did not ask whether he was guilty or innocent.  Instead, those polled were asked if they agreed with his brand of sovereignty.  Of the numerous viewpoints and editorials written on Kanahele since his arrest, most have focused not on his guilt or innocence but on his political views and merits as a leader.  In contrast, no polls were taken after Simpson's arrest asking people what they thought of his political views -- that would have been absurd.  In fact, despite the unprecedented coverage of O.J. Simpson's trial, very few Americans know anything about the former football star's politics.
<P>
Of course, the two cases are very different.  O.J. was charged with murder and Bumpy has been charged with harboring a tax protester.  In the American system both are innocent until proven guilty based on the evidence presented.  In the Simpson trial the media provided the public with enormously detailed information regarding the murders.  In Kanahele's situation Hawaii's people have been given few details relating to the alleged crime.  This would be only understandable if there wasn't any media coverage of the case at all.
<P>
What the whole affair really seems to be about is whether Bumpy Kanahele, as the head of the Nation of Hawaii, is a danger to the community.  U.S. Magistrate Barry Kurren cited exactly this concern as one of his reasons for denying Kanahele's request for bail.
<P>
This allegation, that Kanahele is a "danger to the community" bears some looking into -- especially since much of the media coverage and commentary on Kanahele has depicted him and the Nation of Hawaii as extremist.  Is Kanahele a dangerous extremist and, if so, to what community?

<P>
Under Bumpy Kanahele's leadership the Nation of Hawaii has declared the Hawaiian Archipelago to be independent of the United States. Such a move is certainly radical, but can it be labeled extremist?  The act of declaring national independence was at least as radical in 1776 as it is today, but does it necessarily follow that all efforts made to achieve independence are inherently extremist in nature?
<P>
There are currently a number of independence movements around the world that use tactics to further their cause which could be labeled extremist.  Do Bumpy Kanahele and the Nation of Hawaii fall into this category?
<P>
Last Wednesday marked the fourth month that Western tourists have been held hostage by a separatist group in the Kashmir region of India.  The rebel group, Al-Faran, is fighting India's rule of Kashmir.  The possibility of the tourists' release seems dim and one of them, a Norwegian, has already been beheaded.  More than 20,000 people have been killed since the rebellion began in 1990.  
<P>
The Nation of Hawaii under Bumpy's direction has also had controversial interaction with tourists  -- they gave them pamphlets on sovereignty.  Not only was this action obviously much less extreme than Al-Faran's, it is now seen by some as beneficial to tourism.  Although the action was criticized when it occurred, <A HREF="http://www.visit.hawaii.org/">HVB</A>'s new president, Paul Casey, reevaluated the action in the Star-Bulletin in August saying, "People look back to 1993 when leaflets were handed out on the beach.  And at the time, tourists were curious about sovereignty, they wanted to know more about it, they wanted to be educated.  So it really wasn't a negative."  Pamphleteering has been a tradition since before the United States declared its own independence and the Nation of Hawaii utilized the practice to good effect.
<P>
Even though Kanahele's most recent major action as the Nation of Hawaii's leader -- warning federal officials that they will be held responsible for their actions --  was certainly confrontational, it was still within the bounds of free-speech and nonviolent.
<P>
Most independence movements view violence as a necessary means for achieving their objectives.  In contrast, as the Nation of Hawaii's leader, Kanahele has repeatedly stated his commitment to a peaceful resolution to the sovereignty question.
<P>
For those of us who still wish to call ourselves citizens of the United States, the depiction of Kanahele as a dangerous extremist who needs to be jailed should be of serious concern.  Serious enough to be able to call it the way we see it, regardless of what our personal opinion of Kanahele or the Nation of Hawaii might be.
<P>
Here's the way I see it: Bumpy Kanahele is being selectively prosecuted for political reasons, period.  This is not the type of action I want my country to be taking.  As a strategy for "protecting" us from sovereignty, it's stupid; and as an exercise in justice, it's just plain wrong.

  Regardless of which, if any, sovereignty group one identifies with--the arrest of Bumpy Kanahele at Honolulu Airport, August 2, should make all Hawaiians uneasy. Feds charge in 1994 that Bumpy obstructed Hawaiian Nathan Brown's incarceration for tax protest. Also, on a State level, 'Ohana Council has been using sovereignty license plates, which has caused arrests. Meanwhile no arrests have been made after the overthrow of the Hawaiian Nation in 1893 which was acknowledged illegal by President Clinton's <A HREF="publawsum.html">apology</A> last year.
<P>
  In 1990 Nathan Brown and Raymond Kamaka were involved in a Federal tax protest. Kamaka's 'ohana 'aina (family land) in Waikane Valley was leased by the U.S. military for maneuvers with promises to clean it upon return to owner. Instead of cleaning up the land, the U.S. confiscated the land against the will of the legal owners.
<P>
  Frustrated at lack of alternatives in seeking justice--they did tax protest and were convicted; some like Kamaka served years in jail (political prisoners); Nathan Brown has been at large since his conviction. What kind of a system is this that confiscates land because it refuses to live up to its agreement (to restore land for use), forces the owner to become tax protester "grasping for straws" as a last alternative in seeking justice? The victim, Raymond Kamaka has served two years in federal prison on the mainland.
<P>
  As for harboring a tax evader, President Clinton--admitted and apologized for the long-outstanding theft of the Islands from the Hawaiian Kingdom. One Hawaiian in half-jest, tongue-in-cheek sent to the IRS his return, stating the U.S. government owed him $750,000. The IRS then sent him a check for three quarters of a million dollars! Now several of this Hawaiian's Japanese-American friends got a $20,000 from the U.S. for unlawful imprisonment during WW II. It could seem natural then that Hawaiians would be given something commensurate to the injury from the theft--loss of sovereignty, loss of language, loss of land base, and identity for over a century.  $750,000 would be fair considering the AJA settlement.
<P>
  To spend the money sent by the government is the American thing to do if ever there was one. Ah, but now they want the money back and have convicted the Hawaiian Nathan Brown of defrauding those who stole his Nation. Nathan was sentenced to 6-1/2 years. Bumpy is charged with obstructing Nathan's arrest.
<P>
  The Ohana Council Hawaiian Nation (there are several including Ka Lahui) has displayed a real necessary function in Hawai'i today working with some citizens unable to make it in society at large. Yet there are those who are disturbed that the 'Ohana Council is on the `aina at Waimanalo--building homes with homeless families, reestablishing ancient taro patches (that incidentally the FBI identified as fortified bunkers) and generally uplifting the lives of Waimanalo villagers.
<P>
  I suggest we all pull together and despite disagreements support Hawaiians using the magic of <A HREF="aloha.html">aloha</A>, hard work and our aina to improve lives of our people as is happening at Waimanalo Village.
<P>
  Everyone agrees that the resumption of <A HREF="nukeprotest.html">Nuclear Tests in South Pacific</A> is a bad thing for Hawai'i, the Pacific and world--yet the U.S. government with its super-muscle has executed no tangible pressure on the French to alter their plans. Is it because to the U.S. we are part of grand global plan--perhaps even a pawn in the Great Chess Game? To people who live in and love Hawai'i and Polynesia, we are the main event and the resumption of Nuclear Tests in the Pacific by anyone is an invasion of the homeland by reckless, autocratic, neo-imperialistic barbarians.
<P>
  Why is the U.S. government not following the lead shown by all Pacific Nations and Hawai'i in dissuading the French from this nuclear reckless endangering. This is the real issue--not the quasi-legal license plates and not even the specious charge of harboring a felon--(who really are the bad guys here?)

<H1>Professor Believes U.S. Apology Gives Hawaiians Right to Nationhood</H1>

<STRONG>Maui Press<BR>
January 14-20, 1994</STRONG>
<P>
</CENTER>
An International Law expert has told Native Hawaiian groups that the <A HREF="publawsum.html">apology for the overthrow</A> of Hawaii's last monarch and the subsequent annexation of the Hawaiian Islands by the U.S. government clears the way for the restoration of an independent Hawaiian nation.  
<P>
<A HREF="boylebio.html">Professor Francis A. Boyle</A> of the University of Illinois who is internationally recognized as a law expert and has served as advisor to Bosnia, Palestine and Latvia among foreign nations, was invited to Hawaii by the Governor's Sovereignty Advisory Commission to advise the Hawaiian people about their rights, and to explain the implications of the apology insofar as it applies to international law.  
<P>
In a speech to a gathering of Native groups at Mable Smyth Hall in Honolulu Dec. 28, Boyle declared:
<P>
"...now the United States government, after 100 years, has finally and officially conceded, as a matter of United States law, that Native Hawaiian people have the right restore the Independent Nation state that you had in 1893 when the United States government came and destroyed it. And also then that as a matter of international law the Native Hawaiian people have the right to go out now and certainly <A HREF="proclamsum.html">proclaim</A> the restoration of that State....this resolution clears up all these matters... You don't need to petition Congress to do it.  Congress has given you everything you need right here to do it, if that's what you want to do. And the United Nations Charter provides the rest of the authority to do it."  Boyle's interpretation has been welcomed by various Native associations formed in recent years, and these include the Ohana Council, the Ka Ohana '0 Kahikinui and Kauiki Council which have announced they will stage a "He Hawai'i Au" or Spiritual Solidarity March at <A HREF="palace.html">Iolani Palace</A> on Sunday, Jan. 16 when Boyle's findings will be explored further.
<P>
The Ohana Council, in particular, is seeking further exposure for Boyle's interpretations in the hope that more of Hawaii's people will become familiar with his findings and, according to Council member Kekula Bray of Maui "be fully informed of the truth regarding the political relationship between Hawaii and America."
<P>
Boyle also pointed out that as a result of the apology, the U.S. government concedes that "sovereignty resides in the people of Hawaii, and not in the Hawaii or federal governments."
<P>
He also told the Native groups that they are "free to determine your own fate pursuant to the principal of self-determination," while offering these other comments:
<P>
"Who's land is it? Well, from what Congress seems to be saying, it's the land of the Native Hawaiians. The Native Hawaiian people still have sovereignty... You can't trespass on your own land. The trespassers then become the state of Hawaii, and the land developers, and the golf courses, and the resorts. You are simply the Native Hawaiians asserting your rights under international law..... this reversal of positions, between who is the criminal and who is the victim, who is asserting their rights and who is violating their rights, has been effectively conceded by Congress."

Free Bumpy. Seriously. Free him. He's making everyone look like a bunch of big dummies.
<P>
He's not a flight risk. He's not a danger to the community. And, frankly, he's getting way too much publicity.
<P>
Holding Bumpy Kanahele without bail pending another trial is just silly. When you consider all the people who we let walk the streets who are really a danger to the community, holding Bumpy is ridiculous.
<P>
A state judge let a guy go free who was convicted of killing someone with a baseball bat. Maybe I'm old fashioned. But I think people who brutally kill people with baseball bats are a danger to the community.
<P>
Bumpy has never killed anyone with a baseball bat.
<P>
There was another guy recently arrested for killing his third woman. His third. He was convicted of killing two women. He's innocent until proven guilty of killing that third woman. But he killed two. There's no doubt about that. He was let out of jail after killing two women. Call me naive, but I would propose that he was a danger to the community. I would propose that after he killed his first human being, he should have been put in prison until he was so old that the key part of his wardrobe was a Depends diaper. After being convicted of killing his second human being, he should have been buried in a Depends diaper. Our system of justice decided he was not a danger to the community.
<P>
Bumpy never killed three women. He pointed a gun at a cop almost ten years ago. And he went to prison for it. 
<P>
Every day, police arrest people for murder, rape, robbery and assault and then "release them on their own recognizance pending further investigation."
<P>
They feel these people are not a danger to the community.
<P>
But, you say, it is the state court system or city and county police who find that people who repeatedly kill, rob and rape are not a danger to the community. Kanahele is in the <EM>federal</EM> justice system, where the game is completely different. The federal system is big-time. It is serious. In the federal system, all the government has to do is accuse you of being a danger and then you have to prove that you're not.
<P>
The trouble is, most people don't know the difference between state and federal justice. In their minds, and probably rightly so, there is either justice or there isn't. There is either fairness or there isn't. People are either a danger to the community, or they're not.
<P>
Justice, fairness and the concept of dangerousness shouldn't change simply because the suspect is being held in a building on the <EM>Ewa side</EM> of Punchbowl Street rather than the <EM>Diamond Head side</EM>.
<P>
It is expecting a little too much of the average person to pick up on such subtleties. What they see is one big system, not a bunch of different little ones with different rules.
<P>
What they see is a system wracked by inconsistencies. It is a system where male police officers can force a female suspect to strip and pose for naughty Polaroids right in the police station and then have the audacity to indict her for prostitution. (I'd say the community is in danger when the cops don't know the difference between booking and groping.)
<P>
It is a system where a convicted sex abuser can lie about his past and end up on a federal jury and nobody notices until the trial is over. And then, because the system screwed up by putting this joker on the jury, the defendant - in this case Bumpy - has to remain in prison awaiting a new trial.
<P>
It's time to free Bumpy and for the system to get it's act together. It Bumpy's case, they are simply making a martyr out of a molehill.
<P>
So far, the biggest danger to the community has been the system itself.

ANAHOLA-  IT WAS LIKE POURING SALT IN THE WOUND.   A SHORT TIME AFTER KAHALE SMITH DIED IN THE FIRE HE SET IN HIS ANAHOLA HOUSE, HAWAIIAN HOMES CHIEF KALI WATSON TOLD SMITH'S CHILDREN THEY COULD NOT SUCCEED TO THE LEASE BECAUSE IT HAD BEEN LEGALLY CANCELED.  THERE WAS NO LEASES TO SUCCEED TO.
<P>
AND NOW AN INVESTIGATOR'S REPORT GIVES THE CHILDREN REASON TO BELIEVE THEIR FATHERS DEATH COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED IF THE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS HAD DONE THEIR JOB BETTER.
<P>
EVEN THOUGH SECTION 215, PARAGRAPH 3, OF THE HAWAII REVISED STATUTES SPECIFICALLY SAYS THAT IN THE CASE OF A CANCELED LEASE THE DEPARTMENT OF HAWAIIAN HOME LANDS HAS THE OPTION OF OFFERING THE LEASE TO THE PROSPECTIVE SUCCESSORS, FOR WHATEVER REASON IT REFUSED TO TAKE THAT OPTION.
<P>
AND BECAUSE HILBERT KAHALE SMITH'S CHILDREN ARE ONLY 44-PERCENT HAWAIIAN, THERE IS NO WAY OTHER THAN SUCCESSORSHIP TO BECOME HAWAIIAN HOMES LESSEES ON THEIR OWN.
<P>
THAT WAS THE LATEST IN A SERIES OF BLOWS THE AGENCY HAS DEALT THE SMITH'S BEGINNING WITH A BADLY BUILT HOUSE AND CULMINATING IN SMITH'S DEATH ON JAN. 18 AT THE AGE OF 58.
<P>
BUNNIE SMITH, MONA ROJAS, AND THEIR BROTHERS, HILBERT, JR. AND ERNEST, ONCE LIVED IN THAT HOUSE, WITH ITS DOORS THAT WOULDN'T CLOSE, ITS ELECTRIC SHORTS, RUSTING WINDOW FRAMES, SAGGING FLOORS, LEAKY ROOF, AND ASSORTED OTHER DEFECTS.
<P>
THE HOUSE WAS BAD ENOUGH.  THEIR FATHERS' BATTLE FOR JUSTICE WAS SOMETHING ELSE: 18 YEARS  OF HOPE, REJECTION, LETTER WRITING, NEGOTIATIONS, COMMUNITY ORGANIZING, POLITICAL ACTION, MEDIA PUBLICITY, LAWSUITS, AND BUREAUCRATIC INEPTITUDE AND THREATS, CULMINATING IN DEATH WHEN HE SET HIMSELF AND THE HOME FROM WHICH HE WAS BEING EVICTED ON FIRE.
<P>
NOW HAWAIIAN HOMES, WHICH APPEARS TO DRAW ON A BOTTOMLESS WELL OF CALLOUSNESS, SEEMS TO BE CELEBRATING  ITS PYRETIC VICTORY OVER KAHALE SMITH BY DENYING HIS CHILDREN THE RIGHT TO SUCCEED TO HIS LEASE.
<P>
<H3>BLACK THURSDAY: </H3>

YET NONE OF THIS CAN COMPARE TO WHAT THE TWO DAUGHTERS EXPERIENCED THAT THURSDAY IN JANUARY.  THEIR GRIEF ABIDES BUT HAS DULLED SOMEWHAT.  THEIR RECEIPT OF A SPECIAL INVESTIGATOR'S REPORT ON WHAT HAPPENED THAT DAY, HOWEVER SHARPENED THEIR ANGER.
<P>
DONALD K. L. WONG WAS THE STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S SPECIAL INVESTIGATOR, SENT TO THE HOUSE ON THE DAY OF SMITH'S EVICTION TO HELP THE DHHL "BY PROVIDING INVESTIGATIVE ASSISTANCE, SHOULD IT BE REQUIRED."
<P>
THE REPORT DOESN'T REALLY MENTION WHO WAS ACTUALLY IN CHARGE ON THE DAY THAT THE DEPUTY SHERIFFS ARRIVED AND KNOCKED ON SMITH'S DOOR, ROJAS SAID.  " WE FEEL WE SHOULD KNOW WHO  WAS SUPPOSED  TO BE IN CONTROL  OF THIS AND WHO WAS SUPPOSED TO BE  KEEPING TRACK OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING".
<P>
TWELVE SHERIFFS AND FOUR DHHL OFFICIALS WERE AT THE SCENE.  SO HOW WAS IT THAT SMITH WAS ABLE TO WALK INTO THE HOUSE CARRYING A BRIGHT-PINK GASOLINE CAN-LABELED "GAS", BUNNIE SMITH SAID-RIGHT PASSED ONE OF THE DEPUTY SHERIFFS WHO WAS SUPPOSED TO  "SECURE THE DWELLING"?.
<P>
"WE FEEL  HIS DEATH COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED", SMITH SAID.  AS FAR BACK AS JULY 1995, WHEN HE WAS EXPECTING EVICTION ANY DAY, MONA SAID, SMITH TOLD A NEWSPAPER REPORTER THAT HE WOULD BURN THE HOUSE DOWN BEFORE HE WOULD GIVE IT UP.  SHE SAID HE REPEATED THAT THREAT LATER THAT YEAR TO THE SAME REPORTER.
<P>
THE JOURNALIST WAS VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE THREAT AND IN NOVEMBER REPORTED IT TO DHHL OFFICIAL JOHN HIROTA AND THE AGENCY'S KAUAI'S HEAD CHAD TANIGUCHI, AND WAS TOLD THEY'D TAKE IT INTO CONSIDERATION, MONA SAID.
<P>
<H3>THE EVICTION:</H3>

HIROTA WAS AT THE EVICTION ON JAN. 18. TANIGUCHI MISSED IT.
<P>
IT WAS A SURPRISE EVICTION.  THERE WAS NO NOTICE OF THE DAY AND TIME IT WOULD OCCUR.  SHERIFF'S JUST SHOWED UP AT 8 A.M. THURSDAY MORNING AND TOLD SMITH TO GET ALL HIS BELONGINGS PACKED AND LEAVE.
<P>
AS THE REPORT STATES, SMITH MADE SOME CALLS TO FRIENDS, INCLUDING A NEIGHBOR WHO GAVE HIM PERMISSION TO PARK SOME CARS ON HIS  PROPERTY. HIS BROTHER, HENRY, CAME OVER TO HELP HIM MOVE THE CARS.  MOST OF THEM NEEDED PRIMING WITH GASOLINE, WHICH KAHALE POURED IN TO THE CARBURETORS.  
<P>
HAWAIIAN HOMES HAD CONTRACTED WITH KAUAI FREIGHT COMPANY TO PACK, MOVE AND STORE SMITH'S POSSESSIONS.  THE REPORT SAYS THE COMPANY  TRUCK ARRIVED AT ABOUT 9 A.M.
<P>
MONA ESTIMATES IT WAS  AROUND 9 A.M. WHEN HER FATHER CALLED HER AND ASKED TO STORE SOME BELONGINGS AT HER HOUSE IN ANAHOLA.
"I TOLD HIM TO GO AHEAD, AND THAT  I'D COME AND HELP HIM AFTER I GOT OFF WORK", SHE SAID.  "HE DIDN'T GIVE ANY INDICATION THAT HE WAS GOING TO  DO ANYTHING BUT MOVE OUT,  AND HE SAID I DIDN'T HAVE TO COME OUT THERE."
<P>
THE REPORT SUBSTANTIATES MONA'S IMPRESSION.  "DURING  THE ENTIRE OPERATION, MR. SMITH APPEARED CALM.  MR. SMITH DID NOT ARGUE AND IN FACT WAS HELPING TO FACILITATE THE MOVE .  THERE WAS NO INDICATION...THAT MR. SMITH WOULD TAKE THE ACTIONS THAT HE FINALLY DID".
<P>
"SOMETHING'S WRONG IN ANAHOLA":  A HALF HOUR LATER, MONA BEGAN GETTING CALLS FROM FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS IN ANAHOLA, WHO TOLD HER THAT KAHALE'S HOUSE WAS BURNING AND THAT " SOMETHING MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED TO MY DAD, I SAID NO WAY, I JUST TALKED TO HIM A FEW MINUTES AGO. " I DIDN'T WANT TO BELIEVE IT."  AND SO SHE REMAINED AT WORK, WORRIED AND NOT REALLY SURE WHAT WAS GOING ON.
<P>
BUT IT WAS  TRUE.  SMITH HAD MADE  GOOD  ON HIS THREATS TO BURN THE HOUSE DOWN RATHER THAN TURN IT OVER TO HAWAIIAN HOMES.
<P>
ACCORDING TO THE STATEMENT  OF DEPUTY SHERIFF AUDREY  DOLD, WHO WAS ASSIGNED TO GUARD THE REAR DOOR OF THE HOUSE,  SHE SMELLED SMOKE AT ABOUT 9:50 A.M. ( MONA IS QUITE CERTAIN SHE GOT THE FIRST CALL ABOUT THE FIRE ABOUT 9:30 A.M.)
<P>
DOLD SAID  SHE HAD  HER BACK TO THE HOUSE AT THE TIME AND TURNED TO LOOK  INSIDE.  SHE SAW SMITH IN THE KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM AND CALLED OUT TO HIM TO OPEN THE DOOR .  BUT SMITH NEVER RESPONDED.
<P>
MEANWHILE,  BUNNIE SMITH WAS ON HER USUAL MAIL DELIVERY  ROUTE FOR THE KAPAA POST OFFICE.  HER UNCLE'S STEP DAUGHTER TRACKED BUNNIE DOWN  AND TOLD HER THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG IN ANAHOLA AND TO GET OUT THERE FAST.  BUNNIE HAD TO RETURN THE  MAIL TRUCK TO THE POST OFFICE.   
<P>
KAHALE HAD ALSO TOLD HER HE WOULD BURN THE HOUSE DOWN, SHE SAID, " BUT I NEVER BELIEVED IT UNTIL I GOT BACK TO THE POST OFFICE AND THE COP TOLD ME THAT THE HOUSE ON FIRE AND THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO SAVE MY DAD".  
<P>
BUNNIE CALLED  MONA, AND THE COP DROVE BUNNIE OUT TO ANAHOLA.
"AND THAT'S WHERE I SAW THE CHAOS."  THE FIRE WAS OUT BY THE TIME SHE ARRIVED.  MONA LEFT WORK IMMEDIATELY, BUT TRAFFIC DELAYED HER ARRIVAL UNTIL ABOUT 10:45.
<P>
ON THE SCENE:  WHEN BUNNIE ARRIVED , SHE SAW THE BLACKENED REMAINS OF THE HOUSE, STILL SMOKING, SMELLED THE CHARRED WOOD, AND NOTICED SHERIFF'S AND THE FOUR HAWAIIAN HOMES OFFICIALS STANDING TOGETHER BENEATH A PLUMERIA TREE, WATCHING THE HOUSE.
<P>
THEY DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING TO ME AS I WALKED BY THEM.  I WALKED REALLY CLOSE TO THEM, AND THEY DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.
<P>
STEVEN GIRALD OF KAUAI FREIGHT WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO TALKED TO HER. SHE SAID, "HE CAME UP TO ME AND TRIED TO EXPLAIN WHAT HAPPENED BEFORE THE FIRE.  HE WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO CONVEYED HIS CONDOLENCES.  HE SAID IF WE  NEEDED ANY HELP TO LET HIM KNOW."
<P>
GIRALD INDEED SEEMED  TO TAKE ON THE RESPONSIBILITY THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN THAT OF A HAWAIIAN HOMES REPRESENTATIVE.
<P>
"WHEN I FIRST GOT THERE". SAID BUNNIE" HE WAS THE ONE WHO TOOK ME BY THE HAND AND WALKED ME AROUND THE HOUSE AND TRIED TO EXPLAIN WHAT HAPPENED.  AND AS I WENT UP TO THE KITCHEN DOOR  WHERE DAD'S BODY WAS"-HERE SHE PAUSES, TAKES A BREATH-"THE LAST MEMORY I HAVE OF MY DAD WAS SMELLING HIS BURNT FLESH.  IT'S THE LAST THING I CAN REMEMBER OF HIM.
<P>
"STEVEN TOLD  ME , YOUR DAD IS HERE", " I ASKED, CAN I SEE HIM"?
HE TOLD ME , "NO IT'S BEST YOU REMEMBER HIM AS HE WAS".  "KPD DETECTIVE PAUL KANOHO ADVISED THE SAME". SHE SAID.
<P>
KANOHO WAS THE ONLY OFFICIAL BEHAVING PROFESSIONALLY, THE SISTERS AGREED.  NO OTHER GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL SEEMED TO "GIVE A DAMN."
OFFICIAL CALLOUSNESS:   MONA SAID SHE HAD TO SEEK OUT THE HAWAIIAN HOMES OFFICIALS.  "THEY DID NOT INTRODUCE THEMSELVES TO ME.  THEY DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING; THEY JUST STOOD THERE.  SO I HAD TO PROMPT THEM TO SAY SOMETHING, AND THE ONLY THING THAT POPPED INTO MY MIND WAS, "O.K., NOW WHAT"? WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO NOW?".
<P>
"THEY KIND OF GOT TOGETHER IN A LITTLE HUDDLE, AND THEN I THINK IT WAS JOHN PEIPER WHO TOLD ME, "YOU NEED TO GET YOUR FATHER'S THINGS OFF THE PROPERTY BY THE END OF THE DAY".  
<P>
MAYBE THE OFFICIALS WERE IN SHOCK?  WHAT WERE THE LOOKS ON THEIR FACES?  THEY KNEW A MAN HAD JUST DIED, AND HIS CHILDREN WERE FACING THEM. 
<P>
"IT WAS LIKE A BIG BOTHER TO THEM."  MONA SAID.
<P>
"YES THEY KNEW A MAN HAD JUST DIED, "BUNNIE SAID, "BUT I FEEL THEY HAD A PERSONAL VENDETTA AGAINST MY DAD BECAUSE HE WAS TOO VOCAL."  WHEN I LOOKED AT DONALD WONG, HE HAD THIS LOOK ON HIS FACE- IT WAS LIKE A GIRL, LIKE A SNOB. HE TURNED AWAY."
<P>
THE  LOOKS  AND BODY LANGUAGE OF THE HAWAIIAN HOMES OFFICIALS MADE INDELIBLE IMPRESSION ON THE DAUGHTERS, ESPECIALLY IN CONTRAST TO GIRALD'S.  "STEVEN'S EYES WERE IN TEARS,"  BUNNIE SAID,
KANOHO REACTED THE SAME WAY, THEY SAID.  AND THE ANAHOLA COMMUNITY MEMBERS WHO GATHERED WERE DEFINITELY IN SHOCK, MONA SAID.
<P>
THE HAWAIIAN HOMES OFFICIALS PRESENTED A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT REACTION.  "THESE GUYS WALKED AROUND WITH THEIR TAILS IN THE AIR AND THEIR HEADS HIGH, YOU KNOW AS IF NOTHING HAPPENED," BUNNIE SAID.
<P>
"THEY STILL HAD TO GET THE JOB DONE AND GET ALL HIS STUFF OFF THE PROPERTY,"  MONA SAID, LAUGHING IN DISBELIEF.
<P>
"THAT  WAS THE ONLY THING THEY WANTED ACCOMPLISHED, "BUNNIE ADDED.  "AND MIND YOU DAD'S BODY WAS STILL IN THE HOUSE.  THE MORTUARY HADN'T EVEN ARRIVED YET.  AND THEY DIDN'T CARE.  THEY JUST TOLD US  THEY WANT HIS THINGS OFF THE PROPERTY."
<P>
THE SISTERS SEE THAT REACTION AS SCARCELY HUMAN.
<P>
THIS IS WHEN BUNNIE WALKED UP TO HER SISTER  AND  BEGAN WEEPING.
<P>
<H3>DUMBFOUNDED:</H3>

  GIRALD OVERHEARD THIS EXCHANGE, THEY SAID.
"STEVEN WAS DUMBFOUNDED," BUNNIE SAID," HE PULLED THE HAWAIIAN HOMES PEOPLE OFF TO THE SIDE AND TOLD THEM, "LOOK THE FATHER JUST DIED!  YOU'RE  TELLING THEM TO GET THESE THINGS OFF THE PROPERTY, AND HE'S STILL IN THE HOUSE!  AT LEAST HAVE SOME HEART."
<P>
GIRALD WANTED THE OFFICIALS TO GIVE THE FAMILY AT LEAST THE WEEKEND TO CLEAR KAHALE'S BELONGINGS OUT, MONA SAID, AND HE WANTED TO COME BACK AND HELP THEM.
<P>
THEY TOLD HIM, "NO, WE'RE ONLY PAYING FOR TODAY.  IF YOU'RE GOING TO COME BACK WE'RE NOT PAYING YOU,"  MONA SAID.
<P>
AND STILL THEY WANTED THE BELONGINGS OFF THE PROPERTY BY FRIDAY, THE NEXT DAY.  "THAT'S WHAT STEVEN TOLD US."  GIRALD ALSO SAID THAT HE WOULD BE ABLE  TO HELP THEM MOVE ONLY ON THURSDAY, SHE SAID.
<P>
"AND YOU KNOW HOW SWEET HE WAS?" BUNNIE SAID, "HE PUT EVERYTHING ON HOLD THAT WEEKEND IN CASE WE HAD ANY QUESTIONS FOR HIM.  HE WAS THE ONLY ONE.  AND THEY ALSO WANTED HIM TO BUST DOWN THE HOUSE, AND HE SAID NO, HE WOULDN'T TOUCH IT WITH A TEN FOOT POLE."
<P>
<H3>IT LOOKED LIKE HIM:</H3>

MONA'S REACTION WAS A LITTLE DIFFERENT FROM HER SISTER'S.  "I WANTED TO FORGET WHAT WAS GOING ON. BASICALLY,
I JUST WATCHED, AND I DIDN'T SPEAK.  I DIDN'T WANT TO THINK ABOUT WHAT I WAS GOING TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH LATER ON."
<P>
DESPITE BEING TOLD  TO GET RID OF THEIR FATHER'S THINGS,  MONA SAID , THE SISTERS WERE UNABLE TO ACT IMMEDIATELY BECAUSE POLICE HAD TAPED OFF THE PROPERTY AND WOULDN'T LET THEM TAKE ANYTHING. 
<P>
ONE OFFICER CALLED THE MORTUARY, AND KANOHO "KEPT TELLING US 
TO LEAVE SO WE WOULDN'T GO INTO HYSTERICS WHEN THE BODY WAS BROUGHT OUT."  BUNNIE HAD TO LEAVE TO PICK UP HER CHILDREN AT SCHOOL, BUT MONA WAS THERE WHEN KAHALE'S BODY WAS CARRIED OUT AROUND 1:30 OR 2:00 P.M.  "THEY WERE TRYING TO ESCORT ME AWAY 
AND I HAD TO SAY,  'LOOK,  I'M NOT GOING TO GO CRAZY ON YOU GUYS, JUST LET ME SEE MY DAD FOR THE LAST TIME.'"
<P>
THE WORKERS HAD TO REMOVE A SINK AND CABINET AND A PORTION OF FALLEN ROOF TO GET TO SMITH'S BODY,  WHICH THEY CARRIED OUT IN A BODY BAG.  "IT  WAS KIND OF WEIRD BECAUSE I  COULD STILL SEE THE OUTLINE OF HIS BODY," MONA SAID.
<P>
"MY DAD WAS A BIG MAN, AND IT LOOKED LIKE HIM, LYING DOWN.  THEY KEPT TELLING ME HE WAS BURNT BEYOND RECOGNITION AND WE SHOULDN'T SEE HIM BECAUSE IT'S NOT A PRETTY SIGHT.  BUT THE WAY THE BAG WAS AND HOW THEY CARRIED HIM OUT AND ROLLED HIM AWAY
IT LOOKED LIKE HIM, THE OUTLINE OF HIS BODY.  THAT'S WHEN I STARTED CRYING, FINALLY."  THE HAWAIIAN HOMES OFFICIALS KEPT WATCHING.
<P>
<H3>CRIMINAL CHARGES?</H3>

<P>
AND THAT'S WHEN THE POLICE ALLOWED THE FAMILY TO BEGIN REMOVING THEIR FATHER'S BELONGINGS.  "THAT SAME DAY WE SCRAMBLED TO GET THINGS OFF THE PROPERTY," MONA SAID. "I JUST CONCENTRATED ON THAT. I KEPT A NARROW MIND ABOUT EVERYTHING."
<P>
MANY OF KAHALE'S PAPERS FROM HIS LONG BATTLE WITH HAWAIIAN HOMES MADE IT THROUGH THE FIRE.  "THE BOXES FELL THROUGH THE FLOOR," MONA LAUGHED, SOMETHING THAT MIGHT NOT HAVE HAPPENED WITH A BETTER-BUILT HOUSE.
<P>
SOMETIME AFTER THEY TOLD THE SISTERS TO CLEAR THEIR FATHER'S THINGS OFF THE PROPERTY, THE OFFICIALS DISAPPEARED FROM SIGHT FOR A WHILE, MONA SAID. THE SISTERS WERE HOLDING  ONE ANOTHER, AND WHEN THEY LOOKED UP, THE HAWAIIAN HOMES OFFICIALS WERE GONE.
<P>
"SOMEBODY SAID THAT THEY WENT  BACK TO THE OFFICE TO CONTACT HONOLULU ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED," MONA SAID,  AND MAYBE CONSIDER 
CRIMINAL CHARGES.  "THAT WAS THEIR HOUSE, AND DAD DESTROYED IT."
<P>
INDEED, WONG'S REPORT NOTES THAT THE KPD "INITIATED AN INVESTIGATION INTO ALLEGATIONS OF CRIMINAL PROPERTY DAMAGE IN THE FIRST DEGREE," AND THAT THE CASE HAD BEEN REFERRED TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S  CRIMINAL JUSTICE DIVISION  "FOR FINAL DISPOSITION."
<P>
<H3>QUESTIONS RAISED:</H3>

<P>
THE QUESTION OF WHO WAS SUPPOSED TO BE IN CHARGE  OF THE EVICTION OPERATION LOOMS IN THE CHILDREN'S MINDS.  "ISN'T THERE SUPPOSED TO BE A STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE FOR SUCH A SITUATION?" ASKED A RELATIVE.  "CLEARLY THERE WAS NONE WHEN I WAS THERE."  
<P>
SINCE THAT DAY MONA HAS COMPLIED A THICK BINDER PACKED WITH DOCUMENTS AND LETTERS SHE'S EXCHANGED WITH HAWAIIAN HOMES HEAD KALI WATSON AND OTHER AGENCY OFFICIALS. SHE SAID SHE'S ASKED WHY THERE WAS NO INSURANCE ON THE HOUSE, WHICH SHE UNDERSTANDS THE DEPARTMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR.  HER FATHER HAD BEEN LIVING IN THE HOUSE WITHOUT INSURANCE SINCE 1986.  HE HAD TOLD HIS DAUGHTERS IT WAS UNINSURABLE BECAUSE OF ELECTRICAL  PROBLEMS.
<P>
MONA ALSO WROTE WATSON IN MARCH TO ASK ABOUT SUCCESSORSHIP.  WATSON REPLIED THAT THERE WAS NO LEASE TO SUCCEED TO.  SHE WROTE AGAIN AND ASKED ABOUT SECTION 215, WHICH ALLOWS THE DEPARTMENT TO OFFER A CANCELED LEASE  TO THE SUCCESSORS.  SHE SAID WATSON REPLIED WITH THE SAME ANSWER AS BEFORE, WITH NO EXPLANATION OF SECTION 215.
<P>
THE SISTERS AREN'T EVEN SURE WHO  MADE THE DECISION TO REFUSE SUCCESSORSHIP - WATSON ALONE, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL, THE HAWAIIAN HOMES COMMISSION, OR THE DEPARTMENT.
<P>
NO ONE IN THE DEPARTMENT HAS CALLED OR WRITTEN TO OFFER CONDOLENCES, THEY SAID.  ALTHOUGH LAST MONTH,  MONA SAID , A DEPARTMENT SECRETARY CALLED TO FIND OUT IF THE REMOVED ALL OF THEIR FATHER'S BELONGINGS FROM THE PROPERTY.  THE SECRETARY TOLD HER IT WAS A "COURTESY CALL," BEFORE THE DEPARTMENT SENT IN BULLDOZERS TO DEMOLISH THE BURNED HULK OF THE HOUSE.
<P>
THE CHILDREN ARE LOOKING FOR A LAWYER TO ADVISE THEM ON WHAT THEY CAN OR SHOULD DO.  "BUT WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO GET ONE,"
MONA SAID.
<P>
<H3>KAHALE'S CHARACTER:</H3>

   OTHER ANAHOLA RESIDENTS SETTLED WITH HAWAIIAN HOMES OVER THE DEFECTS IN 60-PLUS HOUSES.  THEY ACCEPTED PAYMENTS AND SIGNED WAIVERS PROMISING NOT TO HOLD THE DEPARTMENT RESPONSIBLE.  "MY DAD DIDN'T THINK THE WAIVER WAS RIGHT," MONA SAID. "IF SOMETHING ELSE TURNED UP WRONG THERE WAS NO PROMISE IT WOULD EVER HAVE BEEN FIXED CORRECTLY."   KAHALE WAS LOOKING AT THE BIGGER PICTURE,  SHE SAID.  THE DEFECTIVE  ANAHOLA HOUSES  WERE JUST ONE OF MANY WRONGS HE SAW BEING DONE AGAINST HAWAIIAN HOME LESSEES.  HE GOT INVOLVED IN PANAEWA ON THE BIG ISLAND, WHOSE RESIDENTS HAD SIMILAR PROBLEMS.   
<P>
"HE WASN'T REALLY STUBBORN," MONA SAID. "I FEEL HAWAIIAN HOMES DIDN'T WANT TO WORK WITH HIM."  THEY MADE HIM OUT TO BE STUBBORN,  BUT MY DAD WASN'T LIKE THAT.  I  DON'T THINK THERE WAS EVER ANYONE HE COULDN'T GET ALONG WITH.  HE NEVER HELD ANY GRUDGES AGAINST HAWAIIAN HOMES.  HE LOVED PEOPLE.  HE WOULD HELP ANYONE.  HE HAD A SOFT VOICE, HE WAS GENTLE, UNDERSTANDING, QUIET.  HE LISTENED, HE WAS SO HAPPY TO BE AROUND PEOPLE, TO TALK TO THEM, TO LAUGH, TO HEAR WHAT THEY HAD TO SAY.  
<P>
KAHALE ATTENDED EVERY POLITICIAN'S FUNDRAISERS, HE TALKED STORY, PLAYED SANTA CLAUS, BABYSAT HIS GRANDCHILDREN.
<P>
"HE BELIEVED IN HAWAIIAN HOMES," MONA SAID, "HE THOUGHT IF HE KEPT TRYING TO WORK WITH THEM SOMEWHERE DOWN THE LINE THEY WOULD ALL COME TO A MID-POINT.  BUT THEY FELT  THEY DIDN'T OWE HIM ANYTHING.  THERE WERE A LOT OF THINGS HIDDEN THAT HE BROUGHT UP, AND THEY DIDN'T LIKE THAT."  SMITH BECAME  FAIRLY WELL-READ IN THE HAWAII REVISED STATUTES THAT GOVERN HAWAIIAN HOMES. "HE FOUND OUT THINGS WEREN'T RIGHT, AND THEY DIDN'T WANT OTHERS TO DO THE SAME THING," SHE SAID. "THEY TRIED TO WEAR HIM OUT UNTIL HE RAN OUT OF MONEY AND GOT OLD."
<P>
<H3>THE FINAL DAYS:</H3>

HE WAS THIS KIND, SWEET, CALM, BIG GUY.  YET HE SET HIS HOUSE ON FIRE,  AND HE DIDN'T COME OUT WHEN IT BURNED AROUND HIM.  WHY?   HIS DAUGHTERS CAN ONLY GUESS.  "HE WAS WALKING ON THE EDGE ALREADY WHEN THEY CAME UP THAT MORNING AT 8 O'CLOCK AND KNOCKED ON HIS DOOR," MONA SAID. "HE ALWAYS FELT THAT HE HAD THE SYSTEM ON HIS SIDE, THAT HE WAS DOING SOMETHING RIGHT FOR THE  COMMUNITY, FOR HAWAIIANS."
<P>
AND WHEN THE SHERIFFS TOLD HIM TO MOVE HIMSELF AND HIS THINGS OUT OF THE HOUSE AND OFF THE PROPERTY,  MONA SAID. "THAT WAS THE LAST STRAW." 
<P>
HIS CHILDREN DIDN'T KNOW HE MIGHT HAVE REACHED SUCH A POINT.
"HE WAS ALWAYS SO CALM.  HE HID HIS FEELINGS.  WE GREW UP KNOWING HE WAS STRONG.  NOTHING WOULD MAKE HIM DO ANYTHING VIOLENT.  IF ANYTHING HE WAS ALWAYS STOPPING PEOPLE FROM FIGHTING.  HE WAS NEVER A RADICAL PERSON.  EVEN IF SOMETHING WAS HURTING INSIDE,  HE WOULD NOT SHOW IT.  HE'D JUST GO OFF SOMEWHERE.  WE NEVER SAW HIM WEAK, SO BAD HE WOULD FEEL OVERCOME.   BUT IN HINDSIGHT, THERE WERE SIGNS THAT SOMETHING WASN'T QUITE RIGHT,  MONA SAID. HE WAS LESS BUBBLY, LESS TALKATIVE.
<P>
KAHALE  SMITH WEIGHED WELL OVER 300 POUNDS, BUT WITHIN TWO TO THREE MONTHS BEFORE HIS DEATH, HE DROPPED BELOW 300.  A WEEK BEFORE THE FIRE, MONA HAD GONE OVER TO HIS HOUSE TO BAKE SWEET BREAD AND FOUND THAT HE HAD VIRTUALLY NO FOOD IN HIS HOUSE. HE HAD ALSO BEEN DIGGING OUT OLD PHOTOGRAPHS, SCHOOL YEARBOOKS, COINS, AND OTHER KEEPSAKES TO GIVE TO HIS CHILDREN. "BUT I DON'T THINK HE WAS PLANNING TO KILL HIMSELF," SHE SAID. "HE JUST MEANT TO DESTROY THE HOUSE." AND BEFOREHAND, HE WANTED TO GET THINGS OUT OF THE HOUSE AND BECAUSE THE KIDS NEEDED OR WANTED SOME OF THE KEEPSAKES.
<P>
"THE AUTOPSY INDICATED SMOKE INHALATION, PULMONARY EDEMA AND A POSSIBLE HEART ATTACK KILLED KAHALE SMITH", MONA SAID.
<P>
<H3>INVESTIGATION?</H3>

THE CHILDREN WANT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO INVESTIGATE THEIR FATHER'S BATTLE WITH HAWAIIAN HOMES AND THE CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING HIS DEATH.  MONA HAS WRITTEN TO HAWAII'S CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION, AND ALL BUT SEN. DANIEL INOUYE HAVE RESPONDED.  DAN AKAKA WROTE THAT HE WOULD LOOK INTO THE MATTER.   ATTORNEY GENERAL JANET RENO HASN'T REPLIED TO A LETTER ASKING FOR AN INVESTIGATION.
<P>
THERE'S A POINT TO THEIR QUESTIONING AND LETTER-WRITING, BUNNIE SAID. "THIS IS THE KIND OF EVICTION WE DON'T WANT ANYBODY, TO EVER HAVE TO GO THROUGH!"

K. "Kahale" Smith's fiery death could either widen or  bridge the gap between the Department of Hawaiian Home  Lands and its critics.<P>Activists yesterday weren't talking reconciliation.<P>"This is the beginning of our true fight, to see our  warriors going down," said John K. "Butch" Kekahu, Jr. of  Anahola. "It's remotivated us to pursue what he's done and make  sure his work wasn't in vain."<P>Smith, 58, burned to death Thursday after setting his  home on fire during an eviction for delinquent lease payments.  He and the department had battled for 18 years over repairs to  the Anahola house that Smith alleged had been defective from  the start.<P>"Hawaiians fighting this issue are so disgusted that  Kahale would have to resort this low to get our government to  pay attention to us," said Kekahu, who lives in the same  subdivision as Smith and is still pushing for repairs to the house  he has since deeded to his parents. "I'm sticking with it."<P>Harold Jim, a member of a Big Island group protesting  the use of Hawaiian homelands for a Hilo Wal-Mart store, said  he wants to FBI to investigate.<P>"They were waging a personal vendetta against Kahale,"  he said, referred to department officials. "We can't back down  now, because we know just how far they'll go."<P>The state attorney general's office is investigating, and  Hawaiian Homes Chairman Kali Watson met yesterday with his  staff to go over the events leading up to the fire. Agency official  John Hirota earlier said Smith had been treated the same as  other lessees and that the department tried to avoid the eviction.<P>Kekahu said he is planning a May 20 civil disobedience  action in Anahola and will use Smith's plight as a rallying cry to  attract Hawaiians from around the state.<P>"The Hawaiians are a sickly people, but we're not afraid  to die now," he said. "And you know why? Because most of our  sickness is on the inside, the hurt and the emotions we feel."<P>Lucas, an attorney with the Native Hawaiian Legal  Corp., said Smith's dispute with Hawaiian Homes was an  extreme case, but many other homesteaders are frustrated by the  shoddy workmanship on their homes.<P>"Most are just living with it, and that shouldn't be. In  Kahale's case, I think he had a legitimate defense," Lucas said. "I  don't know what happened. It's very sad to see his fight ended  this way."<P>Most of the complaints revolve around homes built in the  late 1970s and early 1980s, he said. Disgruntled homesteaders  often must hire attorneys and construction experts to prove their  case.<P>"It's a very long, drawn-out process and very  expensive," Lucas said. "Most Hawaiians can't afford it."<P>So the state Legislature created a review panel that in  1993 began accepting claims against the department for the  period of Aug. 21, 1959, through June 30, 1988. More than  4,300 claims were filed by last August's deadline, but only about  2.5 percent dealt with construction issues, said the panel's  executive director, Melody MacKenzie. Most of those,  however, were filed by homesteaders from Kauai and Molokai,  she said, and only one has been resolved.<P>Lucas said Hawaiian Homes cut back evictions for a  time, apparently recognizing that "to dispossess a person whose  race or class of people have been dispossessed for years is a  difficult thing."<P>Watson renewed the practice, however, seeing  delinquent mortgages as another source of homes for Hawaiians  on the waiting list.<P>"That can be good," Lucas said. "But it has to be done  with sensitivity."<P>Lucas said he hopes Smith's death will help the sheriff's  office improve the way it approaches evictions. Hawaiian Homes  also has been criticized in the past for handling evictions  unprofessionally, he said, but the agency is slowly changing.<P>"It's going to take time," Lucas said.<P><IMG SRC="hrcolor2.gif"><BR><A HREF="index.html"><IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="flagsm.gif" BORDER="0" HSPACE=4 VSPACE=4></A> Return to the <A HREF="index.html">Nation of Hawai`i Home Page</A>, the <A HREF="kahale.html">Kahale Smith Memorial Page</A> or the <A HREF="news.html">News Articles Index</A></BODY></HTML>

I was hard head before, &quot; Kanahele, headof the self-proclaimed Nation of Hawaii, told federal Judge David Ezra.&quot;Whatever it takes to patch things and make things work, you got myword.&quot; <BR><BR>Leaders from such organizations as the Office of Hawaiian Affairs, stateHawaiian Sovereignty Elections Council and Ka Lahui Hawai'i assured thejudge that Kanahele is neither a danger to this community not a flight risk.<BR><BR>They testified he should be released on bail pending trail in January oncharges that he harbored convicted tax protester Nathan Brown and foiledtwo attempts to arrest Brown last year. <BR><BR>A half-dozen church leaders also were on hand to testify. <BR><BR>After a 2 1/2-hour hearing, Ezra ruled that Kanahele can be released asearly as today to the Miller Hale &quot;halfway house&quot; on the slopesof Punchbowl until his new trial. <BR><BR>Kanahele will be required to spend his nights there, but will be free togo out during the days. Ezra cited the risk of danger of &quot;overzealoussupporters&quot; and ordered Kanahele to stay out of Waimanalo, where hisclosest supporters have established a settlement on state land. The Nationof Hawai'i calls it &quot;Puuhonua (Refuge) Village;&quot; federal officialscall it &quot;a compound.&quot; <BR><BR>The state offered the facility to Kanahele and his followers last year,in exchange for their ending a 15-month occupation of Kaupo and Makapuubeach parks. The Nation of Hawaii claims several thousand members, who advocateHawaiian independence and contend that the federal and state governmentsare occupying the Islands illegally. <BR><BR>Deemed a danger to the community and likely no-show for trial, Kanahelehas been held without bail since he was indicted and arrested on Aug. 2.<BR><BR>Kanahele stood trial on the charges last month, but that ended in a mistrialbecause of the jury's deadlock and a juror's misconduct. <BR><BR>Yesterday he and his lawyer, Hayden Aluli, asked Ezra to reconsider holdingKanahele without bail. <BR><BR>Kanahele said that he's been pushing Hawaiian independence, but believedit was his right under the U.S. Constitution: &quot;I thought you couldspeak without getting in trouble.&quot; <BR><BR>But he told Ezra, &quot;Today I understand that it cannot be done the wayI like 'em done. . . . I think I was put in prison for understand that Imight have been too aggressive.&quot; <BR><BR>Kanahele, 41, also mentioned that yesterday was his 21st wedding anniversary.<BR><BR>Aluli called seven people to the stand, and offered endorsements from manyothers. <BR><BR>Among those who testified were OHA trustees A. Frenchy DeSota and Kina'uKamali'i as well as Hawaiian scholar Lilikala Kame'eleihiwa. <BR><BR>&quot;We who grew up poor, who grew up in the street, who grew up rough,sometimes we say rough things,&quot; said Kame'eleihiwa, a citizen of KaLahui Hawai'i, a sovereignty group that has often clashed with Kanahele.<BR><BR>But she pointed out that during the 1986 Makapuu occupation that resultedin Kanahele's conviction for threatening a policeman, no one was killedor shot. <BR><BR>Office of Hawaiian Affairs trustee Kamali'i called Kanahele &quot;passionate.<BR><BR>&quot;Some people might take that as being violent,&quot; Kamali'i said.<BR><BR>When Ezra mentioned that Kanahele might have to pay his own rent at theMiller Street halfway house or stay at Halawa until the federal governmentcould find the money, Aluli turned around and saw Kamali'i sitting behindhim. She immediately offered to put up $2,000 in personal funds to coverKanahele's costs. <BR><BR>DeSoto, who has know Kanahele since he was a child, promised Ezra that hewould return for his second trial. <BR><BR>&quot;I swear to you, judge, on the lives of my children and my grandchildrenand my great-grandchildren, he will not run. He has given his word, andhis word is sacred,&quot; DeSoto said. <BR><BR>Ezra on his own came up with the notion of sending Kanahele to the MillerHale halfway house. <BR><BR>Assistant U.S. Attorney Les Osborne wanted Kanahele to remain in jail. Hesaid Kanahele's &quot;antisocial dangerous conduct&quot; has continued intothis year and argued that Kanahele &quot;has no reason&quot; to return tocourt for his case. <BR><BR>But Aluli said Kanahele's supporters could post bail of up to $250,000 andanother $57,000 from the equity in Kanahele's Hawaiian Homes house. <BR><BR>Ezra said he wanted to balance Kanehele's rights with the safety of thecommunity and concerns by law enforcement officials. <BR><BR>The judge cited the time Kanahele has already been held without bail andthe initial mistrial. <BR><BR>Any further detention would not &quot;serve any useful purpose,&quot; thejudge said. <BR><BR>Osborne said he was disappointed in Ezra's ruling. <BR><BR>&quot;I sincerely hope he (Kanahele) doesn't disappoint the judge or thepeople of this state.&quot; Advertiser Staff Writers Ann Botticelli andKen Kobayashi contributed to this report.<BR><BR><IMG SRC="hrcolor2.gif" WIDTH="648" HEIGHT="11" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN=bottom><BR><A HREF="index.html"><IMG SRC="flagsm.gif" ALIGN=middle BORDER="0" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="19" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A>Return to the <A HREF="index.html">Nationof Hawai`i Home Page</A>, the <A HREF="news.html">News Articles Index</A>,or the <A HREF="political_prisoner.html">Political Prisoner page</A><BR><BR></BODY></HTML>

Although he is gone, his spirit will always be remembered in our hearts as a gentle giant who enjoyed more than anything in his life, were moments that allowed him an opportunity, to swim with his grandson in the Anahola Bay.<P>Kahale Smith, a soft spoken intelligent Hawaiian was one among 65 other native Hawaiian families who waited many years on the deadly State of Hawaii's Department of Hawaiian Homelands &quot;waiting list&quot; only to get the shaft instead.<P>After waiting many years he finally got a lot.  Billie Beamer who served as the chairperson, awarded Kahale his lot during a groundbreaking ceremony on the Anahola subdivision and was responsible for allowing shoddy construction; poor electrical wiring, termite eaten lumber and poor plumbing that prompted a suit filed by Kahale and the 65 families. Beamer has since done nothing to make right the wrongs she is responsible for in this situation, she serves a trustee with the <A HREF="http://planet-hawaii.com/oha">OFFICE OF HAWAIIAN AFFAIRS</A>.<P>After years of litigation, mitigation and finally intimidation by the department and the State's Sheriff's department forced many to &quot;settle-out-of-court&quot; for less than they deserved.  Kahale was a researcher, creative and very patient he went for the long haul and put his money into escrow, hoping that the department would in good faith someday repair his home.  We believe that they are in clear violation of the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act of 1920 in the situation of Kahale Smith because he was not &quot;back in his mortgage&quot; as they would like the public to believe and they did nothing to repair his termite eaten, shoddy constructed home he continued to live in, as he waited for 18 years.<P>The State's Department of Hawaiian Homelands has a bad record for 75 years that included; losing applications, leasing lands to non-Hawaiians before the native Hawaiians, favoritism, fraud, neglect, conflict of interest and ammending the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act of 1920 without the consent or input of the beneficiaries.   No one has a clear idea of what those 52 ammendments  means in terms of the pros and cons, more importantly what affect they may have had in the Kahale Smith's case.<P>For 18 years this situation has caused economic, physical, mental and spiritual stress on Kahale.  His wife left him because she couldn't take the pressure.  His children moved with his wife, leaving him alone to battle the department that led to the straw that broke the camel's back.<P>We know how humiliating this all has been, we have seen the department and the State's Sheriffs office come with the John Wayne attitude and saying, &quot;we're just doing our job&quot; with no feelings what so ever, committing Genocide.<P>There is no doubt in our minds that the State of Hawaii's Department of Hawaiian Homelands, sheriff's office and the attorney general are all responsible for Kahale's death.  One day, all of you will be called to stand trial for the death of this man.<P>Our heart felt love and aloha goes out to his wife and children for whom this lesson was meant for.  We will miss this gentle giant who was loved by his friends, family and children.<P>Kahale Smith was a dear friend of mine and where ever you are, you will be missed in the Anahola Bay and we will continue to struggle for justice, your death my friend was not in vain.<P><IMG SRC="hrcolor2.gif"><BR><A HREF="index.html"><IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="flagsm.gif" BORDER="0" HSPACE=4 VSPACE=4></A> Return to the <A HREF="index.html">Nation of Hawai`i Home Page</A>, the <A HREF="kahale.html">Kahale Smith Memorial Page</A> or the <A HREF="news.html">News Articles Index</A></BODY></HTML>

But we want him to be the last person to be evicted."<P>Trask, director of the University of Hawaii Center for Hawaiian Studies, was among several Hawaiian leaders who met Saturday at Kaumakapili Church to discuss the aftermath of Smith's death. Others included Dr. Kekuni Blaisdell, Bumpy Kanahele, the Rev. Kaleo Patterson, representatives from the Kingdom of Hawaii and Ka Lahui's Oahu Caucus.<P>Smith died Thursday after an 18-year disagreement with the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands culminated in his eviction from his home at Anahola, Kauai.<P>Smith poured gasoline on the floor of the residence and ignited it.<P>The department has pledged to investigate Smith's death and expressed its sorrow.<P>Smith had been arguing with the department over construction defects, but had been paying his mortgage into an escrow account.<P>His death brought an immediate outcry from many Hawaiian sovereignty leaders who have said the department pushed him to the edge. It also has renewed attention on the department that administers 187,000 acres of land for the benefit . . . {printed text missing} . . . percent Hawaiian blood.<P>But not all Hawaiian leaders believe that criticizing the department in the wake of Smith's death is the Hawaiian thing to do.<P>They believe problems with the department should be worked out through ho'oponopono - the traditional Hawaiian resolution process of working through problems by talking.<P>"This is a time for Hawaiians to come together, to go back to their traditions, to learn to handle this crisis in a Hawaiian way," said Lela Hubbard, a member of Ka Lahui Hawaii. "A traditional concept in our culture is forgiveness."<P>Said Melvin Kalahiki, Council of Hawaiian Organizations president and former Department of Hawaiian Homes commissioner, "I can sympathize with those who have strong feelings. But at the same time they need to understand those that serve there are looking after the benefits as Hawaiians."<P>"We need to come up with solutions rather than pointing fingers, because it's easy to point fingers."<P>Yet some of those who have come together in the Coalition to Stop All Evictions on Hawaiian Homes Lands believe ho'oponopono won't work. Evictions like Smith's involve courts and law enforcement officers who don't respond to ho'oponopono, Trask said.<P>"The time has long past since there could be any talking about this," Trask said. "Hawaiians have been evicted for 20 years."<P>Hubbard worries about losing support if Hawaiians criticize too harshly.<P>"I don't think we should be whipping posts or doormats. But I think the silent majority wouldn't want to see all this fighting," she said. "They would want to see positive things and proposals to make changes that are realistic and intelligently thought out."<P>The Department of Hawaiian Home Lands was created by the federal government in 1920 and was turned over to the state of Hawaiian in 1959.<P>It has been criticized for poor progress in awarding land leases to native Hawaiians and for favorable deals with politically connected individuals.<P>At the beginning of this year, some 16,000 people were waiting for homestead land.<P><IMG SRC="hrcolor2.gif"><BR><A HREF="index.html"><IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="flagsm.gif" BORDER="0" HSPACE=4 VSPACE=4></A> Return to the <A HREF="index.html">Nation of Hawai`i Home Page</A>, the <A HREF="kahale.html">Kahale Smith Memorial Page</A> or the <A HREF="news.html">News Articles Index</A></BODY></HTML>

He poured gasoline on the carpet and lit it Thursday morning as sheriffs sent by the Department of Hawaiian Homes Lands were evicting him.<P>A preliminary autopsy report indicated he died as a result of inhaling smoke and fumes, police said.<P>Members of his family were gathering in Anahola yesterday, but some were still coming from off-island. A daughter said they wanted to all be together before they discussed the circumstances of his death.<P>Neighbors were outraged by Smith's death.<P>&quot;These people showed no respect whatsoever,&quot; said Wilfred Kaui, a longtime Anahola resident. Kaui, a victim of a series of strokes, sat on a chair on his lawn as his grandsons mowed.<P>&quot;People are mad. They're really salty for what happened to that man.&quot; Kaui said he awoke Thursday to the acrid smell of the smoke from the burning house.<P>Kaui, who once owned Kauai's largest security guard service, expressed his own concern that the state sheriffs who were evicting Smith should have been able to prevent him from burning his house.<P>&quot;We were taught in FBI school, if you're with someone depressed, you should stay with him. You don't leave him alone,&quot; Kaui said.<P>Kaui's brother had one of the houses, and it, like Smith's, had defects. Kaui recalled talking to Smith about the electrical problems in his house.<P>&quot;He was afraid of a short-circuit. He told me, 'I got an electrical problem. I tell them about it, and they didn't do anything,'&quot; Kaui said.<P>Smith's good friend, William Aki Sr., said he believes Smith burned his house and himself because he was humiliated by the eviction. The man had tried for 18 years to negotiate with the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands, had failed, and was being thrown out as all his neighbors watched, Aki said.<P>&quot;There were about 250 people watching what happened there. That kind of embarrassed him. Any Hawaiian you talk to, they have a heart. They have a softness in their heart. You get everybody looking, you get shame,&quot; Aki said.<P>Smith, aware that the department had a writ of possession that would allow his eviction, had already moved this cars off the property earlier this month, but when no eviction came, he moved the cars and himself back to the house, Aki said. Then, without notice, the sheriffs arrived with a moving van.<P>&quot;Hawaiian Homes should have given him at least 10 days notice,&quot; Aki said. &quot;I talked to this officer, and he said it was suicide. I said it was harassment.&quot;<P>Smith's activism began and ended with his battle over the Anahola house. It was part of  a 66-unit development in 1977, in which DHHL hired a contractor to build the homes. Buy many Hawaiians awarded homes in the subdivision complained of multiple construction and materials problems.<P>After lawsuits and years of confrontation, some of the owners settled with the department. Smith never settled. He argued that when he agreed to pay for a new home, he deserve one without construction flaws. He refused to pay his mortgage to the department, although for many years he paid into an escrow account at the 5th Circuit Court.<P>When the department gave up on reaching an agreement with Smith, it canceled his lease and got an eviction order. Smith fought in court, and got one such order reversed, but the latest one stood and was the basis of Thursday's eviction action.<P>&quot;I think this man was trying to prove a point. It shows the frustration of people trying to make the system work,&quot; said Maxwell. &quot;This wasn't just regular protesting. This was a long, drawn-out thing.&quot;<P>Helm said the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands let the bureaucracy run away with the situation. Before getting to the ultimate confrontation, the department should have tried ho'oponopono, he said. Ho'oponopono is a Hawaiian technique of conflict resolution in which the parties sit down with family elders or community leaders and work out their differences.<P>&quot;It is to make a wrong right,&quot; Helm said. &quot;To dialogue, understanding both sides. Understanding and getting those two sides together so you can get a happy medium.&quot;<P>In Hilbert Kahale Smith's case, there was clearly an issue in conflict. Hawaiian Homes should have worked harder to resolve it, Helm said.<P>&quot;I think maybe Hawaiian Homes should have said, 'Let's do a whole 'nother house. This one's not good enough,'&quot; he said.<P>Both Helm and Maxwell said they fear a new round of animosity between the Hawaiian people and the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands.<P>Helm is from a family with deep roots in the Hawaiian community. His brother, George, who disappeared at sea while paddling to Kahoolawe, became a martyr to the cause of freeing Kahoolawe from military control.<P>Helm's brother, Greg, is the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands supervisor on Molokai.<P><IMG SRC="hrcolor2.gif"><BR><A HREF="index.html"><IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="flagsm.gif" BORDER="0" HSPACE=4 VSPACE=4></A> Return to the <A HREF="index.html">Nation of Hawai`i Home Page</A>, the <A HREF="kahale.html">Kahale Smith Memorial Page</A> or the <A HREF="news.html">News Articles Index</A></BODY></HTML>

<H1>2 agencies in accord on eviction decisions</H1>

<STRONG>Honolulu Advertiser<BR>

By Greg Barrett
<P>
The State Council of Hawaiian Homestead Associations will be involved in any future decisions by the state to evict Hawaiian homesteaders, council chairman Kamaki Kanahele said yesterday.
<P>
"We want to be an instrument of participation before any eviction takes place," Kanahele said at a news conference.
<P>
Following Hilbert Kahale Smith's funeral yesterday, Kanahele and Department of Hawaiian Homes Lands director Kai Watson sat side-by-side and spoke of mending wounded relations.
<P>
"We do feel that the loss of our brother is a tragic one and we will work to have it never happened again," Kanahele said. "But it is now time to move on."
<P>
Smith, 59, died Jan. 18 when he torched his house while sheriff's deputies sent by the state were evicting him from his Anahola, Kauai, homestead. Smith had refused to make his mortgage payments because of construction defects on his house.
<P>
About 700 homestead mortgage payments are delinquent, and Watson did not rule out future evictions. But, he said, homesteaders will never have their homes yanked away.
<P>
"It's not a situation where we're evicting people left and right," Watson said. "Rather, it's a last and extremely rare resort."
<P>
Peter Kama, president of Hui Kako'o 'Aina Ho'opulapual, a support group for Native Hawaiians eligible for the Hawaiian Homes program, said responsibility for the program's success must be shared by the state and its homesteaders.
<P>
"The issue of those delinquent payments should be rectified," Kama said. "And homes should be inspected and satisfactory to the receiver."
<P>
Kanahele stressed that moving from the Hawaiian Homes waiting list onto homestead land does not end a family's suffering. Many people do not gain the land until late in life, he said, and a new mortgage can wreck a family's budget.

They had  a  writ  of  possession  issued  by  the  District  Court,  and proceeded  to  evict  Smith  from  the  house  he  has  owned  since  it was  new.<P>Smith  had  a  box  of  wooden  matches  in  his  hand.<P>One  mover  was  in  the  house  with  Smith.<P>&quot;I  said,  'Don't  do  it,'  be  he  just  lit  one  and  dropped  it,&quot;  said Manuel  Lomosad  .  &quot;As  soon  as  it  hit  the  floor,  the  flames  came out.  We  were  standing  in  the  flames.&quot;<P>An  hour  later,  Smith  was  dead  inside,  and  his  brother, Henry,  was  accusing  the  Department  of  Hawaiian  Home  Lands of  murder.<P>&quot;Hawaiian  Homes  murdered  my  brother.  They  drove  him to  this,&quot;  said  Henry,  who  was  himself  evicted  from  his  Hawaiian Homes  property  last  year.<P>&quot;They  knew  something  like  this  would  happen.  He  did indicate  that  he  wasn't  going  to  move  out  peacefully.&quot;<P>Hawaiian  Homes  Chairman  Kali  Watson  said  he  was shocked  and  saddened  by  Smith's  death,  and  called  for  an investigation  of  the  entire  case.  &quot;There's  a  sincere  feeling  of  deep  sorrow  and  we'd  like to  express  our  deep  felt  condolences  for  the  family,&quot;  said  Watson, explaining  that  the  department  will  try  to  help  the  family  out  if  it can.<P>Hawaiian  groups  on  other  islands  were  planning memorial  services  yesterday.  But  on  Kauai,  many  in  the Hawaiian  community  were  simply  stunned.<P>&quot;I  can't  talk  about  it  now,&quot;  said  Michael  Grace,  a Hawaiian  lands  activist  who  has  been  the  subject  of  sheriff-led evictions  ordered  [by]  the  Department  of  Hawaiian  Home Lands  and  the  Office  of  the  Attorney  General.<P>Hilbert  Clarence  Kahalelehua  Smith,  59,  was  a  soft-spoken  man  who  weighed  over  300  pounds.  He  once  owned  a shop  in  the  Coconut  Plantation  Marketplace,  and  once  ran  the snack  shop  in  the  Lihue  State  Building.  He  prepared  taxes  for people,  and  was  a  quiet  supporter  of  Hawaiian  causes.<P>He  was  firm  when  he  believed  he  was  right.  And  when  it came  to  his  Hawaiian  Homes  house,  he  believed  he  was  right. He  and  many  other  residents  were  awarded  house  and  lot packages  in  1977,  but  quickly  found  the  houses  flawed.<P>Smith  and  other  residents  reported  rusting  and  leaking roofs,  floor  weakness,  electrical  and  plumbing  problems, collapsing  cabinets  and  other  construction  defects.<P>So  he  refused  to  pay  his  DHHL  mortgage.  The department  found  him  delinquent,  canceled  his  lease  and  in  1984 ordered  him  to  vacate  the  property.<P>Smith  and  other  lessees  sued  the  department  because  of the  construction  defects,  and  the  court  halted  the  eviction process.  But  when  Smith  and  the  state  couldn't  reach  agreement about  repairing  the  defects,  it  again  held  a  hearing,  canceled  his lease  and  ordered  him  to  vacate.<P>He  appealed,  but  his  appeal  was  dismissed.  Legal maneuvering  continued  until  Jan.  5,  when  the  District  Court issued  a  writ  of  possession,  which  allowed  the  department  to evict  Smith.<P>&quot;He  fought  the  fight,&quot;  said  his  attorney,  Mark  Zenger, who  had  planned  to  file  an  appeal  of  the  eviction  order.  &quot;He  went to  the  newspapers.  He  went  to  court.  He  went  to  the  Supreme Court  twice.  He  went  to  three  (DHHL)  administrative  hearings. He  kept  coming  back.  He  never  stopped.  His  claim  remains unresolved  today.&quot;<P>Other  residents  accepted  Hawaiian  Homes  offers  of repairs  to  their  homes.  But  Smith  said  many  of  those  repairs were  insufficient,  and  left  people  with  the  need  to  repeatedly  fix their  houses.  His  brother  Henry  likened  it  to  a  car.<P>&quot;You  had  four  flat  tires  and  they  only  fixed  one,&quot;  Henry said  yesterday.<P>The  analogy  was  an  appropriate  one  for  Hilbert  Smith,  a car  buff  who  made  money  repairing  and  reselling  old  cars  and selling  parts.  Several  older  cars  and  antique  vehicles  stood  in  his yard  yesterday,  surrounding  the  burned-out  shell  of  his  home.<P>Zenger  said  Smith,  who  often  fought  without  the  help  of an  attorney,  was  exhausted  by  the  battle  but  continued  fighting for  the  house  because  he  wanted  to  be  able  to  leave  it  to  his children.<P>&quot;He  was  a  martyr,&quot;  Zenger  said.<P>&quot;He  called  me  this  morning  and  said,  'Come  help  me. They  moving  me  out,'&quot;  Henry  Smith  said.<P>State  officials  said  when  he  was  informed  of  the  eviction, Hilbert  Smith  began  assisting  sheriff's  deputies  and  employees  of Kauai  Freight  in  moving  his  belongings  out  of  the  house.<P>Lomosad  of  Kauai  Freight  said  that  one  point  about  9 a.m.,  he  and  Smith  were  alone  in  the  house.  Lomsoad  said  he was  standing  in  the  living  room  near  the  front  door,  when  Smith walked  in  from  the  back  of  the  house  with  a  red  plastic  gas  can.<P>&quot;He  just  got  the  can  and  turned  it  upside  down  and walked  around.  He  was  mumbling  -  he  talked  very  softly  - something  about  'If  I  can't  have  the  house,  I  might  as  well  burn it.'  Something  like  that.&quot;<P>&quot;He  didn't  show  any  signs  of  being  in  distress  or  anything like  that,&quot;  Lomosad  said.<P>Lomosad  said  he  was  near  the  front  door,  and  ran  out, expecting  Smith  to  follow.  But  when  he  looked  back,  Smith  was no  longer  there.<P>&quot;Within  a  couple  of  seconds,  there  was  smoke everywhere  and  flames  were  coming  out  the  front  door.&quot;<P>Sheriffs  deputies  broke  in  a  window  to  try  to  reach Smith,  but  couldn't  find  him.  They  tried  to  enter  the  kitchen  door, but  it  was  barricaded  by  Smith's  body.<P>It  was  not  clear  whether  he  was  trying  to  prevent  entry, or  whether  he  had  collapsed  there.<P><IMG SRC="hrcolor2.gif"><BR><A HREF="index.html"><IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="flagsm.gif" BORDER="0" HSPACE=4 VSPACE=4></A> Return to the <A HREF="index.html">Nation of Hawai`i Home Page</A>, the <A HREF="kahale.html">Kahale Smith Memorial Page</A> or the <A HREF="news.html">News Articles Index</A></BODY></HTML>

<H1>Kanahele's lawyer cites sovereignty at activist's trial</H1>

<H2>Defense calls case an 'overreaction'</H2>

<P>
The trial of Dennis "Bumpy" Kanahele began yesterday in a case that his attorney calls an "overreaction ... to the most outspoken and assertive direct-action Hawaiian sovereignty advocate in Hawaii today."
<P>
Kanahele, leader of the self-proclaimed Nation of Hawaii, is on trial in federal District Court on a charge of harboring a federal tax fugitive and interfering with two attempts to arrest that fugitive, Nathan K. Brown, early last year.
<P>
Kanahele aide Gordon Kaaihue, head of the nation's "peace force," is a co-defendant on one interfering charge.
<P>
In opening statements yesterday, Kanahele's attorney, Hayden Aluli, suggested that, rather than criminal conduct, the case "is really about certain state and federal agents' perception of the Hawaiian sovereignty movement."
<P>
But Judge Helen Gillmor indicated she won't allow the defense to hold a "mini-trial" of what Kanahele and his followers consider to be the illegal occupation of Hawaii by the federal and state governments.
<P>
Assistant U.S. Attorney Les Osborne said he intends to call six witnesses to prove that Kanahele and Kaaihue interfered with a Honolulu police officer's attempt to arrest Brown on Jan. 27, 1994, and Kanahele's obstruction of two U.S. marshals.  They were trying to arrest Brown at Kanahele's Waimanalo home on March 16, 1994.
<P>
The trial is expected to take a week or more.
<P>
The panel appears to be ethnically mixed.  Kaaihue's attorney, Sid Quintal, estimated one-third or half of them are part-Hawaiian.

<PRE>                      CONSTITUTION OF THE STATE OF HAWAII
                             (as amended to 1968)        

                                   PREAMBLE              

          We, the people of the  State of Hawaii, grateful for  Divine
          Guidance, and mindful of our Hawaiian heritage, reaffirm our
          belief in a government of the people, by the people and  for
          the  people,  and  with  an  understanding  heart toward all
          peoples of  the earth  do hereby  ordain and  establish this
          constitution for the State of Hawaii.

                         FEDERAL CONSTITUTION ADOPTED

          The  Constitution of the United States of America is adopted
          on behalf of the people of the State of Hawaii.

                                    BILL OF RIGHTS

Sec. 1.   All political power of this State is inherent in the people;
          and the responsibility for  the exercise thereof rests  with
          the people.  All government is founded on this authority.

Sec. 2.   All persons are free by nature and are equal in their inher-
          ent and inalienable rights.  Among these rights are  the en-
          joyment of life, liberty  and the pursuit of  happiness, and
          the acquiring and possessing property.  These rights  cannot
          endure unless the people recognize their corresponding obli-
          gations and responsibilities.

Sec. 3.   No law shall be enacted respecting an establishment of reli-
          gion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or abridging
          the freedom of speech or of  the press, or the right of  the
          people peaceably to assemble and to petition the  government
          for a redress of grievances.

Sec. 4.   No person  shall be  deprived of life, liberty,  or property
          without due process of law, nor be denied the equal  protec-
          tion of the laws, nor  be denied the enjoyment of  his civil
          rights or be discriminated  against in the exercise  thereof
          because of race, religion, sex or ancestry.

Sec. 5.   The  right  of  the people  to be  secure in  their persons,
          houses, papers  and effects  against unreasonable  searches,
          seizures, and  invasions of  privacy shall  not be violated;
          and no warrants  shall issue but  upon probable cause,  sup-
          ported by oath  or affirmation, particularly  describing the
          place to be searched and the persons or things to be  seized
          or the communications sought to be intercepted.

Sec. 6.   No citizen shall be disfranchised, or deprived of any of the
          rights or  privileges secured  to other  citizens, unless by
          the law of the land.

Sec. 7.   No citizen shall be denied enlistment in any military organ-
          ization of this State  nor be segregated therein  because of
          race, religious principles or ancestry.

Sec. 8    No person shall be held to answer for a capital or otherwise
          infamous crime, unless on  a presentment or indictment  of a
          grand jury, except in cases arising in the armed forces when
          in actual service in time of war or public danger; nor shall
          any person be subject for  the same offense to be  twice put
          in jeopardy; nor shall any person be compelled in any crimi-
          nal case to be a witness against himself.

Sec. 9.   Excessive  bail shall not  be required, nor excessive  fines
          imposed, nor  cruel or  unusual punishment  inflicted.   The
          court may  dispense with  bail if  reasonably satisfied that
          the defendant or witness  will appear when directed,  except
          for a defendant charged  with an offense punishable  by life
          imprisonment.

Sec. 10.  In suits at common law where the value in controversy  shall
          exceed one hundred dollars, the right of trial by jury shall
          be preserved. The legislature  may provide for a  verdict by
          not less than three-fourths of the members of the jury.

Sec. 11.  In all  criminal  prosecutions, the accused  shall enjoy the
          right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury  of
          the district  wherein the  crime shall  have been committed,
          which  district  shall  have  been previously ascertained by
          law, or of such other district to which the prosecution  may
          be removed with the consent  of the accused; to be  informed
          of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be  confronted
          with the witnesses against  him; to have compulsory  process
          for obtaining witnesses in his favor; to have the assistance
          of counsel for his defense.  The State shall provide counsel
          for an indigent defendant charged with an offense punishable
          by imprisonment for more than sixty days.

Sec. 12.  No person shall be disqualified to serve as a juror  because
          of sex.

Sec. 13.  The privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be sus-
          pended, unless when  in cases of  rebellion or invasion  the
          public safety may require it.   The power of suspending  the
          privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, and the laws or  the
          execution thereof,  shall never  be exercised  except by the
          legislature, or  by authority  derived from  it to  be exer-
          cised in such particular cases only as the legislature shall
          expressly prescribe.

Sec. 14.  The  military shall be held  in strict subordination to  the
          civil power.

Sec. 15.  A well regulated militia being necessary to the security  of
          a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear  arms
          shall not be infringed.

Sec. 16.  No soldier or member of the militia shall, in time of peace,
          be quartered in any house, without the consent of the  owner
          or occupant,  nor in  time of  war, except  in a manner pre-
          scribed by law.

Sec. 17.  There shall be no imprisonment for debt.

Sec. 18.  Private  property shall not be  taken or damaged for  public
          use without just compensation. (amended 1968)

Sec. 19.  The power of the  State to act in the general welfare  shall
          never be impaired by the making of any irrevocable grant  of
          special privileges or immunities.

Sec. 20.  The enumeration of  rights and privileges shall not be  con-
          strued to impair or deny others retained by the people.</PRE>

Extract from "Status of the WMO Global Atmosphere Watch Programme as at 31 December 1993", WMO/TD-NO. 636.
<PRE>

<DL>
<DT><B><H2>Introduction</H2></B>

<DD>1.1      The issues of global change and man's influence on the quality of the natural environment are complex.
Global warning is expected if observed increases in the concentrations of man-made greenhouse gases (CH4, CO2, N2O,
CFCs, and ozone) and alterations in the amounts of clouds and particles in the atmosphere continue; the stratospheric
ozone layer, and, consequently, the surface solar flux of ultraviolet radiation are being modified; there are changes
in the integrated oxidation rate or oxidizing capacity of the atmosphere, and perturbations in the abundance of tropospheric
trace gases, in particular ozone.

<DD>1.2      Assessing and understanding these changes and the responses of the global environment to them occupy a prominent
position on the international scientific agenda today.   Finding ecologically effective and economically efficient
solutions to the resulting problems confronts all countries of the world with a challenge of global dimensions.

<DD>1.3      The scientific input to the debate on environmental issues must be on adequate knowledge.   The latter can only be
achieved through high-quality, strategically oriented observations and research related to the particular issues.
Hence the establishment of proper global environmental observation systems as the only effective way to ensure systematic
gathering of data worldwide, with comparable and clearly defined measuring criteria, co-ordinated data processing and
quality assurance, and the distribution and provision of available information to the widely varied group of users.
This complex international task must be tackled jointly by countries, international organizations and the scientific community.


<DD>1.4      The Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) programme of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) contributes to this purpose.



<DT><B><H2>Establishment and implementation</H2></B>

<DD>1.5      The GAW was establishes in 1989 from the integration of WMO activities involving the chemical composition and
related physical characteristics of the atmosphere and the meteorological aspects of air pollution monitoring which existed
under the Organization's Global Ozone Observing System (GO3OS) established in the 1950s and Background Air Pollution
Monitoring Network (BAPMoN) started in the 1960s.

<DD>1.6      Considerations which  led to the establishment of GAW included :

         (i)    the concern which had arisen regarding the quality, timeliness and completeness of many of the BAPMoN and
                GO3OS data;

         (ii)   the need to expand and strengthen WMO's and Members' research and monitoring activities which would focus on
                cognizant scientific issues.   At present, such issues include, (a) at the global level; climate change,
                stratospheric ozone depletion, tropospheric ozone increase and changes in the oxidizing capacity of the
                atmosphere; and (b) at the regional level: acidic wet and dry deposition, the long-range transport of
                pollutants,biogeochemical cycles, exchange of pollutants between the atmosphere and the sea, biomass burning,
                biogenic sources and sinks of greenhouse gases and others:

         (iii)  the need to strengthen the role of WMO and the Meteorological Services of WMO Member countries in the field of
                atmospheric composition assessment, early warning and research, in the light of growing requirements of
                atmospheric environmental information;

         (iv)   the need for Meteorological Services of Members to ensure that atmospheric composition measurements become an
                integral part of atmospheric observations in general and are carried out with the same attention as is given to
                the measurements of other meteorological parameters;

         (v)    the need to expand collaboration and promote involvement with other relevant programmes (e.g. International Global
                Atmospheric Chemistry Project (IGAC), International Geosphere/Biosphere Programme, Global Climate Observing System
                (GCOS), Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS), Global Terrestrial Observing System(GTOS)).


<DD>1.7      GAW activities are implemented in accordance with WMO Technical Regulations (Reference 1).



<DT><B><H2>Objectives</H2></B>

<DD>1.8      The GAW pursues two main objectives, namely:

         (a)   to serve an early warning and forecasting system for changes in the background chemical composition and related
               physical characteristics of the atmosphere which have direct or indirect effects on climate, ultra violet-B
               radiation, the ozone layer, the oxidizing capacity of the atmosphere and terrestrial and marine ecosystems;

         (b)   to document, detect and understand such changes.



<DT><B><H2>Activities</H2></B>

<DD>1.9      GAW activities include measurements at participating stations; chemical analysis of samples at participating
laboratories; co-ordinated quality assurance programme; data archiving and publication; capacity building through training and
technical co-operation; and monitoring of the operation of the system.

<DD>1.10     (omission)



<DT><B><H2>Current regulations, procedures, practices and arrangements

Measurements
</H2></B>

<DT><I><B>Categories of stations</B></I>

<DD>1.11     There are two categories of manned GAW stations, namely global and regional stations.

<DD>1.11.1   Global stations were formerly called "baseline" stations.   They are established to provide measurements needed to
address atmospheric environmental issues of global scale and importance, currently those given in paragraph 1.6 (ii) (a) above.

<DD>1.11.2   Regional stations were formerly known as "regional stations", "continental stations" and/or "regional stations with
extended programmes".   They are established to provide measurements primarily to help assess regional aspects of global
atmospheric environmental issues and atmospheric environmental problems in various regions or countries, in particular those
listed in paragraph 1.6 (ii) (b) above.

<DD>1.11.3   Countries operating stations under other global, regional or national programmes which might be to interest to GAW are
encouraged to offer their data for inclusion in the growing GAW data pool.   Examples of such "contributing" stations from which
GAW currently benefits are stations belonging to the EMEP (CO-operative Programme for Monitoring and Evaluation of the Long-Range
Transmission of Air Pollution in Europe).

<DD>1.11.4   Efforts are also continuing to step up co-operation between GAW and the WHO programme on urban and industrial air
pollution monitoring.


<DT><H2><I><B>Network density</B></I></H2>

<DD>1.12     It is currently considered that the required number of global stations should be such that a minimum of one per
principal climatic zone and per major biome is achieved.

<DD>1.13     As for regional stations, their number should allow regional aspects of global environmental issues and environmental
problems of interest to the region or country(ies) concerned to be adequately addressed.


<DT><H2><I><B>Criteria for siting stations</B></I></H2>

<DD>1.14     Despite the difficulty of finding locations where suitable conditions are met often enough and evenly enough through
the year and on a long-term basis, siting criteria have been determined for GAW stations.

         In principle, and depending on the measurement component:

         (a)   global station should be preferably located in remote (if possible pristine) areas where:

              (i)    no significant changes in land-use practices are expected for at least 50 years within a reasonable distance
                     (30-50 km) in all directions from the stations; away from major populations and industrial centres, away from
                     major highways and airports; if possible on islands, mountain ranges and major forest reserves;

              (ii)   effects of natural phenomena such as volcanic eruptions, forest fires and dust storms are not frequently
                     experienced;

              (iii)  it can be reasonably assumed that the ambient air at the station is entirely free of the influence of local
                     pollution sources, nearly free of the influence of regional pollution sources ar least 60% of the time evenly
                     distributed over the year, and contains only diluted vestiges of chemical components carried to the site by
                     the long-range transport from sources located at least 30-50 kilometres away;

              (iv)   a full programme of surface meteorological observations is carried out and an upper air station is not
                     farther away than 50-70 km.

        (b) regional stations should be located:

              (i)    preferably in rural areas, at any rate sufficiently far away from population and industrial centres,
                     so that the effect of local sources of air pollution is absent at the station most of the year;

              (ii)   on, or close to meteorological/climatological stations making surface and rawindsonde observations.

<DD>1.15     Other criteria of prospective measurements include: availability and interest of scientists, existence of a suitable
infrastructure, relevance to national and/or regional issues (especially in developing countries).



<DT><H2><I><B>Measurement programme</B></I></H2>

<DD>1.16     GAW global stations are considered as research centres and expected to monitor all or most of the variables listed in
paragraph 1.18 below.

<DD>1.17     Regional stations have a more flexible, less intensive, observational programme, which should include as many or few of
the parameters listed in paragraph 1.18 below and/or others as the needs of the region/country dictate.

<DD>1.18     The recommended GAW measurement programme includes the following components:

         (a) chemical composition of rainfall and snow;

         (b) atmospheric gases, including;

               (i)    greenhouse gases - carbon dioxide; the chlorofluorocarbon, their substitutes, intermediates and final
                      products; methane; nitrous oxide; tropospheric ozone; water vapour

               (ii)   ozone - surface, total column, vertical profile and precursor gases, using ground-based instruments
                      such as spectrophotometers, sondes, lasers, microwaves, as well as satellites;

               (iii)  reactive gas species such as: sulphur dioxide and the reduced sulphur species; nitrogen oxides and the
                      reduced nitrogen species; carbon monoxide;

        (c)  aerosols and optical depth or transparency of the atmosphere, including:

               (i)    total concentrations and physical and chemical characteristics of particles, including mineral aerosols
                      and their vertical profiles;

               (ii)   turbidity, total optical depth, visibility

        (d)  solar radiation including UV-B;

        (e)  radionuclides, including krypton-85, radon, tritium, and the isotopic composition of selected substances.

<DD>1.19     At the time of writing this report (October 1994), QA protocols and manuals were in preparation or planned for each of
the above measurements.



<DT><B><H2>Sampling and chemical analysis</H2></B>

<DD>1.20     The chemical analysis of samples (precipitation water, air filters, flasks, etc.) obtained at GAW stations are normally
carried out at chemical laboratories located in the relevant participating countries.   Recommended laboratory and sample
collection methods for precipitation chemistry are described in References 5.   Each participating country is therefore encouraged
to arrange for the samples from its station(s) to be analyzed in a chemical laboratory within the country.   Such arrangements are
normally made prior to the start of measurements.

<DD>1.21.3   Every two months, the Centre at AES in Canada processes all ozone data (surface, total column, vertical distribution)
and publishes GAW Data Volume III: "Ozone Data for World (ODW)".   The Centre also publishes an "Index" which contains the list
of stations, a station catalogue with information on stations (names, organizations operating the stations, types of observation,
types of instruments used, observation programmes) as well as a catalogue of available ozone data (stations, period, data type,
OWD volume numbers in which the data are contained);

<DD>1.21.4   The Centre at NCDC extracts, processes and prepares for publication the turbidity data.   Data for the years through 1992
have been published in "Global Atmosphere Background Monitoring for Selected Environmental Parameters, BAPMoN Data for (year),
Volume I - Atmospheric Aerosol Optical Depth".   The data of the years 1972 through 1980 were published by the Centre and those of
the years since 1981 are published by the WMO Secretariat.

<DD>1.21.5   The WDCGG at JMA started operations on 1 October 1990.   As described more fully in Reference 6, the WDCGG collects
hourly, daily, monthly and event observations of all trace gases, except ozone; applies procedures for quality control, assessment,
processing and interpretation to the data; publishes a "data report", GAW Data Volume IV, every six months; prepares a "data
summary" every six months; and prepares and publishes a "data catalogue" every two years.   To date (September 1994) the following
titles have been issued:

         WDCGG publication No.:

         1. Data Reporting Manual

         2. Data Report (covering the data period 1967 through August 1992)

         3. Data Report (data received during the period September 1992 through March 1993)

         4. Data Catalogue containing information on the methods of measurements, 

         5. Data Report

         6. CD-ROM containing all data available up to that point in time.

<DD>1.21.6   Until, after many years of dedicated, crucial and much appreciated services, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
discontinued its involvement in GAW-related activities in October 1993, unprocessed data of precipitation chemistry and suspended
particulate matter used to be forwarded from the Centre ar NCDC to the then "WMO Collaborating Centre for Background Air Pollution
Data" which EPA had established in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, USA, most recently within their Analysis and Research
Branch, Atmospheric Research and Exposure Assessment Laboratory.   The WMO Collaborating centre would process, publish (or prepare
for publication) and archive both types of data.   Thus GAW data of precipitation chemistry and suspended particulate matter
through 1984 have been published in GAW Data Volume II which, until then, was entitled continuous atmospheric carbon dioxide and
suspended particulate matter".

<DD>1.21.7   Since October 1993 WMO has been working on arrangements for a replacement centre for precipitation chemistry elsewhere in
North America.

<DD>1.21.8   The WDCA has begun to collect data from GAW station worldwide.   The stations which will be include and the exact details
of the measurements, frequencies of measurements, reporting procedures and other operational aspects are currently being
determined.



<DT><B><H2>Availability</H2></B>

<DD>1.22     Details on GAW data availability on paper, magnetic tapes/diskettes and CD-ROM, as applicable, including conditions and
procedures for ordering, can be obtained directly from the active Centres indicated in paragraph 1.21.2 above.   Copies of
published GAW Data Volumes I, II and IV, subject to availability in stock, can be obtained upon request from the WMO Secretariat.



<DT><B><H2>Quality assurance</H2></B>

<DD>1.23     Data Quality assurance (QA) activities in GAW are at present in the conception/development stage.   In the past, WMO
atmospheric composition activities concentrated on the promotion of measurements, especially for regional stations, and a small
group of investigators from developed countries were, to one degree or another, left to arrange for a QA programme to ensure data
quality for measurements from their countries.   This is true of CO2 measurements, O3 reactive gases, aerosol chemistry and solar
radiation.

<DD>1.24     With the establishment of GAW, WMO has undertaken to strengthen existing quality assurance (QA) programmes and to
implement new ones for measurements not yet covered under a unified QA approach called for in the relevant Technical Regulations.
The GAW QA programme involves the establishment of three Quality Assurance/Science Activity Centres (QA/SACs) in Germany, USA and
Japan, and its goal is to provide a clear, workable structure that will:

         -   deliver quality assured data to the GAW Data Centres, in accordance with defined data quality objectives (DQOs) and
             standard operating procedures (SOPs) as stated in the appropriate Quality Assurance Project Plans (QAPjP):

         -   provide uniform DQOs and clearly defined procedures for data management;

         -   maintain and, where necessary, improve the quality of data by performing management functions that include:

                  training of scientific personnel
                  training of station operating personnel
                  holding of workshops on SOPs, Quality Control (QC) techniques, recurring problems, etc.;
                  design of QC, calibrations, intercomparisons and experiments to prevent and/or resolve problems.

<DD>1.25     under the QA/SACs, GAW QA management will be structured so as to ensure:

         -   station and programme audits
         -   rapid feedback of QA reports and reviews and of QC experiment results that identify the nature of operating problems
             to the personnel operating the stations;
         -   feedback of descriptions of end use and value of data to the GAW sites; and
         -   regular peer reviews of GAW procedures and data, including expert consultations to resolve apparent problems.

<DD>1.26     The proposed overall management structure for GAW QA practically exists.   However, it needs to be focused on a
three-level hierarchy, i.e. local (station), regional and global, with co-ordination by the WMO Secretariat, as sketched.

<CENTER>
<TABLE BORDER="10">
<TR><TD>
<IMG SRC="QAImplementation.gif">
</TD></TR></TABLE>
</CENTER>


<DD>1.27     At the global level, on the advice of the EC Panel of Experts on Atmospheric Chemistry and Environmental Pollution, an
ad-hoc Steering Committee will be designated to oversee QA/SAC activities in order to balance the interests of various GAW data
producers, quality assurance officers, central data and flag archivers, users of the data, and international experts.

<DD>1.28     At the local level, the GAW stations will collect the data in accordance with the GAW DQOs and SOPs and transmit the data,
proposed data flags, and the stations' QC reports to the QA/Science Centres for their regional areas.   This level is the only at
which data changes will be made.

<DD>1.29     At the regional level, the QA/SACs will be the major scientific institutes responsible on a geographical area basis for
QA of all GAW data from the relevant sites.   The Centres will preferably be based at GAW global stations or laboratories.   The
three geographical regions suggested for QA/Science Centres are:

         -   Europe and Africa (WMO Regions VI and I)
         -   The Americas (WMO Region III and IV)
         -   Asia (WMO Region II and V)

<DD>1.30     The GAW QA/SACs will be responsible for critically reviewing and accepting the QA flags to the station data, identifying
and resolving quality performance differences among the stations of their geographical region, giving their station' data and QC
reports a timely review and notifying the stations immediately of any performance problems which are detected.

<DD>1.31     The QA/SACs will also provide reference materials to sites, design QC experiments and expert consultations to resolve
problems and organize training, instrument calibrations and intercomparisons, and workshops.   For more details on QA in GAW see
Reference 7, 8 and 9.



<DT><B><H2>Capacity building</H2></B>

<DD>1.32     To ensure that the developing countries realize the full benefits of GAW and are full partners in addressing the
scientific and environmental policy challenges facing the global community, training courses on background atmospheric composition
measurements are held at appropriate times and a global education and training programme in atmospheric chemistry is currently
under development.


<DT><H2><I><B>Training courses on background atmospheric composition measurements</B></I></H2>

<DD>1.33     Within the framework of the WMO Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW), the objectives of the courses are to train meteorological
personnel - mainly from developing countries - engaged or preparing to engage in scientific and managerial work at or in relation
to GAW regional stations.

<DD>1.34     The successful trainees are expected, after the courses, to be qualified to carry out the following duties in their home
countries:

         (a) supervision of observers who in turn are responsible for the operation of the instruments used to make the
             observations, the preparation of the final data products from the instrument readings, the application of quality
             control to the data, the timely reporting of the data to the appropriate GAW data centres and their archiving within
             the country;

         (b) supervision of instrument technicians trained for the testing, calibration, first line maintenance and repair of the
             instruments;

         (c) liaison with the chemical laboratory where the samples collected at the station(s) are analyzed;

         (d) interpretation of GAW data and other information and their applications to the solution of atmospheric environment
             problems of concern to the country;

         (e) scientific and technical aspects of the work of the station(s) at the national and international levels.


<DT><H2><I><B>Global education and training programme in atmospheric chemistry</B></I></H2>

<DD>1.35     Agenda 21 calls for new partnerships that cut across isolated compartments that many scientific communities and
organizations have long found comfortable.   The new "indigenous capacity building" programme in atmospheric chemistry is sponsored
by the Global Atmosphere Watch of WMO, the international Global Atmospheric Chemistry (IGAC) Project of the international
Geosphere/Biosphere Programme (IGBP), the Global Change System for Analysis, Research and Training (START) and the Education and
Training Division of the American Geophysical Union (AGU).   It sets out to organize an international team of volunteer scientists
to: (a) teach atmospheric chemistry in areas around the world where new GAW global stations are being established; (b) help
establish atmospheric chemistry programmes at universities and training centres in developing countries; and (c) work to establish
long-term co-operative arrangements with relevant academia, global research and monitoring programmes, and professional societies.

<HR>

<H3><B>Functions of a QA/SAC</B></H3>
<P>

The QA/SACs provide to WMO the communications and constructive assistance 
necessary for maintaining consistent and known data quality in the GAW Programme 
so that it can achieve its monitoring goals.   They are an essential and 
integral part of the GAW network and the operational mechanism for harmonization and 
coordination of GAW activities.   The approach shall be scientists helping 
scientists.
<P>

The QA/SACs will facilitate transfer of knowledge, experience, and expertise within 
the network to ensure common practices.   All GAW participants will abide by the
WMO policies and the QA/SAC procedures and methodologies to produce data bases 
of consistent and known quality.   Although the country supporting the GAW site 
remains the primary owner of its sites' data and may release them as agreed with 
WMO, the data can only be accepted as GAW data after completing the quality 
assurance/quality control (QA/QC) procedures for GAW.   While the QA/SACs 
perform a network-wide quality review, the site Principal Scientist (PI)[PI = Principal Investigator] 
has primary responsibility for the quality of the data generated at his/her site.
   The QA/SACs will help establish and foster research ties among site PIs and with 
users of GAW data bases to ensure relevance to international scientific and policy concerns.
<P>

The QA/SACs will be advised by a policy advisory board of neutral experts and 
technical advisory groups which include site PIs.   The QA/SAC is envisaged as a 
small core of people who establish short-term of experts to perform the majority 
of functions.   The effectiveness of the QA programme and QA/SAC procedures will be 
reviewed by WMO on regular bases.   An interim review of the QA/SAC system shall 
be conducted by members of the policy advisory board to identify necessary 
corrective actions one year after operation commences.
<P><P>

<H3><B>Specific Duties of QA/SACs</B></H3>
<P>

A regional QA/SAC should in general be responsible for only the sites within its 
own region.
<BR>
The specific duties include:
<P>

<UL>
 <LI>Management of Preparation of QA Plans for Environmental Variables
<OL>
  <LI>ensure the production of specifications for DQOs, QAPjPs, lists of supporting
  <LI>information to be supplied, and the corresponding protocols for flags
  <LI>perform pilot studies to test QA procedures in a limited scale before full
  <LI>implementation
  <LI>coordinate activities among all QA/SACs
</OL>
<BR><BR>

 <LI>QA Support
<OL>
  <LI>design and lead QC tests in consultation with sites to resolve performance questions
  <LI>prepare (or identify existing) QA/QC and data-transfer protocols
  <LI>prepare QC activity schedule; site-visit, expert consultations (performance and system audits),
 calibrations, and intercomparisons
  <LI>promote twinning arrangements between sites.   The duties of twins should be elaborated by the QA/SACs.
   Once twinning arrangements have been formalized by WMO, the QA/SAC has the responsibility to implement
 (and monitor) the twinning arrangements
  <LI>identify source of standards and instructions for usage (provide if necessary)
  <LI>periodically review site adequacy (in specific situations, QA activities may be delegated to
 appropriate expert groups outside the GAW network)
  <LI>QA/SAC responsibility to from audit teams.   Audit teams to be constructed from authorities
 in the field of measurement, including personnel of successful GAW sites
  <LI>a total management system audit must be performed at regular frequency, covering data flow
 management from the GAW site to the data centres, to identify effectiveness of the data flow.
</OL>
<BR><BR>

 <LI>Management Review of Data and QC Products
<OL>
  <LI>perform quality checks on data streams and QA products (primary quality checks must be performed by the site PI.)
  <LI>transmit data, metdata, and flags to data centre following review within about 15 working days
  <LI>if review has not occurred within specified time, transmit data, metdata, and flags to data centre with a flag indicating that review has been delayed
  <LI>until QA procedures are fully implemented, all data, metdata and flags will pass through the QA/SAC with flags where appropriate, indicating that the QA/SAC has not review a part of the data because the QA procedure for that part has not been elaborated.   During initiation of the QA/SAC, interim arrangements should be put in place allowing parallel data flows to the QA/SAC and the data centre for a specified period of time (length of time at discretion of QA/SAC) to ensure the effectiveness of the new QA.SAC procedures.   There should be a flag indicating this situation
  <LI>the QA/SAC will take phased approach in the introduction of QA procedures for specific variables, and the inclusion of regional sites
  <LI>allocate station performance categories.
</OL>
<BR><BR>

 <LI>Training
<OL>
  <LI>develop an ongoing, network-specific educational programme
  <LI>prepare development plans for technical personnel and certification procedures to ensure that personnel involved in station operations are properly trained.
</OL>
<BR><BR>

 <LI> Communication and Dissemination of Information
<OL>
  <LI>establish a communications network (e.g., e-mail)
  <LI>promote awareness of technological changes
  <LI>arrange periodic review meeting (including scientists, technicians, and operators from GAW and other scientists whose work is of relevance to GAW) to present scientists, exchange technical information, and facilitate coordination of QA procedures
  <LI>cooperate with international scientific programmes involved in atmospheric research such as the International Global Atmospheric Chemistry Programme (IGBP-IGAC).

<LI>      <FONT SIZE=+2>E</FONT>ven before the establishment of the World Meteorological Organization's World Climate Program (WCP),
the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), other related agencies and universities started the significant parts
of on-going programs of climate observations, monitoring, prediction and research.   We summarize the Japan
Meteorological Agency's activities and describe perspectives in the future.
<P>

<LI>      <FONT SIZE=+2>T</FONT>he JMA's Climate Program is being conducted based on "Guidelines for Promotion of the Climate Program"
issued in June, 1981 and "Basic Plan for Climate Research" in April, 1982, which were established in response
to the WCP; the program is being coordinated within the framework of international cooperations involving
observation and monitoring, research, and information exchange related to climate change.
<P><P><P><P>

<LI><H3><I>
Observations
</I></H3>

      <FONT SIZE=+2>T</FONT>he most important elements in climate observations are the regular surface observations such as temperature
and precipitation, the oceanographic observations such as sea water temperature and sea level.   Japan's observations
are well coordinated with the WMO's World Weather Watch (WWW) program, the Integrated Global Ocean Services
System (IGOSS), and Global Sea-Level Observing System (GLOSS).   In addition, as part of the WMO's Global Atmosphere
Watch (GAW), Japan carries out observations of background levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases and ozone-depleting
substances and the ozone layer and harmful ultraviolet rays.   Japan has played a leading role of oceanographic
observations of greenhouse gases as well as other substances in the sea surface air and in seawater by means of
regular surveys by research vessels in the northwestern Pacific.
<P><P><P>

<LI><H3><I>
Climate data
</I></H3>

      <FONT SIZE=+2>F</FONT>or over one hundred years, the JMA has been collecting and archiving climate data.   In June 1990,
Japan Climatic Data Center (JCDC) was established to play the role of WMO's Data Centre for Greenhouse Gases (WDCGG);
the JCDC collects and archives global data on carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases and is building a global data base
in other to analyze long-term greenhouse gas trends.   Data and results of their analyses are disseminated international
through data report, data catalogue, data summaries, etc.
<P><P><P>

Climate monitoring
</I></H3>

      <FONT SIZE=+2>M</FONT>onthly Report on Climate System" have been published since 1987, and the El Ni&ntilde;o Monitoring Center which was
established to strengthen the monitoring and prediction of changes in the ocean climate, particularly in the tropical
Pacific, has published the "El Ni&ntilde;o Monitoring Report" and "JMA Monthly Ocean Report" since April 1992.   As part of the
agency's efforts to step up its observations and monitoring of the global environment in response to recent concerns about
global warning, ozone depletion and other climate changes, the "Annual Report of Ozone Layer Monitoring" has been published
since 1990 and "Monitoring of Global Warning and Ozone Depletion", annually since 1992.   These provide information on the
concentrations of greenhouse gases and their effects on global warning, climate change trends, and the condition of the ozone
layer.
<P><P><P>

<LI><H3><I>
Research
</I></H3>

      <FONT SIZE=+2>V</FONT>arious researches are being carried out in coordination with the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) and other
international cooperative research programs; researches on clouds and radiations, oceanic variations, processes in
the carbon cycle, the mechanisms of El Ni&ntilde;o events and global warning and their prediction using coupled ocean-atmosphere
general circulation models, ozone depletion, acid precipitation, desertification, etc.   Especially with regard to the global
warning issue of public concern, progress is being made in developing coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation climate
models for achieving more reliable predictions.   In coordination with the IPCC's activities, climate prediction experiments
are being carried out to simulate transient climate responses to gradually increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide.

        <FONT SIZE=+2>G</FONT>reenhouse Gases including carbon dioxide (CO<SUB>2</SUB>), methane (CH<SUB>4</SUB>), chlorofluorocarbons
   (CFCs), nitrous oxide (N<SUB>2</SUB>O) and ozone (O<SUB>3</SUB>) allow the solar radiation to penetrate the
   Earth's atmosphere but absorb and re-emit infrared radiation from the Earth.   They thus
   trap heat and cause warm to the surface and the troposphere of the Earth.   With the
   development in human activities, atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and
   other greenhouse gases have been rising year after year, and it is feared that global
   warming will rapidly accelerate.

Increase in Atmospheric Concentrations of Carbon Dioxide
</H3></B>
<BR>

<PRE>
        <FONT SIZE=+2>C</FONT>arbon dioxide (CO<SUB>2</SUB>) is one of the most important greenhouse gases.   Until the
   industrial revolution, atmospheric concentration of CO<SUB>2</SUB> was between 270 and 280ppmv
   (parts per million by volume), but since then, because of the increasing use of fossil fuels,
   the concentration has increased remarkably.

        <FONT SIZE=+2>O</FONT>n the occasion of the International Geophysical Year in 1958, continuous modern
   measurement of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration began at Mauna Loa in
   Hawaii and at the South Pole.   Under the framework of the Global Atmosphere Watch
   (GAW) of the  World Meteorological Organization (WMO), CO<SUB>2</SUB> levels are now observed
   globally at about 60 locations; including two in Japan: Ryori (since 1987), northern part of
   Japan, and Minamitorishima Island (since 1993), isolated in the western north Pacific.

        <FONT SIZE=+2>V</FONT>alues for carbon dioxide concentrations before 1957 are obtained by analyzing air bubbles
   trapped in ice cores in Antarctica, etc.

        <FONT SIZE=+2>T</FONT>he carbon dioxide concentration data observed over many years at Mauna Loa, South
   Pole, Ryori, and other observatories show clearly that carbon dioxide are increasing year
   after year with seasonal variations.   The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
   (IPCC) established by WMO and the United Environmental Programme (UNEP) estimates the globally
   averaged carbon dioxide concentration in 1992 to be about 355ppmv and the annual growth rate
   to be about 1.5ppmv (about 0.4% per year).

        The following is an explanatory note, though a little modified, cited by the WDCGG from the
explanatory note of the NOAA Flask Network.

        NOAA/CMDL has attempted to provide the most accurate and precise measurements possible in a
timely manner.   NOAA/CMDL reserves the right to adjust the data based on recalibrations of reference
gases and instruments.   The CO2 mixing ratios reported were measured by a nondispersive infrared
absorption technique in air samples collected in glass flasks at NOAA/CMDL flask network sites.  
Descriptions of the sampling, measurement, and calibration procedures are given in <I>Komhyr et al.</I>, 1983;
<I>Komhyr et al.</I>, 1985; and <I>Thoning et al.</I>, 1987.  Analysis and interpretation of the data have been
reported by <I>Komhyr et al.</I>, 1985; <I>Conway et al.</I>,1988; <I>Tans et al.</I>, 1989; <I>Tans et al.</I>, 1990 and <I>Conway
et al.</I>, 1994.  Thirty seven of the land-based sites were active in 1992.  Sampling at Ocean Station Charlie
was discontinued in 1973, and sampling at St. Croix was discontinued in 1990.   Also included are data
from three shipboard flask sampling programs.  Samples are collected at approximately 5 degree latitude
intervals on regular cruises of the Southland Star and Wellington Star in the Pacific Ocean between the
west coast of the U.S. and New Zealand.  Samples are also collected at 3 degree latitude intervals aboard
the Carla A. Hills on regular cruises in the South China Sea between Hong Kong and Singapore.   The
Data Report doesn't include the data of Carla A. Hills because they have not been updated since last
Report publishing.   The data contain CO<SUB>2</SUB> mixing ratios and relevant sampling and analysis information
for each flask sample. The monthly means were calculated from a smooth curve obtained by a combination of
curve fitting and digital filtering based on the methods of <I>Thoning et al.</I>, 1989, and <I>Tans et al.</I>, 1989b.
For Southland Star and Wellington Star, the sampling frequency in each latitude bin is insufficient to
calculate monthly means.   Therefore, NOAA/CMDL has merged the Southland Star's and Wellington Star's data
for each bin, and calculated monthly means for the fourteen 5-degree latitude bins from 30 degrees north
to 35 degrees south.

<B>Data selection procedures used :</B>
   Prevailing wind directions are SW to NW.

   1981-1982   Data representative for marine sector (270&#176; through 040o clockwise) are selected.
   1983-1984   Data selected for winds superior to 4 m/s and marine sector (300&#176; through 040&#176; clockwise).
   1985-1989   Data are selected for winds from;
               (1) a sector of 300&#176; through 040&#176; clockwise with velocities higher than 4 m/s,
               (2) a sector of 260&#176; through 300&#176; clockwise with velocities higher than 8 m/s,
   1990-       Data are selected for winds from;
               (1) a sector of 300&#176; through 050&#176; clockwise with velocities higher than or equal to 5 m/s,
               (2) a sector of 260&#176; through 300&#176; clockwise with velocities higher than 8 m/s,
   Note: The lack of the data from January 1985 to March 1985 is due to the interruption of the measurements during
         the building of the new station.

        The following is an explanatory note, though a little modified, cited by the WDCGG from the
explanatory note of the NOAA Flask Network.

        NOAA/CMDL has attempted to provide the most accurate and precise measurements possible in a
timely manner.   NOAA/CMDL reserves the right to adjust the data based on recalibrations of reference
gases and instruments.   The CO2 mixing ratios reported were measured by a nondispersive infrared
absorption technique in air samples collected in glass flasks at NOAA/CMDL flask network sites.  
Descriptions of the sampling, measurement, and calibration procedures are given in <I>Komhyr et al.</I>, 1983;
<I>Komhyr et al.</I>, 1985; and <I>Thoning et al.</I>, 1987.  Analysis and interpretation of the data have been
reported by <I>Komhyr et al.</I>, 1985; <I>Conway et al.</I>,1988; <I>Tans et al.</I>, 1989; <I>Tans et al.</I>, 1990 and <I>Conway
et al.</I>, 1994.  Thirty seven of the land-based sites were active in 1992.  Sampling at Ocean Station Charlie
was discontinued in 1973, and sampling at St. Croix was discontinued in 1990.   Also included are data
from three shipboard flask sampling programs.  Samples are collected at approximately 5 degree latitude
intervals on regular cruises of the Southland Star and Wellington Star in the Pacific Ocean between the
west coast of the U.S. and New Zealand.  Samples are also collected at 3 degree latitude intervals aboard
the Carla A. Hills on regular cruises in the South China Sea between Hong Kong and Singapore.   The
Data Report doesn't include the data of Carla A. Hills because they have not been updated since last
Report publishing.   The data contain CO<SUB>2</SUB> mixing ratios and relevant sampling and analysis information
for each flask sample. The monthly means were calculated from a smooth curve obtained by a combination of
curve fitting and digital filtering based on the methods of <I>Thoning et al.</I>, 1989, and <I>Tans et al.</I>, 1989b.
For Southland Star and Wellington Star, the sampling frequency in each latitude bin is insufficient to
calculate monthly means.   Therefore, NOAA/CMDL has merged the Southland Star's and Wellington Star's data
for each bin, and calculated monthly means for the fourteen 5-degree latitude bins from 30 degrees north
to 35 degrees south.

<B>Authors      :</B> A. Shashkov, N. Paramonova, V. Privalov, Y. Starodubtzev

<B>Organization :</B> Main Geophysical Observatory

<B>Address      :</B> Karbyshev Street 7, St. Petersburg, 194018 Russia

<B>Site Position and description :</B>
   55&#176; 12&#180; N, 165&#176; 59&#180; E,  10 msl,  island seashore

<B>Sampling method, frequency and measurements technique :</B>
   Before 1986 samples were collected into glass flasks of 0.5l.  Since 1986 they are collected into stainless steel flasks 1.5l, with
   electro-polished inner walls, four times per month; analyzed by NDIR in Leningrad.

<B>Scientific aims and scope of measurements :</B>
   Monitor atmospheric CO<SUB>2</SUB> increase

<B>Data selection procedures used for daily values :</B>
   Numbers in the body of table are the monthly mean values, calculated on the base of daily mean values, selected as follows:
        The daily mean values are the averages for two CO<SUB>2</SUB> concentrations, measured in two simultaneously sampled flasks, if difference
   between these measured concentration value is less or equal 1 ppmv.  Otherwise, lower of two measured value is included in the table
   as a daily value if it does not differ from the smoothed concentration curve for more than 2 standard deviations.  Those "single value
   data" are flagged in accordance with the convention, accepted at the WDCGG manual.  Technically invalid data were also removed.
        All accepted data for the samples with the water vapor partial pressure e>2.2mbar.   Were corrected for storage time,
   using the experimental formula:

                        dC=-(0.0023<SUP>*</SUP>e-0.005)<SUP>*</SUP>t,

   where dC-is an additive correction to the measured concentration values, e-is water vapor partial pressure in the air sample (mb),
   and t-is storage time for a sample: from sampling to analyses date.  Samples with less humidity were not subjected to any correction at all.

<B>Calibration gases used :</B>
   CO<SUB>2</SUB>-in-synthetic air reference gases were primarily used for calibration.  Those gases were initially calibrated at the Scripps Institution of
   Oceanography in 1981.  The CO<SUB>2</SUB> concentration values in this set cover the range 318-354 ppmv.
   In 1990-1993 the calibration experiments were performed by us, using the set of 5 CO<SUB>2</SUB>-in-air tertiary gas standards provided by the Atmospheric
   Environment Service of Canada.  In 1990-1993 all our data were recalculated according the results of these calibrations.

<B>Scale of reported data :</B> SIO X87 mole fraction scale.

<B>Acknowledgment :</B>
   We are grateful to the sincere help in our work Dr. Shchukin - the Director of Scientific Research Remote Sensing Center, Dr. Neil Trivett of
   the Atmospheric Environment Service of Canada, Dr. J. Miller of WMO, the Central European University of George Soros Foundation and the
   international CO<SUB>2</SUB> society for kind patronage of our work.

        The following is an explanatory note, though a little modified, cited by the WDCGG from the
explanatory note of the NOAA Flask Network.

        NOAA/CMDL has attempted to provide the most accurate and precise measurements possible in a
timely manner.   NOAA/CMDL reserves the right to adjust the data based on recalibrations of reference
gases and instruments.   The CO<SUB>2</SUB> mixing ratios reported were measured by a nondispersive infrared
absorption technique in air samples collected in glass flasks at NOAA/CMDL flask network sites.  
Descriptions of the sampling, measurement, and calibration procedures are given in <I>Komhyr et al.</I>, 1983;
<I>Komhyr et al.</I>, 1985; and <I>Thoning et al.</I>, 1987.  Analysis and interpretation of the data have been
reported by <I>Komhyr et al.</I>, 1985; <I>Conway et al.</I>,1988; <I>Tans et al.</I>, 1989; <I>Tans et al.</I>, 1990 and <I>Conway
et al.</I>, 1994.  Thirty seven of the land-based sites were active in 1992.  Sampling at Ocean Station Charlie
was discontinued in 1973, and sampling at St. Croix was discontinued in 1990.   Also included are data
from three shipboard flask sampling programs.  Samples are collected at approximately 5 degree latitude
intervals on regular cruises of the Southland Star and Wellington Star in the Pacific Ocean between the
west coast of the U.S. and New Zealand.  Samples are also collected at 3 degree latitude intervals aboard
the Carla A. Hills on regular cruises in the South China Sea between Hong Kong and Singapore.   The
Data Report doesn't include the data of Carla A. Hills because they have not been updated since last
Report publishing.   The data contain CO<SUB>2</SUB> mixing ratios and relevant sampling and analysis information
for each flask sample. The monthly means were calculated from a smooth curve obtained by a combination of
curve fitting and digital filtering based on the methods of <I>Thoning et al.</I>, 1989, and <I>Tans et al.</I>, 1989b.
For Southland Star and Wellington Star, the sampling frequency in each latitude bin is insufficient to
calculate monthly means.   Therefore, NOAA/CMDL has merged the Southland Star's and Wellington Star's data
for each bin, and calculated monthly means for the fourteen 5-degree latitude bins from 30 degrees north
to 35 degrees south.

        The following is an explanatory note, though a little modified, cited by the WDCGG from the
explanatory note of the NOAA Flask Network.

        NOAA/CMDL has attempted to provide the most accurate and precise measurements possible in a
timely manner.   NOAA/CMDL reserves the right to adjust the data based on recalibrations of reference
gases and instruments.   The CO<SUB>2</SUB> mixing ratios reported were measured by a nondispersive infrared
absorption technique in air samples collected in glass flasks at NOAA/CMDL flask network sites.  
Descriptions of the sampling, measurement, and calibration procedures are given in <I>Komhyr et al.</I>, 1983;
<I>Komhyr et al.</I>, 1985; and <I>Thoning et al.</I>, 1987.  Analysis and interpretation of the data have been
reported by <I>Komhyr et al.</I>, 1985; <I>Conway et al.</I>,1988; <I>Tans et al.</I>, 1989; <I>Tans et al.</I>, 1990 and <I>Conway
et al.</I>, 1994.  Thirty seven of the land-based sites were active in 1992.  Sampling at Ocean Station Charlie
was discontinued in 1973, and sampling at St. Croix was discontinued in 1990.   Also included are data
from three shipboard flask sampling programs.  Samples are collected at approximately 5 degree latitude
intervals on regular cruises of the Southland Star and Wellington Star in the Pacific Ocean between the
west coast of the U.S. and New Zealand.  Samples are also collected at 3 degree latitude intervals aboard
the Carla A. Hills on regular cruises in the South China Sea between Hong Kong and Singapore.   The
Data Report doesn't include the data of Carla A. Hills because they have not been updated since last
Report publishing.   The data contain CO<SUB>2</SUB> mixing ratios and relevant sampling and analysis information
for each flask sample. The monthly means were calculated from a smooth curve obtained by a combination of
curve fitting and digital filtering based on the methods of <I>Thoning et al.</I>, 1989, and <I>Tans et al.</I>, 1989b.
For Southland Star and Wellington Star, the sampling frequency in each latitude bin is insufficient to
calculate monthly means.   Therefore, NOAA/CMDL has merged the Southland Star's and Wellington Star's data
for each bin, and calculated monthly means for the fourteen 5-degree latitude bins from 30 degrees north
to 35 degrees south.

        The following is an explanatory note, though a little modified, cited by the WDCGG from the
explanatory note of the NOAA Flask Network.

        NOAA/CMDL has attempted to provide the most accurate and precise measurements possible in a
timely manner.   NOAA/CMDL reserves the right to adjust the data based on recalibrations of reference
gases and instruments.   The CO<SUB>2</SUB> mixing ratios reported were measured by a nondispersive infrared
absorption technique in air samples collected in glass flasks at NOAA/CMDL flask network sites.  
Descriptions of the sampling, measurement, and calibration procedures are given in <I>Komhyr et al.</I>, 1983;
<I>Komhyr et al.</I>, 1985; and <I>Thoning et al.</I>, 1987.  Analysis and interpretation of the data have been
reported by <I>Komhyr et al.</I>, 1985; <I>Conway et al.</I>,1988; <I>Tans et al.</I>, 1989; <I>Tans et al.</I>, 1990 and <I>Conway
et al.</I>, 1994.  Thirty seven of the land-based sites were active in 1992.  Sampling at Ocean Station Charlie
was discontinued in 1973, and sampling at St. Croix was discontinued in 1990.   Also included are data
from three shipboard flask sampling programs.  Samples are collected at approximately 5 degree latitude
intervals on regular cruises of the Southland Star and Wellington Star in the Pacific Ocean between the
west coast of the U.S. and New Zealand.  Samples are also collected at 3 degree latitude intervals aboard
the Carla A. Hills on regular cruises in the South China Sea between Hong Kong and Singapore.   The
Data Report doesn't include the data of Carla A. Hills because they have not been updated since last
Report publishing.   The data contain CO<SUB>2</SUB> mixing ratios and relevant sampling and analysis information
for each flask sample. The monthly means were calculated from a smooth curve obtained by a combination of
curve fitting and digital filtering based on the methods of <I>Thoning et al.</I>, 1989, and <I>Tans et al.</I>, 1989b.
For Southland Star and Wellington Star, the sampling frequency in each latitude bin is insufficient to
calculate monthly means.   Therefore, NOAA/CMDL has merged the Southland Star's and Wellington Star's data
for each bin, and calculated monthly means for the fourteen 5-degree latitude bins from 30 degrees north
to 35 degrees south.

reported by <I>Komhyr et al.</I>, 1985; <I>Conway et al.</I>,1988; <I>Tans et al.</I>, 1989; <I>Tans et al.</I>, 1990 and <I>Conway
et al.</I>, 1994.  Thirty seven of the land-based sites were active in 1992.  Sampling at Ocean Station Charlie
was discontinued in 1973, and sampling at St. Croix was discontinued in 1990.   Also included are data
from three shipboard flask sampling programs.  Samples are collected at approximately 5 degree latitude
intervals on regular cruises of the Southland Star and Wellington Star in the Pacific Ocean between the
west coast of the U.S. and New Zealand.  Samples are also collected at 3 degree latitude intervals aboard
the Carla A. Hills on regular cruises in the South China Sea between Hong Kong and Singapore.   The
Data Report doesn't include the data of Carla A. Hills because they have not been updated since last
Report publishing.   The data contain CO<SUB>2</SUB> mixing ratios and relevant sampling and analysis information
for each flask sample. The monthly means were calculated from a smooth curve obtained by a combination of
curve fitting and digital filtering based on the methods of <I>Thoning et al.</I>, 1989, and <I>Tans et al.</I>, 1989b.
For Southland Star and Wellington Star, the sampling frequency in each latitude bin is insufficient to
calculate monthly means.   Therefore, NOAA/CMDL has merged the Southland Star's and Wellington Star's data
for each bin, and calculated monthly means for the fourteen 5-degree latitude bins from 30 degrees north
to 35 degrees south.

        The following is an explanatory note, though a little modified, cited by the WDCGG from the
explanatory note of the NOAA Flask Network.

        NOAA/CMDL has attempted to provide the most accurate and precise measurements possible in a
timely manner.   NOAA/CMDL reserves the right to adjust the data based on recalibrations of reference
gases and instruments.   The CO<SUB>2</SUB> mixing ratios reported were measured by a nondispersive infrared
absorption technique in air samples collected in glass flasks at NOAA/CMDL flask network sites.  
Descriptions of the sampling, measurement, and calibration procedures are given in <I>Komhyr et al.</I>, 1983;
<I>Komhyr et al.</I>, 1985; and <I>Thoning et al.</I>, 1987.  Analysis and interpretation of the data have been
reported by <I>Komhyr et al.</I>, 1985; <I>Conway et al.</I>,1988; <I>Tans et al.</I>, 1989; <I>Tans et al.</I>, 1990 and <I>Conway
et al.</I>, 1994.  Thirty seven of the land-based sites were active in 1992.  Sampling at Ocean Station Charlie
was discontinued in 1973, and sampling at St. Croix was discontinued in 1990.   Also included are data
from three shipboard flask sampling programs.  Samples are collected at approximately 5 degree latitude
intervals on regular cruises of the Southland Star and Wellington Star in the Pacific Ocean between the
west coast of the U.S. and New Zealand.  Samples are also collected at 3 degree latitude intervals aboard
the Carla A. Hills on regular cruises in the South China Sea between Hong Kong and Singapore.   The
Data Report doesn't include the data of Carla A. Hills because they have not been updated since last
Report publishing.   The data contain CO<SUB>2</SUB> mixing ratios and relevant sampling and analysis information
for each flask sample. The monthly means were calculated from a smooth curve obtained by a combination of
curve fitting and digital filtering based on the methods of <I>Thoning et al.</I>, 1989, and <I>Tans et al.</I>, 1989b.
For Southland Star and Wellington Star, the sampling frequency in each latitude bin is insufficient to
calculate monthly means.   Therefore, NOAA/CMDL has merged the Southland Star's and Wellington Star's data
for each bin, and calculated monthly means for the fourteen 5-degree latitude bins from 30 degrees north
to 35 degrees south.

        The following is an explanatory note, though a little modified, cited by the WDCGG from the
explanatory note of the NOAA Flask Network.

        NOAA/CMDL has attempted to provide the most accurate and precise measurements possible in a
timely manner.   NOAA/CMDL reserves the right to adjust the data based on recalibrations of reference
gases and instruments.   The CO<SUB>2</SUB> mixing ratios reported were measured by a nondispersive infrared
absorption technique in air samples collected in glass flasks at NOAA/CMDL flask network sites.  
Descriptions of the sampling, measurement, and calibration procedures are given in <I>Komhyr et al.</I>, 1983;
<I>Komhyr et al.</I>, 1985; and <I>Thoning et al.</I>, 1987.  Analysis and interpretation of the data have been
reported by <I>Komhyr et al.</I>, 1985; <I>Conway et al.</I>,1988; <I>Tans et al.</I>, 1989; <I>Tans et al.</I>, 1990 and <I>Conway
et al.</I>, 1994.  Thirty seven of the land-based sites were active in 1992.  Sampling at Ocean Station Charlie
was discontinued in 1973, and sampling at St. Croix was discontinued in 1990.   Also included are data
from three shipboard flask sampling programs.  Samples are collected at approximately 5 degree latitude
intervals on regular cruises of the Southland Star and Wellington Star in the Pacific Ocean between the
west coast of the U.S. and New Zealand.  Samples are also collected at 3 degree latitude intervals aboard
the Carla A. Hills on regular cruises in the South China Sea between Hong Kong and Singapore.   The
Data Report doesn't include the data of Carla A. Hills because they have not been updated since last
Report publishing.   The data contain CO<SUB>2</SUB> mixing ratios and relevant sampling and analysis information
for each flask sample. The monthly means were calculated from a smooth curve obtained by a combination of
curve fitting and digital filtering based on the methods of <I>Thoning et al.</I>, 1989, and <I>Tans et al.</I>, 1989b.
For Southland Star and Wellington Star, the sampling frequency in each latitude bin is insufficient to
calculate monthly means.   Therefore, NOAA/CMDL has merged the Southland Star's and Wellington Star's data
for each bin, and calculated monthly means for the fourteen 5-degree latitude bins from 30 degrees north
to 35 degrees south.

curve fitting and digital filtering based on the methods of <I>Thoning et al.</I>, 1989, and <I>Tans et al.</I>, 1989b.
For Southland Star and Wellington Star, the sampling frequency in each latitude bin is insufficient to
calculate monthly means.   Therefore, NOAA/CMDL has merged the Southland Star's and Wellington Star's data
for each bin, and calculated monthly means for the fourteen 5-degree latitude bins from 30 degrees north
to 35 degrees south.

        The following is an explanatory note, though a little modified, cited by the WDCGG from the
explanatory note of the NOAA Flask Network.

        NOAA/CMDL has attempted to provide the most accurate and precise measurements possible in a
timely manner.   NOAA/CMDL reserves the right to adjust the data based on recalibrations of reference
gases and instruments.   The CO<SUB>2</SUB> mixing ratios reported were measured by a nondispersive infrared
absorption technique in air samples collected in glass flasks at NOAA/CMDL flask network sites.  
Descriptions of the sampling, measurement, and calibration procedures are given in <I>Komhyr et al.</I>, 1983;
<I>Komhyr et al.</I>, 1985; and <I>Thoning et al.</I>, 1987.  Analysis and interpretation of the data have been
reported by <I>Komhyr et al.</I>, 1985; <I>Conway et al.</I>,1988; <I>Tans et al.</I>, 1989; <I>Tans et al.</I>, 1990 and <I>Conway
et al.</I>, 1994.  Thirty seven of the land-based sites were active in 1992.  Sampling at Ocean Station Charlie
was discontinued in 1973, and sampling at St. Croix was discontinued in 1990.   Also included are data
from three shipboard flask sampling programs.  Samples are collected at approximately 5 degree latitude
intervals on regular cruises of the Southland Star and Wellington Star in the Pacific Ocean between the
west coast of the U.S. and New Zealand.  Samples are also collected at 3 degree latitude intervals aboard
the Carla A. Hills on regular cruises in the South China Sea between Hong Kong and Singapore.   The
Data Report doesn't include the data of Carla A. Hills because they have not been updated since last
Report publishing.   The data contain CO<SUB>2</SUB> mixing ratios and relevant sampling and analysis information
for each flask sample. The monthly means were calculated from a smooth curve obtained by a combination of
curve fitting and digital filtering based on the methods of <I>Thoning et al.</I>, 1989, and <I>Tans et al.</I>, 1989b.
For Southland Star and Wellington Star, the sampling frequency in each latitude bin is insufficient to

        NOAA/CMDL has attempted to provide the most accurate and precise measurements possible in a
timely manner.   NOAA/CMDL reserves the right to adjust the data based on recalibrations of reference
gases and instruments.   The CO<SUB>2</SUB> mixing ratios reported were measured by a nondispersive infrared
absorption technique in air samples collected in glass flasks at NOAA/CMDL flask network sites.  
Descriptions of the sampling, measurement, and calibration procedures are given in <I>Komhyr et al.</I>, 1983;
<I>Komhyr et al.</I>, 1985; and <I>Thoning et al.</I>, 1987.  Analysis and interpretation of the data have been
reported by <I>Komhyr et al.</I>, 1985; <I>Conway et al.</I>,1988; <I>Tans et al.</I>, 1989; <I>Tans et al.</I>, 1990 and <I>Conway
et al.</I>, 1994.  Thirty seven of the land-based sites were active in 1992.  Sampling at Ocean Station Charlie
was discontinued in 1973, and sampling at St. Croix was discontinued in 1990.   Also included are data
from three shipboard flask sampling programs.  Samples are collected at approximately 5 degree latitude
intervals on regular cruises of the Southland Star and Wellington Star in the Pacific Ocean between the
west coast of the U.S. and New Zealand.  Samples are also collected at 3 degree latitude intervals aboard
the Carla A. Hills on regular cruises in the South China Sea between Hong Kong and Singapore.   The
Data Report doesn't include the data of Carla A. Hills because they have not been updated since last
Report publishing.   The data contain CO<SUB>2</SUB> mixing ratios and relevant sampling and analysis information
for each flask sample. The monthly means were calculated from a smooth curve obtained by a combination of
curve fitting and digital filtering based on the methods of <I>Thoning et al.</I>, 1989, and <I>Tans et al.</I>, 1989b.
For Southland Star and Wellington Star, the sampling frequency in each latitude bin is insufficient to
calculate monthly means.   Therefore, NOAA/CMDL has merged the Southland Star's and Wellington Star's data
for each bin, and calculated monthly means for the fourteen 5-degree latitude bins from 30 degrees north
to 35 degrees south.

        The following is an explanatory note, though a little modified, cited by the WDCGG from the
explanatory note of the NOAA Flask Network.

        NOAA/CMDL has attempted to provide the most accurate and precise measurements possible in a
timely manner.   NOAA/CMDL reserves the right to adjust the data based on recalibrations of reference
gases and instruments.   The CO<SUB>2</SUB> mixing ratios reported were measured by a nondispersive infrared
absorption technique in air samples collected in glass flasks at NOAA/CMDL flask network sites.  
Descriptions of the sampling, measurement, and calibration procedures are given in <I>Komhyr et al.</I>, 1983;
<I>Komhyr et al.</I>, 1985; and <I>Thoning et al.</I>, 1987.  Analysis and interpretation of the data have been
reported by <I>Komhyr et al.</I>, 1985; <I>Conway et al.</I>,1988; <I>Tans et al.</I>, 1989; <I>Tans et al.</I>, 1990 and <I>Conway
et al.</I>, 1994.  Thirty seven of the land-based sites were active in 1992.  Sampling at Ocean Station Charlie
was discontinued in 1973, and sampling at St. Croix was discontinued in 1990.   Also included are data
from three shipboard flask sampling programs.  Samples are collected at approximately 5 degree latitude
intervals on regular cruises of the Southland Star and Wellington Star in the Pacific Ocean between the
west coast of the U.S. and New Zealand.  Samples are also collected at 3 degree latitude intervals aboard

<B>Organization :</B> Air Research Laboratory, The Netherlands

<B>Address      :</B> National Institute of Public Health and Environmental Protection
               P.O. Box 1, 3720 BA Bilthoven
               The Netherlands 

<B>Location     :</B> 53&#176; 20&#180; 02" N, 06&#176; 16&#180; 38" E, elevation 0 meter above mean sea level,

<B>Topography around the station :</B>
   The station is located in an agricultural area.   The nearest town is the city of Groningen
   (168,000 inhabitants) at a distance of about 25 km in ESE direction.

<B>Sampling method, frequency and measurement technique :</B>
   A Chromo-pack GC (type CP 9000) is operated with three columns in series, packed with
   HayeSep (1 and 2) and Molecular sieve (3) respectively.   Following sample injection,
   backflush and heart-cut techniques are performed using two 10 port switching valves.   After
   separation, components are led to a hydrogen-fed Ni catalyst (methanizer) where CO<SUB>2</SUB> and CO
   are converted to CH<SUB>4</SUB>.   Final detection is done by means of a flame ionization detector (FID).
   From the 2 inch sample stack air is led through 1/4 inch Stainless Steel tubing at s flow rate
   of 5 litres/minute using a critical orifice and a vacuum pump to a dual Perma Pure Dryer
   system (PermaPure type MD-125-12S).

<B>Sampling Interval :</B> 15 minutes

<B>Calibration :</B>
   Performed every month using computer-controlled massflow dilution of a standard gas
   mixture (CO, CH<SUB>4</SUB>, CO<SUB>2</SUB> and C<SUB>3</SUB>H<SUB>8</SUB> ; C<SUB>3</SUB>H<SUB>8</SUB> representing NMHC) at 6 individual levels for
   each component in its relevant concentration range.

<B>Calibration gases :</B> NIST reference materials

<B>Authors      :</B> A. Shashkov, N. Paramonova, V. Privalov, Y. Starodubtzev

<B>Organization :</B> Main Geophysical Observatory

<B>Address      :</B> Karbyshev Street 7, St. Petersburg, 194018 Russia

<B>Site position and description :</B>
   76&#176; 06&#180; N, 137&#176; 54&#180; E, 5 m msl, island seashore

<B>Sampling method, frequency and measurement technique :</B>
   Samples were collected into stainless steel flasks of 1.5l, with electro-polished inner walls, four
   times per month; analyzed by NDIR in Leningrad. 

<B>Scientific aims and scope of measurements :</B> Monitoring atmospheric CO2 increase

<B>Data selection procedures used :</B>
        Numbers in the body of table are the monthly mean values, calculated on the base of daily mean
   values, selected as follows:
        The daily mean values are the averages for two CO<SUB>2</SUB> concentrations, measured in two simultaneously
   sampled flasks, if difference between these measured concentration value is less or equal
   1 ppmv.   Otherwise, lower of two measured value is included in the table as a daily value if it does not
   differ from the smoothed concentration curve for more than 2 standard deviations.  Those "single value
   data" are flagged in accordance with the convention, accepted at the WDCGG manual.   Technically
   invalid data were also removed.
        All accepted data for the samples with the water vapor partial pressure e>2.2mbar.   Were corrected
   for storage time, using the experimental formula:

                 dC=-(0.0023<SUP>*</SUP>e-0.005)<SUP>*</SUP>t,

   where dC-is an additive correction to the measured concentration values, e-is water vapor partial pressure
   in the air sample (mb), and t-is storage time for a sample: from sampling to analyses date.   Samples with
   less humidity were not subjected to any correction at all.

<B>Calibration gases used :</B>
        CO<SUB>2</SUB>-in-synthetic air reference gases were primarily used for calibration.  Those gases were initially
   calibrated at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in 1981.  The CO<SUB>2</SUB> concentration values in this set
   cover the range 318-354 ppmv.
        In 1990-1993 the calibration experiments were performed by us, using the set of 5 CO<SUB>2</SUB>-in-air
   tertiary gas standards provided by the Atmospheric Environment Service of Canada.  In 1990-1993 all
   our data were recalculated according the results of these calibrations.

<B>Scale of reported data :</B> SIO X87 mole fraction scale.

<B>Acknowledgment :</B>
        We are grateful to the sincere help in our work Dr. Shchukin - the Director of Scientific Research
   Remote Sensing Center, Dr. Neil Trivett of the Atmospheric Environment Service of Canada, Dr. J.
   Miller of WMO, the Central European University of George Soros Foundation and the international CO<SUB>2</SUB>
   society for kind patronage of our work.

        The following is an explanatory note, though a little modified, cited by the WDCGG from the
explanatory note of the NOAA Flask Network.

        NOAA/CMDL has attempted to provide the most accurate and precise measurements possible in a
timely manner.   NOAA/CMDL reserves the right to adjust the data based on recalibrations of reference
gases and instruments.   The CO<SUB>2</SUB> mixing ratios reported were measured by a nondispersive infrared
absorption technique in air samples collected in glass flasks at NOAA/CMDL flask network sites.  
Descriptions of the sampling, measurement, and calibration procedures are given in <I>Komhyr et al.</I>, 1983;
<I>Komhyr et al.</I>, 1985; and <I>Thoning et al.</I>, 1987.  Analysis and interpretation of the data have been
reported by <I>Komhyr et al.</I>, 1985; <I>Conway et al.</I>,1988; <I>Tans et al.</I>, 1989; <I>Tans et al.</I>, 1990 and <I>Conway
et al.</I>, 1994.  Thirty seven of the land-based sites were active in 1992.  Sampling at Ocean Station Charlie
was discontinued in 1973, and sampling at St. Croix was discontinued in 1990.   Also included are data
from three shipboard flask sampling programs.  Samples are collected at approximately 5 degree latitude
intervals on regular cruises of the Southland Star and Wellington Star in the Pacific Ocean between the
west coast of the U.S. and New Zealand.  Samples are also collected at 3 degree latitude intervals aboard
the Carla A. Hills on regular cruises in the South China Sea between Hong Kong and Singapore.   The
Data Report doesn't include the data of Carla A. Hills because they have not been updated since last
Report publishing.   The data contain CO<SUB>2</SUB> mixing ratios and relevant sampling and analysis information
for each flask sample. The monthly means were calculated from a smooth curve obtained by a combination of
curve fitting and digital filtering based on the methods of <I>Thoning et al.</I>, 1989, and <I>Tans et al.</I>, 1989b.
For Southland Star and Wellington Star, the sampling frequency in each latitude bin is insufficient to
calculate monthly means.   Therefore, NOAA/CMDL has merged the Southland Star's and Wellington Star's data
for each bin, and calculated monthly means for the fourteen 5-degree latitude bins from 30 degrees north
to 35 degrees south.

        The following is an explanatory note, though a little modified, cited by the WDCGG from the
explanatory note of the NOAA Flask Network.

        NOAA/CMDL has attempted to provide the most accurate and precise measurements possible in a
timely manner.   NOAA/CMDL reserves the right to adjust the data based on recalibrations of reference
gases and instruments.   The CO<SUB>2</SUB> mixing ratios reported were measured by a nondispersive infrared
absorption technique in air samples collected in glass flasks at NOAA/CMDL flask network sites.  
Descriptions of the sampling, measurement, and calibration procedures are given in <I>Komhyr et al.</I>, 1983;
<I>Komhyr et al.</I>, 1985; and <I>Thoning et al.</I>, 1987.  Analysis and interpretation of the data have been
reported by <I>Komhyr et al.</I>, 1985; <I>Conway et al.</I>,1988; <I>Tans et al.</I>, 1989; <I>Tans et al.</I>, 1990 and <I>Conway
et al.</I>, 1994.  Thirty seven of the land-based sites were active in 1992.  Sampling at Ocean Station Charlie
was discontinued in 1973, and sampling at St. Croix was discontinued in 1990.   Also included are data
from three shipboard flask sampling programs.  Samples are collected at approximately 5 degree latitude
intervals on regular cruises of the Southland Star and Wellington Star in the Pacific Ocean between the
west coast of the U.S. and New Zealand.  Samples are also collected at 3 degree latitude intervals aboard
the Carla A. Hills on regular cruises in the South China Sea between Hong Kong and Singapore.   The
Data Report doesn't include the data of Carla A. Hills because they have not been updated since last
Report publishing.   The data contain CO<SUB>2</SUB> mixing ratios and relevant sampling and analysis information
for each flask sample. The monthly means were calculated from a smooth curve obtained by a combination of
curve fitting and digital filtering based on the methods of <I>Thoning et al.</I>, 1989, and <I>Tans et al.</I>, 1989b.
For Southland Star and Wellington Star, the sampling frequency in each latitude bin is insufficient to
calculate monthly means.   Therefore, NOAA/CMDL has merged the Southland Star's and Wellington Star's data
for each bin, and calculated monthly means for the fourteen 5-degree latitude bins from 30 degrees north
to 35 degrees south.

        The following is an explanatory note, though a little modified, cited by the WDCGG from the
explanatory note of the NOAA Flask Network.

        NOAA/CMDL has attempted to provide the most accurate and precise measurements possible in a
timely manner.   NOAA/CMDL reserves the right to adjust the data based on recalibrations of reference
gases and instruments.   The CO<SUB>2</SUB> mixing ratios reported were measured by a nondispersive infrared
absorption technique in air samples collected in glass flasks at NOAA/CMDL flask network sites.  
Descriptions of the sampling, measurement, and calibration procedures are given in <I>Komhyr et al.</I>, 1983;
<I>Komhyr et al.</I>, 1985; and <I>Thoning et al.</I>, 1987.  Analysis and interpretation of the data have been
reported by <I>Komhyr et al.</I>, 1985; <I>Conway et al.</I>,1988; <I>Tans et al.</I>, 1989; <I>Tans et al.</I>, 1990 and <I>Conway
et al.</I>, 1994.  Thirty seven of the land-based sites were active in 1992.  Sampling at Ocean Station Charlie
was discontinued in 1973, and sampling at St. Croix was discontinued in 1990.   Also included are data
from three shipboard flask sampling programs.  Samples are collected at approximately 5 degree latitude
intervals on regular cruises of the Southland Star and Wellington Star in the Pacific Ocean between the
west coast of the U.S. and New Zealand.  Samples are also collected at 3 degree latitude intervals aboard
the Carla A. Hills on regular cruises in the South China Sea between Hong Kong and Singapore.   The
Data Report doesn't include the data of Carla A. Hills because they have not been updated since last
Report publishing.   The data contain CO<SUB>2</SUB> mixing ratios and relevant sampling and analysis information
for each flask sample. The monthly means were calculated from a smooth curve obtained by a combination of
curve fitting and digital filtering based on the methods of <I>Thoning et al.</I>, 1989, and <I>Tans et al.</I>, 1989b.
For Southland Star and Wellington Star, the sampling frequency in each latitude bin is insufficient to
calculate monthly means.   Therefore, NOAA/CMDL has merged the Southland Star's and Wellington Star's data
for each bin, and calculated monthly means for the fourteen 5-degree latitude bins from 30 degrees north
to 35 degrees south.

<B>Address      :</B> 639-1 Kami-okubo, Urawa, Saitama 338, Japan

<B>>Site Position and description :</B>
   36&#176; 00&#180; 5" N, 139&#176; 11&#180; 35" E, elevation 860 m, near mountain top,
   Mt. Dodaira is located about 60 km north-west of Tokyo, and located east-end of Soto Chichibu
   mountain range.

<B>Sampling method, frequency and measurement technique :</B>
   Continuous NDIR analyzer,  HORIBA VIA-500R.
   Air from intake of 20 meter above ground is introduced to the dryers corresponding to +5, -30,
   and -65&#176;C dew-point temperature.
   The calibration is carried out 2-hourly using quadratic calibration equation with 4 working
   standards.
   Japan Standard Time of 9 hours earlier than UTC is adopted for the measurement.

<B>Scientific aims and scope of measurements :</B>
   Monitor atmospheric CO<SUB>2</SUB> variation.

<B>Data selection procedures used :</B>
   (1) Take the arithmetic mean of 30-second averaged value for one hour, and
   (2) adopt hourly mean value of which standard deviation less than 3ppmv.
   (3) Determine the best fit curve consisted of four harmonics and linears for the daily
       data of one year.
   (4) Reject the daily data exceeding 2 sigma ( sigma : standard deviation for daily data remained
       of one year) from the best fit curve, and
   (5) back to (4) until the difference of new and former sigma is less than 0.05ppmv.
   (6) The daily mean value with the difference from the final curve equal to or less than 5ppmv are
       selected as daily data.
   (7) Take the arithmetic mean of selected daily data as monthly data.

<B>Calibration gases used :</B>
   CO<SUB>2</SUB> in synthetic air (1991.4.1 - 1993.5.12)

        The following is an explanatory note, though a little modified, cited by the WDCGG from the
explanatory note of the NOAA Flask Network.

        NOAA/CMDL has attempted to provide the most accurate and precise measurements possible in a
timely manner.   NOAA/CMDL reserves the right to adjust the data based on recalibrations of reference
gases and instruments.   The CO<SUB>2</SUB> mixing ratios reported were measured by a nondispersive infrared
absorption technique in air samples collected in glass flasks at NOAA/CMDL flask network sites.  
Descriptions of the sampling, measurement, and calibration procedures are given in <I>Komhyr et al.</I>, 1983;
<I>Komhyr et al.</I>, 1985; and <I>Thoning et al.</I>, 1987.  Analysis and interpretation of the data have been
reported by <I>Komhyr et al.</I>, 1985; <I>Conway et al.</I>,1988; <I>Tans et al.</I>, 1989; <I>Tans et al.</I>, 1990 and <I>Conway
et al.</I>, 1994.  Thirty seven of the land-based sites were active in 1992.  Sampling at Ocean Station Charlie
was discontinued in 1973, and sampling at St. Croix was discontinued in 1990.   Also included are data
from three shipboard flask sampling programs.  Samples are collected at approximately 5 degree latitude
intervals on regular cruises of the Southland Star and Wellington Star in the Pacific Ocean between the
west coast of the U.S. and New Zealand.  Samples are also collected at 3 degree latitude intervals aboard
the Carla A. Hills on regular cruises in the South China Sea between Hong Kong and Singapore.   The
Data Report doesn't include the data of Carla A. Hills because they have not been updated since last
Report publishing.   The data contain CO<SUB>2</SUB> mixing ratios and relevant sampling and analysis information
for each flask sample. The monthly means were calculated from a smooth curve obtained by a combination of
curve fitting and digital filtering based on the methods of <I>Thoning et al.</I>, 1989, and <I>Tans et al.</I>, 1989b.
For Southland Star and Wellington Star, the sampling frequency in each latitude bin is insufficient to
calculate monthly means.   Therefore, NOAA/CMDL has merged the Southland Star's and Wellington Star's data
for each bin, and calculated monthly means for the fourteen 5-degree latitude bins from 30 degrees north
to 35 degrees south.

        The following is an explanatory note, though a little modified, cited by the WDCGG from the
explanatory note of the NOAA Flask Network.

        NOAA/CMDL has attempted to provide the most accurate and precise measurements possible in a
timely manner.   NOAA/CMDL reserves the right to adjust the data based on recalibrations of reference
gases and instruments.   The CO<SUB>2</SUB> mixing ratios reported were measured by a nondispersive infrared
absorption technique in air samples collected in glass flasks at NOAA/CMDL flask network sites.  
Descriptions of the sampling, measurement, and calibration procedures are given in <I>Komhyr et al.</I>, 1983;
<I>Komhyr et al.</I>, 1985; and <I>Thoning et al.</I>, 1987.  Analysis and interpretation of the data have been
reported by <I>Komhyr et al.</I>, 1985; <I>Conway et al.</I>,1988; <I>Tans et al.</I>, 1989; <I>Tans et al.</I>, 1990 and <I>Conway
et al.</I>, 1994.  Thirty seven of the land-based sites were active in 1992.  Sampling at Ocean Station Charlie
was discontinued in 1973, and sampling at St. Croix was discontinued in 1990.   Also included are data
from three shipboard flask sampling programs.  Samples are collected at approximately 5 degree latitude
intervals on regular cruises of the Southland Star and Wellington Star in the Pacific Ocean between the
west coast of the U.S. and New Zealand.  Samples are also collected at 3 degree latitude intervals aboard
the Carla A. Hills on regular cruises in the South China Sea between Hong Kong and Singapore.   The
Data Report doesn't include the data of Carla A. Hills because they have not been updated since last
Report publishing.   The data contain CO<SUB>2</SUB> mixing ratios and relevant sampling and analysis information
for each flask sample. The monthly means were calculated from a smooth curve obtained by a combination of
curve fitting and digital filtering based on the methods of <I>Thoning et al.</I>, 1989, and <I>Tans et al.</I>, 1989b.
For Southland Star and Wellington Star, the sampling frequency in each latitude bin is insufficient to
calculate monthly means.   Therefore, NOAA/CMDL has merged the Southland Star's and Wellington Star's data
for each bin, and calculated monthly means for the fourteen 5-degree latitude bins from 30 degrees north
to 35 degrees south.

        The following is an explanatory note, though a little modified, cited by the WDCGG from the
explanatory note of the NOAA Flask Network.

        NOAA/CMDL has attempted to provide the most accurate and precise measurements possible in a
timely manner.   NOAA/CMDL reserves the right to adjust the data based on recalibrations of reference
gases and instruments.   The CO<SUB>2</SUB> mixing ratios reported were measured by a nondispersive infrared
absorption technique in air samples collected in glass flasks at NOAA/CMDL flask network sites.  
Descriptions of the sampling, measurement, and calibration procedures are given in <I>Komhyr et al.</I>, 1983;
<I>Komhyr et al.</I>, 1985; and <I>Thoning et al.</I>, 1987.  Analysis and interpretation of the data have been
reported by <I>Komhyr et al.</I>, 1985; <I>Conway et al.</I>,1988; <I>Tans et al.</I>, 1989; <I>Tans et al.</I>, 1990 and <I>Conway
et al.</I>, 1994.  Thirty seven of the land-based sites were active in 1992.  Sampling at Ocean Station Charlie
was discontinued in 1973, and sampling at St. Croix was discontinued in 1990.   Also included are data
from three shipboard flask sampling programs.  Samples are collected at approximately 5 degree latitude
intervals on regular cruises of the Southland Star and Wellington Star in the Pacific Ocean between the
west coast of the U.S. and New Zealand.  Samples are also collected at 3 degree latitude intervals aboard
the Carla A. Hills on regular cruises in the South China Sea between Hong Kong and Singapore.   The
Data Report doesn't include the data of Carla A. Hills because they have not been updated since last
Report publishing.   The data contain CO<SUB>2</SUB> mixing ratios and relevant sampling and analysis information
for each flask sample. The monthly means were calculated from a smooth curve obtained by a combination of
curve fitting and digital filtering based on the methods of <I>Thoning et al.</I>, 1989, and <I>Tans et al.</I>, 1989b.
For Southland Star and Wellington Star, the sampling frequency in each latitude bin is insufficient to
calculate monthly means.   Therefore, NOAA/CMDL has merged the Southland Star's and Wellington Star's data
for each bin, and calculated monthly means for the fourteen 5-degree latitude bins from 30 degrees north
to 35 degrees south.

        The following is an explanatory note, though a little modified, cited by the WDCGG from the
explanatory note of the NOAA Flask Network.

        NOAA/CMDL has attempted to provide the most accurate and precise measurements possible in a
timely manner.   NOAA/CMDL reserves the right to adjust the data based on recalibrations of reference
gases and instruments.   The CO<SUB>2</SUB> mixing ratios reported were measured by a nondispersive infrared
absorption technique in air samples collected in glass flasks at NOAA/CMDL flask network sites.  
Descriptions of the sampling, measurement, and calibration procedures are given in <I>Komhyr et al.</I>, 1983;
<I>Komhyr et al.</I>, 1985; and <I>Thoning et al.</I>, 1987.  Analysis and interpretation of the data have been
reported by <I>Komhyr et al.</I>, 1985; <I>Conway et al.</I>,1988; <I>Tans et al.</I>, 1989; <I>Tans et al.</I>, 1990 and <I>Conway
et al.</I>, 1994.  Thirty seven of the land-based sites were active in 1992.  Sampling at Ocean Station Charlie
was discontinued in 1973, and sampling at St. Croix was discontinued in 1990.   Also included are data
from three shipboard flask sampling programs.  Samples are collected at approximately 5 degree latitude
intervals on regular cruises of the Southland Star and Wellington Star in the Pacific Ocean between the
west coast of the U.S. and New Zealand.  Samples are also collected at 3 degree latitude intervals aboard
the Carla A. Hills on regular cruises in the South China Sea between Hong Kong and Singapore.   The
Data Report doesn't include the data of Carla A. Hills because they have not been updated since last
Report publishing.   The data contain CO<SUB>2</SUB> mixing ratios and relevant sampling and analysis information
for each flask sample. The monthly means were calculated from a smooth curve obtained by a combination of
curve fitting and digital filtering based on the methods of <I>Thoning et al.</I>, 1989, and <I>Tans et al.</I>, 1989b.
For Southland Star and Wellington Star, the sampling frequency in each latitude bin is insufficient to
calculate monthly means.   Therefore, NOAA/CMDL has merged the Southland Star's and Wellington Star's data
for each bin, and calculated monthly means for the fourteen 5-degree latitude bins from 30 degrees north
to 35 degrees south.

        The following is an explanatory note, though a little modified, cited by the WDCGG from the
explanatory note of the NOAA Flask Network.

        NOAA/CMDL has attempted to provide the most accurate and precise measurements possible in a
timely manner.   NOAA/CMDL reserves the right to adjust the data based on recalibrations of reference
gases and instruments.   The CO<SUB>2</SUB> mixing ratios reported were measured by a nondispersive infrared
absorption technique in air samples collected in glass flasks at NOAA/CMDL flask network sites.  
Descriptions of the sampling, measurement, and calibration procedures are given in <I>Komhyr et al.</I>, 1983;
<I>Komhyr et al.</I>, 1985; and <I>Thoning et al.</I>, 1987.  Analysis and interpretation of the data have been
reported by <I>Komhyr et al.</I>, 1985; <I>Conway et al.</I>,1988; <I>Tans et al.</I>, 1989; <I>Tans et al.</I>, 1990 and <I>Conway
et al.</I>, 1994.  Thirty seven of the land-based sites were active in 1992.  Sampling at Ocean Station Charlie
was discontinued in 1973, and sampling at St. Croix was discontinued in 1990.   Also included are data
from three shipboard flask sampling programs.  Samples are collected at approximately 5 degree latitude
intervals on regular cruises of the Southland Star and Wellington Star in the Pacific Ocean between the
west coast of the U.S. and New Zealand.  Samples are also collected at 3 degree latitude intervals aboard
the Carla A. Hills on regular cruises in the South China Sea between Hong Kong and Singapore.   The
Data Report doesn't include the data of Carla A. Hills because they have not been updated since last
Report publishing.   The data contain CO<SUB>2</SUB> mixing ratios and relevant sampling and analysis information
for each flask sample. The monthly means were calculated from a smooth curve obtained by a combination of
curve fitting and digital filtering based on the methods of <I>Thoning et al.</I>, 1989, and <I>Tans et al.</I>, 1989b.
For Southland Star and Wellington Star, the sampling frequency in each latitude bin is insufficient to
calculate monthly means.   Therefore, NOAA/CMDL has merged the Southland Star's and Wellington Star's data
for each bin, and calculated monthly means for the fourteen 5-degree latitude bins from 30 degrees north
to 35 degrees south.

        The following is an explanatory note, though a little modified, cited by the WDCGG from the
explanatory note of the NOAA Flask Network.

        NOAA/CMDL has attempted to provide the most accurate and precise measurements possible in a
timely manner.   NOAA/CMDL reserves the right to adjust the data based on recalibrations of reference
gases and instruments.   The CO<SUB>2</SUB> mixing ratios reported were measured by a nondispersive infrared
absorption technique in air samples collected in glass flasks at NOAA/CMDL flask network sites.  
Descriptions of the sampling, measurement, and calibration procedures are given in <I>Komhyr et al.</I>, 1983;
<I>Komhyr et al.</I>, 1985; and <I>Thoning et al.</I>, 1987.  Analysis and interpretation of the data have been
reported by <I>Komhyr et al.</I>, 1985; <I>Conway et al.</I>,1988; <I>Tans et al.</I>, 1989; <I>Tans et al.</I>, 1990 and <I>Conway
et al.</I>, 1994.  Thirty seven of the land-based sites were active in 1992.  Sampling at Ocean Station Charlie
was discontinued in 1973, and sampling at St. Croix was discontinued in 1990.   Also included are data
from three shipboard flask sampling programs.  Samples are collected at approximately 5 degree latitude
intervals on regular cruises of the Southland Star and Wellington Star in the Pacific Ocean between the
west coast of the U.S. and New Zealand.  Samples are also collected at 3 degree latitude intervals aboard
the Carla A. Hills on regular cruises in the South China Sea between Hong Kong and Singapore.   The
Data Report doesn't include the data of Carla A. Hills because they have not been updated since last
Report publishing.   The data contain CO<SUB>2</SUB> mixing ratios and relevant sampling and analysis information
for each flask sample. The monthly means were calculated from a smooth curve obtained by a combination of
curve fitting and digital filtering based on the methods of <I>Thoning et al.</I>, 1989, and <I>Tans et al.</I>, 1989b.
For Southland Star and Wellington Star, the sampling frequency in each latitude bin is insufficient to
calculate monthly means.   Therefore, NOAA/CMDL has merged the Southland Star's and Wellington Star's data
for each bin, and calculated monthly means for the fourteen 5-degree latitude bins from 30 degrees north
to 35 degrees south.

        The following is an explanatory note, though a little modified, cited by the WDCGG from the
explanatory note of the NOAA Flask Network.

        NOAA/CMDL has attempted to provide the most accurate and precise measurements possible in a
timely manner.   NOAA/CMDL reserves the right to adjust the data based on recalibrations of reference
gases and instruments.   The CO<SUB>2</SUB> mixing ratios reported were measured by a nondispersive infrared
absorption technique in air samples collected in glass flasks at NOAA/CMDL flask network sites.  
Descriptions of the sampling, measurement, and calibration procedures are given in <I>Komhyr et al.</I>, 1983;
<I>Komhyr et al.</I>, 1985; and <I>Thoning et al.</I>, 1987.  Analysis and interpretation of the data have been
reported by <I>Komhyr et al.</I>, 1985; <I>Conway et al.</I>,1988; <I>Tans et al.</I>, 1989; <I>Tans et al.</I>, 1990 and <I>Conway
et al.</I>, 1994.  Thirty seven of the land-based sites were active in 1992.  Sampling at Ocean Station Charlie
was discontinued in 1973, and sampling at St. Croix was discontinued in 1990.   Also included are data
from three shipboard flask sampling programs.  Samples are collected at approximately 5 degree latitude
intervals on regular cruises of the Southland Star and Wellington Star in the Pacific Ocean between the
west coast of the U.S. and New Zealand.  Samples are also collected at 3 degree latitude intervals aboard
the Carla A. Hills on regular cruises in the South China Sea between Hong Kong and Singapore.   The
Data Report doesn't include the data of Carla A. Hills because they have not been updated since last
Report publishing.   The data contain CO<SUB>2</SUB> mixing ratios and relevant sampling and analysis information
for each flask sample. The monthly means were calculated from a smooth curve obtained by a combination of
curve fitting and digital filtering based on the methods of <I>Thoning et al.</I>, 1989, and <I>Tans et al.</I>, 1989b.
For Southland Star and Wellington Star, the sampling frequency in each latitude bin is insufficient to
calculate monthly means.   Therefore, NOAA/CMDL has merged the Southland Star's and Wellington Star's data
for each bin, and calculated monthly means for the fourteen 5-degree latitude bins from 30 degrees north
to 35 degrees south.

<B>Organization :</B> Main Geophysical Observatory

<B>Address      :</B> Karbyshev Street 7, St. Petersburg, 194018 Russia

<B>Site Position and description :</B>
   69&#176; 12&#180; N, 35&#176; 07&#180; E, 15 msl, arctic coastal seashore

<B>Sampling method, frequency and measurements technique :</B>
   Samples were collected into stainless steel flasks of 1.5l, with electro-polished inner walls, four
   times per month, and subsequently analyzed by NDIR in Leningrad.

<B>Scientific aims and scope of measurements :</B> Monitor atmospheric CO<SUB>2</SUB> increase

<B>Data selection procedures used for daily values :</B>
        Numbers in the body of table are the monthly mean values, calculated on the base of daily mean
   values, selected as follows:
        The daily mean values are the averages for two CO<SUB>2</SUB> concentrations, measured in two simultaneously
   sampled flasks, if difference between these measured concentration value is less or equal 1 ppmv.
   Otherwise, lower of two measured value is included in the table as a daily value if it does not
   differ from the smoothed concentration curve for more than 2 standard deviations.  Those "single value
   data" are flagged in accordance with the convention, accepted at the WDCGG manual.  Technically
   invalid data were also removed.
        All accepted data for the samples with the water vapor partial pressure e>2.2mbar.   Were corrected
   for storage time, using the experimental formula:

                dC=-(0.0023<SUP>*</SUP>e-0.005)<SUP>*</SUP>t,

   where dC-is an additive correction to the measured concentration values, e-is water vapor partial pressure
   in the air sample (mb), and t-is storage time for a sample: from sampling to analyses date.  Samples with
   less humidity were not subjected to any correction at all.

<B>Calibration gases used :</B>
        CO2-in-synthetic air reference gases were primarily used for calibration.   Those gases were
   initially calibrated at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in 1981.   The CO<SUB>2</SUB> concentration values in
   this set cover the range 318-354 ppmv.
        In 1990-1993 the calibration experiments were performed by us, using the set of 5 CO<SUB>2</SUB>-in-air
   tertiary gas standards provided by the Atmospheric Environment Service of Canada.  In 1990-1993 all
   our data were recalculated according the results of these calibrations.

<B>Scale of reported data :</B> SIO X87 mole fraction scale.

<B>Acknowledgment :</B>
        We are grateful to the sincere help in our work Dr. Shchukin - the Director of Scientific Research
   Remote Sensing Center, Dr. Neil Trivett of the Atmospheric Environment Service of Canada, Dr. J.
   Miller of WMO, the Central European University of George Soros Foundation and the international CO<SUB>2</SUB>
   society for kind patronage of our work.

        The following is an explanatory note, though a little modified, cited by the WDCGG from the
explanatory note of the NOAA Flask Network.

        NOAA/CMDL has attempted to provide the most accurate and precise measurements possible in a
timely manner.   NOAA/CMDL reserves the right to adjust the data based on recalibrations of reference
gases and instruments.   The CO<SUB>2</SUB> mixing ratios reported were measured by a nondispersive infrared
absorption technique in air samples collected in glass flasks at NOAA/CMDL flask network sites.  
Descriptions of the sampling, measurement, and calibration procedures are given in <I>Komhyr et al.</I>, 1983;
<I>Komhyr et al.</I>, 1985; and <I>Thoning et al.</I>, 1987.  Analysis and interpretation of the data have been
reported by <I>Komhyr et al.</I>, 1985; <I>Conway et al.</I>,1988; <I>Tans et al.</I>, 1989; <I>Tans et al.</I>, 1990 and <I>Conway
et al.</I>, 1994.  Thirty seven of the land-based sites were active in 1992.  Sampling at Ocean Station Charlie
was discontinued in 1973, and sampling at St. Croix was discontinued in 1990.   Also included are data
from three shipboard flask sampling programs.  Samples are collected at approximately 5 degree latitude
intervals on regular cruises of the Southland Star and Wellington Star in the Pacific Ocean between the
west coast of the U.S. and New Zealand.  Samples are also collected at 3 degree latitude intervals aboard
the Carla A. Hills on regular cruises in the South China Sea between Hong Kong and Singapore.   The
Data Report doesn't include the data of Carla A. Hills because they have not been updated since last
Report publishing.   The data contain CO<SUB>2</SUB> mixing ratios and relevant sampling and analysis information
for each flask sample. The monthly means were calculated from a smooth curve obtained by a combination of
curve fitting and digital filtering based on the methods of <I>Thoning et al.</I>, 1989, and <I>Tans et al.</I>, 1989b.
For Southland Star and Wellington Star, the sampling frequency in each latitude bin is insufficient to
calculate monthly means.   Therefore, NOAA/CMDL has merged the Southland Star's and Wellington Star's data
for each bin, and calculated monthly means for the fourteen 5-degree latitude bins from 30 degrees north
to 35 degrees south.

        The following is an explanatory note, though a little modified, cited by the WDCGG from the

        NOAA/CMDL has attempted to provide the most accurate and precise measurements possible in a

gases and instruments.   The CO<SUB>2</SUB> mixing ratios reported were measured by a nondispersive infrared
absorption technique in air samples collected in glass flasks at NOAA/CMDL flask network sites.  
Descriptions of the sampling, measurement, and calibration procedures are given in <I>Komhyr et al.</I>, 1983;
<I>Komhyr et al.</I>, 1985; and <I>Thoning et al.</I>, 1987.  Analysis and interpretation of the data have been
reported by <I>Komhyr et al.</I>, 1985; <I>Conway et al.</I>,1988; <I>Tans et al.</I>, 1989; <I>Tans et al.</I>, 1990 and <I>Conway
et al.</I>, 1994.  Thirty seven of the land-based sites were active in 1992.  Sampling at Ocean Station Charlie
was discontinued in 1973, and sampling at St. Croix was discontinued in 1990.   Also included are data
from three shipboard flask sampling programs.  Samples are collected at approximately 5 degree latitude

For Southland Star and Wellington Star, the sampling frequency in each latitude bin is insufficient to

     The following is an explanatory note, though a little modified, cited by the WDCGG from the
explanatory note of the NOAA Flask Network.

     NOAA/CMDL has attempted to provide the most accurate and precise measurements possible in
a timely manner.   We reserve the right to adjust the data based on recalibrations of reference gases
and instruments.   In particular, the data for calendar year 1991 are preliminary and are subject to
possibly significant modifications.   Thirty six of the land-based sites were active 1992.   Sampling
at Ocean Station C was discontinued in 1973, and at St. Croix sampling was discontinued in 1990.  
Also included are data from three shipboard flask sampling programs.   Samples are collected at
approximately 5-degree latitude intervals on regular cruises of the Southland Star and Wellington
Star in the Pacific Ocean between the west coast of the U.S. and New Zealand.   For Southland
Star and Wellington Star, the sampling frequency in each latitude bin is insufficient to calculate
monthly means.   Samples are also collected at 3-degree latitude intervals aboard the Carla A. Hill
on regular cruises in the South China Sea between Hong Kong and Singapore.   The Monthly
means are produced for each site by first averaging all values in the complete file with a unique
sample data and time.   These data are fit with a curve (see <I>Steele et al.</I>, 1992 for curve fitting
techniques), values are pulled from the curve at weekly intervals, and these values are averaged for
each month to give the monthly mean values in the files.

     The following is an explanatory note, though a little modified, cited by the WDCGG from the
explanatory note of the NOAA Flask Network.

     NOAA/CMDL has attempted to provide the most accurate and precise measurements possible in
a timely manner.   We reserve the right to adjust the data based on recalibrations of reference gases
and instruments.   In particular, the data for calendar year 1991 are preliminary and are subject to
possibly significant modifications.   Thirty six of the land-based sites were active 1992.   Sampling
at Ocean Station C was discontinued in 1973, and at St. Croix sampling was discontinued in 1990.  
Also included are data from three shipboard flask sampling programs.   Samples are collected at
approximately 5-degree latitude intervals on regular cruises of the Southland Star and Wellington
Star in the Pacific Ocean between the west coast of the U.S. and New Zealand.   For Southland
Star and Wellington Star, the sampling frequency in each latitude bin is insufficient to calculate
monthly means.   Samples are also collected at 3-degree latitude intervals aboard the Carla A. Hill
on regular cruises in the South China Sea between Hong Kong and Singapore.   The Monthly
means are produced for each site by first averaging all values in the complete file with a unique
sample data and time.   These data are fit with a curve (see <I>Steele et al.</I>, 1992 for curve fitting
techniques), values are pulled from the curve at weekly intervals, and these values are averaged for
each month to give the monthly mean values in the files.

     The following is an explanatory note, though a little modified, cited by the WDCGG from the
explanatory note of the NOAA Flask Network.

     NOAA/CMDL has attempted to provide the most accurate and precise measurements possible in
a timely manner.   We reserve the right to adjust the data based on recalibrations of reference gases
and instruments.   In particular, the data for calendar year 1991 are preliminary and are subject to
possibly significant modifications.   Thirty six of the land-based sites were active 1992.   Sampling
at Ocean Station C was discontinued in 1973, and at St. Croix sampling was discontinued in 1990.  
Also included are data from three shipboard flask sampling programs.   Samples are collected at
approximately 5-degree latitude intervals on regular cruises of the Southland Star and Wellington
Star in the Pacific Ocean between the west coast of the U.S. and New Zealand.   For Southland
Star and Wellington Star, the sampling frequency in each latitude bin is insufficient to calculate
monthly means.   Samples are also collected at 3-degree latitude intervals aboard the Carla A. Hill
on regular cruises in the South China Sea between Hong Kong and Singapore.   The Monthly
means are produced for each site by first averaging all values in the complete file with a unique
sample data and time.   These data are fit with a curve (see <I>Steele et al.</I>, 1992 for curve fitting
techniques), values are pulled from the curve at weekly intervals, and these values are averaged for
each month to give the monthly mean values in the files.

     NOAA/CMDL has attempted to provide the most accurate and precise measurements possible in
a timely manner.   We reserve the right to adjust the data based on recalibrations of reference gases
and instruments.   In particular, the data for calendar year 1991 are preliminary and are subject to
possibly significant modifications.   Thirty six of the land-based sites were active 1992.   Sampling
at Ocean Station C was discontinued in 1973, and at St. Croix sampling was discontinued in 1990.  
Also included are data from three shipboard flask sampling programs.   Samples are collected at
approximately 5-degree latitude intervals on regular cruises of the Southland Star and Wellington
Star in the Pacific Ocean between the west coast of the U.S. and New Zealand.   For Southland
Star and Wellington Star, the sampling frequency in each latitude bin is insufficient to calculate
monthly means.   Samples are also collected at 3-degree latitude intervals aboard the Carla A. Hill
on regular cruises in the South China Sea between Hong Kong and Singapore.   The Monthly
means are produced for each site by first averaging all values in the complete file with a unique
sample data and time.   These data are fit with a curve (see <I>Steele et al.</I>, 1992 for curve fitting
techniques), values are pulled from the curve at weekly intervals, and these values are averaged for
each month to give the monthly mean values in the files.

     The following is an explanatory note, though a little modified, cited by the WDCGG from the
explanatory note of the NOAA Flask Network.

     NOAA/CMDL has attempted to provide the most accurate and precise measurements possible in
a timely manner.   We reserve the right to adjust the data based on recalibrations of reference gases
and instruments.   In particular, the data for calendar year 1991 are preliminary and are subject to
possibly significant modifications.   Thirty six of the land-based sites were active 1992.   Sampling
at Ocean Station C was discontinued in 1973, and at St. Croix sampling was discontinued in 1990.  
Also included are data from three shipboard flask sampling programs.   Samples are collected at
approximately 5-degree latitude intervals on regular cruises of the Southland Star and Wellington
Star in the Pacific Ocean between the west coast of the U.S. and New Zealand.   For Southland
Star and Wellington Star, the sampling frequency in each latitude bin is insufficient to calculate
monthly means.   Samples are also collected at 3-degree latitude intervals aboard the Carla A. Hill
on regular cruises in the South China Sea between Hong Kong and Singapore.   The Monthly
means are produced for each site by first averaging all values in the complete file with a unique
sample data and time.   These data are fit with a curve (see <I>Steele et al.</I>, 1992 for curve fitting
techniques), values are pulled from the curve at weekly intervals, and these values are averaged for
each month to give the monthly mean values in the files.

     The following is an explanatory note, though a little modified, cited by the WDCGG from the
explanatory note of the NOAA Flask Network.

     NOAA/CMDL has attempted to provide the most accurate and precise measurements possible in
a timely manner.   We reserve the right to adjust the data based on recalibrations of reference gases
and instruments.   In particular, the data for calendar year 1991 are preliminary and are subject to
possibly significant modifications.   Thirty six of the land-based sites were active 1992.   Sampling
at Ocean Station C was discontinued in 1973, and at St. Croix sampling was discontinued in 1990.  
Also included are data from three shipboard flask sampling programs.   Samples are collected at
approximately 5-degree latitude intervals on regular cruises of the Southland Star and Wellington
Star in the Pacific Ocean between the west coast of the U.S. and New Zealand.   For Southland
Star and Wellington Star, the sampling frequency in each latitude bin is insufficient to calculate
monthly means.   Samples are also collected at 3-degree latitude intervals aboard the Carla A. Hill
on regular cruises in the South China Sea between Hong Kong and Singapore.   The Monthly
means are produced for each site by first averaging all values in the complete file with a unique
sample data and time.   These data are fit with a curve (see <I>Steele et al.</I>, 1992 for curve fitting
techniques), values are pulled from the curve at weekly intervals, and these values are averaged for
each month to give the monthly mean values in the files.

     The following is an explanatory note, though a little modified, cited by the WDCGG from the
explanatory note of the NOAA Flask Network.

     NOAA/CMDL has attempted to provide the most accurate and precise measurements possible in
a timely manner.   We reserve the right to adjust the data based on recalibrations of reference gases
and instruments.   In particular, the data for calendar year 1991 are preliminary and are subject to
possibly significant modifications.   Thirty six of the land-based sites were active 1992.   Sampling
at Ocean Station C was discontinued in 1973, and at St. Croix sampling was discontinued in 1990.  
Also included are data from three shipboard flask sampling programs.   Samples are collected at
approximately 5-degree latitude intervals on regular cruises of the Southland Star and Wellington
Star in the Pacific Ocean between the west coast of the U.S. and New Zealand.   For Southland
Star and Wellington Star, the sampling frequency in each latitude bin is insufficient to calculate
monthly means.   Samples are also collected at 3-degree latitude intervals aboard the Carla A. Hill
on regular cruises in the South China Sea between Hong Kong and Singapore.   The Monthly
means are produced for each site by first averaging all values in the complete file with a unique
sample data and time.   These data are fit with a curve (see <I>Steele et al.</I>, 1992 for curve fitting
techniques), values are pulled from the curve at weekly intervals, and these values are averaged for
each month to give the monthly mean values in the files.

        The following is an explanatory note, though a little modified, cited by the WDCGG from the
explanatory note of the NOAA Flask Network.

        NOAA/CMDL has attempted to provide the most accurate and precise measurements possible in a
timely manner.   NOAA/CMDL reserves the right to adjust the data based on recalibrations of reference
gases and instruments.   The CO<SUB>2</SUB> mixing ratios reported were measured by a nondispersive infrared
absorption technique in air samples collected in glass flasks at NOAA/CMDL flask network sites.  
Descriptions of the sampling, measurement, and calibration procedures are given in <I>Komhyr et al.</I>, 1983;
<I>Komhyr et al.</I>, 1985; and <I>Thoning et al.</I>, 1987.  Analysis and interpretation of the data have been
reported by <I>Komhyr et al.</I>, 1985; <I>Conway et al.</I>,1988; <I>Tans et al.</I>, 1989; <I>Tans et al.</I>, 1990 and <I>Conway
et al.</I>, 1994.  Thirty seven of the land-based sites were active in 1992.  Sampling at Ocean Station Charlie
was discontinued in 1973, and sampling at St. Croix was discontinued in 1990.   Also included are data
from three shipboard flask sampling programs.  Samples are collected at approximately 5 degree latitude
intervals on regular cruises of the Southland Star and Wellington Star in the Pacific Ocean between the
west coast of the U.S. and New Zealand.  Samples are also collected at 3 degree latitude intervals aboard
the Carla A. Hills on regular cruises in the South China Sea between Hong Kong and Singapore.   The
Data Report doesn't include the data of Carla A. Hills because they have not been updated since last
Report publishing.   The data contain CO<SUB>2</SUB> mixing ratios and relevant sampling and analysis information
for each flask sample. The monthly means were calculated from a smooth curve obtained by a combination of
curve fitting and digital filtering based on the methods of <I>Thoning et al.</I>, 1989, and <I>Tans et al.</I>, 1989b.
For Southland Star and Wellington Star, the sampling frequency in each latitude bin is insufficient to
calculate monthly means.   Therefore, NOAA/CMDL has merged the Southland Star's and Wellington Star's data
for each bin, and calculated monthly means for the fourteen 5-degree latitude bins from 30 degrees north
to 35 degrees south.

<h2><u><b>Program Description</b></u></h2>
<p align=left>
The US Global Change Research Information Office (GCRIO) provides access 
to data and information on global change research, adaptation/mitigation strategies and technologies, and global change-related educational resources on behalf of the various US Federal Agencies and Organizations that are involved in the <a href="http://www.usgcrp.gov/">US Global Change Research Program </a>(USGCRP).   GCRIO offers the following products and services to its users:
<p>
<ul>
<li>GCRIO acts as a clearinghouse for selected key documents and reports that are either generated or sponsored by the US Government or by specific Federal Agencies.  GCRIO generates abstracts of  these documents and places them into an on-line searchable

 <a href="http://sedac.ciesin.org:80/Harvest/brokers/GCRIO/query.html">bibliographic data base</a>.  Links to other 
relevant bibliographic systems are also maintained.  GCRIO can respond to requests for copies of these documents either directly or indirectly by forwarding the request or the user to
 the proper Government/Agency contact.  Selected documents are available <a href="online.html">on-line</a> in their entirety.</li>
<p>
<li>GCRIO provides high-level User Services for the interagency <a href="http://www.gcdis.usgcrp.gov/">Global Change Data and Information System </a>(GCDIS).  The function is designed to complement the existing User Support functions already in place at the various Federal Agencies.  Requests for data and information from GCDIS are processed by GCRIO User Services staff and forwarded to the appropriate Agency contact, as appropriate.</li>
<p>
<li>GCRIO performs outreach services to both domestic (Federal, state, and local) and international target audiences (including governments, institutions, researchers, educators, students, and the general public) in an effort to showcase relevant activities and results of the US Global Change Research Program and to help increase the awareness of the availability of data and information resources of the participating Federal Agencies.</li>
<p>
<li>The <a href="http://www.gcrio.org/">GCRIO Home Page</a> (http://www.gcrio.org) provides access to selected  bibliographic data bases; web sites at the participating Federal Agencies; relevant environmental data, catalog, and library systems; and a special section that deals with environmental education and research funding opportunities.  Brochures describing GCRIO's products and services are available in English, French, Russian, Spanish, Arabic, and Chinese.</li>

<h2><u><b>History of GCRIO</b></u></h2>
<p align left>
In 1990, Congress passed and the President signed Public Law 101-606, <a href="http://www.gcrio.org/gcact1990.html">The Global Change Research Act of 1990</a>.  The purpose of the legislation was: 
<p>
<blockquote>
. . . to require the establishment of a United States Global Change Research Program aimed at understanding and responding to global change, including the cumulative effects of human activities and natural processes on the environment, to promote discussions towards international protocols in global change research, and for other purposes.
</blockquote>
<p align left>
Under Title II (International Cooperation in Global Change Research) of the Act, Section 204 requires that a Global Change Research Information Office (GCRIO) be established.  The stated purpose of the GCRIO is:
<p>
<blockquote>
 . . . to disseminate to foreign governments, businesses, and institutions, as well as citizens of foreign countries, scientific research information available in the United States which would be useful in preventing, mitigating, or adapting to the effects of global change.
</blockquote>
<p align left>
In June 1991, the Working Group on Global Change (WGGC) of the Committee on Earth and Environmental Sciences (CEES) [now the Subcommittee on Global Change Research (SGCR) of the Committee on the Environment and Natural Resources (CENR)] convened a Task Group representing several Federal agencies to analyze the requirements of the Law and to establish GCRIO.  In November 1991, the Task Group produced a report of its recommendations including direction to expand the target audience of GCRIO to include US citizens and organizations.  In May 1992, the SGCR designated that GCRIO be implemented within the <a href="http://www.ciesin.org/">Consortium for International Earth Science Information Network </a>(CIESIN) under the direction of a GCRIO Oversight Panel established within the SGCR.  The initial GCRIO Implementation Plan was submitted to the SGCR in November 1992.  A formal Statement of Work for GCRIO was approved by the GCRIO Oversight Panel in early 1993 and GCRIO began formal operation in May 1993.

<li><strong>What services does GCRIO provide for its users?</strong>
<p align=left>
The GCRIO offers the following products and services to its users:
<p align=left>
<ul>
<li>GCRIO acts as a clearinghouse for key documents and reports generated or sponsored by the U.S. Government or selected Federal Agencies that pertain to global change research, adaptation/mitigation strategies and technologies, and global change related educational resources.  GCRIO generates abstracts of these documents and places them into an on-line, searchable bibliographic data base.  GCRIO also provides links to other Agency and commercial bibliographic systems.  Selected documents are placed on-line in their entirety.</li>
<p>
<li>GCRIO provides high-level User Services for the interagency <a href="http://www.gcdis.usgcrp.gov/">Global Change Data and Information System</a> (GCDIS).  The function is designed to complement the existing User Support functions already in place at the various Federal Agencies.  Requests for data and information from GCDIS are processed by <a href=#Z>GCRIO User Services</a>  staff and, if necessary, forwarded to the appropriate Agency contact.</li>
<p>
<li>GCRIO performs outreach services to both domestic (Federal, state, and local) and international target audiences (including governments, institutions, researchers, educators, students, and the general public) in an effort to showcase relevant activities and results of the US Global Change Research Program and to help increase the awareness of the availability of data and information resources of the participating Federal Agencies.</li>

<hr width=95% size=1 >
<a name="C"> </a>
<p align=left><li><strong>What is in the GCRIO On-line Bibliographic Data Base?</strong>
<p align=left>
Information on documents and publications relevant to the GCRIO mission(providing access to data and information on global change research, adaptation/mitigation strategies and technologies, and global change related educational resources) has been requested from each of the agencies and organizations participating in the <a href="http://www.usgcrp.gov">US Global Change Research Program(USGCRP)</a> GCRIO staff abstracted these documents and placed the descriptions into an on-line data base.  In addition to brief abstracts, each data base record contains information on the format of the document, the agency of origin, and a list of related keywords that assist in free-text searches. 
<p>
In some cases, the agency or organization provided multiple copies of the document or publication to GCRIO so that the <a href=#Z>GCRIO User Services</a>  could respond to user requests directly.  In other cases, the agency or organization provided only one copy for abstraction purposes, and requests for those documents are forwarded by GCRIO User Services to the appropriate agency or organization for disposition.   
<p align=left>
The population of this on-line bibliographic data base is an on-going task.  Please note that the various Federal Agency and Organizations participate in this effort on a volunteer basis.  Thus, the robustness of the data base is dependent upon our ability to encourage and facilitate participation.  Another factor is that many Agencies and Organization expend considerable effort in maintaining their own bibliographic data bases.  GCRIO does not intend to duplicate these existing agency services.  Instead, GCRIO offers its users the ability to link to other relevant bibliographic data bases from its Document Search Home Page
<p>
Other private or non-governmental organizations are invited to provide copies relevant materials to the GCRIO User Services for possible inclusion in the GCRIO bibliographic on-line data base.  Contact the <a href=#Z>GCRIO User Services</a>  for details.

<a name="E"></a> 
<p align=left><li> <strong>Does the GCRIO have a list of publications or a catalog?</strong>
<p align=left>
You may request a list of titles and abstracts of the GCRIO document holdings directly from the GCRIO Document Search Home Page or you may request from <a href=#Z>GCRIO User Services</a> that a list of titles and abstracts be sent, free of charge, by postal mail, email or fax.
</li>
<hr width=95% size=1>
<a name="F"> </a>
<p align=left><li><strong>What about on-line documents?</strong>
<p align=left>
GCRIO provides selected key documents on-line in full-text.  The selection for on-line placement is usually made of the basis of importance to the USGCRP (i.e., the annual production of <i>Our Changing Planet</i>), timeliness (i.e., the recent National Academy review of the USGCRP and NASA's MTPE), or need to disseminate new scientific findings.
<p>
Organizations or individuals wishing to place a complete document within the GCRIO web space may contact the <a href=#Z>GCRIO User Services</a> to obtain submission guidelines and selection criteria.
</li>
<hr width=95% size=1>
<a name="G"> </a>
<p><li><strong>What is the difference between GCDIS & GCRIO?</strong>
<p align=left>
The <a href="http://www.gcdis.usgcrp.gov"> Global Change Data and Information System (GCDIS)</a> provides access to the global change related data and information sources and services of the participating Federal agencies through organized Internet-accessible interfaces.   The GCRIO supports GCDIS through provision of User Services and Outreach services.
<p>
<h3>GCDIS Overview</h3>
<p>
The GCDIS is the set of individual agency data and information systems supplemented by a minimal amount of crosscutting new infrastructure, and made interoperable by the use of standards, common approaches, technology sharing, and data policy coordination.  The GCDIS user community extends from global change researchers to other researchers, policy makers, educators, private industry, and private citizens.  Through the GCDIS, these users are able to learn about the existence and location of relevant data and information resources, have key holding available in useful forms, and be assured of their quality and continued availability.
<p>
The individual agency components of the GCDIS are funded through their respective budgets.  There will neither be a lead agency nor a separately funded budget for the GCDIS.  Interagency GCDIS implementation will be coordinated through the GCDIS Subgroup of the Data Management Working Group (DMWG) of  the Subcommittee of Global Change Research (SGCR). 
<p>
<h3>GCRIO Support of GCDIS User Services and Outreach</h3>  
The GCDIS Implementation Plan (1994) states that the User Support and Outreach function applies to all agencies (or their designees) participating in the GCDIS access system at any level.  Common elements include:
<p align=left>
<ul>
<li>Provision of expert staff personnel to assist users with GCDIS access system functions;</li>
<li>Use of information outreach to users of products and services;</li>
<li>Mechanism for obtaining and responding to user feedback;</li>
<li>Ability to exchange information with User Service elements of other agencies/organizations.</li>
</ul>
<p align=left>
GCRIO has defined an approach to User Services and Outreach that complements that functionality without duplicating any existing agency effort.  Elements of the GCRIO approach include:
<p align=left>
<ul>
<li>Developing and maintaining a <i>GCDIS White Pages </i>, or a directory of people so that GCRIO can act as a switchboard, linking users with the global change related contacts at the relevant Federal Agencies or Organizations; 
   </li>
<li>Developing and maintaining a <i>GCDIS Yellow Pages</i>, or a directory of services so that GCRIO can act as a switchboard linking users with the global change-related functions or services at the relevant Federal Agencies or Organizations; </li>
<li>Providing access and links to relevant global change related documentation generated and maintained by the various Federal Agencies or Organizations; </li>
<li>Facilitating access to relevant global change-related data and information products generated and maintained by the various Federal Agencies or Organizations; </li>
<li>Representing GCDIS at selected, relevant national and international meetings and fora;</li>
<li>Promoting a GCDIS Speaker's Bureau in an effort to match user requirements for speakers on global change topics and issues, with appropriate agency contacts. </li>
</ul>
<hr width=95% size=1>
<a name="H"></a>
<p align=left><li><strong>Does GCRIO provide reference/research(journal articles, research reports, books, etc.) to researchers or scholars?</strong>
<p align=left>The GCRIO does not provide in-depth research services but serves more in the referral role and as the provider of on-line access to information systems and resources  via computer networks.</li>
<hr width=95% size=1>
<a name="I"></a>
<p align=left><li><strong>We are students working on the relationship between the "greenhouse effects" and the sea level rise.  Can the GCRIO help us?</strong>
<p align=left>Please feel free to contact the GCRIO for assistance.  The exponential growth of information resources often makes it very difficult to know where to find relevant information. 
<p>The <a href=#Z>GCRIO User Services</a> tries to find the best and most direct resource by selecting and organizing many resources from experts and agencies involved in global environmental change information and the integration of librarians, and researchers, provides a real value-added service that will guide users with specific information needs.<br></li> 
<p>The following GCRIO links are particularly relevant to your topic:<br>

<p align=left><li><strong>I need stratospheric data for the amount of NO2 and O3 present prior to the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo in 1991 and the measurements after the eruption.  Could you supply the data requested or direct us to an alternative source accessible on the internet?</a></strong>
<p align=left>Two articles in Our Changing Planet include references to your topic:<br>
<p>Grant, W.B. et al.  JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH."Aerosol-Associated
Changes in Tropical Stratospheric Ozone Following the Eruption of Mount
Pinatubo."  Vol. 99, pp.8197-8211, 1994.
<p>Data on tropical ozone amounts taken before and after the Mt. Pinatubo
eruption(June 1991) show that there were significant decreases in lower
stratospheric ozone in the year following the eruption.  By comparing
ozone measuremetns take from airborne lidar and balloon ozonesondes
during September 1991 and May-August, 1992 with sonde and satellite data
taken previously, these changes were quantified.  In September, 1991, thereduction in the 16-28 km region was some 33% (29+-Dobson Units, DU) from
pre-Pinatubo amounts.  Comparable changes(33+-7 DU) were observed in the
summer of 1992.
<p>Hilsenrath, E. et al.  JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH.  "Calibaration of
the NOAA 11 Solar Backscatter Ultra Violet (SBUV/2) Ozone Data Set from 1989
to 1993 Using Inflight Calibration Data and SSBUV."  Vol. 100,
p.1351-1366, 1995.
<p>The longest satellite-base ozone data set ever assembled has been created
by combining observations from NASA's Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet
Radiometer (SBUV) and NOAA's SBUV/2.  The merged global data set covers
the period 1978 to 1994 and is being used to evaluate global ozone
trends.  The data set of ozone vertical distribution obtained by the
Solar Backscatter Ultraviol (SBUV/2) instrument on the NOAA-11
operational meteorological satellite was reprocessed, leading the to the
currently available version(Version 6) data set.
