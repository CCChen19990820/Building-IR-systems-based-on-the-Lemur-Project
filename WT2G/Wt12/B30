<h1>Race Based Private Scholarships</h1><p>

Apparently, preferential admissions aren't enough. American 
corporations also provide money on explicit race-based criteria
to minority students just in case the normal scholarships and
loans fail to motivate society's chosen ones. <p>

Notice that this money is not made available based on economic
need or objective criteria of cultural or economic deprivation.<p>

With more European-Americans than Blacks under the poverty line,
it seems that this type of aid should be directed to those from
deprived economic backgrounds without regard to color.<p>

But then this is America!<p>

<h3>Seed Clouds Spread Over Engineering Pool</h3><p>

CORPORATE CASH is starting to flow to the nation's
fastest-growing pool of engineering talent -- black and
Hispanic students.<p>

General Electric Co. has committed $35 million over 10
years for minority students and faculty. And General Motors
Corp. has almost doubled its support for minority engineering
students since 1984 to $1.9 million last year. "We're trying
to make sure we have enough engineering talent," says Richard
O'Brien, a GM personnel official.<p>

Meanwhile, the National Action Council for Minorities in
Engineering, which distributes corporate funds to schools and
minority engineering students, says it's running $500,000
ahead of last year's $5 million budget.<p>

In 1989, blacks received only 2,122, or 3%, of the 68,291
engineering degrees awarded, about the same share as Hispanic
students. On the bright side, U.S. engineering school
enrollments turned up last year after a seven-year slide,
with black and Hispanic students accounting for more than
half the increase.<p>

Of course, some professionals believe corporations haven't
done enough. "Imagine at one point there was no money
running," says Tyrone Taborn, who publishes three magazines
for black and Hispanic engineers. "Now there is a trickle."<p>

<h1>"Separate Pool" Executive Hiring</h1><p>

The following quotes from an article from the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>
give you a bird's eye view of preferences in action at the very
highest levels in Corporate America.<p>

You will notice that Pepsico maintains separate pools by race and
sex for recruiting senior executives in its "Designate" program.<p>

This practice is precisely what the Supreme Court supposedly
outlawed in the Bakke case. Apparently, corporate America recognizes
Bakke for what it is--window dressing by our highest Court to
maintain the impression of fairness. Apparently, there were enough
winks and nods in that badly split opinion to convince corporate
America that they could continue discriminating against European-Americans 
in any way they please.<p>

One thing you will never find is the very top brass resigning to
make room for their new-found favorites.<p>

You may also want to take a look at the stock charts for Xerox,
Merck and the other star performers in minority executive preference
and ask yourselves whether they might be short sale candidates.<p>

<i>PepsiCo's KFC Scouts For Blacks and Women For Its Top Echelons <p>
Fried-Chicken Chain Seeks Well-Seasoned Managers Like Lawrence
Drake, 37</i><p>
 
<b>The $150,000 Onion Breader</b><p>

By JOAN E. RlGDON<br>
Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL<p>

When Larry Drake found himself mixing mashed potatoes at a
Kentucky Fried Chicken outlet in a suburb of Pittsburgh last
winter, he worried that his friends wouldn't understand. 
Months earlier, Mr. Drake had worn tailored suits and cuff links
to his job at Coca-Cola Co., where he managed $100 million of
bottler accounts. A 10-year veteran of Coca-Cola, and one of its
highest-ranking black executives, Mr. Drake earned more than
$100,000 a year, including bonuses. He had just received his
master's degree in business and was aiming for a vice presidency.<p>

Then he got an offer he couldn't refuse. The Kentucky Fried
Chicken unit of archrival PepsiCo Inc. was looking for senior 
executives who could run a business. There was just one hitch: No
senior position was immediately available. Despite that Kentucky
Fried Chicken offered Larry Drake the title of Vice President,
annual compensation of more than $150,000 and the promise of an
executive position within a year. Meanwhile, he would train in
the company's restaurants, learning the business from the kitchen
up.<p>

This is the fast track, Kentucky Fried Chicken style. For two
years, the fast-food chain has been looking across industries,
snapping up other companies' seasoned managers for its so-called
Designate program. In addition to attracting fresh thinkers in
general, Kentucky Fried Chicken uses the program to try to
correct one of corporate America's most intractable problems:
attracting and keeping female and minority-group executives. 
The company makes no bones about its goal. "We want to bring in
the best people," says Kyle Craig, president of Kentucky Fried
Chicken's U.S. operations. But "if there are two equally
qualified people, we'd clearly like to have diversity."  The
program is achieving noteworthy results: In 1989, none of the
company's 17 senior U.S. managers were minority or female; today,
seven are.<p>

<b>Slow Climbing</b><p>

That is a better record than at many American corporations,
where, despite widespread efforts, women and members of minority
groups have made slow progress climbing the ladder. American
companies have tried many strategies for integrating their ranks,
including recruiting at minority-group job fairs, hiring
diversity consultants and, more recently, retaining search firms
owned by women and members of minorities. Gilbert Tweed
Associates, a New York executive search firm reports that 14% of
this year's searches were dedicated to finding women and minority
candidates, double the 7% of 1987.<p>
 
Other companies have proved that however difficult the task of
integrating management, it can be done. As of last year, 14% of
Xerox Corp.'s managers at the vice president level and above were
blacks, up from 3% in 1980. Merck & Co. had 11% minority-group
managers by last year, up from 7.2% a decade ago.<p>
 
But these are the exceptions. Among companies with 100 or more
employees, whites still account for 90% of managers, with white
men outnumbering white women by almost 3-to-1, according to a
1990 study by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Black
men account for just 2.9% of managers; black women, 2.1%;
Hispanics, less than 3%; and Asians, less than 2%. <p>

<b>Calling Every Week</b><p>

Companies say slow progress in minority-group hiring and
advancement is caused partly by a limited hiring pool. Many
minority-group executives fend off calls from companies once a
week, says F. Hassan Shariff, a recruiter for the Johnson Group,
another New York search firm. "There's not a lot of them out
there," he says. Indeed, Kentucky Fried Chicken's Designate
program draws on the same small pool of high-ranking minority-
group and women managers that would attract many other companies.
But KFC points out that it actively promotes women and blacks
into its middle-management ranks, and that its Designate
executives help train future executives within the company. <p>

Adding to the struggle to integrate America's executive suites is
a series of challenges to affirmative action programs and hiring
quotas. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas has loudly
denounced affirmative action programs. Whites say they are being
unfairly deprived of jobs by minority-group candidates who are
less qualified. Others says affirmative action stigmatizes people
by focusing on race instead of talent. Stephen Carter, a Yale
University law professor and author of "Reflections of an
Affirmative Action Baby." calls affirmative action "racial
justice on the cheap" because it is less costly than broad-based
social programs.<p>
 
But for Kentucky Fried Chicken, aggressively recruiting
minorities and women makes good business sense. The company,
which ranks No. 5 in sales in the U.S. among fast-food concerns,
says it is second only to McDonald's Corp. in number of black
customers. And of its 161 middle managers,. 31% are members of
minorities and 26% are women.<p>
 
Kentucky Fried Chicken finds candidates for its Designate program
by retaining search firms owned by minority members and women as
well as by white men. Armed with the same criteria, each
recruiter is asked to produce a different slate of candidates:
all white men, all women (white and minority ) or all black men.
One person is hired from each search; Mr. Drake competed for his
slot against six other black men. Of the 13 people that have been
brought in under the program, two are white women, two black
women, three black men and six white men.<p>

* * *<p>

Women and minority members who reach the executive suite are
"always on stage and on guard," says Nathaniel "Toby" Thompkins,
a diversity consultant at Harbridge House, a Boston-based
training firm. For Mr. Drake, that's a tough mandate. "I can't be
the standard bearer for the entire race," he says.<p>
 
Coca-Cola made no counteroffers when Mr. Drake left because he
told them he wouldn't consider any. he says A CocaCola spokesman
says Mr. Drake was a "fast-track" manager who was slated for more
responsibility within the bottler operations division, though not
necessarily an officership.<p>
 
If Mr. Drake felt frustrated at Coke, he had to fasten his seat
belt for his ride at KFC. His promotion started in November 1990
with the unlikely task of breading onion rings in inner-city
Pittsburgh restaurants, where he later scrubbed floors beside his
colleagues in the middle of the night. Then he managed clusters
of restaurants and, by last June. entire markets.<p>
 
By July, five months ahead of schedule, Mr. Drake got what he
wanted. Now 37 years old, he is KFC's most senior black
executive--a vice president and general manager for the Midwest
region. He is responsible for 259 company and 805 franchise
restaurants with combined revenues of about $800 million. Mr.
Drake reports to Mr. Craig, KFC's U.S. president, and is
considered a candidate for senior positions at PepsiCo's other
divisions.

<h3><i>Race Bias #12</i></h3>

<h1>Minority Promotion Networks</h1><p>

In much of the racial dialogue in the U.S., integrationists
dispute the simple fact of anti-White bias in the system.  Of
course, the media generally propagate our national myths -- 
myths intended to hide the ball from the majority.  But there is
one major daily newspaper that is overwhelmingly subscriber
supported (and not supported by ad revenue).  So it is no
surprise that this well known paper reports the facts. <b>All</b> the
facts.<p>

The excerpt below gives us another list of American corporations
employing preference schemes. In this case, the schemes involve
the curious practice of encouraging exclusive minority "networks"
in which minorities are encouraged to "strategize" about
promotions.  Not the company's success, but <b>promotions</b>.<p>

You see, some organizations have several parallel corporate
objectives. Some employees and managers are expected to get the
goods out the door to customers. Other employees and managers -- 
now officially -- have the job of getting themselves promoted.<p>

In these corporate cultures, non-preferred employees charged
with getting the goods out the door are expected to ignore the
blatant promotion seeking activity of the preferred employees -- 
pretend it doesn't exist -- and press on with the company's
economic business. Managers running this system have developed
a wonderful set of code words, described below, to mollify 
non-preferred employees who might perceive unfairness in all this. <p>

It tells you a great deal about the organization.<p>

In any event, we get a nice list of short-sale candidates
from this article. <p>

Good luck to Xerox in its drive to show the monolithic Japanese
copier companies that "diverse" management ranks are better.<p>

<h3>The New Work Force: A New Push to Break the "Glass Ceiling"</h3><p>

<i><b>But Senior Jobs For Minorities Remain Scarce</b></i><p>

By Leon E. Wynter and Jolie Solomon<br>
Staff Reporters of <i>The Wall Street Journal</i><br>
11/15/89 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)<br>
{Part of a Series}<p>

For years, blacks, other minorities and women have
complained about the "glass ceiling" -- invisible but real --
that acts as a subtle barrier to promotions into high-level
executive jobs.<p>

*  *  *<p>

Today, though, a new sense of urgen      p to be building
over promoting minorities into senior management. And
pressure for increased efforts is coming not just from
minority employees, but also from growing numbers of
decision-makers in big U.S. corporations.<p>

Demographics are an important reason. According to the
Hudson Institute, a think tank, white non-Hispanic men made
up 45% of the labor force in 1986, but from now till 2000,
they will represent only 9% of work-force growth. So, many
executives argue, the successful companies of the future will
be those that remake their corporate cultures so that women,
blacks, immigrants -- and white males -- can get along
comfortably and productively.<p>

Thus, attention is focusing on those few companies that
have shown a knack for promoting minorities into fast-track
management jobs. One such company is Xerox Corp., where
minorities held 16% of managerial jobs and 18% of
professional posts in 1987. Both figures, which have since
risen, were close to the 21% overall minority participation
in the work force in 1987, and significantly better than
average: Companies reporting that year to the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission had minorities in only 9%
of managerial and 12% of professional jobs.<p>

What's more, two of Xerox's five regional vice presidents
and general managers are black. The vice president who heads
the 16,000-person field-service army is black. And he reports
to a black man, A. Barry Rand, who heads Xerox's U.S.
marketing group, the company's single largest U.S. operation.<p>

Some of Xerox's tactics were considered radical just a few
years ago. Among them: encouraging minority caucus groups and
national "networks" providing support and advice to black --
and, later, female, Asian and Hispanic -- employees. "Xerox
gave them the freedom to help advance themselves," says Glegg
Watson, a black Xerox executive and co-author of a book on
blacks in corporate America.<p>

Today, many other companies are trying to learn from
Xerox. Johnson & Johnson and Polaroid Corp. have contacted
Xerox recently to find out about its policies.<p>

Amoco Corp., seeking the best way to establish some form
of minority employee groups, looked to Xerox for guidance.
"Their reputation is that they do a good job," says Wayne
Anderson, vice president for human resources.<p>

Xerox officials say they didn't set out to promote
minorities with the changing labor market in mind, yet they
see definite advantages in being out front in promoting
minorities. "We believe we will have an edge on people who
are trying to catch up to the work force of the '90s," says
Mr. Rand, the Xerox marketing chief. "The manager of the
future is one who can relate to all parts of the population,
with the ability to manage minorities, females, etc. and be
managed by them."<p>

*  *  * <p>

Xerox's push started in the 1970s, when managers of the
company's affirmative action program examined the careers of
10 top executives to find "the key job without which they
would not have made it to where they were," says Theodore
Payne, the company's affirmative action manager. Xerox found
that the common "pivotal" job was that of first-level sales
manager. But an internal survey showed that all of the
company's 500 first-level sales managers were white. The
affirmative-action managers had their work cut out.<p>

"We would go to a regional vice president and ask, `How
many {blacks} can you get to be a sales manager?'" Mr. Payne
recalls. The carrot was that Xerox based 20% of a manager's
performance review on success with human-resources
management, including affirmative action. The stick was
unequivocal messages from two consecutive chairmen, C. Peter
McColough and David T. Kearns, that this program was going to
succeed -- or else.<p>

The program met with some resistance from white managers.
"There were some . . . who just could not adjust," Mr. Payne
recalls. "Some left, others just got crunched up." No one got
fired, he says "but some had to be put out of harm's way. If
the manager had trouble with blacks," he says, they usually
had other problems dealing with people.<p>

In changing its culture, Xerox never tried to dismantle
its informal white, male old-boy network. Instead, the
company allowed a black network to flourish. Groups sprang up
in every major regional headquarters city.<p>

At first, Xerox did nothing to sanction the groups. But
when the first confrontations with management arose, Xerox's
Mr. Kearns, then head of U.S. marketing, supported the
caucus-group concept. Says Mr. Rand, now in the top marketing
post: "We knew we had to establish our own support network,
our own communications channels, because we were not part of
the old-boy network. We called it `revolution by telephone.'"<p>

The caucus groups met on their own time to develop
advancement strategies. Mr. Rand says his group met after
work in one another's homes and videotaped their sales
presentations for group critiques. "If a sales rep wasn't
performing well, another black sales rep might go into that
person's territory and find them prospects," Mr. Rand says of
the early days. One change the caucus sought and won was
getting Xerox to post stepping-stone job openings, a system
many large companies still resist.<p>

But Howard Holley, a black district manager in San Diego,
worries that the groups' effectiveness may be waning because
newer employees, finding a system in place, are complacent.
"The people coming into the organization now don't feel as
threatened," Mr. Holley says.<p>

As the groups succeeded, some whites in the company grew
concerned. "There were numbers of white male employees who
were worried when they saw how aggressively we were moving,"
says Richard Healy, who ran Xerox's Eastern U.S. region for
most of this decade. "If I chose to place a ready black
candidate or female, sometimes the white employees would come
up and say, `What about me?'" recalls Mr. Healy, who is
white.<p>

   Mr. Healy, now a top marketing strategist for Xerox, says
a company policy of candor about its affirmative-action goals
was a major deterrent to backlash from suspicious white
males. "It was a matter of convincing people that they too
would have their chance. It was a matter of speaking about it
very openly."<p>

To be sure, Xerox's success hasn't been universal or
complete. Mr. Watson, who studied hundreds of black
executives for his book on blacks in corporations, says
minorities haven't had as much success breaking barriers in
Xerox's financial-services business or in the important
international arena. "When blacks become as successful {in
those areas}, then Xerox as a whole will be by far the
ultimate corporate model," Mr. Watson says.<p>

Even within sales, "I still think we have too high a rate
of turnover of minorities," Mr. Holley says. He adds that
Xerox can only sustain its goals by staying vigilant in
training new workers.<p>

Mr. Rand believes Xerox will be one of the first companies
prepared to test the value of American cultural diversity
against Japanese homogeneity in the global marketplace. If
Xerox, whose dominance in copying machines has been targeted
by Japanese rivals, can prevail, "we'd like to be able to
stand up and say that we've done that as a multicultural
company," Mr. Rand says. "I think that will serve as a beacon
for the rest of American industry."<p>

<h3><i>Race Bias #13</i></h3>

<h1>Consulting and the Information Elite</h1><p>

This article is important in understanding how large U.S.
employers can indulge in racial preference schemes without
damaging their business.<p>

In Race Bias #12 we read about large U.S. corporations creating
and encouraging minority networks organized for the purpose
of getting minorities promoted. Previous posts in the series
have illustrated the many private preference schemes maintained
for minorities by U.S. corporations.<p>

Discrimination against the talented ordinarily entails economic
costs. Thus the only governmental employers and regulated
utilities insulated against the economic effects of the practice
can indulge it on a large scale.<p>

Many of you may have wondered how large corporations can afford
these costs.<p>

The answer has three parts:<p>

First, the programs are limited in scope.<p>

Second, affirmative action is mandated by government against all
employers with the result that no large competitor can gain an 
advantage by administering tests that restrict the workforce to
the most talented.<p>

Third, consulting firms and investment banks increasingly do all
the "heavy lifting."<p>

As the quoted excerpts from the following article show,
consulting firms and investment banks more or less uniformly hire
the brightest and most talented business graduates. Private industry
seldom hires any. Most management functions are reduced to rote,
repetitive decisions with only minor factual variations from
problems solved earlier.<p>

American corporations have found that they can operate with less
expensive talent, as long as the managers they do hire are
trained to turn to the high paid consultants before tackling the
tough problems.<p>

In this environment of "outsourcing" the difficult tasks,
management has little difficulty creating "easy" management jobs
for minorities to fill.<p>

As you might expect, the information elite is now employed by
consulting firms and investment banks. There are tens of
thousands employed in the computer consulting arms of major
accounting firms, and more tens of thousands in general business
consulting. Additional tens of thousands are employed in the
niche areas of investment banking and smaller fields such as
employee benefits and labor relations.<p>

The only way these consulting firms can survive is to hire
smarter people than those employed at the corporations. And they
do. As you might expect, these consulting firms tend to be
ruthless meritocracies with promotion, ownership and income
levels strictly tied to merit.<p>

As a general observation, there is no "affirmative action" in
these enclaves of the information elite. They have their own
oases of employment largely untouched by the political and social
costs imposed on large manufacturing corporations.<p>

These firms pay much more at the entry level than corporations,
and create many more high paying senior positions than are
created in the relatively narrow pay pyramids of the typical

<h3>Manufacturers Put on the Ritz to Woo M.B.A.s</h3><p>
By JOANN S. LUBLIN<br>
Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL <p>

Ten leading business schools queried by <i>The Wall Street
Journal</i> said the proportion of new M.B.A. degree holders choosing
consulting rose between 1989 and 1994. Seven of the 10 said the
share selecting investment banking and other financial services
also increased. Manufacturers snared a smaller portion of
graduates this year from all but two of the 10 schools. <p>

Money is a big problem. This year's graduates of Dartmouth
College's Tuck School of Business were offered median salaries of
$60,000 from manufacturers and $80,000 from consulting firms. And
while they've long offered more lucrative salary packages,
consulting firms are sweetening those deals even more. <p>

Now many industrial concerns are trying to get back in the
game. They are promising M.B.A.s juicier pay packages. including
signing bonuses. More employers send senior officers to recruit
on campus. To combat the glamour and intellectual challenge
promised by a consulting job, other manufacturers have devised
faster career tracks, expanding leadership-development programs
or moving rising stars into important jobs quickly. <p>

"The competition for the top students is so ferocious that
industrial companies think they have to ratchet up the level of
recruiting," observes Dick Kwartler, editor and publisher of the
M.B.A. Newsletter in Floral Park, N.Y. <p>

ITT'S aggressive pursuit of bright business-school graduates
typifies the industrial sector's intensified talent hunt. Rand V.
Araskog, chairman and chief executive officer of the New York
conglomerate, created the Chairman's MBA Career Development
Program in 1992. At that time few young ITT managers held
positions responsible enough to propel them "into top management
by the time they were 40," he recalls. Yet an early start can be
crucial. The 63-year-old Mr. Araskog took over a Honeywell Inc.
division at age 30. <p>

Every school year, three ITT executive vice presidents and a
senior vice president visit seven schools to interview candidates
for the program. They target M.B.A. students with at least three
years of business experience. <p>

Chairman's MBAs enter ITT at the executive rank, at base
salaries of $80,000 to $100,000 and often with a signing bonus.
Each soon receives options for between 500 and 1,000 ITT shares a
year. Another unusual perk is that these hotshots attend a
luncheon with the board. High-level officials closely track the
new managers. "I think a CEO could easily come from this group,"
Mr. Araskog says. Several recruits have already progressed to key
posts. <p>

* * *<p>

But the arrival of a well-paid but relatively inexperienced
Young Turk can rankle older managers. Even Frydenberg, a
Chairman's MBA and 1993 Stanford University graduate, leapfrogged
over more experienced workers when he joined ITT at age 29. He
immediately became executive assistant manager of the Sheraton
Copenhagen, overseeing about 230 workers.<p>
 
"Most people in my position are no younger than 35" and worked
their way up within a hotel, Mr. Frydenberg says. "I felt
[resentment] from people with a little more seniority than me.
When colleagues grow jealous, he observes, "you don't get the
cooperation, you don't get the support that you need." <p>

And despite its program's visibility, ITT is scoring fewer
successes on campus. Just 10 of 17 M.B.A.s accepted ITT's offer
this year- in 1993, 12 of 15 signed on. "There is tremendous
competition," Mr. Araskog says. "It's a whole new ballgame." 
Indeed. Consultants A.T. Kearney Inc. wants to hire about 270
M.B.A.s in 1995, up from about 50 in 1993. The Chicago concern
says that each new M.B.A. will receive between $90,000 and
$95,000 in salary and signing bonus. The salary packages could
soar to $200,000 by 1999, one Kearney executive predicts. <p>

Michael Spence, a second-year M.B.A. student at the University
of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, is weighing widely disparate
offers from Mercer Management Consulting Inc. and Ford Motor Co.
The 29-year-old was a Mercer consultant for three years before
enrolling in business school . Mr. Spence says Mercer will pay
him $85,000 in salary, a $45,000 signing bonus and a year-end
performance bonus. Ford's offer was $72,000 straight salary, he
adds. <p>

A Ford spokesman says that it doesn't offer signing bonuses and
declines to discuss performance bonuses. <p>

Mr. Spence, who worked for Ford this summer, wants to become a
hands-on manager in industry. But money talks. He will owe about
$48,000 in student loans after graduation. "There isn't an
understanding in industry" of how much money indebted M.B.A.s
need, he contends. <p>

Unable -- or unwilling -- to match consultants' lucrative
packages, more major manufacturers are beefing up leadership
development efforts that rotate a new M.B.A. through numerous
business areas. United Technologies Corp. this year revived its
program, moribund since 1991. Whirlpool Corp. plans to hire
nearly 20 business-school graduates next spring for its
development program, up from 11 in 1994. Some participants land
an overseas assignment almost immediately. <p>

Still, manufacturers have a long way to go. Industrial
companies "need to reassess the job content of the positions
they're putting M.B.A.s into," contends Maury Hanigan, a New York
recruiting consultant. Too many businesses "are still putting
them into fairly low-level jobs that aren't keeping them
intellectually challenged." <p>

<h3><i>Race Bias #14</i></h3>

<h1>Tax Breaks for Minorities</h1><p>

The problem with quotas and racial preferences in the United
States is that they are so widespread you will have trouble
finding them all.<p>

Particularly odious are the numerous tax breaks that promote and
advantage minority business. Unlike minority set-asides in
contracting, there are no competing businesses to get angry when
they lose the contract to a higher bidder. Thus, there is no one
to complain.<p>

People seldom know about these. But then the <i>Journal</i> is doing its
usual thorough job of reporting.<p>

<h3>A Cable Empire That Was Built On a Tax Break</h3> <p>

By MARK ROBICHAUX <br>
Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL <p>

On Frank Washington's first trip to buy a cable system eight
years ago, lightning struck the wing of the plane he took from
California to Tyler, Texas. Thunderstorms rocked the tiny craft,
shaking up Mr. Washington and his new partner, Leo Hindery,
sweating beside him. <p>

The duo arrived safely and pitched the seller with a new tax
break if he sold the cable system to a minority buyer. Mr.
Washington, an African-American, was turned down, and the system
was sold to another minority buyer. <p>

Undeterred, Mr. Washington went on to build a cable empire
using the federal policy, known as the minority tax certificate.
Now he and partners that include Mr. Hindery will try to swallow
their biggest acquisition yet -- the pending $2.2 billion purchase
of cable systems owned by Viacom Inc. The deal would be the
largest ever involving a minority tax certificate, and would put
Mr. Washington in control of one of the country's 10 largest
cable systems. <p>

The deal is expected to be announced soon, perhaps as early as
this Week. It would be part of a sweeping agreement that also
settles an antitrust lawsuit filed by Viacom against Tele-
Communications Inc. TCI, which is backing Mr. Washington's
partnership, is also expected to agree to carry Viacom s MTV and
Showtime in long-term commitments as part of the deal. 
Mr. Washington knows minority tax policy inside and out - he
helped write its foundation while a consultant to former
President Carter's White House staff in 1977. He later went to
the Federal Communications Commission, where he helped implement
the policy, which was created to increase minority ownership of
radio, broadcast TV and cable properties. <p>

At the time, it was a catalyst," says Mr. Washington. "It
focused minorities with aspirations to get into the business, and
it focused the funding sources, the white establishment." 
Advocates say the policy is a practical solution to the dearth of
minorities in telecommunications. But critics say it has been
little more than a tax loophole for media giants like Viacom,
which will be allowed to defer about $280 million in capital
gains taxes, as long as it reinvests the money in replacement
media properties within two years or meets other FCC criteria.
They say it has helped only a handful of people, and Mr.
Washington, who controls more cable systems than any minority in
the industry, has been its primary beneficiary. <p>

* * *<p>
 
Mr. Washington worked his way into Yale Law School, where he
met FCC Chairman Reed Hunt and became lifelong friends with
Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. The men were two of only
10 blacks in their class of about 170 students. <p>

After graduation, Mr. Washington went first to a Washington,
D.C., law firm and then into the political arena as a consultant
to the White House office of telecommunications policy. It was
here that he devised the minority tax certificate. <p>

After five years at the FCC, he jumped into the cable business -- 
first at Times Mirror and later at McClatchy newspapers. He left
McClatchy after three years to build his own cable company --
using the minority tax certificate. But he bristles at the
suggestion that the tax break is solely responsible for his
success. "It took an enormous amount of risk and hard work to get
where I am today," says Mr. Washington. <p>

* * *<p>
 
Critics of the tax certificate policy are hoping the program
will be dismantled by the new Republican-dominated Congress.
"It's utterly odious -- the thought that every group has the right
to a quota of representation, and any time it goes under par, we
go out and fix it," says Bruce Fein, an assistant attorney
general under former President Reagan and a lawyer who
specializes in constitutional law. <p>

The FCC maintains that successes under the tax certificate
program far outnumber the abuses. Mr. Washington defends it as a
meaningful way to increase minority ownership. "We're not talking
about quotas here -- this is a voluntary system," says Mr.
Washington. "It really comes down to individual effort." <p>

<h3><i>Race Bias #15</i></h3>

<h1>Private Quotas -- Law</h1><p>

Reprinted below is an exerpt from a <i>Wall Street Journal</i>
article on programs maintained by large businesses in the
United States that grant explicit race-conscious preferences
in hiring suppliers.<p>

The program is not mandated by government. Note especially the
demand of General Motors for race-based billings information.
Remember this the next time you buy a car.<p>

In this case the explicit race-based hiring involves outside
legal counsel.<p>

<h3>Good Counsel For Minority Lawyers</h3><p>

THE COLOR OF LAW is changing, according to Roger N. Gordon,
publisher of the Minority Counsel Report. Some 18% of the current
first-year law school class is black, Hispanic or Asian. The
Washington, D.C., newsletter advises aspiring lawyers of color on
getting the most out of corporate initiatives to engage more
minority lawyers as outside counsel. <p>

Some 200 major corporations and 300 to 400 minority partners and
minority-owned law firms participate in programs begun by the
black American Bar Association. Other companies are using more
minority lawyers, Mr. Gordon says, as the movement has gone "from
a 'good thing to do' to being an intrinsic part of strategy for
lowering outside counsel expenditures." <p>

Since 1987, General Motors has increased billings with minority
law firms and partners to well over $7 millionn last year, without
substantially raising the costs of hiring outside counsel, says
David A. Collins, general counsel for GM's Saturn division. Like
all small firms, minority firms "are lean and hungry with low
overhead and less complacency," Mr. Collins says, but that
shouldn't lead companies "into assuming that minority attorneys
should be asking for less compensation in return for cracking the
barriers." <p>

Mr. Gordon notes that publicly regulated firms and those that
regularly appear before urban juries also are using more minority
lawyers. He advises minority attorneys to look for a mandate from
top management and to examine how it affects dealings with
nonminority firms. GM, for example, requires law firms to break
out billings by race and gender, and notifies firms of its
"comfort" with being assigned minority partners, Mr. Collins
says. <p>

<h3><i>Race Bias #16</i></h3>

<h1>The Weber Case Revisited</h1><p>

Below are excerpts from a 1978 <i>Wall Street Journal</i> article on the
famous "Weber" Case. These excerpts are from an article
explaining the importance of the case for survival of private
programs that discriminate against European-Americans.<p>

The Supreme Court agreed to review the case, and held that
private business was free to discriminate against European-
Americans in any way it wished, thereby overruling the Fifth
Circuit.<p>

The Supreme Court is making news recently by reviewing a
case concerning race preferences in federal contracting.<p>

Welcome to the hierarchy of race preferences and political
resistance!<p>

Contracting preferences are politically dangerous because the low
bidders (unlike the Brian Webbers of this country) have resources
and can effectively complain to their congressmen and sponsor
opposing candidates if they do not get their way. Their resources
could also be used to create institutions that might marshall
opposition to affirmative action and, more broadly,
integrationism in all its aspects.<p>

To cripple opposition, it is most important for the liberals to get
rid of quotas in government contracting.<p>

Far less powerful are the rank and file employees like Brian
Weber. The integrationists have less to fear from them.<p>

Less powerful still are students seeking college admissions.
(Curiously, the "policy prescription" set forth by Herrnstein and
Murray in the "Bell Curve" was for universities to keep
admissions quotas, but to reduce the gap between average white
and black IQs on campus to a half a standard deviation from the
current range of from 1 to 2 full standard deviations, so that the
differences would not be so obvious to European-Americans on
campus.)<p>

Last in power are the taxpayers victimized by direct subsidies
and tax breaks for minority business. These are the preference
schemes most often supported by the economic conservative
integrationists like Jack Kemp and William Bennett with their
"enterprise zones" and other direct financial handouts. <p>

These schemes allow the Kemps and Bennetts of this country to
advocate outright race preferences and buy minority votes while
apearing to respect "rights of the individual."<p>

They would impose the burden of minority preferences exclusively
on the taxpayer. The virtue of such schemes is that they tend not
to arouse the intense opposition of individual victims such as
Brian Weber. (Liberals, on the other hand, prefer schemes that
involve direct "in-your-face" degradation of European-American
males.)<p>

In any event, you should not be surprised to learn that much of
the effort you read about in the press to "roll back" racial
preferences is not motivated by principled opposition to them,
but rather a concern to "fine tune" them so that the consequences
will be less visible to the great mass of European-American sheep
who commute the freeways and pay their taxes.<p>

Also, you should not be surprised to learn that the Supreme Court
will select cases based on cynical political motives as opposed
to constitutional principle. <p>

After all, this is America!<p>

So if we are to see a rollback in affirmative action, expect to
see it in contracting and, perhaps, job quotas. But look more for
measures that refine it and make it less visible -- which is to
say to load more of its costs onto the taxpayer generally and
less on to the backs of individual victims.<p>

That said, here is the description of the land-mark case that
made discrimination against European-Americans perfectly "legal."<p>

<h3>In Bakke's Wake, Kaiser Aluminum Case<br>
May Help in Clarifying Reverse Job-Bias Issue</h3><p>

<i><b>Supreme Court May Consider Attack by White Worker On Preferential
Program </b></i><p>

<b>Weakness of a Clean Record</b><p>

By MARILYN CHASL<br>
Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL<p>

Brian Weber, a 31-year-old lab analyst with 10 years' service
at the Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical Corp. plant in Gramercy, La.,
says he longs for a crack at a skilled crafts job in which he
could double his pay, get greater job security and escape the
grind of night work. <p>

However, when he applied for a crafts-retraining program back
in April 1974, he was rejected. Mr. Weber is white, and the
program called for at least 50% black and female trainees. 
Initial disbelief turned to anger, says Mr. Weber, who often
wears a hard hat decorated with patriotic decals. I'm not a
person to sit down and let this happen--let it happen to me,
anyway," he asserts. So eight months and several fruitless
complaint procedures later, he sued. <p>

So far, Mr. Weber's claim of reverse discrimination has been
upheld in federal district court in New Orleans and in the Fifth
Circuit Court of Appeals; both courts ruled the Kaiser program
illegal. The Supreme Court, which begins its new term Oct. 2,
could consider whether to accept Kaiser's appeal shortly after
that. If it accepts the case, oral arguments aren't likely to be
scheduled until early next year. If the court declines to review
it, the Fifth Circuit's decision against the Kaiser plan at the
Louisiana plant would remain in force without setting any
nationwide standard for the moment. <p>

<b>Kaiser's View</b><p>

Kaiser's attorney, Robert J. Allen Jr., warns that a Supreme
Court ruling against the company "would destroy affirmative
action as we have practiced it -- on a voluntary basis." <p>

Although Kaiser's chances of winning its case in the Supreme
Court are far from clear, one top federal official says a
decision in Kaiser's favor would be "momentous" because it would
lend legitimacy to just about any industrial affirmative-action
program currently in existence. Moreover, Eleanor Holmes Norton,
chief of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission,
supports Kaiser's program as both "reasonable" and "responsible,"
and she considers such voluntary programs, "absolutely essential
to law enforcement." <p>

Mrs. Norton adds that Weber v. Kaiser exemplifies the
contradictory pressures squeezing American companies. 
"Kaiser," she says, "is a classic example of an employer caught
between a rock and a hard place, trying to comply with the law
but sued by a white employee." Then she adds: "When law
enforcement makes it hard for people to comply voluntarily, then
there's something wrong with law enforcement." <p>

The central dilemma: A company that shuns affirmative action
runs the risk of a discrimination suit by minority employees, and
a company that hasn't a proven history of past bias but embraces
affirmative action -- such as Kaiser -- runs the risk of a reverse
discrimination suit by white employees. <p>

*  *  *<p>

Kaiser had set up its affirmative-action program to comply with
an executive order issued by President Johnson. The order
required that companies doing business with the federal
government not only refrain from discriminating but take
"affirmative action" to correct racial imbalance. Many other
companies have begun similar programs to avoid losing federal
contracts or to ward off Title VII suits by minorities contending
that they have been victims of job bias.<p>

The affirmative-action plan at Kaiser was negotiated between
the company and the United Steelworkers of America. It was
designed to channel minorities and women at Kaiser into
higher-paying skilled-crafts jobs, where they were
underrepresented. To achieve this, a training program was devised
in which at least one black or female employee had to be admitted
for every white male. In effect, the lines of seniority split
into minority and white, and as a  result some minority trainees
were placed ahead of whites with more seniority -- including Brian
Weber.<p>

"The quota eliminated me (and) a lot of people more senior than
me," Mr. Weber charges, adding that white co-workers rallied to
his side. "People got behind me," he says. "They put their
marbles on the suit." And when black co-workers reply that they
have suffered historical discrimination, he responds with what
may be the rallying cry for the present wave of reverse-
discrimination cases: "Yeah, but that's no reason to do it to me
now."<p>

Mr. Weber's attorney, Michael Fontham, charges, "We have what
is an out-and-out quota."<p>

Moreover, as in the Bakke case, the Weber case turns on the
lack of any proven record of bias at the Gramercy plant on which
to justify a quota. Kaiser had determined that blacks and women
were outnumbered in the crafts because such jobs formerly had
been awarded solely on the basis of seniority and prior
experience, where white males traditionally had the edge.
Voluntarily -- albeit spurred on by federal contract compliance
reviews, as are all companies -- Kaiser and the union set out to
redress that imbalance that sprang from years of social
inequality in the South. <p>

"I have no problem with any program designed to return an
individual to his rightful place in the company, if the company
and the union did anything to prevent him from advancing," Mr.
Fontham argues. "But for the company to do it to correct general
societal conditions is contrary to our values. People like Brian
Weber are having their dreams for the future quashed."<p>

However, many federal contractors prefer to set up an
affirmative-action program before their employee rolls are found
to be racially imbalanced. "It really puts the contractor at risk
to have to wait for the government to come in and find something
that's wrong," Assistant Secretary of Labor Donald Elisburg says.
A predictable storm of bad publicity and possible loss of a
lucrative federal contract make companies anxious to avoid such
findings of discrimination, whether by a court or federal agency.<p>

Federal officials believe companies undertaking affirmative
action under court order, by consent degree or through
conciliation with EEOC, are generally safe from reverse-
discrimination complaints. But the Supreme Court has yet to issue
any definitive rule guiding employers through the gauntlet of
opposing claims by black and white workers. Such a rule could
emerge from the Weber case.<p>

*  *  * <p>

Kaiser's case may indeed be weakened ironically enough -- by its
clean record, government sources say. Thus, some fear Weber v.
Kaiser is a bad test case on which to pin the future of voluntary
affirmative-action programs. If the lower courts had found that
Kaiser or the union had discriminated against black workers prior
to initiating the program, "obviously we would feel a lot
stronger about the case," says James D. Henry, associate
solicitor of the Labor Department. <p>

Big corporations--some with millions of dollars tied up in their
affirmative-action programs--are watching the Weber case warily. <p>

*  *  *<p>

<b>Enforcement Impact</b>

Those concerned with enforcing fair employment say their job
would be vastly more difficult if the Supreme Court bans
voluntary affirmative-action programs in the absence of prior
findings of discrimination. "It would be distressing, and it
would be very difficult,'' Assistant Labor Secretary Elisburg
says.<p>

The key difficulty is explained by the EEOC's Mrs. Norton.
"Employers cannot be expected to admit prior discrimination
because that would open them up to liability," she says.
Corporate officials agree. <p>

Thomas Hilbert, labor counsel for General Electric Co.,
criticizes the Fifth Circuit decision as "unrealistic" and
"marginal" for requiring proof of past bias. To admit to
violations is "a hell of a thing for any company to do," he says,
noting that GE's recent $32 million conciliation agreement with
the EEOC didn't require any such admission.<p>

Distaste for government interference is another reason business
hopes voluntary affirmative action survives the Weber case. As
Robert Stenberg, Ford Motor Co.'s equal employment planning
manager, says, "We function better in the business community when
we sort of make our own way." <p>

<h3><i>Race Bias #17</i></h3>

<h1>Race Norming</h1><p>

When European-Americans take employment skills tests, they are
scored differently than other groups. They seldom realize that
this is the case.<p>

Race norming is the practice of giving every applicant for
employment the same skills test, but then grading the test
differently depending on the applicant's race.<p>

The test is "normed" for the race of the taker by adding points
to the score of any minority applicant equal to the difference
between the average result for European-Americans and the average
result for the minority group of which the test taker is a
member.<p>

It may surprise you to know that even tests measuring hand-eye
coordination must be race normed!!!<p>

Everyone inside and outside of government admits that higher
scoring Whites are likely to be much more productive employees
than lower scoring whites. They admit also that higher scoring
Blacks and Hispanics will be more productive than lower scoring
Blacks and Hispanics.<p>

Before the advent of affirmative action, most companies used to
hire employees without requiring skill tests. This fact raises 
fascinating questions:<p>

<dl><dd>
Has affirmative action caused a loss in productivity that
has driven employers to administer tests as a means of
compensating for that loss?<p>

Does this need for higher skill and productivity levels
among Euro-Americans and Asians mean that members of those
groups must now work harder and smarter to compensate for
the effects of affirmative action?<p>

In other words, are there costs of affirmative action that
are imposed not only on the unsuccessful White job
applicants, but the successful ones as well?<p>

</dl>

Now if anyone were to accuse employers of doing such a thing,
many of you would be inclined not to believe it. So, I have
reprinted excerpts from an article from the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>
that describes the practice.<p>

Philip Morris is a believer in "Race Normed" tests that
discriminate against European-Americans. Remember that the next
time you are tempted to buy a pack of Marlboro cigarettes or
Miller Beer.<p>

<h3>Job Tests Scored On Racial Curve Stir Controversy</h3><p>

By TIMOTHY NOAH <br>
Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL.<p>

WASHINGTON -- Question: Should scores on job-placement tests be
adjusted to account for an applicant's race?<p>
 
Answer: In some instances, they already are. <p>

For more than a decade, hundreds of companies have been hiring
workers partly on the basis of test scores that are "race-
normed," or ranked on a percentile basis in comparison only with
the performance of others in the same ethnic group. This practice
has stirred some controversy, but the debate generally has been
confined to a small band of experts in corporate personnel
departments and various state and federal agencies.<p>

*  *  *<p>

Supporters of race-norming say unadjusted test results don't
accurately predict job performance. Charles Stephen Ralston, a
lawyer for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund in New York, defends
race-norming as a "necessary tool" that "corrects for the bias
that's in the test."<p>
 
But even some supporters of race-norming say it can compromise
hiring standards. "When you adjust the test scores, you're
passing people who are less qualified," says Charles Wonderlic
Jr., vice president of E.F. Wonderlic Personnel Test Inc.,
Northfield, Ill., which sells tests that can be race-normed. 
The use of race-norming has been shrouded in secrecy. Companies
are reluctant to discuss their race-norming policies, possibly
fearing they will attract reverse discrimination lawsuits.<p>

Officials at various state employment services, which administer
what is probably the most widely used race-normed test, offer
only sketchy details about how businesses have fared using race-
norming. The officials cite either a lack of information or a
need to protect the confidentiality of the companies to which
they refer job applicants.<p>
 
"Our feedback is that employers are very satisfied," says Tom
Chesar, supervisor of test research for New Jersey's state
employment service.<p>
 
The trend toward race-norming has been led by the Labor
Department, which has worked closely with state employment
services to match job seekers with private sector jobs. To screen
job applicants, the state agencies have used the General Aptitude
Test Battery, or GATB, a Job-skills test developed by the
department more than 10 years ago.<p>
 
The GATB measures a potential employee's hand-eye coordination as
well as his or her cognitive skills in such areas as arithmetic,
reasoning and vocabulary. Before 1981, race wasn't a factor in
calculating the scores. Since then, however, many states have had
the option of scoring the GATB on the basis of how well an
individual performs compared with others in the same ethnic
group. Test takers are placed in one of four categories: black,
Hispanic, Native American and "other."<p>
 
Labor Department officials say people who score well on the GATB
tend to be successful on the job, a view backed by a 1989 report
from the National Academy of Sciences. But when the agency moved
to expand the use of the test in the early 1980s, it feared the
results would discriminate against blacks and Hispanics.<p>
 
"Whites on the whole perform above Hispanics, Hispanics above
blacks, Asians above all three groups," says Robert Litman,
deputy director of the Labor Department's U.S. Employment
Service. If employers hired solely on the basis of raw GATB
scores, says Mr. Litman, "we would be discriminating
significantly" along ethnic lines.<p>
 
To avoid potential discrimination, the Labor Department began a
race-norming pilot program that eventually spread to 44 states.
"I don't know that there ever was a policy decision" to proceed,
says one Labor Department official.<p>

*  *  * <p>
 
Mr. Wonderlic says race-norming isn't for everybody. "It's really
the larger companies, where they want to meet affirmative-action
goals," that are likeliest to race-norm, he says. A spokesman for
Philip Morris Cos., New York, says the company uses race norming
because it is "one way we have of recruiting qualified minority
candidates for jobs."<p>
 
Employment specialists say race-norming can help companies avoid
so-called disparate-impact civil rights cases charging that an
employment test is an indirect form of discrimination, because a
normed test is theoretically bias-free. Race-norming has also
been imposed by the courts as a legal remedy in some employment-
discrimination lawsuits and has been pushed by the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission (though the commission is
currently split over whether to allow race-norming ).<p>
 
But some opponents of race-norming argue that it can be
deceptive. Many employers, they charge. are unaware that a black
applicant's GATB score of 85% - may not reflect the same test
performance as a white or Hispanic's score of 85%.<p>
 
A Labor Department official says states have made an "honest
effort" to notify employers who use GATB about the race-norming,
but "saying something and having that message comprehended are
two different things."<p>

<b><i>BUSINESS & RACE</i></b><p>

By Leon E. Wynter<p>

04/18/91 <i>WALL STREET JOURNAL</i> (J), PAGE B1<p>

<h3>Theater Program Tackles Issues of Diversity</h3><p>

AT Xerox, "Gloria," a new black engineer, knits her brow
in frustration after a meeting with her white male boss,
"Charles." He had paired Gloria with a black secretary for
six weeks and then dismissed her bid to join a new product
team. He explained he was too afraid of affirmative action
backlash to risk giving her a shot.<p>

Worst of all, Charles did this while a room full of Xerox
executives looked on in horror.<p>

Gloria and Charles are actors in a unique interactive
theater program designed by Cornell University's theater
department to help executives face the challenge of managing
a diverse work force. After each short play, the actors stay
in character for questioning. The action seems so real, a
Xerox employee recalls, that after one scene, a Xerox manager
jumped up, pointed at Charles and announced, "You're
history!"<p>

Xerox has presented the s      ,300 managers. The
company has long stressed affirmative action; the half-day
program is a refresher that supplements video training tapes.
"You can't ask {a videotape} questions," says Jim Stoffel, a
Xerox vice president.<p>

The program succeeds by touching feelings, says Cornell's
Janet Salmons-Rue. A scene in which a Hispanic manager's
heavily accented words are ignored by whites makes one
participant recall his unease with asking a Hispanic employee
to repeat things slowly. "I'm not quite sure if I'm
embarrassing him," the manager says. The answer, a Xerox
trainer tells him, is to ask.<p>

<h1>Business Opposes Quota Repeal</h1>

Well here you have it, folks. We elect a huge crop of new
Republican Freshmen who want to represent us by repealing race
preferences, and what happens?<p>

Big Business lobbies to keep the preferences in place. Their
Republican lackeys in the Senate agree.<p>

Some possible explanations:<p>

<ul>
<li>Fear of racial unrest and riots which would dampen consumer
demand.

<li>Fear by firms with minorities that upstart competitors might
not be faced with the same affirmative action hurdles and costs.

<li>A feeling that employment serves a social welfare purpose, and
that all employers should be forced to employ minorities as a 
concealed wealth transfer from shareholders and the remaining
workers who must increase productivity.

<li>Euro-Americans are such compliant sheep that there is no reason
to roll back the quotas and anger minorities (who are not sheep)!<p>

PEELING BACK affirmative-action programs picks up momentum in the
House. <p>

Critics look to Oklahoma Rep. Istook on the Appropriations
Committee to zero in on agencies that enforce minority
preferences. One suggested target: the Office of Federal Contract
Compliance. Illinois Rep. Fawell plans hearings on Justice
Department policies. Florida Rep. Canady, head of a Judiciary
panel, says, "The time has come to look at [preferences] in a
comprehensive way." <p>

But business is wary. "That is not one of our key issues here
at the moment," says the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's Stephen
Bokat. The National Association of Manufacturers frets about a
backlash from minorities. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman
Hatch doesn't "see in the near future any real set of hearings or
bill" on affirmative action. <p>

Following California's lead, Delaware state Rep. Wayne Smith is
drafting a state constitutional amendment that would ban
government racial preferences there.<p>

<h1>Bidding War for Black Students</h1><p>

The statistics show that there are more European-Americans below
the poverty line than African-Americans.<p>

On page 46 of <i>The Bell Curve</i> Herrnstein and Murray reprint a
graphic showing that the number persons having IQs of 140 who do
not attend college still exceeds the number with IQs above 140
who do attend.  While colleges are doing a better job at
identifying high-ability students than they did in 1930, there is
still a long way to go.<p>

Only four tenths of one percent of Americans have IQs above 140,
(approximately 12,000 out of the 3 million babies born live each
year). What "The Bell Curve" makes clear is that more than half
of these super-bright children are "missed" entirely by the
system and never get to college.<p>

Now three guesses as to the racial group in which these "missed"
children are concentrated!<p>
 
As you will see from the article below, enormous sums are spent
by colleges on the children of wealthy Blacks. None is being
spent on identifying the brilliant children of ordinary working
European-American parents who cannot afford college tuition.<p>

America has developed a rather strange concept of justice!<p>

<h3>Education: Black Students Become Targets Of Bidding War</h3><p>

by Gary Putka<br>
Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL<p>

A financial-aid bidding war for top black students has broken
out among colleges, yielding generous scholarships and some
knotty questions of equity in an era of scarce academic
resources. <p>

Eager to diversify the racial profile of their student bodies,
colleges are offering unprecedented sums to academically talented
blacks, admissions officers say. Many of the awards are not based
on need but on merit, causing some colleges to question whether
the trend is diverting aid dollars from poorer students. <p>

"It's deeply troubling to me," says Neil Rudenstine, Harvard
University's president. "It's a situation that looks like it
could develop into a system that doesn't pay attention to the
real needs of families and students." <p>

Instead of partial scholarships, awards covering all costs -- 
more than $20,000 a year at some private schools -- are becoming
more common. Although academic merit scholarships are available
to students of all races at many colleges, Harvard and other
schools say such awards are being made with increasing frequency
as a recruitment tactic in a heated competition to tap a small
pool of top-achieving blacks. <p>

And while the big aid awards may be lifting black enrollment at
some schools, overall black participation in higher education
remains stubbornly frozen at levels below the 12% proportion of
blacks in the general population. Nationally, blacks accounted
for 9.2% of freshmen in the fall of 1991, down from a peak of
9.8% in 1984. <p>

Harvard, disturbed by a sharp drop in black enrollment in this
year's freshman class, says that many black students it accepted
were wooed away by other schools offering aid packages that far
exceeded financial need. <p>

Of 172 blacks accepted for admission at Harvard this fall, only
94 are attending -- the lowest number in the 24 years since
affirmative action policies began taking hold at the school.
Harvard has 1,606 first-year students. Last year, the school
enrolled 132 black freshmen. <p>

Harvard surveyed the black students who rejected it, and "what
we found is quite provocative," says William Fitzsimmons, dean of
admissions. "There is an awful lot of money being spent out
there." <p>

Mr. Fitzsimmons says that one student who went elsewhere
reported receiving an $85,000, four-year scholarship that covered
tuition, fees, room and board -- and an additional $10,000 in
stipends to cover "travel or any project of her choice" during
summer vacations. Many of the students reported getting "full
ride" scholarships covering all costs, including one whose
family's income was $140,000 a year according to Mr. Fitzsimmons.
Harvard, which makes awards only on the basis of need, declined to
name students or the schools they chose. <p>

Mr. Fitzsimmons says students with family incomes as high as
$164,000 reported receiving aid elsewhere, while a "reasonable
number" of those in the survey had incomes above $80,000, a level
at which little need-based aid is generally available. He says he
doesn't have complete income data because some of the students
didn't apply for financial aid at Harvard. <p>

Admissions officers at other well-regarded colleges agree with
the assessment that merit-based awards are increasing and have
been especially high for blacks and, to a lesser extent, other
minorities. <p>

It has "been true for the last couple of years," says Fred
Hargedon, Princeton University's dean of admissions. Mr. Hargedon
says that "probably half" of black students accepted by Princeton
go elsewhere for merit scholarships. Princeton has 64 black
freshmen, five fewer than last year, in a class of 1,130
students. It accepted 180 blacks for admission. Like other Ivy
League schools, it makes no aid awards based on merit. <p>

Many colleges, of course, also lure students with athletic
scholarships that aren't based on need. But abuses in athlete
recruitment have led to award limits and other regulation by the
National Collegiate Athletic Association. No such regulation
governs academic-merit awards. <p>

Competition for the best black students has become especially
heated, schools say, because more colleges are pursuing racial
heterogeneity as a goal. "Colleges nationally want diversity, and
to get diversity, you have to make your aid packages very
attractive for incoming freshmen," says Emmett Griffin,
admissions director at Howard University, an historically black
college in Washington, D.C. <p>

Another factor is the relatively small pool of black students
with high college entrance test scores. Colleges typically buy
the same recruitment lists from test sponsors, focusing in on
groups according to ethnicity, scores and geography. The list of
last year's black high school seniors scoring between 600 and the
maximum of 800 on the verbal part of the Scholastic Aptitude Test
contained only 1,493 names; in mathematics the number was 3,404.
Schools rated in the top rung in college guides generally prefer
students with scores higher than 600. <p>

Richard Shaw, Yale University's dean of admissions, says many
students in the top tier receive multiple offers of admission,
with colleges increasingly willing to negotiate aid packages to
match others. The danger, says Mr. Shaw, is that students will be
"bought off" and will make their decision based strictly on
money, rather than the school that might make the best
educational fit. <p>

But not everyone is upset. Indeed, the U.S Department of
Justice, in an antitrust case against the Ivy League and others,
argued that students should be free to negotiate the best deal
they can get from a school, irrespective of need. The case
resulted in the demise of a practice called overlap, under which
aid awards were fixed by the schools so that multiple admission
students were denied any price advantages. Now that Overlap has
collapsed, black students and others "are finally getting what
they deserve," says John Katzman, who owns Princeton Review Inc.,
a test-coaching company. <p>

But Harvard and other Ivy schools say that the increased aid to
blacks has little to do with the demise of their financial aid
cooperation. They say much of the competition is coming from
institutions that were never part of Overlap to begin with. <p>

Dr. Rudenstine, Harvard's president, says he may take steps to
reduce the growth of merit-only awards if the school continues to
lose black students "or any other category of students" for
financial reasons in the spring and next September. Despite the
legal sensitivity of the issue, he says he may request that
colleges exchange information on financial aid after students are
enrolled to see whether awards are actually draining money from
needy students. If that is the case, he says it may be possible
to argue that the schools should curb excessive awards.  <p>

But if that fails, Dr. Rudenstine says Harvard may have to
consider providing, merit scholarships of its own. Any such move
would have widespread implications for other schools' aid
policies, since Harvard's $5 billion endowment would make it, a
formidable competitor in merit awards. Dr. Rudenstine stressed
that Harvard would do this only as a last resort. <p>

<h3>What Non-White Immigration Means for Our Children</h3>

<H1>Melting Pot Meltdown</H1>

<i>Originally published in the Jan. 1994 edition of <b>Stormfront</b></i><p>

Russian nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky has once again
horrified the politically correct and "culturally sensitive"
by suggesting that White people, who comprise only eight
percent of the world's population, should unite to keep from
being overwhelmed by non-Whites. The reaction from Western
governments and the news media to their current archdemon
has been predictable. Any attempt to preserve the integrity
of the White race, in their view, constitutes the most vile
form of racism and bigotry, and anyone advocating such a
plan must be pilloried as a dangerous criminal.<p>

It is, therefore, no surprise that only a few farsig      itical philosophers have addressed the looming American
immigration crisis. Our elected officials have failed for
more than two decades to act to control immigration. As a
result, demographers are already taking note of the dramatic
changes occurring in the population of the United States.<p>

Leon Bouvier and Cary Davis, respected demographers with
the Population Reference Bureau, prepared population
projections demonstrating the changes which large-scale
Third World immigration is causing.<p>

They warn that projections are not predictions.
Immigration could increase or decrease. The future will
never turn out to be exactly like the projections. Yet
projections by the population experts are important because
they give an approximation of future population demographics
if immigration continues at current high levels.<p>

What do the experts' predictions show?<p>

Current levels of immigration are transforming the United
States from a predominantly European-descended, English-
speaking nation into a melting pot, a land in which
Asians, non-White Hispanics, Blacks and Whites are all minorities.<p>

This transformation is happening fastest in the states
favored by immigrants, such as California, Texas, Florida
and New York. The speed with which this change occurs
depends on the level of immigration. Because most
immigration to the United States is now illegal, no precise
figure can be given for annual net immigration. However,
Immigration and Naturalization Service officials and leading
scholars are able to make educated estimates.<p>

Legal immigration is currently in excess of 600,000
persons annually. Illegal immigrants fall into two broad
categories: (1) visa abusers/fraudulent document users and
(2) surreptitious border crossers.<p>

The latter category is well known to the American public.
Chiefly Mexicans and others from Central America, these
illegal aliens cross the border without visas or other
documentation -- usually under cover of darkness.<p>

More than 1.2 million such aliens were captured this
year, and Border Patrol agents estimate that two to three
illegal aliens slip by for each one that is apprehended.<p>

While an indeterminate number of those who succeed in
entering our country eventually return to their native
lands, the net influx is believed to have been in excess of
one million persons annually for the last several years --
and the number is growing.<p>

The other category of illegal aliens is more
sophisticated and comes from around the world, particularly
the Middle East, the Far East and Latin America. These
violators of our laws enter posing as students, tourists or
businessmen, then simply drop out of sight and never return
to their homelands. Others enter with forged U.S. passports
or resident alien cards.<p>

Experts estimate that the flow of such visa abusers and
fraudulent documents users is now in the neighborhood of
300,000 to 500,000 per year -- and growing.<p>

Combining 600,000 legal immigrants with a conservative
1,100,000 illegal border crossers, then adding 300,000 visa
abusers and fraudulent document-using aliens, a rough
estimate of 2,000,000 immigrants per year is reached.<p>

It should be noted that the flow of illegal aliens has
been increasing steadily for over two decades, so that if
the present lack of immigration control is continued, the
flow will be much greater in the future. Given the exploding
population of the Third World, pressure to immigrate to the
United States can only increase over the next several
decades.<p>

The accompanying chart shows how the White population is
decreasing in the United States while the non-White
population from Latin America and the Caribbean is
exploding.<p>

If America is to survive as a free and prosperous nation,
decisive action must be taken soon. Border Patrol forces
must be bolstered until enough men are available to cut the
illegal immigrant flow to nil. Legal immigration must be
drastically reduced and shifted to favor those of European
descent, who can more easily assimilate into the American
population. Illegal aliens already here must be apprehended
and deported. Our borders must be protected or we will
become not a nation, but a borderless conglomerate of
peoples mixed in confused identities; linguistically,
socially and racially debased.<p>

<H1>Destructive Immigration</H1><P>

<I>American Dissident Voices program of 13th November, 1993</I><P>

A few days ago an extremely important article was published in the patriotic magazine, Liberty Bell, PO Box 21, Reedy WV 25270, $45 per year. The article was written by Dr. Richard C. Bentinck, MD. It is a warning to us, a warning which American patriots will ignore at their peril. It deals with the most pressing problem that our country faces today: destruction by the invasion of America which is now taking place, an invasion which is often referred to by soft euphemisms, but which is an invasion nonetheless. Today's program is based on that article, entitled Destructive Immigration. Listen carefully, for you are 
about to hear truths that no other radio program on the air today would 
dare to tell you, so strong is the censorship in our country today.<P>

Polls show that the vast majority of Americans want legal immigration 
reduced and illegal immigration stopped. I wonder why our government has 
taken no action to stem the flow of third-world minorities, a flow that is 
now so great that it literally transforming our nation in a way that 
ordinary Americans find frightening and disturbing.<P>

In fact, why does the U.S. Congress actually promote immigration, legal 
and illegal, against all reason? Our nation, already mired in debt, cannot 
productively employ our existing population and must create non-productive 
taxpayer-supported "service" jobs to absorb the surplus labor we now have.<P>

With rare exception, the immigrant, legal or illegal, from a third world 
area is fleeing, not political persecution, but economic deprivation as a 
direct result of indiscriminate breeding and its consequence, 
over-population, in quasi-feudalistic societies steeped in ignorance and 
authoritarian religious dogma. Decades of experience has shown that many 
of these immigrants and their numerous offspring end up as drains on one 
or more of the myriad Liberal-sponsored county, state, and federal 
give-away programs. Not satisfied with our bounty, they have leisure to 
turn to violence and jam our law enforcement, judicial, and prison 
systems. All of this is paid for by confiscatory taxing of a diminishing 
number of mostly White, legitimate U.S. citizens productively employed in 
the private sector.

Why do Congress and federal bureaucrats ignore, when considering the 
illegal immigrant, our statutes that require a legal immigrant to be 
conversant with our history and our institutions, guarantee that he will 
not require support from any federal or state program for a minimum of 
five years, be in good health, and have a working knowledge of English? 
Why this special status for the illegal - and now, even the legal 
immigrant as long as he is a member of a so-called minority? (This word 
"minority" is wildly inappropriate, you know, when you consider that 
persons of European descent constitute only about 12% of the world's 
population!)<P>

And why, when a foreign woman gives birth in the U.S., is she not sent 
back to Mexico - or wherever she may belong - with her infant? Born in the 
U.S., the infant is by a quirk of the law a U.S. citizen. His mother is 
not. The courts have held that simply having received hospital delivery 
care in the United States at U.S. taxpayer expense, does not bestow upon 
the mother a right to U.S. citizenship. She must return to wherever she 
belongs and, since a minor child should not be separated from its mother, 
the court has held that the infant must go with her. When the child has 
reached his majority at the age of 21 years, only then may he return 
legally. But this deliberately hidden aspect of the law is not enforced.<P>

By the way, the word "Hispanic" to designate these illegal immigrants from 
Mexico and Central America is really a misnomer. "Hispanic" literally 
means "from Spain," and only a very few of these illegal immigrants are of 
European Spanish descent. Most of them are mestizos, meaning part European 
and part Indian. Their special-interest organization is even called La 
Raza, which means "the race," expressing their racial solidarity as 
mestizos.<P>

For decades, it has been no secret that a mestizo Mexican female will 
cross the border surreptitiously or on a tourist visa, ostensibly for a 
day of "shopping," when she knows delivery of her pregnancy is imminent. 
Within hours, she is in a U.S. hospital giving birth to her little U.S. 
citizen, courtesy of the U.S. taxpayer. Almost certainly, the mother, 
often a child herself, has had no prenatal care and her pregnancy is at 
high risk. If there should be problems, there is no shortage of hungry 
lawyers waiting to pounce on the delivering physician and hospital with 
law suits regardless of merit. Such an infant is more likely to require 
care in an Intensive Care Nursery where costs routinely are measured in 
the hundreds of thousands of dollars. In California, Los Angeles County 
alone spends millions of dollars for the care of illegal aliens.<P>

Hospital Discharge Planning acquaints the new mother with all the 
taxpayer-supported programs ready to help her and her little one. More 
often than not, Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) has not been 
notified of her illegal status. Even if INS were notified, political 
pressures from leftist church groups, the previously mentioned La Raza 
group, and various mestizo activist groups would force the INS to keep a 
strictly hands-off position. Our new mother fades into the populace, 
untraced and untracable - just one more of a vast and ever-growing brown 
multitude.<P>

Almost immediately, she has obtained a Social Security card for herself 
and for her new baby. Shortly thereafter, she is on welfare, living in 
government-subsidized housing, and receiving the benefits of Food Stamps, 
the WIC (Women, Infants, and Children) Program, and Medicaid. She has sent 
for her four to six older children - or siblings - her "husband," and, 
having learned of the Supplemental Security Income Program (SSI), her 
"disabled" parents and grandparents. Smiling to themselves, they settle 
down to a life of ease and luxury such as they have never known. A little 
later, having come to realize the unbelievably stupid leniency of their 
new host nation, she and her extended family begin to complain loudly of 
the injustices of U.S. society. By now, they have learned that the open 
display of the contempt they have long felt for the "gringo" brings not 
anger and retribution, but obsequious groveling from their "caseworker."<P>

In a classic example of split thinking, they clamor that their native 
language and cultural mores should be officially designated as national 
"alternatives," while they complain that they are not accepted by the 
dominant White culture.<P>

Meanwhile, their older children have found their place in society, joined 
a gang, and become deeply involved in lucrative criminal activities they 
would not have dared attempt in their homeland. Their arrogant contempt 
grows for a system of law enforcement that, compared to the feared, often 
lethal, justice of their native country, is laughably lenient and totally 
ineffective in dealing with them. We Americans have yet to learn the 
lesson that the penalty must fit the criminal, not the crime.<P>

You might call this an extreme example - but it is not at all uncommon in 
modern America as Congress and the federal and state bureaucracies dance 
to the tune of multiculturalism and the New World Order that is being 
imposed on an uninformed and unconsulted American people.<P>

By what right does a judge, solely on his own, decide that a boatload of 
Haitians - or whomever - rescued from a watery grave by the brave men of 
the U.S. Coast Guard, should be considered for U.S. citizenship rather 
than repatriated or left to the mercies of the sea? Is not the act of 
rescue itself sufficient demonstration of our humane good will? Must we 
allow a single man who calls himself a judge to second-guess the majority 
of our citizens? What loopholes allow him and the racially-motivated 
Jewish and Liberal groups and their money-hungry lawyers to circumvent 
reason, logic, and our laws and determine that these obviously 
economically-motivated emigres are really political refugees? Why does 
Congress allow a judge to transgress the interests of those taxpayers who 
support him and allow him to flaunt the laws of this nation which he is 
supposed to uphold? When our nation was vibrant and forthright in support 
of the interests of its own, such behavior by a public servant would not 
have been tolerated. But a few years ago our imperial Congress flew in the 
face of the well-being of its constituents and passed an immigration 
amnesty act that forgave most illegal immigrants their crime and 
guaranteed that even greater numbers would cross our border illegally.<P>

Now that Congress has demonstrated its abject lack of integrity by having 
granted amnesty to countless illegals who have verified their fitness to 
become US citizens by having avoided our law enforcement institutions for 
a few years, millions more are now emboldened to break our laws. They now 
know that there exists a foolishly generous nation where a criminal must 
spend only a short time as a fugitive to have his crime forgiven with no 
greater penalty for being caught before he qualifies for amnesty, than the 
necessity to begin over again. When he achieves this goal not only is his 
crime forgiven - even if suspected - but he is rewarded beyond his 
greatest dreams. He is instantly eligible for the multitude of federal, 
state, and local give-away programs that are denied to those here legally. 
His cornucopia is overflowing, particularly when he learns that, for a few 
dollars, he need not even exist as a fugitive. He can purchase illegally 
the papers necessary to qualify immediately, with little likelihood that 
he will be discovered. For all this, there is a small risk. He risks 
neither life nor incarceration: If he fails this time, he but needs to try 
again - and again - and again.<P>

The billions that constitute the surplus population of Africa, the 
Caribbean, Central America, and Asia have been given the signal that 
America is a rich land ripe for conquest, that its citizens are prevented 
from stopping the invasion by their own government. And they are coming, 
by land and by sea and by air, they are coming.<P>

These invaders are breaking our laws. They are committing a crime against 
the United States - against you and me. Under our truly ineffective 
Liberal laws, they are committing only a misdemeanor. In many other 
countries of the world, they would be shot the instant they trespassed. 
Those who aid them, whether by giving them work or sanctuary, are also 
criminals. They have committed a felony. But the long-term harm such 
felons do to the future of our nation far outweighs the penalties our laws 
could exact, were they enforced. Why do we let them get away with it?<P>

One reason is psychological intimidation and Liberal brainwashing. We are 
always hearing the cry "we are all immigrants - and the statue of Liberty 
proclaims our open door to the world's poor and oppressed." Such claims 
ignore the fact that the Statue of Liberty was never intended to symbolize 
such a thing - it was entitled "Liberty Enlightening the World" and was a 
gift from one European people (France) to another. More importantly, such 
claims misapply the past to a very different present. The immigrants of 
the last century were nearly all Europeans and were assimilated to our 
culture and institutions quickly and they proved their mettle by hard work 
by which they built our Western Civilization across a nearly empty 
wilderness. The character of the immigrants has changed - and so has 
America. No longer able to absorb millions on a frontier, we are unable 
even to provide jobs and homes for even those that are already here.<P>

Another argument made by both Liberals and Conservatives to excuse these 
crimes is that without illegal immigrants, crops would rot on the ground 
and garments would go unsewn. A more ridiculous argument cannot be 
imagined. With unemployment statistics in the multiple millions - and with 
many more Americans not listed in the figures because they have given up 
looking for work - and with factories closing down every day as more and 
more companies, encouraged by our internationalist rulers, move their 
production to the third world, it is absurd to suggest that we do not have 
enough American hands to do the work that must be done. What is not 
laughable, however, is the fact that so many disloyal businessmen would 
rather pay a Mexican peon slave wages to do the work than pay a living 
wage to an American, the law notwithstanding. When justice comes to 
America such businessmen will be given a fair trial.<P>

It is also said that these illegal immigrants bring their cultures and add 
"richness" and "diversity" to our society. We might, however, question 
whether or not we really need what they bring of their "culture." Have we 
not enough of whatever "richness" they might provide now? Have the 
Liberals who push this "diversity" line of argument ever told us just how 
much "diversity" is needed or when we will finally have enough diversity, 
and when third world immigration can therefore stop? Have we not enough of 
ignorance, crime, filth, disease, hatred, and irresponsible breeding right 
now? It is a fact of chilling import that these illegals are not only 
flowing by the multiple millions across our southern border, but are now 
reproducing at a rate well in excess of nine times the rate of ordinary 
White Americans. And they are bringing a true "diversity" of diseases - 
diseases that had been virtually eliminated from America - with them. 
These are diseases which we often no longer have the familiarity or the 
means to diagnose and treat: measles, syphilis, gonorrhea resistant to 
treatment, chlamydia, all manner of parasites, and now AIDS and a terrible 
drug-resistant strain of tuberculosis. We must protect our children! And 
we must jealously guard and be proud of the civilization which we of 
European descent have built in America at the cost of so much labor,  and 
so much blood. It has given the world the most freedom and the greatest 
discoveries the world has ever known. It must not be adulterated.<P>

Already our standard of living has declined. This is a warning sign. Our 
fall to the status of a Third World nation is assured unless we take 
immediate steps to clean up the corruption in our government and close our 
borders.<P>

I wonder what might be the reasons that our elected representatives have 
for being so signally unrepresentative of Americans. Could it be that they 
have a fear of either alienating or no longer enlarging certain "minority" 
voting blocs? Is it possible that our politicians rely upon an uninformed, 
easily manipulated, illiterate electorate of legal and illegal 
"minorities" to tip the voting balance in their favor? Is it possible that 
politicians would betray the principles upon which this nation was founded 
just so they can spend a few more years at the bountiful Federal feeding 
trough? Or are they merely well-rewarded puppets of the scheming 
internationalists who want to erode our national identity so they can 
erect their one-world government on America's corpse? Or all of the above? 
Perish the thought.<P>

<B><I>Alien Nation:  Common Sense About America's Immigration Disaster</I></B> <BR>
By Peter Brimelow<BR>
Random House, New York, 1995 (327 pages; US$24.00/CAN$33.50)</B><P>

Peter Brimelow is a senior editor of <I>Forbes</I> and <I>National Review</I>. He has also worked for <I>Fortune</I> and <I>Barron's</I>, and his writings have appeared in <I>The Wall Street Journal</I>, <I>Harpers</I>, <I>The New York Times</I>, the <I>London Times</I>, and elsewhere.  His <I>National Review</I> cover story on immigration (6/22/92) is widely credited with reopening the immigration debate on the right. Now he has expanded that article into a powerful new book, <I>Alien Nation</I>, which should be read by every American who cares, even a little, about what may happen to America in the next fifty years.<P>

If you are disturbed by the current uncontrolled flood of immigrants
into the U.S., this book will give you an valuable toolkit of arguments
you can use to make your case. If you are an immigration enthusiast,
and accept the media orthodoxy that there is nothing unusual about the
current level of immigration, and that nothing bad could possibly come
of it, then this book will test your faith severely. And if, like so
many Americans, you haven't even thought about the issue that much,
then I think this book may scare you badly. And it should!<P>

Ironically, Brimelow is himself an immigrant. Raised and educated in
England, he clearly feels this "cultural diversity" has given him a
useful distance and perspective on American society. And indeed,
Brimelow writes like someone who was raised entirely unaware of
American sore spots and taboos, and is thus able to talk directly about
subjects that Americans generally feel they must dance around, and risk
offending sensibilities that Americans generally dare not offend. This
British style of argument is something I find most refreshing (and
rather startling at times). Here is the opening paragraph from <I>Alien
Nation</I>, where Brimelow establishes his main theme: that our current
immigration policy was never actually thought out at all, by anyone,
but is simply a well-intentioned, rather mindless, accident; an
accident which may nevertheless have enormous unintended consequences.<P>

	<BLOCKQUOTE>There is a sense in which current immigration policy is Adolf
	Hitler's posthumous revenge on America. The U.S. political
	elite emerged from the war passionately concerned to cleanse
	itself from all taints of racism or xenophobia. Eventually, it
	enacted the epochal Immigration Act (technically, the
	Immigration and Nationality Act Amendments) of 1965. And this,
	quite accidentally, triggered a renewed mass immigration, so
	huge and so systematically different from anything that had
	gone before as to transform -- and ultimately, perhaps, even to
	destroy -- the one unquestioned victor of World War II: the
	American nation, as it had evolved by the middle of the
	twentieth century.<P></BLOCKQUOTE>

The media tends to treat the recent changes in America's ethnic
composition, the so-called "browning of America," as though it were
some sort of natural and inevitable process, but in fact these changes
are being directly and actively promoted by current government policy.
It is almost as though it had been decided that it would be best if, as
Bertolt Brecht put it, "...the Government/ Dissolved the people and/
Elected another." To believe this however would be to give the
government credit for knowing what it was doing at the time it was
doing it, and there is (to put it mildly) little evidence of this.<P>

Still, given that the 1965 Immigration Act figures so prominently in
this process, it is rather unnerving to learn that the bill's floor
manager in the Senate was our old friend and long time benefactor,
Senator Edward Kennedy, who at the time was chairman of the Immigration
Subcommittee. Indeed, one of <I>Alien Nation</I>'s most astonishing visions
is that of Ted Kennedy swearing up and down on the Senate floor that
the new bill would <B>not</B> result a million Third World immigrants
flooding into our cities every year, and that the "ethnic mix" of this
country would <B>not</B> be upset. Gee thanks, Ted! It's good to know you
felt this was important!<P>

Needless to say, every one of Senator Kennedy's assurances has proven
false. But these assurances were, nevertheless, necessary, because it
is clear that the Congress we had in 1965 would never in a million
years have passed such a bill if they had understood what it's
consequences would be. Nor have the American people ever wanted such
consequences. Unfortunately, the American people were never asked.
Peter Brimelow believes they <B>should</B> be asked, before the process goes
any farther.<P>

It would be difficult for me to do justice to all of Brimelow's
arguments here, so I will just hop around to those I find most
interesting. Be assured that the book is very thorough, and that even
if I don't touch on your favorite argument (or sentimental cliche, as
the case may be) Brimelow almost certainly does.<P>

First of all there are the myths. There is the myth that current
immigration is not really all that high in historical terms. In fact,
as Brimelow demonstrates, it is higher than it has ever been, both in
absolute numbers and in impact on the population. In the past there
were not only immigration peaks but long lulls, when immigrants could
be assimilated, and immigration tended to vary according to the needs
of the U.S. economy. Now, due perhaps to the "welfare safety net" and
our policy of "family reunification," and most certainly to our moral
cowardice in declining to control our borders, the numbers remain
unrelievedly high, in good times and in bad, and the percentage of
immigrants who eventually return home is much lower than it used to
be. Immigrants are projected to account for two thirds of our
population growth throughout the nineties, and <B>all</B> of it thereafter.
According to U.S. Census projections, by the year 2050 one third of the
U.S. population of 400 million will be due to post 1965 immigration.
At this point American whites will be on the verge of becoming a
minority, and will already be a minority among the young. And of
course, in another 50 years or so whites may well be a <B>small</B>
minority, merely a beleaguered elite struggling to maintain their
position in what is essentially just another crowded, miserable Third
World country.<P>

(Note that 400 million is only a "most likely" projection; the worst
case for 2050 is 500 million. The Census has a long history of
underestimating U.S. population growth, and immigration powered
population growth is not expected to suddenly stop in 2050 in any case,
so such numbers are merely a matter of time. Imagine what half a
billion or more Americans would do to the environment. Without
post-1965 immigration by 2050 the U.S. population would be expected to
stabilize at around 250 million. The pre-1965 population is already
close to achieving zero population growth, but this is being wasted,
and we are facing a future that will be terribly crowded, not with our
own children, but with the children of others).<P>

The next myth is that immigrants are somehow necessary economically.
(In other words, that Americans are somehow inadequate, and unable to
get by on their own without constant infusions of new blood). But
Brimelow demonstrates that immigration is really a luxury, not a
necessity, and like any luxury it can be good or bad depending on the
circumstances. When you stuff more people into an economy that economy
pretty much has to grow in absolute terms, but most of that growth is
soaked up by the immigrants themselves, and even under the best of
circumstances the per capita economic benefits of immigration for
natives can be shown to be quite meager. However to the extent that
such benefits do exist they tend to work in such a way as to transfer
wealth from native American workers (whose wages are marginally
depressed) to the owners of capital (who benefit from a lower cost of
labor), which could conceivably explain some of the pro-immigration
sentiment you find among our economic elites.<P>

(Incidentally, the book includes an amusing dissection of one such
elite individual, the noted self-help author, economist and immigration
enthusiast Julian Simon. Brimelow gets a little bit mean here, in a
very British sort of way, and the result is quite hilarious. But such
discussions are really not out of place, as another of Brimelow's many
topics is the intense and unacknowledged emotionalism of many of the
immigration enthusiasts, who seem to view immigration to the U.S. as a
sort of universal "civil right," and who are often startling open in
their contempt for pre-1965 America.)<P>

A third myth is that of the industrious, energetic, entrepreneurial
immigrant. This picture seems to have been true of the pre-1965
immigrant, and remains true of some immigrant groups today, who do
indeed "revitalize" whole neighborhoods (which actually says something
pretty awful about the previous inhabitants of those neighborhoods!).
But the rosy picture so often painted was based on statistics decades
old -- and newer figures are much more discouraging. Taken as a whole,
post-1965 immigrants are much less successful than their predecessors,
in ways that are very easy to measure.<P>

For example, pre-1965 immigrants tended to earn slightly more than
natives, but by 1990 immigrants on the average earned 16 percent <B>less</B>
than natives, and immigrants who had arrived within the last five years
earned 32 percent less! This is really not surprising, as the skills
and education levels of recent immigrants are down dramatically from
pre-1965 levels (another consequence of our family reunification
policy). In addition, post-1965 immigrants, again unlike their
predecessors, are significantly more likely to be on welfare than
natives, dramatically so for some groups (such as Dominicans, 28
percent of whom are on welfare, far above the level of even native
American blacks, which is 13.5 percent). Beyond that, welfare
participation now seems to <B>increase</B> the longer immigrants stay in the
country. In short, many of our recent immigrants do seem to be
assimilating, but to the American welfare system rather than to the
greater American culture!<P>

To be blunt, there is simply no economic justification for our current
immigration policy, and the cultural consequences are enormous, and
often enormously bad.<P>

Consider crime. Right now 25 percent of the prisoners in our federal
penitentiaries are immigrants. Thirty five to forty percent of the
heroin that comes into this country is smuggled in by Nigerians, and
and U.S. law enforcement officials estimate that an incredible 75
percent of all Nigerians in this country are engaged in some sort of
systematic fraud. The Russian "Organizatsiya" (drawn from the educated
elite of a totally corrupt society) is unbelievably violent, and so
well organized that it may be on its way to displacing the Italian
Mafia as the world's largest crime syndicate. The list goes on and on,
with different ethnic groups tending to specialize in different
crimes.<P>

Consider disease. Tuberculosis is on the rise again, mostly due to
immigration. Exotic tropical diseases are starting to be reported in
the U.S., again due to immigration. Public health officials estimate
that 10,000 people would probably die within months if yellow fever,
endemic in Africa and South America, were to reestablish itself in New
Orleans. Again, the list goes on.<P>

Consider the consequence for partisan politics. Despite the hopes of
"bleeding heart conservatives," immigration seems to be inexorably
reinforcing the "Rainbow Coalition" envisioned by Jesse Jackson. This
is perhaps the main reason that so many on the Multiculturalist Left
react to calls for immigration reform with outraged accusations of
racism, nativism, and xenophobia. They see immigrants as
reinforcements in their great culture war against traditional American
society, and in this, for once, they are probably right.<P>

Consider the consequences for American Blacks. It can be seriously
argued (and was certainly believed by blacks at the time) that previous
waves of immigration from Europe had the effect of squeezing blacks out
of skilled trades. History may be repeating itself now.

Consider the consequences for population and the environment. I've
already talked about this, but consider it again. The Third World
population explosion is <B>REALLY HAPPENING</B>, and for a long time to come
there will be hundreds of millions, even billions, of desperately poor
people all over the world who could improve their lives enormously just
by setting foot on our shores. If we don't prevent it, they <B>will</B>
come here, and the only thing that will stop them is when things get so
bad that they would be no better off here than in their own countries.
Try to imagine how bad <B>that</B> would have to be! (It is interesting,
BTW, to notice how the Civil Rights and Environment lobbies have both
tended to avoid addressing their constituent's concerns on the question
of immigration).<P>

And while you are considering all these issues, and the many more that
Brimelow discusses in his book, please ask yourself this one important
question. Why? Why are we doing this? No one can see the future, so
I suppose it is possible that everything will somehow work out.
America will become a multi-racial, multi-cultural, multi-lingual
empire, held together by nothing more than the force of law and the raw
authority of it's political elites, and everything will be just dandy.<P>

It could happen I suppose, but if you look at the rest of the world the
picture does not seem encouraging at all. It is clear that we are
taking a terrible risk, and for what? The advantages to the immigrants
are obvious, and I do not fault them for wanting to come here, but the
people who are here already have little to gain and much to lose. You
may think the worst case scenarios are unlikely. Well, if you play one
game of Russian roulette it is "unlikely" that you will lose. The odds
are five to one in your favor. If you think that makes it a good idea
then I definitely do <B>not</B> want you in charge of our public policy!!!
Think about it. Then think about it again.<P>

In the end, there is simply no rational justification for this. For no
good reason at all, we are passively allowing ourselves to become, in
the angry words of former senator Eugene McCarthy (of all people!), a
"Colony of the World," and perhaps it is time for the American people
to finally ask ourselves whether this is what we <B>want</B>. Personally I
just don't think it is, and I am glad Peter Brimelow has the courage to
argue for us that "America is more than just an idea, it is a nation."<P>

So what is to be done? Brimelow has a number of suggestions, all of
which are practical, have worked in the past for us and other
countries, and require nothing more than political will to implement.<P>
To begin with, we must beef up the Border Patrol, and take back control
of our borders. Immigration enthusiasts gloatingly assert that this is
impossible, but in fact when the problem is taken seriously even modest
efforts, such as the 1993 "Operation Blockade," organized by El Paso
Border Patrol sector chief Silvestre Reyes (who is Hispanic himself),
have proven strikingly successful.<P>

Next, we should beef up our internal security. There should be a
repeat of the 1954 Operation Wetback, which would be an attempt to
round up and deport the millions of illegals already here. Jack Miles,
whose generally favorable review of <I>Alien Nation</I> appears in the April
issue of <I>The Atlantic Monthly</I>, feels that this is impractical, and that
given the heavily armed 40 percent Hispanic minority in cities like Los
Angeles this would be a virtual declaration of civil war. (It says a
lot about our situation that such possibilities must be considered.)
Nevertheless, Miles says he agrees strongly with Brimelow that
"American immigration law needs to be reformed severely and quickly,"
and that Brimelow "makes a powerful -- indeed, nearly overwhelming --
case against the status quo."

But even more important than controlling illegal immigration is cutting
back, or perhaps even temporarily stopping, <B>legal</B> immigration. The
1965 Immigration act must be repealed, and any new law should favor
skilled immigrants over family reunification. The costs of immigration
must be made to fall on the immigrants themselves, or their sponsors.
We should consider restricting immigration from the many countries
which do not allow reciprocal emigration <B>from</B> the U.S. No payments
of any sort should be made to illegal immigrants, and no immigrant
should ever be considered a member of a "protected class" for
affirmative action purposes. Congress should be given the flexibility
to adjust immigration on a yearly basis, according the the needs of the
country. English language competency should be made a requirement for
immigrants, and the Constitution should be amended so that the children
of illegal immigrants born on American soil do not automatically become
American citizens. Few other countries grant citizenship this way, and
this would eliminate the phenomenon of Mexican women dashing over the
border to give birth in U.S. hospitals. (Right now, two thirds of all
births in Los Angeles Country hospitals are to illegal-immigrant
mothers, and a recent survey of new Hispanic mothers in California
border hospitals found that 15 percent had crossed the border
specifically to give birth).<P>

All of these reforms make sense. And all will be resisted bitterly,
even hysterically, by pro-immigration forces. But Brimelow believes
that some sort of immigration restriction is inevitable in America, no
matter how our political elites resist, and that the real struggle will
be over what form these restrictions will take. If you want to be
involved, and to understand the issues, you will simply have to read
<I>Alien Nation</I>. And then you can start to think about what sort of
immigration policy <B>you</B> want.<P>

<H1>Equality: Man's Most Dangerous Myth</H1><P>

<B>by Dr. William L. Pierce</B><P>

All racial differences are either genetic (hereditary, inborn) or
cultural (acquired from society after birth). The latter can be
changed or eliminated by enforced social changes; the former are
independent of man's laws and customs, except over a period of many
generations.<P>

Examples of cultural traits which differ from race to race are
mannerisms of speech ("Amos 'n' Andy" dialect or "Black English"),
styles of dress, and personal grooming. If Blacks and Whites are
forced to live together from birth, attending the same schools and
exposed to exactly the same cultural influences, they will grow up
speaking and dressing in very nearly the same manner. Even Blacks who
have grown up in the tribal areas of Africa and who customarily
distort their earlobes or lips with huge wooden plugs or plaster
their hair with liquid cow dung as a means of attracting Blacks of
the opposite sex can be trained to adopt White standards of personal
cleanliness and grooming.<P>

The fact is, however, that the most important racial differences
are genetic rather than cultural. Skin and eye color, facial features,
skull shape, skeletal proportions, patterns of body fat disposition,
tooth size, jaw shape, female breast form, odor, and hair texture are
only the most noticeable genetically determined physical
characteristics which differ racially.<P>

Beyond these things are the entire biochemical constitution and
development of the individual. There are profound racial differences
in blood chemistry, in endocrine function, and in physiological
response to environmental stimuli. Blacks and Whites mature at
different rates. They have different susceptibilities to many disease
organisms as well as different patterns of congenital disease. They
even have different nutritional requirements.<P>

Racial differences, in other words, are much more than skin deep;
they permeate the individual and are manifested in virtually every
cell of his body. They are the products of millions of years of
separate evolutionary development which has adapted the different
races, with considerable precision to different environmental demands.<P>

When we understand the all pervading nature of genetic racial
differences, we can see that cultural racial differences are not so
superficial as some would have us believe. Far from masking any
fundamental "equality" or exaggerating racial dissimilarities, they
simply manifest the genetic differences of which they are, in fact,
expressions.<P>

The culture of a race, free of alien influences, is telling
evidence of that race's essential nature. The African Negro with a
cow-dung hairdo, a bone through his nose, and teeth filed down to
sharp points, in other words, presents to us a far more accurate
image of the Negro essence than does the American Black in a business
suit who has been trained to drive an automobile, operate a
typewriter, and speak flawless English.<P>

<IMG  Align=Left SRC="../images/racial5.gif" HSpace=10>
Negro culture is not merely DIFFERENT from White culture; it is a
LESS ADVANCED culture and, by practically any standard, INFERIOR. It
is a culture which never advanced to the point of a written language
or a civilized society. It never saw even the barest glimmerings of
mathematics or the invention of the wheel.

The smelting and use of metals and the quarrying and dressing of
stone for architectural purposes are crafts that were taught to the
Negro by members of other races. The hokum currently being served up
in the schools about a centuries-old Negro "civilization" based on
the ruins of stone walls found at Zimbabwe, in Rhodesia [note: at the
time of this writing, the country was still called Rhodesia] is
simply the product of wishful thinking by proponents of racial
equality who are willing to ignore all facts which conflict with
their equalitarian mania.<P>

Negro culture inferiority is the consequence of the physical
inadequacy of the Negro brain in dealing with abstract concepts. On
the other hand, the Negro shows an ability approaching that of the
White at mental tasks requiring only memory. That is why the Negro
can be trained relatively easily to adapt to many aspects of White
culture.<P>

His verbal ability and his ability to imitate allow him, when
properly motivated, to assume much of the outward appearance of
"equality." In a decade of special college-admission quotas for
Blacks, many thousands of Blacks have obtained college diplomas --
but only in those disciplines in which a glib tongue and a good
memory suffice. There have been virtually no Black graduates in the
physical sciences and very few in engineering.<P>

Thus the Negroes inability to handle the abstract concepts
required in problem-solving and technological innovation make a
mockery of outward appearances. And this inability is genetic in
nature, rooted in the physical structure of the Negro brain.<P>

Until the post-World War II campaign to blend the White and Negro
races began in earnest, the Negro's mental limitations were common
knowledge. The 11th edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica, for
example, says of the Negro, in part:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
"...Other characteristics appear to be hypertrophy of the
organs of excretion, a more developed venous system, and a less
voluminous brain, as compared with the White races."
</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
"In certain of the characteristics mentioned above the Negro
would appear to stand on a lower evolutionary plane than the
White man, and to be more closely related to the highest
anthropoids ...."
</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"Mentally the Negro is inferior to the White ... While with
the latter the volume of the brain grows with the expansion of
the brainpan, in the former the growth of the brain is on the
contrary arrested by the premature closing of the cranial
sutures and lateral pressure of the frontal bone."
</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

And the 1932 edition of the Encyclopedia Americana lists, among
the distinguishing characteristics of the Negro race, the following:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
"3. Weight of brain, 35 ounces (in gorilla 20 ounces,
average Caucasian 45 ounces) ...."<P>
"8. Exceedingly thick cranium, enabling him to use the head
as a weapon of attack ...."<P>
 "14. The cranial sutures, which close much earlier in the
Negro than in other races."<P>
</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

As the media stepped up their flow of "equality" propaganda,
later editions of these encyclopedias simply deleted the racial
data on Blacks. One had to turn to specialized medical texts to learn
that the associative areas of the brain, where abstract thought takes
place, are less developed in the Negro than in the White.<P>

It has been well known since the large-scale intelligence testing
of U.S. Army recruits in World War I that the average Negro IQ is
approximately 15 per cent below that of the average White. Apologists
for the Blacks have tried to explain away the earlier test scores as
being due to the effects of segregated schools and Black poverty; i.e.
they claimed the tests were "culturally biased."<P>

Later IQ tests, however, showed essentially the same degree of
Black deficiency in IQ: whether Black graduates of integrated high
schools were tested against White graduates of the same schools, or
Blacks in a certain socio-economic category against similarly
categorized Whites, the Blacks always scored substantially lower,
even though standard IQ tests measure memory skills as well as purely
associative ability. Tests which focus on the latter type of mental
function show a much larger difference between Black and White scores.<P>

But it is precisely the ability to associate concepts, to deal
with abstractions, to mentally extrapolate the present into the
future that has allowed the White race to build and maintain its
civilization, and it is the Negro's deficiency in this regard which
kept him in a state of savagery in his African environment and is now
undermining the civilization of a racially mixed America. That is why
it is vitally important for every White person to understand that
there can be no such thing as "equality" between Whites and Blacks,
regardless of the amount of racial mixing forced on Americans by the
government.<P>

<H1>Establishment Science of Intelligence</H1><P>

Wow! Look what appeared in the <I>Wall Street Journal</I>!<P>

Fifty professors at Universities throughout the U.S., Canada, and
Britain have signed the following statement concerning the
generally accepted science of intelligence and inter-race
differences in intelligence.<P>

You will be surprised at many of the conclusions and at the
number and identity of the signers, all of whom are listed at the
end of the article.<P>

<B><I>Yggdrasil</I></B><P>

<hr>

Dec. 13, 1994 <I>Wall Street Journal</I> p A18

<H3>Mainstream Science on Intelligence</H3><P>

Since the publication of <I>The Bell Curve</I>, many commentators
have offered opinions about human intelligence that misstate
current scientific evidence. Some conclusions dismissed in the
media as discredited are actually firmly supported.<P>

This statement outlines conclusions regarded as mainstream
among researchers on intelligence, in particular, on the nature,
origins, and practical consequences of individual and group
differences in intelligence. Its aim is to promote more reasoned
discussion of the vexing phenomenon that the research has
revealed in recent decades. The following conclusions are fully
described in the major textbooks, professional journals and
encyclopedias in intelligence.<P>

<B>The Meaning and Measurement of Intelligence</B><P>

1. Intelligence is a very general mental capability that,
among other things, involves the ability to reason, plan, solve
problems, think abstractly, comprehend complex ideas, learn
quickly and learn from experience. It is not merely book
learning, a narrow academic skill, or test-taking smarts. Rather,
it reflects a broader and deeper capability for comprehending our
surroundings--"catching on," "making sense" of things, or
"figuring out" what to do.<P>

2. Intelligence, so defined, can be measured, and intelligence
tests measure it well. They are among the most accurate (in
technical terms, reliable and valid) of all psychological tests
and assessments. They do not measure creativity, character
personality, or other important differences among individuals,
nor are they intended to.<P>

3. While there are different types of intelligence tests, they
all measure the same intelligence. Some use words or numbers and
require specific cultural knowledge (like vocabulary). Others do
not, and instead use shapes or designs and require knowledge of
only simple, universal concepts (many/few, open/closed, up/down).<P>
 
4. The spread of people along the IQ continuum, from low to
high, can be represented well by the bell curve (in statistical
jargon, the "normal curve"). Most people cluster around the
average (IQ 100). Few are either very bright or very dull: About
3% of Americans score above IQ 130 (often considered the
threshold for "giftedness"), with about the same percentage below
IQ 70 (IQ 70-75 often being considered the threshold for mental
retardation).<P>

5. Intelligence tests are not culturally biased against
American blacks or other native-born, English-speaking peoples in
the U.S. Rather, IQ scores predict equally accurately for all
such Americans, regardless of race and social class. Individuals
who do not understand English well can be given either a
nonverbal test or one in their native language.<P>

6. The brain processes underlying intelligence are still little
understood. Current research looks, for example, at speed of
neural transmission, glucose (energy) uptake, and electrical
activity of the brain, uptake, and electrical activity of the
brain.<P>

<B>Group Differences</B><P>

7. Members of all racial-ethnic groups can be found at every IQ
level. The bell curves of different groups overlap considerably,
but groups often differ in where their members tend to cluster
along the IQ line. The bell curves for some groups (Jews and
East Asians) are centered somewhat higher than for whites in
general. Other groups (blacks and Hispanics) ale centered
somewhat lower than non-Hispanic whites.<P>

8. The bell curve for whites is centered roughly around IQ 100;
the bell curve for American blacks roughly around 85; and those
for different subgroups of Hispanics roughly midway between those
for whites and blacks. The evidence is less definitive for
exactly where above IQ 100 the bell curves for Jews and Asians
are centered.<P>

<B>Practical Importance</B><P>

9. IQ is strongly related, probably more so than any other
single measurable human trait, to many important educational,
occupational, economic, and social outcomes. Its relation to the
welfare and performance of individuals is very strong in some
arenas in life (education, military training), moderate but
robust in others (social competence), and modest but consistent
in others (law-abidingness). Whatever IQ tests measure, it is of
great practical and social importance.<P>
 
10. A high IQ is an advantage in life because virtually all
activities require some reasoning and decision-making.
Conversely, a low IQ is often a disadvantage, especially in
disorganized environments. Of course, a high IQ no more
guarantees success than a low IQ guarantees failure in life.
There are many exceptions, but the odds for success in our
society greatly favor individuals with higher IQs.<P>

11. The practical advantages of having a higher IQ increase as
life settings become more complex (novel, ambiguous, changing,
unpredictable, or multifaceted). For example, a high IQ is
generally necessary to perform well in highly complex or fluid
jobs (the professions, management): it is a considerable
advantage in moderately complex jobs (crafts, clerical and police
work); but it provides less advantage in settings that require
only routine decision making or simple problem solving (unskilled
work).<P>

12. Differences in intelligence certainly are not the only
factor affecting performance in education, training, and highly
complex jobs (no one claims they are), but intelligence is often
the most important. When individuals have already been selected
for high (or low) intelligence and so do not differ as much in
IQ, as in graduate school (or special education), other
influences on performance loom larger in comparison.<P>

13. Certain personality traits, special talents, aptitudes,
physical capabilities, experience, and the like are important
(sometimes essential) for successful performance in many jobs,
but they have narrower (or unknown) applicability or
"transferability" across tasks and settings compared with general
intelligence. Some scholars choose to refer to these other human
traits as other "intelligences."<P>
 
<B>Source and Stability of Within-Group Differences</B><P>

14. Individuals differ in intelligence due to differences in
both their environments and genetic heritage. Heritability
estimates range from 0.4 to 0.8 (on a scale from 0 to 1), most
thereby indicating that genetics plays a bigger role than does
environment in creating IQ differences among individuals.
(Heritability is the squared correlation of phenotype with
genotype.) If all environments were to become equal for
everyone, heritability would rise to 100% because all remaining
differences in IQ would necessarily be genetic in origin.<P>

15. Members of the same family also tend to differ
substantially in intelligence (by an average of about 12 IQ
points) for both genetic and environmental reasons. They differ
genetically because biological brothers and sisters share exactly
half their genes with each parent and, on the average, only half
with each other. They also differ in IQ because they experience
different environments within the same family.<P>

16. That IQ may be highly heritable does not mean that it is
not affected by the environment. Individuals are not born with
fixed, unchangeable levels of intelligence (no one claims they
are). IQs do gradually stabilize during childhood, however, and
generally change little thereafter.<P>

17. Although the environment is important in creating IQ
differences, we do not know yet how to manipulate it to raise low
IQs permanently. Whether recent attempts show promise is still a
matter of considerable scientific debate.<P>

18. Genetically caused differences are not necessarily
irremediable (consider diabetes, poor vision, and phenal keton
uria), nor are environmentally caused ones necessarily remediable
(consider injuries, poisons, severe neglect, and some diseases).
Both may be preventable to some extent.<P>
 
<B>Source and Stability of Between-Group Differences</B><P>

19. There is no persuasive evidence that the IQ bell curves for
different racial-ethnic groups are converging. Surveys in some
years show that gaps in academic achievement have narrowed a bit
for some races, ages, school subjects and skill levels, but this
picture seems too mixed to reflect a general shift in IQ levels
themselves.<P>

20. Racial-ethnic differences in IQ bell curves are essentially
the same when youngsters leave high school as when they enter
first grade. However, because bright youngsters learn faster
than slow learners, these same IQ differences lead to growing
disparities in amount learned as youngsters progress from grades
one to 12. As large national surveys continue to show, black 17-
year-olds perform, on the average, more like white 13-year-olds
in reading, math, and science, with Hispanics in between.<P>

21. The reasons that blacks differ among themselves in
intelligence appear to be basically the same as those for why
whites (or Asians or Hispanics) differ among themselves. Both
environment and genetic heredity are involved.<P>

22. There is no definitive answer to why IQ bell curves differ
across racial-ethnic groups. The reasons for these IQ
differences between groups may be markedly different from the
reasons for why individuals differ among themselves within any
particular group (whites or blacks or Asians). In fact, it is
wrong to assume, as many do, that the reason why some individuals
in a population have high IQs but others have low IQs must be the
same reason why some populations contain more such high (or low)
IQ individuals than others. Most experts believe that
environment is important in pushing the bell curves apart, but
that genetics could be involved too.<P>

23. Racial-ethnic differences are somewhat smaller but still
substantial for individuals from the same socioeconomic
backgrounds. To illustrate, black students from prosperous
families tend to score higher in IQ than blacks from poor
families, but they score no higher, on average, than whites from
poor families.<P>

24. Almost all Americans who identify themselves as black have
white ancestors-the white admixture is about 20%, on average--and
many self-designated whites, Hispanics, and others likewise have
mixed ancestry. Because research on intelligence relies on self-
classification into distinct racial categories, as does most
other social-science research, its findings likewise relate to
some unclear mixture of social and biological distinctions among
groups (no one claims otherwise).<P>

<B>Implications for Social Policy</B><P>

25. The research findings neither dictate nor preclude any
particular social policy, because they can never determine our
goals. They can, however, help us estimate the likely success and
side-effects of pursuing those goals via different means.<P>

<H1>Hitler's extermination orders</H1>

Note: The fact file series is intended to present facts of history, free from the polemics and misinformation so often presented in this medium. Hopefully the facts contained herein will serve the cause of truth in history.

<P>Note to educators and students: The essence of this Fact File is that no order for the extermination of the Jews written or authorized by Adolf Hitler has ever been discovered. The result of this situation is that many historians presume that the order was transmitted orally. For this, there is also no proof. The syllogism utilized is:

<P><I>Major premise:</I> The extermination of the Jews occured.

<P><I>Minor premise:</I> Within the Nazi form of government, the                          extermination of the Jews could not have occurred without Hitler's authorization.

<P><I>Conclusion:</I> Hitler ordered the extermination of the Jews.

<P>Since Historians and researchers have yet to unearth such an order, the 'oral order' has become a necessary part of the story. It should be unnecessary to stress that the conclusion of this logical form is invalid if either the major or minor premise is untrue.
<I>Don Van Handel (DonVH@aol.com)</I>

<P>The F&uuml;hrer Order on the Final Solution apparently was never committed to paperat least no copy of it has yet been unearthed in the captured Nazi documents. <I>William Shirer, The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich</I>

<P>For the want of hard evidenceand in 1977 I offered, around the world, a thousand pounds to any person who could produce even one wartime document showing explicitly that Hitler knew, for example, of Auschwitz. My critics ... postulated the existence of F&uuml;hrer orders without the slightest written evidence of their existence ... Of explicit, written, wartime evidence, the kind of evidence that could hang a man, they have produced not one line. <I>David Irving, Hitler's War</I>

<P>To the present day a written order by Hitler regarding the destruction of the European Jewish community has not been found, and, in all probability, this order was never given.<I> Walter Laqueur, Was niemand wissen wollte: Die Unterdruckung der Nachrichten uber Hitlers Endl&ouml;sung</I>

<P>For in the table talk, the speeches, the documents or the recollections of participants from all those years not a single concrete reference of [Hitler's] to the practice of annihilation has come down to us. When we consider that he ordinarily transformed everything that preoccupied him into rampant speechmaking, that he never concealed his radicalism, his vulgarity, his readiness to go to extremes, this silence about the central concern of his life involving, as it did in his mind, the salvation of the world seems all the stranger. <I>Joachim C. Fest, Hitler</I>

<P>... The New York Times' ... editorial (December 2, 1942) claimed that 'Of Germany's 200,000 Jews in 1939 all but 40,000 have been deported or have perished,' while going on to assert that 'according to evidence in the hands of the [U.S.] State Department, an order of Adolf Hitler demanding the extermination of all Jews in all territories controlled by Germany' was known to exist. Researchers nearly 40 years later were still searching for that order, or information leading to anyone who might have ever seen it at any time. <I>James J. Martin, The Man who invented 'Genocide': The Public Career and Consequences of Raphael Lemkin</I>

<P>No written document containing or reporting an explicit command to exterminate the Jews has come to light thus far. <I>Arno J. Mayer, Why did the Heavens not Darken?: The 'Final Solution' in History</I>

<P>In the new edition [of Hilberg's Destruction of the European Jews], all references in the text to a Hitler decision or Hitler order for the Final Solution have been systematically excised. <I>Christopher Browning, The Revised Hilberg</I>

<H1>Nazi testimony regarding exterminations</H1>


<I>Note:</I> The fact file series is intended to present facts of history, free from the polemics and misinformation so often presented in this medium. Hopefully the facts contained herein will serve the cause of truth in history.

<P><I>Note to educators and students: </I>This fact file presents the actual words and opinions of various members of the Nazi leadership as well as numerous Nazi warheroes. The purpose of this presentation is to counter the claims that the Nazi leadership fully acknowledged that plans to extermination the Jews of Europe existed. As is evident from this Fact File, most of the top Nazi leadership claimed to have no knowledge of such plans and showed genuine disbelief at such charges. This Fact File is not totally inclusive. Those quoted may have expressed other opinions at other times and of course other individuals made differing comments. <BR>
<I>Don Van Handel (DonVH@aol.com)</I>

<P>(Regarding an Allied radio broadcast announcement that the Jews were being exterminated): Really, the Jews should be grateful to me for wanting nothing more than a bit of hard work from them.<BR>
<I>Adolf Hitler</I>

<P>In order to put a stop to the epidemics, we were forced to burn the bodies of incalculable numbers of people who been destroyed by disease. We were therefore forced to build crematoria, and on this account they are knotting a noose for us.<BR>
<I>ReichsfuehrerSS Heinrich Himmler</I>

<P>Well, I knew they were being transported to the East, and understood that they were being set up in camps with their own administration, and eventually would settle somewhere in the East.  I don't know.  I had no idea that it would lead to extermination in any literal sense. We just wanted to take them out of German political life.<BR>
<I>Alfred Rosenberg  leading Nazi theoretician</I>

<P>I was never so close to Hitler as to have him express himself to me on [Nazi extermination camps] . I always thought that [concentration camps] were places where people were put to useful work. Those pictures that you showed me yesterday [of Dachau] must depict things that happend in the final few days.<BR>
<I>Reichsmarschall Hermann Goering</I><P>

<P>(After being shown films of Buchenwald:) I don't believe it!<BR>
<I>Deputy of the F&uuml;hrer Rudolf Hess</I>

<P>They refuse to believe me when I tell them that I have never even seen a concentration camp. I add that if excesses have been committed they are regrettable and reprehensible, and the real culprits should be punished. I point out that such cruelties have been perpetrated not only by our people, but by all peoples in every age. I remind them of the Boer War. Therefore these excesses must be judged by the same criterion. I cannot imagine that the mounds of corpses depicted in the photographs were taken in concentration camps. I tell them that we have seen such sights, not on film, but in fact, after the air attacks on Dresden and Hamburg and other cities when Allied fourengined bombers deluged them indiscriminately with phosphorus and high explosive bombs and countless women and children were massacred.<BR>
<I>Hans Ulrich Rudel  First and only soldier to be awarded the Golden Oakleaves with Swords and Diamonds to the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross.</I>

<P>How can they accuse me of knowing of such things? They ask why I didn't go to Himmler to check on the concentration camps. Why that's preposterous! He would have kicked me out just as I would have kicked him out if he came to investigate the navy! What in God's name did I have to do with these things?<BR>
<I>Grand Admiral Karl Doenitz</I>

<P>If I had known it I would have told my son, I'd rather shoot you than let you join the SS. But I didn't know.<BR>
<I>FieldMarshal Wilhelm Keitel</I>

<P>Hitler couldn't even have looked at such a film [documentary film on Nazi concentration camps as they were found by American troops] himself. I don't understand. I don't even think that Himmler could have ordered such things.<BR>
<I>Joachim von Ribbentrop, Foreign Minister</I>

<P>Do you think I had the slightest notion about gas wagons and such horrors? <BR>
<I>Wilhelm Funk, Finance Minister</I>

<P>I never found out anything about any of this ... [It] is because of newspaper propaganda. I told you when I saw the newspaper headline 'Gas Chamber Expert Captured' and an American lieutenant explained it to me, I was pale with amazement. How can they say such things about me? I told you I was only in charge of the Intelligence Service from 1943 on. The British even admitted that they tried to assassinate me because of that not because of having anything to do with atrocities, you can be sure of that.<BR>
<I>Ernst Kaltenbrunner, Chief of Police</I>

<P>But for millions of nonGermans, the Germans are brutes, capable of anything. That summary judgement, born of invented horrors laid to the Germans in 1914, has remained in the subconscious of the public. Let the occasion arise again, and that mentality is reborn at once, as we saw in 19401945. Anything at all will be believed if it is charged to the Germans. Whether it's a question of gas chambers in which, to believe the figures of the accusers, the victims would have to have been crowded together thirtytwo persons per square meter twentyfour hours a day; or whether a description is being given to you of the crematory furnaces which, if they had to burn up all the bodies assigned to them by the Jewish propaganda, would still be working at full capacity in the year 2050, or even 2080. When it's a matter of denigrating Germans, nothing need be verified.<BR>

<H1>Nuremberg trial transcripts</H1>

<P><I>Note:</I> The fact file series is intended to present facts of history, free from the polemics and misinformation so often presented in this medium. Hopefully the facts contained herein will serve the cause of truth in history.

<P><I>Note to educators and students: </I>This Fact File presents actual excerpts from the Nuremberg Trial Transcripts. The Nuremberg Trials documented countless Nazi atrocities including the now infamous gas chambers. What most people do not realize is that many of the claims documented at Nuremberg are no longer accepted by any reasonable historians. Many of these "atrocities" have simply been forgotten about. To many, these claims are nothing but a product of allied wartime propaganda and postwar hysteria. Citations are from the various volumes from the IMT (International Military Tribunal). <BR>
<I>Don Van Handel (DonVH@aol.com)</I>

<P><I>IMT V</I>It was common practice to remove the skin from dead prisoners. I was commanded to do this on many occasions. Dr. Rascher and Dr. Wolter in particular asked for this human skin from human backs and chests. It was chemically treated and placed in the sun to dry. After that it was cut into various sizes for use as saddles, riding breeches, gloves, house slippers, and ladies' handbags.

<P><I>IMT XVI</I>Mr. Justice Jackson: And certain experiments were also conducted and certain researches conducted in atomic energy... An experiment... was carried out near Auschwitz ... The purpose of the experiment was to find a quick and complete way of destroying people without the delay and trouble of shooting and gassing and burning, as it had been carried out, and this is the experiment, as I am advised. A village, a small village was provisionally erected, with temporary structures, and in it approximately 20,000 Jews were put. By means of this newly invented weapon of destruction, these 20,000 people were eradicated almost instantaneously, and in such a way that there was no trace.

<P><I>IMT XXXII</I>The second building [at Treblinka] consists of three chambers and a boiler room. The steam generated in the boilers is led by means of pipes to the chambers. There are terracota floors in the chambers which become very slippery when wet ... All victims had to strip off their clothes and shoes, which were collected afterwards, whereupon all victims, women and children first, were driven into the death chambers. Those too slow or too weak to move quickly were driven on by rifle butts, by whipping and kicking...Many slipped and fell, the next victims pressed forward and stumbled over them. Small children were simply thrown inside. After being filled up to capacity the chambers were hermetically closed and steam was let in. In a few minutes all was over.

<P><I>IMT VI </I>Balachowsky: I saw SS men come out of Block 2 [ at Buchenwald], the Pathological Block, carrying tanned skins under their arms. I know, from my comrades who worked in Pathological Block 2, that there were orders for skins; and these tanned skins were given as gifts to certain guards and to certain visitors, who used them to bind books.

<P><I>IMT VII</I>In the autumn of 1941, in Katyn Forest, the German occupational authorities carried out mass shootings of the Polish prisoners of war from the above mentioned camps. The German occupational authorities, with a view to provoking incidents, undertook a whole series of measures to ascribe their own misdeeds to organizations of the Soviet authorities, in order to make mischief between the Russians and the Poles.

<P><I>IMT VII </I>It was in 1942 [at Belsen] that the special electrical appliances were built in for mass extermination of people. Under the pretext that the people were being led to the bathhouse, the doomed were undressed and then driven to the building where the floor was electrified in a special way; there they were killed.

<P><I>IMT VII</I>In this small room [at Sachsenhausen] there was a slot in the wall, approximately 50 centimeters in length. The prisoner of war stood with the back of his head against the slot and a sniper shot at him from behind the slot. In practice this arrangement did not prove satisfactory, since the sniper often missed the prisoner. After 8 days a new arrangement was made. The prisoner, as before, was placed against the wall; an iron plate was then slowly lowered onto his head. The prisoner was under the impression that he was being measured for height. The iron plate contained a ramrod which shot out suddenly and poleaxed the prisoner with a blow on the back of the head. He dropped dead. The iron plate was operated by a foot lever in a corner of the room.

<P><I>IMT XX</I>These places were faked cloakrooms, and the person was given a check at each one so that the people believed that they would get their things back ... When the last one was in, the doors were shut and the gas was let into the room. As soon as death had set in, the ventilators were started. When the air could be breathed again, the doors were opened, and the Jewish workers removed the bodies. By means of a special procedure... they were burned in the open air without the use of fuel.

<P><I>IMT VII</I>I boiled the soap out of the bodies of women and men. The process of boiling alone took several days from 3 to 7. During two manufacturing processes, in which I directly participated, more than 25 kilograms of soap were produced. The amount of human fat necessary for these two processes was 70 to 80 kilograms collected from some 40 bodies ... I used this human soap for my personal needs, for toilet and for laundering.

<P><I>IMT XXXIII</I>Rudolf Hoess: I commanded Auschwitz until 1 December, 1943, and estimate that at least 2,500,000 victims were executed and exterminated there by gassing and burning, and at least another half million succumbed to starvation and disease making a total dead of about 3,000,000.

<P><I>IMT XXX</I>Inside the showerbath [at Dachau] the gas vents. On the ceiling the dummy shower heads. In the engineers' room the intake and outlet pipes. Push buttons to control inflow and outtake of gas. A hand valve to regulate pressure. Cyanide powder was used to generate the lethal smoke. From the gas chamber, the bodies were removed to the crematory.

<P><I>IMT VII</I>In August 1942 the prisoners were ordered by the German staff of the camp to have all their hair removed from their armpits and around their genitals, as otherwise they would be shot. Not one prisoner received a razor from the Germans, though the Germans knew well that they had none. The prisoners spent the whole of the night plucking out their hair with their hands and assisting one another.

<P><I>IMT VII </I>The SS forced [women] to wash the stairs leading from the seven entrances to the four story house, with their tongues and lips. After those stairways were washed, the same people were forced to collect garbage in the courtyard with their lips. All garbage had to be transferred to one place in the courtyard.

<P><I>IMT VII </I>They invented the following method of murder: Several Soviet prisoners would be forced to climb a tree and others had to saw it down. The prisoners would fall together with the tree and be killed.

<H1>War crimes trials</H1>

<EM>Note:</EM> The fact file series is intended to present facts of history, free from the polemics and misinformation so often presented in this medium. Hopefully the facts contained herein will serve the cause of truth in history.<BR><I>Don Van Handel (DonVH@aol.com)</I>

<P>The Nuremberg Trials ...had been popular throughout the world and particularly in the United States. Equally popular was the sentence already announced by the high tribunal: death. But what kind of trial was this? ...The Constitution was not a collection of loosely given political promises subject to broad interpretation. It was not a list of pleasing platitudes to be set lightly aside when expediency required it. It was the foundation of the American system of law and justice and [Robert Taft} was repelled by the picture of his country discarding those Constitutional precepts in order to punish a vanquished enemy.<BR>
<I>U.S. President, John F. Kennedy</I>

<P>No matter how many books are written or briefs filed, no matter how finely the lawyers analyzed it, the crime for which the Nazis were tried had never been formalized as a crime with the definiteness required by our legal standards, nor outlawed with a death penalty by the international community. By our standards that crime arose under an ex post facto law. Goering et al deserved severe punishment. But their guilt did not justify us in substituting power for principle.<BR><I>U.S. Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas</I>

<P>About this whole judgment there is the spirit of vengeance, and vengeance is seldom justice. The hanging of the eleven men convicted will be a blot on the American record which we shall long regret.<BR><I>U.S. Senator Robert A. Taft</I>

<P>It was clear from the outset that a death sentence would be pronounced against me, as I have always regarded the trial as a purely political act by the victors, but I wanted to see this trial through for my people's sake and I did at least expect that I should not be denied a soldier's death. Before God, my country, and my conscience I feel myself free of the blame that an enemy tribunal has attached to me. <BR><I>Reichsmarschall Herman G&ouml;ring</I>

<P>This kangaroo court at Nuremburg was officially known as the 'International Military Tribunal.' That name is a libel on the military profession. The tribunal was not a military one in any sense. The only military men among the judges were the Russians.... At Nuremberg, mankind and our present civilization were on trial, with men whose own hands were bloody sitting on the judges' seats. One of the judges came from the country which committed the Katyn Forest massacre and produced an array of witnesses to swear at Nuremberg that the Germans had done it.<BR><I>Rear Admiral, U.S.N.

<P>I think the Nuremberg trials are a black page in the history of the world...I discussed the legality of these trials with some of the lawyers and some of the judges who participated therein. They did not attempt to justify their action on any legal ground, but rested their position on the fact that in their opinion, the parties convicted were guilty...This action is contrary to the fundamental laws under which this country has lived for many hundreds of years, and I think cannot be justified by any line of reasoning. I think the Israeli trial of Adolf Eichmann is exactly in the same category as the Nuremberg trials. As a lawyer, it has always been my view that a crime must be defined before you can be guilty of committing it. That has not occurred in either of the trials I refer to herein. <BR><I>Edgar N. Eisenhower, American Attorney, brother of President Dwight D. Eisenhower</I>

<P>My opinion always has been that the Nuremberg War Crimes Trials were acts of vengeance. War is a political and not a legal act, and if at the termination of a war, should it be considered that certain of the enemy's leaders are politically too dangerous to be left at large, then, as Napoleon was, they should be banished to some island. To bring them to trial under post facto law, concocted to convict them, is a piece of hideous hypocrisy and humbug.<BR>
<I>Major General J.F.C. Fuller, C.B., C.B.E., D.S.O.</I>

<P>To me the Nuremberg trials have always been totally inexcusable and a horrible travesty on justice. This is especially true when such trials are used to punish the men of the military services who were directing those services in time of war, and thus giving nothing more than an expression of the basic purposes of their whole adult life. In the execution of their wartime duties, these officers naturally carried out, to the letter, the orders and directions which they received fromt he head of their government. If an officer... should ever, for one instant, consider disregard or disobedience to his government's orders, all cohesion in the military services would fail, from that moment, and the military sevices would fail in the one reason for their existence-the waging of successful war in the interests of their country.<BR>
<I>Rear Admiral Robert A. Theobald, U.S.N.</I>

<P>I am quite clear that any trial of defeated foes by their victors is a mistake and a precedent which should not be followed among what are commonly described as civilised nations.<BR><I>Dr. George Peabody Gooch, C.H., British historian and author</I>

<P>[The Nuremberg] war-crimes trials were based upon a complete disregard of sound legal precedents, principles and procedures. The court had no real jurisdiction over the accused or their offenses; it invented ex post facto crimes; it permitted the accusers to act as prosecutors, judges, jury and executioners; and it admitted to the group of prosecutors those who had been guilty of crimes as numerous and atrocious as those with which the accused were charged. Hence, it is not surprising that these trials degraded international jurisprudence as never before in human experience.<BR><I>Professor Harry Elmer Barnes, Ph.D.</I><P>
The Tribunal claimed in theory the right - it certainly had the power - to declare any act a war-crime. But it interpreted Article 6 of the Charter creating it, as excluding from its consideration any act committed by the victorious powers. As a consequence any act proved to have been committed by the victorious powers could not be declared by the Tribunal a war-crime. For this reason, the indiscriminate bombing of civilians which had indisputably been initiated by Great Britain was excluded from consideration as a war crime by the Tribunal.<BR><I>F.J.P. Veale, English jurist and author</I><BR>

<H1>Zyklon B </H1>

<P><I>Note:</I> The fact file series is intended to present facts of history, free from the polemics and misinformation so often presented in this medium.  Hopefully the facts contained herein will serve the cause of truth in history. 

<P><I>Note to educators and students:</I> This Fact File presents background and technical information regarding Zyklon B. Zyklon B or in English, Cyclone B was a trade name of the German firm Degesch which supervised the distribution of this product during World War II. The product was designed as a fumigant for the purpose of pest and vermin control. Zyklon B was a special preparation which contained hydrocyanic acid (HCN). HCN was used as a fumigant even prior to World War I by the United States.  Zyklon B was HCN absorbed in a carrier, typically wood pulp or diatomaceous earth. This preparation of pellets was sealed in an airtight can to make handling and transportation safer. Zyklon B would be a forgotten footnote of World War II except for the allegation that it was used as a poisonous gas to execute millions of concentration camp inmates. Much was made of the bills of lading for deliveries of this fumigant at the Nuremberg Trials. It is reasoned that most of the concentration camps used Zyklon to kill vermin and fight disease thereby reducing the camp death rates. Other camps, designated by experts as extermination camps used the same Zyklon to kill inmates and thereby increase the camp death rates. Therefore, deliveries of Zyklon to Dachau was beneficial and humane while delivery of Zyklon to Auschwitz was criminal.

<B>HISTORY</B><BR>

As long as 80 years ago it was recognized that hydrocyanic acid could be useful in pest control but it took half this time to popularize the method. Deficiencies and disadvantages had first of all to be eliminated from the method of application. First this had been done in such a way that hydrocyanic acid was no more developed on the spot by mixing cyanides and acid, but this process already took place in the factory:  The so-called pot method was replaced by liquid hydrocyanic acid. The few deficiencies of this procedure were removed in the early twenties by the ZYKLON method: One added liquid HCN to a carrier substance, thus simplifying handling whilst all favourable properties of liquid HCN were maintained. At the same time, danger to the operator was reduced to a minimum. Hydrocyanic acid in the form of ZYKLON can be safely stored for considerable periods and under all climatic conditions, any quantity of gas can be easily measured, quickly and cleanly released. Any residures are completely harmless.<P>
<B>COMPOSITION:</B><BR>
In ZYKLON pure (98%-99%) liquid hydrocyanic acid is chemically stabilized and absorbed in a porous, inert material. It is supplied in snippets or discs prepared from wood pulp. Snippets generally are preferred as in view of their larger surface they give off the gas more rapidly. Upon request also discs can be supplied. The aborbent material can easily be collected at the end of the fumigation.<P>
<B>PACKING:</B><BR>
ZYKLON is packed in handy, gas-tight tins of various sizes which are packed in strong wooden cases. One case, measuring 72 x 50 x 36 cm contains: Imperial - units 16 tins, each containing 40 ozs. HCN - total 40 lbs HCN or 30 tins, each containing 16 ozs. HCN - total 30 lbs HCN.<P>
<B>TOXICITY:</B><BR>
No thoroughly effective pesticide is known to exist which could be considered to be harmless to human beings or mammals. Fatal concentrations of HCN impede or completely cut off the oxygen supply to the cells. The poison can enter the body in three ways: through the mouth, the respiratory organs, or the pores of the skin. The latter will occur in particular if the body is exposed to high concentration for any length of time and in unfavourable conditions (great heat).<P>
<B>METHODS:</B><BR>
Prior to fumigation, the tins must be distributed about the building. The tins are opened, and the ZYKLON is scattered so as to reach even the remotest parts of the building. If this is done correctly the gas will develop evenly and instantaneously throughout the premises. Spaces difficult to reach may be charged separately. In multi-storied buildings one begins with the top floor, and then works towards the exit, taking care that nobody re-enters rooms already charged. Even under mask protection it is not advisable to expose oneself to the gas more than is absolutely necessary. The exit door is sealed after everybody has left the building; warning notices must be put up before gassing commences and a guard placed near the building to prevent unauthorised persons from entering. Time of exposure depends on the type of pests to be attacked; for the destruction of the various types of moths and their pre-adult stages 24 hours will suffice, against other kinds of insect pests one should fumigate for 48 hours. If there are any dense stowages or bulkss of commodities to penetrate, the time of exposure may need to be extended to 72 hours.<P>
<B>VENTILATION:</B><BR>
During this operation gas-masks must be worn. The ventilation takes place in the reverse direction to the gassing. All windows near the entrance are opened first, then gradually those in the rest of the building. It is advisable to work only for 10 to 15 minutes at a time and then to make interruptions of half an hour, as a precaution against skin poisoning.  Depending on concentration, outdoor tempature and weather conditions, ventilation will take at least 10 hours. Clearing of tins and residues may be commenced before the end of airing. Windows and doors must remain open, and gas-masks kept available. ZYKLON tins and absorbent material must always be collected and cleared away before the resumption of work. <P>

<B>A SHORT LIST OF BOOKS FOR FURTHER READING</B><BR>
The following are works by Fred A. Leuchter Jr., unquestionably an expert in the design and fabrication of execution hardware. Mr. Leuchters career and personal life have been destroyed due to the publication of these works. Every slander, every weapon has been used to silence Fred Leuchter. Prior to the defamation, Fred Leuchter was featured on Prime Time Live where he was called,&gt;&gt; the countrys reigning expert on execution. He was also part of an expert panel on the Phil Donahue Show regarding Capital Punishment. The New York Times ran a first page story with photo. According to the Times, Mr. Leuchter is &lt;&lt;a consultant to 16 states on executions.&gt;&gt; <P>

<center><H1>66 questions and answers<BR>
on the Holocaust</H1></center>

<I>Updated on January of 1995</I><P>

<ol>
<B><li>What proof exists that the Nazis killed six million Jews?</B><BR>
None. All we have is postwar testimony, mostly of individual  &quot;survivors.&quot; This testimony is contradictory, and very few claim to  have actually witnessed any &quot;gassing.&quot; There are no contemporaneous  documents or hard evidence: no mounds of ashes, no crematories capable  of disposing of millions of corpses, no &quot;human soap,&quot; no lamp shades  made of human skin, and no credible demographic statistics.<P>
<B><li>What evidence exists that six million Jews were not killed by the Nazis?</B><BR>
Extensive forensic, demographic, analytical and comparative evidence  demonstrates the impossibility of such a figure. The widely repeated  &quot;six million&quot; figure is an irresponsible exaggeration.<P>
<B><li>Did Simon Wiesenthal state in writing that &quot;there were no extermination camps on German soil&quot;?</B><BR>
Yes. The famous &quot;Nazi hunter&quot; wrote this in Stars and Stripes, Jan. 24,  1993. He also claimed that &quot;gassings&quot; of Jews took place only in  Poland.<P>
<B><li>If Dachau was in Germany, and even Wiesenthal says that it was not an extermination camp, why do many American veterans say it was an extermination camp?</B><BR>
After the Allies captured Dachau, many GIs and others were led through  the camp and shown a building alleged to have been a &quot;gas chamber.&quot; The  mass media widely, but falsely, continues to assert that Dachau was a  &quot;gassing&quot; camp.<P>
<B><li>What about Auschwitz?</B><BR>
Is there any proof that gas chambers were used to kill people there?<BR>
No. Auschwitz, captured by the Soviets, was modified after the war, and  a room was reconstructed to look like a large &quot;gas chamber.&quot; After  America's leading expert on gas chamber construction and design, Fred  Leuchter, examined this and other alleged Auschwitz gassing facilities,  he stated that it was an &quot;absurdity&quot; to claim that they were, or could  have been, used for executions.<P>
<B><li>If Auschwitz wasn't a &quot;death camp,&quot; what was its true purpose?</B><BR>
It was an internment center and part of a large-scale manufacturing  complex. Synthetic fuel was produced there, and its inmates were used  as a workforce.<P>
<B><li>Who set up the first concentration camps?</B><BR>
During the Boer War (1899-1902), the British set up what they called  &quot;concentration camps&quot; in South Africa to hold Afrikaner women and  children. Approximately 30,000 died in these hell-holes, which were as  terrible as German concentration camps of World War II.<P>
<B><li>How did German concentration camps differ from American &quot;relocation&quot; camps in which Japanese-Americans were interned during WWII?</B><BR>
The only significant difference was that the Germans interned persons  on the basis of being real or suspected security threats to the German  war effort, whereas the Roosevelt administration interned persons on  the basis of race alone.<P>
<B><li>Why did the German government intern Jews in camps?</B><BR>
It considered Jews a direct threat to national security. (Jews were  overwhelmingly represented in Communist subversion.) However, all  suspected security risks - not just Jews - were in danger of  internment.<P>
<B><li>What hostile measure did world Jewry undertake against Germany as early as 1933?</B><BR>
In March 1933, international Jewish organizations declared an  international boycott of German goods.<P>
<B><li>Did the Jews of the world &quot;declare war on Germany&quot;?</B><BR>
Yes. Newspapers around the world reported this. A front-page headline  in the London Daily Express (March 24, 1933), for example, announced  &quot;Judea Declares War on Germany.&quot;<P>
<B><li>Was this before or after the &quot;death camp&quot; stories began?</B><BR>
This was years before the &quot;death camp&quot; stories, which began in  1941-1942.<P>
<B><li>What nation is credited with being the first to practice mass civilian bombing?</B><BR>
Britain - on May 11, 1940.<P>
<B><li>How many &quot;gas chambers&quot; to kill people were there at Auschwitz?</B><BR>
None.<P>
<B><li>How many Jews were living in the areas that came under German control during the war?</B><BR>
Fewer than six million.<P>
<B><li>If the Jews of Europe were not exterminated by the Nazis, what happened to them?</B><BR>
After the war millions of Jews were still alive in Europe. Hundreds of  thousands (perhaps as many as one and a half million) had died of all  causes during the war. Others had emigrated to Palestine, the United  States, and other countries. Still more Jews left Europe after the war.<P>
<B><li>How many Jews fled or were evacuated to deep within the Soviet Union?</B><BR>
More than two million fled or were evacuated by the Soviets in  1941-1942. These Jews thus never came under German control.<P>
<B><li>How many Jews emigrated from Europe prior to the war, thus putting them outside of German reach?</B><BR>
Perhaps a million (not including those absorbed by the USSR).<P>
<B><li>If Auschwitz was not an extermination camp, why did the commandant, Rudolf Hoess, confess that it was?</B><BR>
He was tortured by British military police, as one of his interrogators  later admitted.<P>
<B><li>Is there any evidence of American, British and Soviet policy to torture German prisoners in order to exact &quot;confessions&quot; for use at the trials at Nuremberg and elsewhere?</B><BR>
Yes. Torture was extensively used to produce fraudulent &quot;evidence&quot; for  the infamous Nuremberg trials, and in other postwar &quot;war crimes&quot;  trials.<P>
<B><li>How does the Holocaust story benefit Jews today?</B><BR>
It helps protect Jews as a group from criticism. As a kind of secular  religion, it provides an emotional bond between Jews and their leaders. It is a powerful tool in Jewish money-raising campaigns, and is used to  justify US aid to Israel.<P>
<B><li>How does it benefit the State of Israel?</B><BR>
It justifies the billions of dollars in &quot;reparations&quot; Germany has paid  to Israel and many individual &quot;survivors.&quot; It is used by the  Zionist/Israeli lobby to dictate a pro-Israel American foreign policy  in the Middle East, and to force American taxpayer aid to Israel,  totaling billions of dollars per year.<P>
<B><li>How is it used by many Christian clergymen?</B><BR>
The Holocaust story is cited to justify the Old Testament notion of  Jews as a holy and eternally persecuted &quot;Chosen People.&quot;<P>
<B><li>How did it benefit the Communists?</B><BR>
It diverted attention from Soviet war mongering and atrocities before,  during and after the Second World War.<P>
<B><li>How does it benefit Britain?</B><BR>
In much the same way it benefitted the Soviet Union.<P>
<B><li>Is there any evidence that Hitler ordered mass extermination of Jews?</B><BR>
No.<P>
<B><li>What kind of gas was used in German wartime concentration camps?</B><BR>
Hydrocyanic gas from &quot;Zyklon B,&quot; a commercial pesticide that was widely  used throughout Europe.<P>
<B><li>For what purpose was &quot;Zyklon B&quot; manufactured?</B><BR>
It was a pesticide used to fumigate clothing and quarters to kill  typhus-bearing lice and other pests.<P>
<B><li>Was this product suitable for mass extermination?</B><BR>
No. If the Nazis had intended to use poison gas to exterminate people,  far more efficient products were available. Zyklon is a slow-acting  fumigation agent.<P>
<B><li>How long does it take to ventilate an area after fumigation with Zyklon B?</B><BR>
Normally about 20 hours. The whole procedure is very complicated and  dangerous. Gas masks must be used, and only trained technicians are  employed.<P>
<B><li>Auschwitz commandant Hoess said that his men would enter the &quot;gas chambers&quot; to remove bodies ten minutes after the victims had died. How do you explain this?</B><BR>
It can't be explained because had they done so they would have suffered  the same fate as the &quot;gassing&quot; victims.<P>
<B><li>Hoess said in his &quot;confession&quot; that his men would smoke cigarettes as they pulled bodies out of gas chambers, ten minutes after gassing. Isn't Zyklon B explosive?</B><BR>
Yes. The Hoess confession is obviously false.<P>
<B><li>What was the exact procedure the Nazis allegedly used to exterminate Jews?</B><BR>
The stories range from dropping gas canisters into a crowded room from  a hole in the ceiling, to piping gas through shower heads, to &quot;steam  chambers,&quot; to &quot;electrocution&quot; machinery. Millions are alleged to have  been killed in these ways.<P>
<B><li>How could a mass extermination program have been kept secret from those who were scheduled to be killed?</B><BR>
It couldn't have been kept secret. The fact is that there were no mass  gassings. The extermination stories originated as wartime atrocity  propaganda.<P>
<B><li>If Jews scheduled for execution knew the fate in store for them, why did they go along with the Germans without resisting?</B><BR>
They didn't fight back because they did not believe there was any  intention to kill them.<P>
<B><li>About how many Jews died in the concentration camps?</B><BR>
Competent estimates range from about 300,000 to 500,000.<P>
<B><li>How did they die?</B><BR>
Mainly from recurring typhus epidemics that ravaged war-torn Europe  during the war, as well as from starvation and lack of medical  attention during the final months of the conflict, when virtually all  road and rail transportation had been bombed out by the Allies.<P>
<B><li>What is typhus?</B><BR>
This disease always appears when many people are jammed together under  unsanitary conditions. It is carried by lice that infest hair and  clothes. Ironically, if the Germans had used more Zyklon B, more Jews  might have survived the camps.<P>
<B><li>What is the difference if six million or 300,000 Jews died during the Second World War?</B><BR>
 5,700,000.<P>
<B><li>Some Jewish &quot;death camp&quot; survivors say they saw bodies being dumped into pits and burned. How much fuel would have been required for this?</B><BR>
A great deal more than the Germans had access to, as there was a  substantial fuel shortage during the war.<P>
<B><li>Can bodies be burned in pits?</B><BR>
No. It is impossible for human bodies to be totally consumed by flames  in this manner because of lack of oxygen.<P>
<B><li>Holocaust historians claim that the Nazis were able to cremate bodies in about ten minutes. How long does it take to incinerate one body, according to professional crematory operators?</B><BR>
About an hour and a half, although the larger bones require further  processing afterwards.<P>
<B><li>Why did the German concentration camps have crematory ovens?</B><BR>
To dispose efficiently and sanitarily of the corpses of those who had  died.<P>
<B><li>Given a 100 percent duty cycle of all the crematories in all the camps in German-controlled territory, what is the maximum number of corpses it would have been possible to incinerate during the entire period such crematories were in operation?</B><BR>
About 430,600.<P>
<B><li>Can a crematory oven be operated 100 percent of the time?</B><BR>
No. Fifty percent of the time is a generous estimate (12 hours per  day). Crematory ovens have to be cleaned thoroughly and regularly when  in heavy operation.<P>
<B><li>How much ash is left from a cremated corpse?</B><BR>
After the bone is all ground down, about a shoe box full.<P>
<B><li>If six million people had been incinerated by the Nazis, what happened to the ashes?</B><BR>
That remains to be &quot;explained.&quot; Six million bodies would have produced  many tons of ashes, yet there is no evidence of any large ash  depositories.<P>
<B><li>Do Allied wartime aerial reconnaissance photos of Auschwitz (taken during the period when the &quot;gas chambers&quot; and crematoria were supposedly in full operation) show evidence of extermination?</B><BR>
No. In fact, these photographs do not even reveal a trace of the  enormous amount of smoke that supposedly was constantly over the camp,  nor do they show evidence of the &quot;open pits&quot; in which bodies were  allegedly burned.<P>
<B><li>What was the main provision of the German &quot;Nuremberg Laws&quot; of 1935?</B><BR>
They forbid marriage and sexual relations between Germans and Jews,  similar to laws existing in Israel today.<P>
<B><li>Were there any American precedents for the Nuremberg Laws?</B><BR>
Years before Hitler's Third Reich, most states in the USA had enacted  laws prohibiting marriage between persons of different races.<P>
<B><li>What did the International Red Cross have to report with regard to the &quot;Holocaust&quot; question?</B><BR>
An official report on the visit of an IRC delegation to Auschwitz in  September 1944 pointed out that internees were permitted to receive  packages, and that rumors of gas chambers could not be verified.<P>
<B><li>What was the role of the Vatican during the time six million Jews were allegedly being exterminated?</B><BR>
If there had been an extermination plan, the Vatican would most  certainly have been in a position to know about it. But because there  was none, the Vatican had no reason to speak out against it, and  didn't.<P>
<B><li>What evidence is there that Hitler knew of an on-going Jewish extermination program?</B><BR>
None.<P>
<B><li>Did the Nazis and the Zionists collaborate?</B><BR>
As early as 1933, Hitler's government signed an agreement with the  Zionists permitting Jews to emigrate from Germany to Palestine, taking  large amounts of capital with them.<P>
<B><li>How did Anne Frank die?</B><BR>
After surviving internment in Auschwitz, she succumbed to typhus in the  Bergen-Belsen camp, just a few weeks before the end of the war. She was  not gassed.<P>
<B><li>Is the Anne Frank Diary genuine?</B><BR>
No. Evidence compiled by Dr. Robert Faurisson of France establishes  that the famous diary is a literary hoax.<P>
<B><li>What about the familiar photographs and film footage taken in the liberated German camps showing piles of emaciated corpses? Are these faked?</B><BR>
Photographs can be faked, but it's far easier merely to add a  misleading caption to a photo or commentary to a piece of footage. Piles of emaciated corpses do not mean that these people were &quot;gassed&quot;  or deliberately starved to death. Actually, these were tragic victims  of raging epidemics or of starvation due to a lack of food in the camps  toward the end of the war.<P>
<B><li>Who originated the term &quot;genocide&quot;?</B><BR>
Raphael Lemkin, a Polish Jew, in a book published in 1944.<P>
<B><li>Are films such as &quot;Schindler's List&quot; or &quot;The Winds of War&quot; documentaries?</B><BR>
No. Such films are fictional dramatizations loosely based on history. Unfortunately, all too many people accept them as accurate historical  representations.<P>
<B><li>How many books have been published that refute some aspect of the standard &quot;Holocaust&quot; story?</B><BR>
Dozens. More are in production.<P>
<B><li>What happened when the Institute for Historical Review offered $50,000 to anyone who could prove that Jews were gassed at Auschwitz?</B><BR>
No proof was submitted as a claim on the reward, but the Institute was  sued for $17 million by former Auschwitz inmate Mel Mermelstein, who  claimed that the reward offer caused him to lose sleep and his business  to suffer, and represented &quot;injurious denial of established fact.&quot;<P>
<B><li>What about the charge that those who question the Holocaust story are merely anti-Semitic or neo-Nazi?</B><BR>
This is a smear designed to draw attention away from facts and honest  arguments. Scholars who refute Holocaust story claims are of all  persuasions and ethnic-religious backgrounds (including Jewish). There  is no correlation between &quot;Holocaust&quot; refutation and anti-Semitism or  neo-Nazism. Increasing numbers of Jewish scholars openly admit the lack  of evidence for key Holocaust claims.<P>
<B><li>What has happened to &quot;revisionist&quot; historians who have challenged the Holocaust story?</B><BR>
They have been subjected to smear campaigns, loss of academic  positions, loss of pensions, destruction of their property and physical  violence.<P>
<B><li>Has the Institute for Historical Review suffered any retaliation for its efforts to uphold the right of freedom of speech and academic freedom?</B><BR>
The IHR had been bombed three times, and was completely destroyed on  July 4, 1984, in a criminal arson attack. Numerous death threats by  telephone have been received. Media coverage of the IHR has been  overwhelmingly hostile.<P>
<B><li>Why is there so little publicity for the revisionist view?</B><BR>
Because for political reasons the Establishment does not want any  in-depth discussion about the facts surrounding the Holocaust story.<P>
<B><li>Where can I get more information about the &quot;other side&quot; of the Holocaust story, as well as facts concerning other aspects of World War II historical revisionism?</B><BR>
The Institute for Historical Review, P.O. Box 2739, Newport Beach, CA  92659, carries a wide variety of books, cassette and video tapes on  significant historical subjects. <P>

<H1>Gas chamber fraud</H1>

<B>Major French magazine acknowledges Auschwitz gas chamber fraud</B><P>
One of France's most influential and reputable magazines, L'Express, now acknowledges that &quot;everything is false&quot; about the Auschwitz &quot;gas chamber&quot; that for decades has been shown to tens of thousands of tourists yearly.<P>
&quot;Auschwitz: The Memory of Evil,&quot; a lengthy article by journalist and historian Eric Conan, a dedicated anti-revisionist, appears in the January 19-25, 1995, issue, pages 54-73 (and in the Jan. 26 international edition). L'Express is a liberal large-circulation weekly news magazine, similar in format to Time or Newsweek.<P>
L'Express also reports that, after a five-year battle among the &quot;experts,&quot; Polish president Lech Walesa has decided that the new, revised number of dead to be inscribed on the Birkenau monument will be 1,500,000. (For years the monument proclaimed 4,000,000 Auschwitz deaths.)<P>
Generally speaking, writes Conan, there have been many obvious falsifications in the Auschwitz and Birkenau camp sites. Stefan Wilkanowicz, vice-president of the International Committee of the Polish government's Auschwitz State Museum (and director of an influential Polish Catholic periodical), says:<P>
The biggest blunders have been rectified but the principal  discussions are never-ending and far from being settled. I can  even say that essential debates, distressing, sometimes  unexpected, are only beginning.<P>
<B>About the famous &quot;gas chamber&quot; in the Auschwitz I camp, Conan writes:</B><P>
In 1948, when the Museum was created, Crematory I was  reconstructed in a supposed original state. Everything in it is false [Tout y est faux]: the dimensions of the gas chamber, the  locations of the doors, the openings for pouring in Zyklon B, the  ovens (rebuilt according to the recollections of some survivors), the height of the chimney. At the end of the 70s, Robert Faurisson  exploited those falsifications all the better because at that time  the Museum officials balked at admitting them. An American  revisionist [David Cole] has just shot a video in the gas chamber  (still presented as authentic): one may see him questioning the  visitors with his &quot;revelations&quot; [Emphasis added.]<P>
In spite of this, Conan goes on to report, there are no plans to alter anything there. With regard to the famous &quot;gas chamber,&quot; a staff member of the Museum directors' office, Krystyna Oleksy, says: &quot;For the time being we are going to leave it in the present state, and not give any specifics to the visitors. It is too complicated. We'll see later on.&quot;<P>
<B>Victory for Revisionism</B><P>
This feature article in a leading French magazine is a great victory for Holocaust revisionism. On a key point, L'Express now acknowledges, the revisionists have been right all along.<P>
In fact, the magazine concedes a point that revisionists have been legally penalized for making. Dr. Robert Faurisson, Europe's foremost revisionist scholar, was heavily fined after repeating it on numerous occasions during his &quot;thought crime&quot; trials in France. (Will the French government now prosecute L'Express magazine and journalist Conan for their revisionist Holocaust views?)<P>
In May 1992 a German court fined David Irving 10,000 marks (about $6,000) for publicly saying what L'Express now openly admits. (See: &quot;Irving Fined $6,000 in German 'Gas Chamber' Trial,&quot; IHR Newsletter, July-Aug. 1992, pp. 3-4.)<P>
The court punished the British historian because he had told a Munich meeting in April 1990 that the structure in Auschwitz that has been portrayed for decades to tourists as an extermination gas chamber is a phony reconstruction (&quot;Attrappe&quot;), just like the one at Dachau.<P>
Irving was found guilty of thus &quot;disparaging the memory of the dead,&quot; a crime in Germany that effectively applies only to Jewish victims. In the case the Judge refused to consider any of the evidence presented by Irving's attorneys, including a plea to permit Dr. Franciszek Piper, Senior Curator and archives director of the Auschwitz State Musueum, to testify in the case.<P>

<B>Dr. Faurisson comments on Conan's article:</B><P>
 Clearly, the Auschwitz propagandists are at a loss. Oleksy's  statement is an important vindication of the revisionist position.  Every visitor of the Auschwitz &quot;gas chamber&quot; should confront the  guides (or, if possible, Museum officials) with these sentences  by Oleksy.<P>
 During a September 1992 interview with American revisionist David  Cole, Auschwitz Museum Curator Piper said, &quot;so now this gas  chamber [at Auschwitz I] is very similar to this one which existed  in 1941-1942.&quot; ;<P>
 As Conan knows, already in 1976 I demonstrated the falsehood of  this entire story by questioning Museum official Jan Machalek, and  by finding in the Auschwitz Museum files original plans clearly  showing that, in fact, the alleged &quot;gas chamber &quot; was,  between October 7, 1941, and August 31, 1943, a room with a single  entrance where dead bodies awaiting cremation were stored.<P>
 If Museum officials now wish to rebuild the room as it was during  the war, they will have to fill in the south-east doorway. After  doing so, though, they would no longer be able to explain how the  alleged victims entered the &quot;gas chamber &quot; for gassing. I do not  think the officials would dare contend that the victims entered by  way of the door of the ovens room.<P>
 For details on these points, see what I published in Serge Thion's  1980 book V&eacute;rit&eacute; historique ou v&eacute;rit&eacute; politique? La question des  chambres &agrave; gaz, pp. 316-317. I have also repeatedly mentioned the  story of that &quot;reconstructed &quot; gas chamber in The Journal of  Historical Review (see, for instance, Winter 1981 issue, p. 335),  as well as during the 1985 and 1988 Z&uuml;ndel trials in Toronto (see,  for instance, 1985 Trial, Transcript, pp. 2364-2366). Even as  early as 1968, Olga Wormser-Migot wrote in her book Le Syst&egrave;me  concentrationnaire nazi (p. 157) that the Auschwitz I camp was  &quot;without a gas chamber.&quot; In 1985, Raul Hilberg stated under oath  during the first Z&uuml;ndel trial in Toronto (Transcript, p. 774),  and Pierre Vidal-Naquet wrote in L'Allemagne nazie et le g&eacute;nocide  juif (pp. 510, 516, n. 94), what Franciszek Piper said to Cole in  1992. Jean-Claude Pressac told the same story in his 1989 book,  Auschwitz: Technique and Operation of the Gas Chambers (pp. 108,  123, 133).<P>
 In his L'Express article, Conan mentions Jean-Claude Pressac's  1993 book, Les Cr&eacute;matoires d'Auschwitz. Among the fantastic number  of &quot;dossiers&quot; and articles recently published in French newspapers  and magazines in connection with the 50th anniversary of the  camp's liberation, this article may perhaps be the only one to  mention that book. Pressac's ambivalence has become an  embarrassment for the &quot;exterminationists.&quot; For instance, his  estimate in Les Cr&eacute;matoires d'Auschwitz (1993) of total Auschwitz  deaths was 775,000 (rounded up to 800,000), and in the 1994 German  edition he further reduced this to between 630,000 and 710,000 (of  whom, he asserts, 470,000 to 550,000 were &quot;gassed&quot; Jews).<P>

<B>Book-length 'Scholarly' polemic fails to discredit Leuchter</B><P>
<B>Truth Prevails: Demolishing Holocaust Denial: The End of the Leuchter Report.</B> Edited by Shelly Shapiro. New York, N.Y.: The Beate Klarsfeld Foundation, and Holocaust Survivors &amp; Friends in Pursuit of Justice, 1990. Softcover. 135 pages. Illustrations. Index. $15.00. ISBN 1-879437-00-7.<P>
<B>Reviewed by Mark Weber</B><P>
In response to Fred Leuchter's findings about the alleged wartime extermination gas chambers, the Holocaust lobby has mounted a well-orchestrated campaign of slander, distortion, half-truth and falsehood to discredit him and destroy his career as a consultant to state governments on execution technology.<P>
At the forefront of this effort have been the Paris-based Beate Klarsfeld Foundation and a US-based group that calls itself &quot;Holocaust Survivors &amp; Friends in Pursuit of Justice.&quot; An important propaganda tool in this international campaign is this angry, awkwardly written and poorly organized 135-page polemic, which is perhaps the most ambitious effort so far to discredit Leuchter and his findings. Published jointly by these two organizations in 1990, it bears the pretentious and rather bombastic title Truth Prevails: Demolishing Holocaust Denial: The End of the Leuchter Report.<P>
As Journal readers know, this is not the first time that these two groups have sought to discredit Holocaust Revisionism with a book-length publication. In 1989 the Klarsfeld Foundation released Auschwitz: Technique and Operation of the Gas Chambers, an ambitious 564-page work by French researcher Jean-Claude Pressac. (See the reviews of Pressac's book in the IHR Journal by Mark Weber, Summer 1990, and Robert Faurisson, Spring and Summer 1991.)<P>
Truth Prevails consists of a preface by editor Shelly Shapiro (who is also director of &quot;Holocaust Survivors &amp; Friends&quot;), six essays (including two by Jean-Claude Pressac), and a short commentary by Serge Klarsfeld. In spite of its erudite pretension, this is a poorly written, edited and organized work. Its language is often snide and crude.<P>
All the same, Truth Prevails has had a measurable impact. Libelous and error-ridden articles based on it have appeared in daily newspapers and weekly Jewish community papers around the country. In addition to the usual and untruthful attacks against the IHR and Holocaust Revisionism in general, these articles viciously attack Leuchter as a man.<P>
Throughout this book, Revisionists are routinely referred to as &quot;Holocaust deniers,&quot; a formulation that suggests a medieval Inquisition against religious heretics who have blasphemed against a sacred dogma. By treating &quot;Holocaust denial&quot; as the most terrible sin that anyone can commit these days, this book serves to underscore the way that the Holocaust has become, for many, a kind of religion.<P>
In the preface, &quot;Holocaust denial&quot; is also compared to denying the existence of slavery in 18th and 19th century America, or denying the atomic bombing of Hiroshima. However, one might reasonably ask, if &quot;Holocaust denial&quot; is really so obviously absurd, why bother about it? No rational person wastes time refuting those who might deny the 1945 bombing of Hiroshima.<P>
The preface also sets the tone of Truth Prevails, where the reader is told: &quot;The incomprehensible death factories 'with their bulging gas chambers and smoke-belching crematoria eclipsed man's visions of hell.' The name of Auschwitz means the epitomy [sic] of evil.&quot; Overlooking the emotion-charged rhetoric here, it should be pointed out that, as anyone who is even superficially familiar with the reality of Auschwitz knows, there were no &quot;smoke-belching crematoria&quot; there (or anywhere, for that matter). Like similar facilities elsewhere, the crematory facilities at Auschwitz were structurally not able to &quot;belch&quot; smoke. (Accordingly, Allied aerial reconnaissance photos taken of the camp complex in 1944 - at the height of the supposed extermination process there - show absolutely no trace of any smoke whatsoever.)<P>
Editor Shapiro also expresses outrage at a reference (in the British edition of the Leuchter Report) to an inmates' swimming pool at Auschwitz. In point of fact, there was such a pool. (On this, see: R. Lenski, The Holocaust on Trial, pp. 38, 132, 142, 358-359, 385, and, R. Faurisson, IHR Journal, Summer 1991, pp. 133-134.)<P>
Truth Prevails seeks to discredit the Leuchter Report by, above all, attacking its author's qualifications. A main purpose of this book is to prove that Leuchter lacks the expertise he claims, and to show, instead, that he is a pretentious fraud. &quot;Our goal,&quot; the preface explains, &quot;is to show Leuchter's lack of expertise&quot; as an execution hardware specialist, and &quot;to demonstrate that 'The Leuchter Report' is not a credible scientific analysis. . .&quot; (p. 1).<P>
Charging that &quot;Leuchter does not have the scientific background or experience despite his claims&quot; (p. 11), Truth Prevails insists that Leuchter is simply not qualified to give an expert opinion about the alleged gas chambers at Auschwitz and Majdanek.<P>
In this regard, much is made of the fact that Judge Ron Thomas declined to accept the Leuchter Report as a defense exhibit during the 1988 Z&uuml;ndel trial. Strictly speaking, this is true. But Truth Prevails essentially ignores the fact that Judge Thomas did decide to accept Leuchter as an expert of homicidal gas chamber technology, and accordingly permitted him to give opinion evidence. During his testimony, Leuchter was allowed to read extensively from his Report, which became part of the court record.<P>
As detailed in an article published elsewhere in this issue of the Journal, Leuchter's impressive expertise in the field of execution hardware is a matter of public record, and has been authoritatively and publicly confirmed. For example, in a letter of January 13, 1988, Missouri state prison director William Armontrout wrote: &quot;Mr. Leuchter is an engineer specializing in gas chambers and executions. He is well versed in all areas and is the only consultant in the United States that I know of.&quot; Testifying in the 1988 Zuendel trial, Armontrout also declared that he had consulted with Leuchter on the design, maintenance and operation of the Missouri state gas chamber, and reaffirmed that, to the best of his knowledge, Leuchter is the only such consultant in the United States.<P>
As part of its vicious assault against Leuchter's character, this book charges that financial greed was the motive behind his forensic investigation of the alleged extermination gas chambers, and his conclusion that they were never used as killing facilities. Leuchter's motivation, Pressac writes here, was &quot;to collect the steep fee he asked of Zundel and which the latter paid him.&quot; (p. 32)<P>
In another chapter, contributor Arthur Goodman provides a mendacious explanation of how Leuchter was chosen to carry out his forensic investigation (p. 76):<P>
	Faurisson quickly applied himself to the task of finding an &quot;engineer&quot; who would testify for Z&uuml;ndel. Very soon thereafter, Faurisson dug up the hitherto unknown Leuchter whom he contacted and who was only too willing to earn the money, gain the notoriety and establish a reputation as the one man whose investigation would sustain the [Revisionist] thesis . . . Leuchter [was] only too eager to be won over . . .<P>
In fact (and as explained in more detail elsewhere in this issue of the Journal), Leuchter's motives in conducting his forensic investigation of the alleged wartime gas chambers in Poland were entirely honorable and professional. Prof. Robert Faurisson and Ernst Z&uuml;ndel sought out Leuchter not because of any pre-existing views or prejudices he may have had on this issue, but solely because he was, at that time, the only acknowledged execution gas chamber specialist in the United States.<P>
While it is true that he was paid a standard fee by Z&uuml;ndel, this is not at all remarkable. Any expert witnesses who testifies in a court case under such circumstances is normally paid a fee in keeping with his or her professional standing. Christopher Browning, for example, the star prosecution witness in the 1988 Z&uuml;ndel trial, received 150 (Canadian) dollars an hour for his services.<P>
Shapiro and the Klarsfelds are understandably angry that, in spite of their efforts, the major media continues to acknowledge Leuchter's expertise as America's foremost expert of execution technology. Shapiro expresses outrage that &quot;major news organizations&quot; have given him with &quot;a semblance of respectability and credibility.&quot;<P>
The Atlantic monthly, for example, is taken to task for an illustrated article about Leuchter in the February 1990 issue. In this piece, attorney and author Susan Lehman factually described Leuchter as	the nation's only commercial supplier of execution equipment . . . A trained and accomplished engineer, he is versed in all types of execution equipment. He makes lethal-injection machines, gas chambers, and gallows, as well as electrocution systems. [He] . . . probably knows more about electric chair technology than anyone else.<P>
The Zionist Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith responded to this rather flattering profile with an angry letter of protest. In her reply to the ADL, Susan Lehman correctly pointed out that Leuchter's findings about the Holocaust &quot;gas chambers,&quot; and his testimony in the Z&uuml;ndel trial, &quot;have no direct bearing. . .on the subject of my report.&quot; In his essay in Truth Prevails, Charles R. Allen, Jr., dismisses Lehman's reply as &quot;insolence.&quot;<P>
An even greater calamity, in the view of Shapiro and her friends, was a profile of Leuchter broadcast nationwide May 10, 1990, on the widely viewed ABC television news program &quot;Prime Time Live.&quot; Co-host Diane Sawyer described Leuchter as &quot;the country's foremost expert at creating, designing and maintaining execution equipment.&quot;<P>
Particularly galling to the Shapiro crowd is the fact that ABC news television went ahead with its profile of &quot;Dr. Death&quot; even after it had been &quot;informed&quot; of Leuchter's shocking views on the Holocaust extermination story, and of his links with the infamous Institute for Historical Review. Shelly Shapiro and Beate Klarsfeld had even met with producer Bob Currie to urge him not to air the report.<P>
Finally, The New York Times is castigated for prominently featuring an article, October 13, 1990, which included a front-page photograph of Leuchter, that describes him as &quot;the nation's leading adviser to states on capital punishment.&quot; Leuchter, the article also reported, has &quot;advised 16 states on every kind of execution equipment. Four states have bought his lethal injection systems. . .&quot;<P>
This unequivocal acknowledgment of Leuchter's expertise by the nation's most influential daily paper is all the more significant because its author, and the paper's editors, were entirely aware of the Shapiro/Klarsfled team's criticisms of Leuchter when the article went to press.<P>
And much more recently, Leuchter's standing as the premier expert of execution hardware was affirmed in &quot;The Execution Protocol,&quot; a television report broadcast November 1, 1992, on the Discovery cable television network, as well as on the session of the popular Phil Donahue show broadcast nationwide November 13, 1992.<P>
Truth Prevails tries to explain away these embarrassing tributes by contending that Leuchter has somehow been able to trick or fool these savvy periodicals into accepting his bogus claims of expertise. If Leuchter was actually able to somehow &quot;take in&quot; the media as this book suggests, he must be gifted with truly extraordinary powers of persuasion.<P>
Truth Prevails ruefully notes that Leuchter &quot;is still sought by the media as the only available spokesman on the technology of the death penalty in the U.S.&quot; (p. 24). One can be certain that if there is anyone (besides Leuchter) in the United States who could plausibly be portrayed as a &quot;real&quot; expert on execution hardware, Shapiro and her diligent colleagues certainly would have found him. Interestingly, though, the Shapiro/Klarsfeld team has not produced any such person: To date, the best they have been able to come up with is a confused and unqualified suburban French pharmacist, Jean-Claude Pressac.<P>
Fittingly, much of this book consists of two essays by Pressac that seek to refute the Leuchter Report on technical grounds. (For a point by point response to Pressac's critique of Leuchter's findings, see the detailed essay by Paul Grubach in this issue of the Journal.)<P>
Shapiro and Klarsfeld use a grotesque double standard in deciding just who qualifies as a gas chamber expert. While Leuchter is dismissed as an untrained fraud and crank, Pressac is praised here (by Serge Klarsfeld, on page 29) as &quot;one of the world's rare research specialists in gas chamber extermination technique.&quot; This description is almost laughable in light of Pressac's lack of any formal training, credentials or recognized expertise in architecture, engineering, history or document analysis.<P>
Leuchter is not this book's only target. Prof. Faurisson is accused of &quot;intellectual dishonesty&quot; (p. 36), and Ernst Z&uuml;ndel is referred to as Canada's &quot;prime practitioner of Holocaust denial&quot; (p. 22), as if he is the high priest of an evil satanic cult, and historian David Irving is called a &quot;Nazi propagandist&quot; (p. 85).<P>
In a ten-page chapter by H. L. Silets, a specialist of legal history at the University of Cambridge, the 1946 &quot;Zyklon B&quot; trial is cited as irrefutable proof that German officials used hydrogen cyanide gas from Zyklon to exterminate Jews in wartime concentration camps. Dr. Bruno Tesch, the German businessman who headed the company that supplied Zyklon, and his assistant and business manager Karl Weinbacher were the two main defendants in the 1946 trial in Hamburg. They were found guilty by the British military court, sentenced to death, and hanged.<P>
Revisionist scholars are familiar with this important trial, which was a travesty of justice. (Retired American research chemist Dr. William B. Lindsey provides a thorough examination of it in a carefully researched article in the Fall 1983 IHR Journal.) Even Jean-Claude Pressac has rightly castigated this trial as unjust and probably a &quot;masquerade.&quot; (J.-C. Pressac, Auschwitz, 1989, p. 17.)<P>
A key witness in the trial was Charles (or Paul) Bendel, a Jewish doctor who had been an inmate physician in Birkenau in 1944. His &quot;eyewitness&quot; testimony about extermination gassings in the camp helped to send Tesch and Weinbacher to the gallows. As even Pressac has confirmed, Bendel's testimony is demonstrably wrong on numerous key points. (J.-C. Pressac, Auschwitz, 1989, pp. 469-472.)<P>
Perhaps most remarkably, this British court determined that, of a grand total of six million people killed in the German camps, no less than four and a half million were &quot;systematically exterminated&quot; with Zyklon B at Auschwitz-Birkenau alone. (United Nations War Crimes Commission, Law Reports of Trials of War Criminals, London: HMSO, 1947, Vol. 1, p. 94. See also Nuremberg document NI-12207.)<P>
As further proof of extermination gassings at Auschwitz, Truth Prevails contributor Silets cites the postwar &quot;confession&quot; of former Auschwitz commandant Rudolf H&ouml;ss. However, as even prominent Holocaust historians (including J.-C. Pressac in his 1989 book) now concede, key statements in this &quot;confession&quot; are quite demonstrably untrue. Moreover, it has been indisputably established that H&ouml;ss' infamous &quot;confession&quot; was extracted by brutal torture. (See: R. Faurisson, IHR Journal, Winter 1986-87, pp. 389-403.)<P>
Beate Klarsfeld has announced that Leuchter &quot;has to understand that in denying the Holocaust, he cannot remain unpunished.&quot; (JTA dispatch, Detroit Jewish News, March 1, 1991.) In this spirit, Ms. Shapiro has boasted about the measures that she and her collaborators have taken to pressure public officials, prison wardens, state correction departments, politicians and journalists into blacklisting Leuchter.<P>
In August 1990, for example, the Shapiro/Klarsfeld group succeeded in pressuring the Illinois Department of Corrections into canceling its $8,320 consulting contract with Leuchter to inspect and supervise administration of its lethal injection equipment. (p. 17) Complaints were also made to state prison officials in Alabama, North Carolina, California, Arizona and Maryland. In one state, a lawmaker said that to retain Leuchter as an execution consultant would conflict with the state's requirement of mandatory &quot;Holocaust studies&quot; for every public school pupil. (For more on this campaign, see the IHR Newsletter, July-August 1991, p. 3.)<P>
Sadly, this insidious campaign to &quot;punish&quot; Leuchter for his insolent refusal to toe the Holocaust line has been largely successful. As he explains in his essay elsewhere in this issue of the Journal, his livelihood has largely been destroyed.<P>
Although it is actually little more than a mean-spirited, bigoted and error-ridden polemic, Truth Prevails is not ineffective as a work of Holocaust propaganda. It will undoubtedly continue to have an impact among the ignorant. All the same, its very existence is somewhat gratifying because it is a tangible expression of the growing impact of Holocaust Revisionism. <P>

<H1>Is gun control a Nazi scheme?</H1>
<BR>
With gun owners increasingly aware of the Jewish leadership of the gun-banning movement, a group of Jews in Milwaukee claiming to be defenders of the Second Amendment have been noisily denouncing gun control as a <code>&quot;</code>Nazi<code>&quot;</code> scheme. The group, calling themselves Jews for the Preservation of Firearms Ownership, assert that Adolf Hitler was the father of all gun grabbers. The proof of this, they claim, was the German Weapons Law (Waffengesetz) of March 18, 1938, which was enacted by Germany's National Socialist government. They have succeeded in persuading at least one magazine read by firearms enthusiasts to publicize their claims repeatedly (Guns and Ammo, May 1993 and March 1994).<BR>
 <BR>
The truth of the matter is that the 1938 German law specifically provided for the ownership and carrying of firearms, including handguns, by law-abiding German citizens. Jews, of course, were not German citizens -- the National Socialists defined citizenship in ethnic terms -- and the law specifically barred Jews from having any role in the manufacture of firearms or ammunition or from being firearms dealers (but not from purchasing or owning firearms).<BR>
 <BR>
The German law certainly was not an ideal one from the viewpoint of today's beleaguered American patriot, because it did have certain licensing requirements. A permit (Waffenerwerbschein) was required to buy a handgun (but not a long gun), and a separate license (Waffenschein), good for three years, was required to carry any firearm in public.<BR>
Actually, the German law was less restrictive than most state and local laws in the United States were before the current campaign to nullify the Second Amendment shifted into high gear in 1993. More significantly, it ameliorated a law which had been enacted ten years earlier by a Left-Center government hostile to the National Socialists (the government headed by Wilhelm Marx and consisting of a coalition of Socialists and Catholic Centrists). The 1938 law irritated the Jews by pointedly excluding them from the firearms business, but it clearly was not a law aimed at preventing the ownership or use of firearms, including handguns, for either sporting or self-defense purposes by German citizens. As noted above, it actually relaxed or eliminated the provisions of a pre-existing law.<P>
The facts, in brief, are these:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>The National Socialist government of Germany did not fear its citizens. Adolf Hitler was the most popular leader Germany has ever had. <P>
<LI>The spirit of National Socialism was one of manliness, and individual self-defense and self-reliance were central to the National Socialist view of the way a citizen should behave. The notion of banning firearms ownership was alien to National Socialism.<P>
<LI>Gun registration and licensing (for long guns as well as for handguns) were legislated by an anti-National Socialist government in Germany five years before the National Socialists gained power. Five years after they gained power they got around to rewriting the gun law enacted by their predecessors, substantially ameliorating it in the process (for example, long guns were exempted from the requirement for a purchase permit; the legal age for gun ownership was lowered from 20 to 18 years; and the period of validity of a permit to carry weapons was extended from one to three years). They may be criticized for leaving certain restrictions and licensing requirements in the law, but they had no intention of preventing law-abiding Germans from keeping or bearing arms.</UL><P>
The highlights of the 1938 German Weapons Law (which in its entirety fills 12 pages of the Reichsgesetzblatt with legalese), especially as it applied to ordinary citizens rather than manufacturers or dealers, follow:<BR>
<UL><LI>Handguns may be sold or purchased only on submission of a Weapons Acquisition Permit (Waffenerwerbschein), which must be used within one year from the date of issue. Muzzle-loading handguns are exempted from the permit requirement.<P>
<LI>Holders of a permit to carry weapons (Waffenschein) or of a hunting license do not need a Weapons Acquisition Permit in order to acquire a handgun.<P>
<LI>A hunting license authorizes its bearer to carry hunting weapons and handguns.<P>
<LI>Firearms and ammunition, as well as swords and knives, may not be sold to minors under the age of 18 years.<P>
<LI>Whoever carries a firearm outside of his dwelling, his place of employment, his place of business, or his fenced property must have on his person a Weapons Permit (Waffenschein). A permit is not required, however, for carrying a firearm for use at a police-approved shooting range.<P>
<LI>A permit to acquire a handgun or to carry firearms may only be issued to persons whose trustworthiness is not in question and who can show a need for a permit. In particular, a permit may not be issued to:<P>
<OL>
<LI>persons under the age of 18 years;<P>
<LI>legally incompetent or mentally retarded persons;<P>
<LI>Gypsies or vagabonds; <P>
<LI>persons under mandatory police supervision (i.e., on parole) or   otherwise temporarily without civil rights; <P>
<LI>persons convicted of treason or high treason or known to be engaged in activities hostile to the state;<P>
<LI>persons who for assault, trespass, a breach of the peace, resistance to authority, a criminal offense or misdemeanor, or a hunting or fishing violation, were legally sentenced to a term of imprisonment of more than two weeks, if three years have not passed since the term of imprisonment.</OL><P>
<LI>The manufacture, sale, carrying, possession, and import of the following are prohibited:<P>
<OL><LI><code>&quot;</code>trick<code>&quot;</code> firearms, designed so as to conceal their function (e.g., cane guns and belt-buckle pistols);<P>
<LI>any firearm equipped with a silencer and any rifle equipped with a spotlight;<P>
<LI>cartridges with .22 caliber, hollow-point bullets.</OL><P>
</UL>
That is the essence. Numerous other provisions of the law relate to firearms manufacturers, importers, and dealers; to acquisition and carrying of firearms by police, military, and other official personnel; to the maximum fees which can be charged for permits (3 Reichsmarks); to tourists bringing firearms into Germany; and to the fines and other penalties to be levied for violations. (A full text and translation of these German gun laws is available from National Vanguard Books, PO Box 330, Hillsboro WV 24946 USA, for $14 postpaid.)<P>
The requirements of <code>&quot;</code>trustworthiness<code>&quot;</code> and of proof of need when obtaining a permit are troubling, but it should be noted that they were simply carried over from the 1928 law: they were not formulated by the National Socialists. Under the National Socialists, these requirements were interpreted liberally: a person who did not fall into one of the prohibited categories listed above was considered trustworthy, and a statement such as, <code>&quot;</code>I often carry sums of money,<code>&quot;</code> was accepted as proof of need.<P>
The prohibitions of spotlight-equipped rifles and hollow-point .22 caliber ammunition were based on considerations that the former were unsporting when used for hunting, and the latter were inhumane.<P>
It was not until 1945, when the communist and democratic victors of the Second World War had installed occupation governments to rule over the conquered Germans that German citizens were denied the right to armed self-defense.<P>
Despite these facts, there are a number of people among those who support Second Amendment rights who have fallen for the Jewish trick of associating gun-grabbing with Hitler and the National Socialists. These people sometimes make such statements as, <code>&quot;</code>The first thing Hitler did when he came to power was round up all the guns.<code>&quot;</code> Such statements are demonstrably false, and when they are made by a person who genuinely supports Second Amendment rights they reveal the person's ignorance or dishonesty. When they are made by a Jewish group it is clear that their intent is to confuse the public and deceitfully deflect blame from their fellow Jews.<P>

<H1>The measure of greatness</H1>
<B>NATIONAL VANGUARD Editorial from 1989</B><P>
<a href="http://204.137.145.254../images/ah.jpg"><IMG  Align=Right Border=0 SRC="../images/ah.gif" HSpace=10 VSpace=0></a>
April 20 of this year is the 100th anniversary of the birth of the greatest man of our era -- a man who dared more and achieved more, who set his aim higher and climbed higher, who felt more deeply and stirred the souls of those around him more mightily, who was more closely attuned to the Life Force which permeates our cosmos and gives it meaning and purpose, and did more to serve that Life Force, than any other man of our times. <P>
And yet he is the most reviled and hated man of our times. Only a few tens of thousands of men and women, in scattered groups around the world, will celebrate his birthday with love and reverence on April 20, while all of the scribblers and commentators of the controlled news media, the controlled politicians, and the controlled churchmen will pour out their hatred and venom and lies against him, and those lies will be believed by hundreds of millions.<P>
<B>What is the measure of greatness in a man?</B><P>
Only the most vulgar and doctrinaire democrat would seriously equate greatness with popularity -- although in any polling of average citizens on their choice for the greatest man of the century there are certain to be substantial numbers of votes for Elvis Presley, John Kennedy, Billy Graham, Michael Jackson, and various other high-visibility lightweights: charismatic entertainers on the stage of politics, rock concerts, spectator sports, or what have you. <P>
More serious citizens would pass by the lightweights and choose men who have changed the world in some way. We would hear choices like Franklin Roosevelt (<code>&quot;</code>he saved the world from fascism<code>&quot;</code>), Albert Einstein (<code>&quot;</code>he taught us about the nature of our universe<code>&quot;</code>), and Martin Luther King (<code>&quot;</code>he helped us achieve racial justice<code>&quot;</code>), depending upon whether one's personal inclinations lay more in the direction of politics, science, or racial self-abasement, respectively.<P>
But if the poll asked instead for the most evil man of the century, or the most hated man, or the man having the most negative influence, at least three-quarters of the blue-collar and the white-collar pollees alike would name one man: Adolf Hitler. This, however, would be merely a reflection of the role assigned to him by the controlled mass media, rather than a truly informed and reasoned choice.<P>
All of this raises several very interesting issues. There is, for example, the question of how we came to the preposterous state of affairs prevailing today, wherein we place the destiny of our nation, our planet, and our race in the hands of a mass of voters whose powers of judgment are manifested in such things as the type of television entertainment their preferences have pushed into prime time and the type of men they have elected to public office. And there is the equally weighty question of how, knowing the ease with which this mass is misled, we permitted virtually all of the media of mass information and entertainment to fall into the hands of a race whose interests are so diametrically opposed to our own.<P>
Perhaps even more pertinent to a consideration of human greatness, however, is the question of how our system of values came to be turned on its head, so that Franklin Roosevelt is regarded as a hero and Adolf Hitler as a villain, not only by the stolid and stunned masses, but also by a majority of the supposedly <code>&quot;</code>educated<code>&quot;</code> elite, many of whom pride themselves on their intellectual independence. <P>
Whether we judge the greatness of a man by his intrinsic qualities of character and soul or by his accomplishments, Adolf Hitler had greatness of a very high order -- if we use the standards which have been traditional in our race. <P>
We cannot, of course, make comparisons with all the <code>&quot;</code>mute, inglorious Miltons<code>&quot;</code> whose lack of notable accomplishment has made them anonymous, despite the sterling inner qualities they may have possessed. But when Hitler's character is held up beside those of other 20th-century political leaders, he stands as a giant among pygmies. <P>
At the prosaic level, we can note his ascetic personal habits, compared with Winston Churchill's habitual drunkenness and noto-rious self-indulgence; or his personal loyalty to those who had been his comrades in the days of political struggle, compared with Joseph Stalin's habit of murdering his former comrades by the dozen, as potential rivals, as soon as he no longer needed their services; or his direct, frank, and straightforward manner, compared to the cunning deviousness which was Franklin Roosevelt's trademark.<P>
At the spiritual level, the inner differences between Hitler and his contemporaries are even more striking. Hitler was a man with a mission, from the beginning. The testimony of his closest associates, from his boyhood days to the end of his life, agrees with the observations of more distant and impartial observers: Hitler had a mystical sense of destiny, a sense of having been singled out and called by a higher power to devote his life to the service of his race. <P>
His childhood companion August Kubizek has related extraordinary evidence of this when Hitler was only 16 years old.&lt;August Kubizek, Adolf Hitler, mein Jugendfreund (Graz, 1953), pp. 127-135&gt; Twenty years later, while he was in prison after an unsuccessful attempt to overthrow the government, Hitler himself wrote of his motivation in a way which suggested the range of his vision:<P>
<code>&quot;</code>What we must fight for is the security of the existence and reproduction of our race and our people, the sustenance of our children and the maintenance of the purity of our blood . . . so that our people may mature for the fulfillment of the mission allotted them by the Creator of the universe.<P>
Every thought and every idea, every doctrine and all knowledge, must serve this purpose. And everything must be examined from this point of view and used or rejected according to its utility. Then no theory will stiffen into a dead doctrine, since it is life alone that all things must serve. . . .<P>
. . . [T]he National Socialist philosophy finds the importance of mankind in its basic racial elements. In the state it sees on principle a means to an end and construes that end as the preservation of the racial existence of man. . . . <P>
And so the National Socialist philosophy of life corresponds to the innermost will of Nature, since it restores that free play of forces which must lead to a continuous mutual higher breeding, until finally the best of humanity, having achieved possession of this earth, will have a free play for activity in domains which will lie partly above it and partly outside it.<P>
We all sense that in the distant future humanity must be faced by problems which only a highest race, become mas-ter people and supported by the means and possibilities of an entire globe, will be equipped to overcome. . . .<P>
Thus, the highest purpose of a National Socialist state is concern for the preservation of those original racial elements which bestow culture and create the beauty and dignity of a higher mankind. We, as Aryans, can conceive of the state only as the living organism of a nationality which not only assures the preservation of this nationality, but by the development of its spiritual and ideal abilities leads it to the highest freedom. . . .<P>
A National Socialist state must begin by raising marriage from the level of a continuous defilement of the race and give it the consecration of an institution which is called upon to produce images of the Lord and not monstrosities halfway between man and ape. . . .<P>
It must set race in the center of all life. It must take care to keep it pure. It must declare the child to be the most precious treasure of the people. It must see to it that only the healthy beget children . . . .<P>
The National Socialist state must make certain that by a suitable education of youth it will someday obtain a race ripe for the last and greatest decisions on this earth. . . .<P>
. . .[A]nyone who wants to cure this era, which is inwardly sick and rotten, must first summon the courage to make clear the causes of this disease. And this should be the concern of the National Socialist movement: pushing aside all narrowmindedness, to gather and to organize from the ranks of our nation those forces capable of becoming the vanguard fighters for a new philosophy of life. . . .<P>
We are not simple enough to believe that it could ever be possible to bring about a perfect era. But this relieves no one of the obligation to combat recognized errors, to overcome weaknesses, and to strive for the ideal. Harsh reality of its own accord will create only too many limitations. For that very reason, however, man must try to serve the ultimate goal, and failures must not deter him, any more than he can abandon a system of justice because mistakes creep into it, or any more than medicine is discarded because there always will be sickness in spite of it.<P>
We National Socialists know that with this conception we stand as revolu-tionaries in the world of today and are branded as such. But our thoughts and actions must in no way be determined by the approval or disapproval of our time, but by the binding obligation to a truth which we have recognized.<code>&quot;</code>&lt;Adolf Hitler, Mein Kampf&gt;<P>
Hitler's opponents, Churchill and Roosevelt, were party politicians, with the minds and souls of party politicians. Great, impersonal goals, just as truth, meant nothing at all to them. The only thing that counted was the approval or disapproval of their times: the outcome of the next election, a good press claque, votes. Only Stalin shared in any way Hitler's disdain for approval; only Stalin was motivated to any degree by an impersonal idea. But the idea that Stalin served was the alien, destructive idea of Jewish Marxism. And while Hitler served the Life Force with the instincts of a seer, Stalin served Marxism with the instincts of a bureaucrat and a butcher.<P>
A comparison of careers leads us to a similar ranking of greatness of soul. Churchill and Roosevelt were born into the political establishment. They fed at the public trough for years, in one office after another, grabbing greedily at opportunities for a bigger serving of swill. But it was circumstance, not their own efforts, which thrust them onto the stage of world history. <P>
Stalin hacked out his own niche in history to a much greater extent than his western allies, and he was an incomparably stronger man than either of them. He was tough, ruthless, infinitely cunning, and utterly determined to prevail, no matter what the obstacles. Even so, his struggle for prominence and power was entirely within the Bolshevik party and its predecessors. He was the consummate bureaucratic infighter, not the innovator or the lone pioneer. <P>
Only Adolf Hitler started literally from nothing and through the exercise of a superhuman will created the physical basis for the realization of his vision. In 1918, recovering from a British poison-gas attack in a veterans' hospital, he made the decision to enter politics in order to serve that vision. He was a 29-year-old invalid, with no money, no family, no friends or connections, no university education, and no experience. Liberals, Jews, and communists ruled his country, making him and all those to whom he might appeal for support outsiders. <P>
Five and one-half years later he was sentenced to five years in prison for his political activity, and his enemies thought that was the end of him and his movement. But less than nine years after being sentenced he was Chancellor of Germany, with the strongest and most progressive nation in Europe at his command. He had built the National Socialist movement and led it to victory over the organized opposition of the entire Establishment: conservatives, liberals, communists, Jews, and Christians. <P>
He then transformed Germany, lifting it out of its economic depression (while Americans, under Roosevelt, continued to line up at the soup kitchens), restoring its spirit (and much of the territory which had been taken from it by the victors of the First World War), stimulating its artistic and scientific creativity, and winning the admiration (or, in some cases, the envy and hatred) of other nations. It was an achievement hardly paralleled in the history of the world. Even those who do not understand the real significance of his creation must concede that.<P>
And what was the real significance of Hitler's work? One of his most earnest admirers in India, Savitri Devi, has given us a poetic answer to that question. She wrote:<P>
<code>&quot;</code>. . . [I]n its essence, the National Socialist idea exceeds not only Germany and our times, but the Aryan race and mankind itself and any epoch; . . . it ultimately expresses that mysterious and unfailing wisdom according to which Nature lives and creates: the impersonal wisdom of the primeval forest and of the ocean depth and of the spheres in the dark fields of space; and .. . it is Adolf Hitler's glory not merely to have gone back to that divine wisdom -- stigmatizing man's silly infatuation for <code>&quot;</code>intellect,<code>&quot;</code> his childish pride in <code>&quot;</code>progress,<code>&quot;</code> and his criminal attempt to enslave Nature -- but to have made it the basis of a practical regeneration policy of worldwide scope, precisely now, in our overcrowded, overcivilized, and technically overevolved world, at the very end of the dark age.<code>&quot;</code>&lt;Savitri Devi, The Lightning and the Sun (National Socialist World No. 1, p. 61)&gt;    <P>
More prosaically, Hitler's work, in contrast to that of his contemporaries, was above politics, above economics, above nationalism. He had mobilized a powerful, modern state and placed it at the service of our race, so that our race might become fit to serve as an agent of the Life Force. <P>
Perceptive and idealistic young men from every nation in Europe -- and from many nations outside Europe as well -- recognized this significance, and they flocked to serve him and to fight for his cause, even at the cost of censure and ostracism from their more parochial and narrowminded countrymen. There was never before an elite fighting force to match the SS, which by the end of the Second World War had more non-Germans than Germans in it.<P>
The war, of course, is counted as Hitler's great failure, even as the proof of his lack of greatness, by his detractors. It merely proves that he was a man, not a god, even if a divine will worked through him, and that he could not perform miracles. He could not defend himself forever, with the governments of nearly the whole world allied in a total war to pull him down and destroy his creation, so that they and the interests they served could return to <code>&quot;</code>business as usual.<code>&quot;</code> Even so, he gave a far better account of himself than any of his adversaries.<P>
And what will count in the long run in determining Adolf Hitler's stature is not whether he lost or won the war, but whether it was he or his adversaries who were on the side of the Life Force, whether it was he or they who served the cause of Truth and human progress. We only have to look around us today to know it was not they.<P>

Here we are, losing battle after battle while we hope desperately that we will in the end, somehow, be able to win the war, if we can just do the right things.<P>
What are the right things for us to do?<P>
Well, we must understand where we are, where we have been, and where we want to go; we must formulate that understanding into as clear and cogent a message as possible and adapt the message to every feasible medium; and we must then propagate the message effectively enough to reach every person to whom it is relevant.<P>
These are the things being done now by the National Alliance and a few other -- pitifully few -- individuals and groups. <P>
These are absolutely necessary things, and if we were dealing with rational individuals, they would be sufficient for our purpose.<P>
The great majority of our people are not rational, however, nor do they function primarily as individuals, and so more is required than merely reaching them with our message. Most people function much more as members of groups or as elements in a social milieu than they do as individuals, and we must deal with them in this group or organizational context in order to be effective on a large scale.<P>
For the sake of concreteness: There are history professors who are quite capable of understanding our message -- through their own studies they have learned all the facts we have learned and are quite bright enough to interpret them correctly -- but they operate within a milieu which makes understanding dangerous and frightening to them. If they want to publish papers and advance their careers, they must conform their theses and their conclusions to the prejudices of their peers who edit the professional journals. If they want to be secure in their employment, they must conform what they teach in their classes to what their department heads and their deans consider Politically Correct. And if they want to keep their wives happy and be invited to the faculty parties, they must be careful what they say even in private to their closest friends, lest they violate the Great Taboo. A few of the more courageous and independent-minded professors may eschew the parties, keep Politically Incorrect books in their private libraries, and speak more or less freely with trusted intimates, but most will be so terrified of being unfashionable that they will censor even their own innermost thoughts.<P>
Likewise, there are intelligent and perceptive policemen who are exposed daily to the grimmest consequences of the government's racial, immigration, and welfare policies. Some of them are appalled by these policies and will go so far as to discuss the destructiveness of the government with their colleagues. Nearly all of them, however, will continue to enforce the government's laws for 40 hours each week. It is their job, and they need their paychecks.<P>
These social and organizational constraints are not new. They are inherent in our society, and to some degree in every society. Things may be a bit more highly organized and centralized today than they were 50 or 100 years ago, but the real difference is simply that the policies have changed: policy-making is much more in the hands of the fashion-setters today than it was in the past, and the latter are more Jewish.<P>
What this means is that disseminating our message to individuals can have only limited results. Only those individuals who are relatively rational and relatively free of organizational constraints will respond positively. <BR>
How many of these are there in our society? It's difficult to be precise, but probably not more than two or three per cent of the White population are sufficiently free to examine our message rationally and then to act on their reason. It is essential to reach these people, of course. It also is essential to reach the great majority who are not capable of responding positively to any unfashionable message: it is essential to reach them and to saturate them with facts and ideas, even though we know that their only reaction at this time will be fear and hostility.<P>
As mentioned above, however, this is not enough. It is necessary to do more. It is necessary to address the organizational aspects of our war. In order to win, we must be able to manipulate at least some of the organizational constraints under which most people function. <P>
Which is the better strategy for changing the way history is taught: to attempt to persuade each of thousands of professors that he should try to find courage and respect for truth, neither of which he has previously manifested, and defy the policy-makers of his profession -- or to replace a few dozen policy-makers?<P>
Which is the better way for changing the government's police apparatus from a force for evil into a force for good: to attempt to make each policeman individually do that which is contrary to his nature by rebelling against his appointed superiors -- or to change the interests and loyalties of a relative handful of superiors?<P>
The answers depend on the details. If the history department heads, journal editors, and police chiefs are all Jews, and the rank-and-file professors and cops are mostly our people, then only the first approach has any merit. This is the case with most of the mass media, for example, where there is no chance at all of changing the interests of the fashion-setters. Fortunately, among professors and cops the people at the top are far more open to persuasion. Even where substantial headway can be made at the top of a group, however, it remains necessary to saturate those at the bottom with our message: if professors discover one fine morning that it has become permissible for them to sing a new tune in class, they must at least be familiar with the new lyrics.<P>
The degree of centralization of authority in a group is an important factor in the dynamics of change: the more highly centralized an organization, the greater the leverage which can be had by persuading a policy-maker -- but also the closer to the top one must get in order for the leverage to be effective. The Army is an example of a highly centralized organization, where in theory all policy comes from the commander in chief; in practice, however, a few highly placed command personnel working together may be able to cut the chain of command above themselves. The Army also is an example of an organization in which the only possibility for redirection lies at or near the top.<P>
The foregoing analysis is self-evident, even if it is sometimes overlooked. Less evident are the specific ways in which we should address the organizational aspects of our problem. How do we begin to gain effective organizational leverage while continuing to build the means for disseminating our basic message to the rank and file of our people everywhere?<P>
Let's look at a few general truths which should guide any organizational approach.<P>
First, any alternative presented to policy-makers must be self-evidently viable. Policy-makers are a bit more intelligent and substantially better endowed with self-discipline than the rank and file, but they are not notably more courageous or less superstitious. In fact, they are more often terrified by the thought of being unfashionable than are their organizational inferiors, because they have more to lose. This means that our alternative must be one which already has been pounded into their consciousness -- and the consciousness of the rank and file as well -- until they are sufficiently familiar with it that they can at least be persuaded that it could become the new fashion.<BR>
 <BR>
When the New World Order policy of <code>&quot;</code>free<code>&quot;</code> trade was being hotly debated a few months ago -- debated even though it already had been declared de rigueur by the fashion-setters -- its vocal opponents in the Congress drew their courage from their knowledge that many of their constituents actively opposed the policy. Had there not been strong grass-roots opposition to NAFTA, based on the understanding by ordinary workers that it meant exporting their jobs to Mexico, the legislators would have found neither the courage nor the sense of responsibility to oppose it on their own. As it was, opposition to <code>&quot;</code>free<code>&quot;</code> trade seemed that it might be a viable alternative to the fashion insisted on by the New World Order crowd, even though the latter eventually prevailed.<P>
Second, anyone who wants policy-makers to switch brands must be prepared to offer compensation. Policy-makers are at least as selfish and materialistic as the masses. Any plan which counts on their being persuaded to take actions which are both unfashionable and self-sacrificing is certain to fail. <P>
Every lobbyist understands this. He does not try to persuade a legislator that a particular policy is right; he tries instead to show that it is in the legislator's personal interest to support the policy. Of course, it usually is money which talks in such matters. Many policy-makers have other than monetary interests, however. Some even have the foresight to understand that the policies they have been supporting will not continue to be tenable in the long run. Others are susceptible to being persuaded of this, especially as the disastrous effects of current policies become more manifest. In each case what is needed is a credible argument that a policy-maker, whether he be a university dean or a general in the Pentagon, can better his personal position in the long run by backing a new policy which happens to be unfashionable at the moment. <P>
Usually the current power structure has the advantage in handing out carrots to reward policy-makers for falling in line with current fashion. The recent effort by the Clintonistas to push <code>&quot;</code>free<code>&quot;</code> trade and the <code>&quot;</code>assault rifle<code>&quot;</code> ban through the Congress provided dozens of examples of the buying of policy switches with government money: a brother-in-law given a sinecure on a trade <code>&quot;</code>advisory panel<code>&quot;</code> in return for a <code>&quot;</code>yes<code>&quot;</code> vote on NAFTA; a promise of a contract to build 300 midnight basketball courts in a Congressman's district in return for backing the <code>&quot;</code>crime<code>&quot;</code> bill. The labor unions and the National Rifle Association just didn't have as many carrots. <P>
As the moral authority and prestige of the government continue to decline along with its organizational effectiveness, however, the government's carrots will lose some of their lustre and credibility. Bill Clinton is doing a great service for the American people in this regard. And as government prestige declines, so does the prestige of other organizations supporting the same policies.<P>
Third, the carrot should be accompanied by a credible stick. A policy-maker should be made to believe that the danger to himself in sticking with the old fashion is greater than the danger in switching to the new. Probably not too much should be said about this aspect of organizational work, except to note that as the power to reward grows, so does the power to punish.<P>
The above considerations, applied to formal organizational structures such as university administrations and armies, may seem more theoretical than practical at this time. About all that we can really do now, relevant to these general guidelines, is continue building the means to disseminate our message more widely and more effectively.<P>
What applies to formal structures in this regard also applies to informal structures, however, and some of them may be more accessible. An informal structure exists wherever there is a policy-maker or fashion-setter and a group of people who follow his policy or adopt his fashion: a popular but independent church minister and his congregation, a media idol or rock star and his or her fans, even a very successful and popular businessman/<code>&quot;</code>society<code>&quot;</code> leader in a community and his following of yuppies who also want to be rich and popular. All that is required is a bond between policy-maker and followers which is stronger than, or at least not much weaker than, that between the followers and other guides to belief and behavior in their lives.<P>
Whether one is dealing with a formal, highly centralized structure or a very loose and informal organization, the goal is leverage. Instead of focusing all of his efforts on persuading the rank and file to change their policies, the good strategist may direct a portion of his effort toward the established policy-makers.<P>
An excellent example of the application of this principle is provided by the Jews' neutralization of the mainline Christian churches after the Second World War. To be sure, the Christian churches hadn't been a real impediment to the Jews since the Spanish Inquisition went into retirement. Even before the war many Christian leaders were making a career out of playing up to the Jews, and members of the more primitive Protestant sects were practically worshipping them, as <code>&quot;</code>God's Chosen People.<code>&quot;</code> Nevertheless, there were annoying clashes occasionally, as Christians reacted negatively to Jewish efforts to commercialize sex in films, or as some latter-day crusader railed against Jewish promotion of the White-slave trade. <P>
There were even cases of Christian leaders speaking out against Jewish subversion of American economic and political affairs: an example was Father Charles Coughlin, whose immensely popular radio broadcasts in the 1930s exposing the leading Jewish role in Communism were a major headache for Jews. Eventually the Roman Catholic hierarchy ordered Coughlin to hold his tongue, but it was not soon enough for the Jews, and they decided to eliminate the possibility of any more cannons breaking loose on Christian decks.<P>
The Jews did not accomplish this solely by attempting to persuade the Christian masses that Jews were above all criticism -- although their postwar <code>&quot;</code>Holocaust<code>&quot;</code> propaganda certainly helped in that regard. More to the point, they did not neutralize Christendom primarily by attacking Christian leaders or Christian doctrine, or by attempting to persuade individual Christians to abjure their religious beliefs. Instead the Jews directed their principal effort toward Christian policy-makers: pontiffs, theologians, leading radio evangelists, and the politician-buinessman-bureaucrat hybrids who had risen to the top of the various Protestant denominations. <P>
The Jews gave them propositions they couldn't refuse: in part because the Christian leadership already was morally debilitated to a large degree, in part because the carrots and sticks held out to them were impressive, and in part because the alternative fashion offered -- Jews can do no wrong and must never be criticized or held accountable -- already was implicit in much of what Christians accepted as holy writ. (In Deuteronomy 28, for example, one reads of the covenant between the Jews and their god: <code>&quot;</code>The Lord thy God will set thee on high above all the goyim. . . . The Lord will establish thee an Holy People unto himself . . . and the goyim . . . shall be afraid of thee.<code>&quot;</code>) It was a manifestly viable alternative to the old Christian fashion Jews wanted buried: namely, the fashion according to which Jews rejected the salvation offered by Jesus and then killed him, and so are forever a race of outsiders who should be regarded with distrust.<P>
Among the carrots offered were expense-paid trips to the <code>&quot;</code>Holy Land<code>&quot;</code> (after 1948), noisily publicized B'nai B'rith awards for <code>&quot;</code>brotherhood,<code>&quot;</code> and favorable media treatment. The media carrot could give a semi-literate, fifth-rate Christian pamphleteer with a drinking problem the public image of a modern-day Thomas Aquinas, if he took the desired positions on matters of interest to the Jews.<P>
A very credible stick was a guarantee of problems with a church's tax exemption.<P>
The strategy was resoundingly successful. With a little prodding, leading Catholic and Protestant theologians began re-examining the sacred writings of their churches, and, lo! -- the scales fell from their eyes! The Jews hadn't been responsible for the death of Jesus after all, they suddenly realized. It was the Romans, not the Jews, who had done it, they proclaimed, despite the unanimous account given by the Gospels. Actually, there was a little disagreement on the verdict for a while, with the more literal-minded theologians putting the blame solely on the Romans and the modernist theologians saying instead, <code>&quot;</code>No, we are all guilty,<code>&quot;</code> but on one thing the theologians were in complete agreement: the poor, long-suffering, inoffensive Jews were merely innocent bystanders and must not be blamed at all. <P>
The Catholic Pope announced that Christians who held to the old fashion and continued to regard the Jews as Christ-killers were guilty of a grave sin, while the pooh-bahs of the largest U.S. Lutheran grouping (the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America) ritually excommunicated the founder of their own church, because four centuries earlier he had written that the Blameless Ones not only hated Christ but that they also had an inborn hatred of all mankind, coupled with a deceitfulness which made them so dangerous that they ought not to be tolerated in civilized society.<P>
From the shepherds the word on the new policy toward the Jews went down to all of the Christian sheep, and the dissent was minimal. Of course, not all Catholics were pleased with the transformation of their church's doctrines and practices (not just its policy toward Jews) effected by the Second Vatican Council in the early 1960s, and a few schismatics were heard rumbling in the background for a decade or more. Likewise, there were a few excessively independent Protestants who failed to fall into line immediately: one Southern Baptist potentate as late as the 1970s announced, in accord with the doctrine his church always had accepted, that Jews, as non-believers, could not be admitted into the Christian heaven. Needless to say, his colleagues fell on him like a ton of bricks for this bit of <code>&quot;</code>Juden 'raus<code>&quot;</code> theology, and soon he was back-pedaling as fast as he could.<P>
Today the conquest is virtually complete. A few years ago some backward Christians protested the profane image of their savior presented by Hollywood in The Last Temptation of Christ, but their protest was considered very unfashionable by the Christian establishment, and the veiled hints of <code>&quot;</code>anti-Semitism<code>&quot;</code> detected in some of the statements of the protesters were roundly denounced. Now Jews produce film after film which blatantly mocks the beliefs of Christian viewers: not only is there no protest, but the viewers laugh on cue.<BR>
 <BR>
If instead of first subverting the leaders of Christendom the Jews had tried during the 1940s and 1950s to wean rank-and-file Christians away from their faith through similar mockery, there would have been a reaction from Christian leaders and laymen alike which would have made the hundreds of thousands of <code>&quot;</code>Holocaust survivors<code>&quot;</code> in America yearn for the good, old days under Hitler.<P>
The organizational strategy has been an appropriate one for the Jews, and it is equally appropriate for any group whose members constitute only a small minority of the population they want to persuade, and so need the advantage of leverage in order to accomplish their task.<P>

<H1>The Swastika</H1>

<I>We have received a number of inquiries about the Swastika, why it was adopted, and what it symbolizes for National Socialism. The following is a brief commentary on the subject which we hope will clear up any confusion and explain the significance of the Swastika: Most people assume that it was Adolf Hitler who selected the Swastika for the National Socialist emblem. Adolf Hitler indeed designed the National Socialist flag and much of the insignia, but the Swastika was already earmarked for the party standard before he became a member of the German Worker's Party (DAP).</I><P>

<IMG Align=Right SRC="../images/haken.gif" HSpace=10 VSpace=0><BR>

In 1919 Adolf Hitler was serving as an agent for the army, observing various nationalist and Folkish political parties, when he decided to join the German Worker's Party (DAP), which later became the National Socialist German Worker's Party (NSDAP). Although not well known, there was a very good reason for his decision to join this particular party. The German Worker's Party was founded, protected, and secretly financed by the Thule Gemeinschaft, referred to henceforth by its common English rendering of Thule Society, which was considered to be the most prestigious and powerful secret Folkish organization in Germany.<P>
<B>The Thule Society</B><P>
The Thule society was a strongly anti-Jewish, anti-Marxist, Nordicist organization, which was dedicated to the creation of a Folkish State and the higher evolution of the Aryan race. They had a real understanding of the gulf between the working and the upper classes - and the necessity of closing that gap in order to realize the desired Folkish State. Its membership numbered a wide range of influential legal professionals, university professors, police officials, industrialists, physicians and scientists. Besides the German Worker's Party, The Thule Society subsidized the Oberland Freikorps and it controlled Bavaria's leading anti-Jewish newspaper; The Voelkischer Beobachter. It is quite revealing that Dietrich Eckart, Alfred Rosenberg, and Max Amann, who later became editor, assistant editor, and business manager of the VoelkischerBeobachter when it was sold to the NSDAP, were all Thule Society members.<P>
The Swastika was the official symbol of the Thule Society. The Swastika was prominently displayed on the organization's letterheads and literature, and Swastika banners adorned its meetings. The NSDAP merely inherited the Swastika from its mentor, which, apparently, it ultimately absorbed as Thule Society members all became NSDAP members.<P>
<B>The Meaning of the Swastika</B><P>
The only official reference to the meaning of the National Socialist Swastika which we have encountered is in Chapter 7 of the 2nd volume of Mein Kampf: &quot;As National Socialists we see our program in our flag. In the red, we see the social idea of the movement, in the white, the nationalistic idea, in the Swastika, the mission of the struggle for the victory of Aryan man, and at the same time, also the victory of the idea of creative work, which in itself is, and will always be, anti-Semitic.&quot; This, of course, is probably only one aspect of a deeper meaning which was given to the Swastika, but we have never encountered reference to any such deeper meaning given by the Thule Society or the NSDAP. However, an investigation of some of the historical and esoteric uses of The Swastika certainly gives us some insight into its significance.<BR>
Most of us are aware that the Swastika is a sacred symbol in many lands and in many traditions. However, since the Thule Society was a Folkish Movement, and radically Nordicist, we can certainly assume that they would have derived the Swastika from Germanic traditions, either historical, or perhaps even pseudo-historical or mystical.<P>
<B>19th Century Runic Mysticism</B><P>
Any investigation of Runes (the Germanic Swastika is considered Runic) needs to take into account that during the 19th century there were a few self-styled Runelorers who put some spurious mystical interpretations to the Runes of old. Much of this questionable information is still published today (often by Jews and Jew-in-laws who have become the &quot;new-age&quot; Runelorers and Rune magicians). The National Socialist Party, which was an ardent Folk-movement, incorporated a few Runes into its uniform insignia. Unfortunately, they accepted some of these unsubstantiated meanings of the 19th century Runelorers. For instance, the so-called &quot;Life Rune,&quot; which, among other things, adorned the Hitlerjugend uniforms, was a 19th century reinterpretation of the greatly misinterpreted Akiz Rune. Turning the &quot;Life Rune&quot; upside down, some19th century Runelorer created the &quot;Death Rune&quot; (this is seen nowadays encircled and rather ironically dubbed the &quot;Peace Symbol&quot;)! There is, however, no historical evidence to back up these 19th century interpretations of the Akiz Rune. It is possible that the Swastika may also have been adopted for a similarly spurious, and hence now long forgotten, meaning.<P>
<B>The Symbol of the Sun</B><P>
Savitri Devi, the well-known National Socialist writer and philosopher, interprets the Swastika as a symbol for the sun, and there was evidently some use of it as such by at least one National Socialist artist. However, we know of no historical reference to it as a Germanic sun symbol, although some sources do believe that it could be derived from the well-known Germanic Sunwheel. It is possible that her interpretation is Indo-Aryan, or perhaps even from 19th century rune lore. Nevertheless, a symbol of the sun is reasonably appropriate for a Folkish organization: the sun shining through the darkness, bringing about regeneration and new life.<P>
<B>The Hammer of Thor</B><P>
Historically, the Germanic Swastika symbolized a swirling thunderbolt: a symbol for the famed hammer of Thor, long regarded as the greatest weapon against evil. Moreover, Thor is remembered as the most beloved Germanic God who uses his hammer to battle the deadly World Serpent. In National Socialist political allegory, the World Serpent was sometimes used to symbolize World Jewry. Hence, the mighty Hammer of Thor would be a fitting, and historically valid, deeper meaning for the National Socialist Swastika.<P>
<B>A Symbol of Mystical Power?</B><P>
Adherents of the politically-correct neo-pagan movement assure us that the Swastika is a symbol which has great mystical power, and that Adolf Hitler - no doubt in league with some sorcerer - tried to use it to obtain world domination. However, they happily add that the world was saved because he mistakenly turned it the wrong way, thereby bringing destruction on himself and Germany, rather than the victory which the opposite direction would have guaranteed. The Swastika to which they are referring is the Indo-Aryan Swastika of Saivism (a Tantric symbol), and we have often amused ourselves by pointing out to these same pseudo-pagans that this Swastika is rendered in exactly the same direction as the one which adorns the NSDAP banner! The Indo-Aryan Swastika is very ancient, and it comes from a common origin with that of Germanic traditions. It symbolizes the movement of evolutionary energy in the spine. We might note here that the Thule Society, especially Dietrich Eckart and Alfred Rosenberg, delved deeply into the esoteric rites of our pre-Christian Forefathers, with emphasis on higher evolution and a Superhuman Species. Considering the likelihood that the Thule Society was aware of its common origin, it is even possible that they adopted the Swastika for its Indo-Aryan significance.<P>
<B>The Symbol for Wotanism</B><P>
Wotanism, our spiritual heritage, is higher evolution by self effort, and for this, the Swastika is the most fitting symbol. Higher evolution is the greatest creative and regenerative force on this earth, and it is indeed the only thing which guarantees victory in our struggle against domination by World Jewry (thereby &quot;anti-semitic&quot;), and for the &quot;victory of the idea of creative work&quot; and the &quot;victory of the struggle of Aryan man.&quot; (We might note here that whether we consider the Swastika to represent the sun, the Hammer of Thor, or the energy of higher evolution, it still cover the definition from Mein Kampf!). The ultimate goal of the Thule Society, National Socialist Germany, and Wotanism was, and is, the Superhuman Species, which is, of course, the ultimate victory of all creative work and of Aryan man, and which is rightfully symbolized by the Swastika.<P>
The Swastika is the most sacred symbol of our Folk (and as well, of all mankind who strive to live in harmony with Nature). Never flaunt it! Never render it with specious words or with thoughtless, childish racial slurs! Keep it sacred and singular by sheltering it from the eyes of mankind's enemies until the day comes when all will gaze on it with honor and reverence!<P>

<H1>A tribal affair</H1>

In addition to the newspapers they publish for the goyim to read, Jews have a number of publications intended to be read only by other Jews. From the latter there is a wealth of insight into the Jewish psyche to be gained.<P>

Some of the stories in these intramural Jewish publications are really interesting; others are merely bizarre, seeming almost to be about creatures of an entirely different species from us. A story which appeared in the August 2 edition of the Jewish Chronicle (London) last year falls into both categories. The story begins: <code>&quot;</code>Police were called to Stamford Hill, the heart of the strictly Orthodox community in London, during the weekend, when bricks were hurled at a house, a car was attacked by a crowd armed with metal bars, and a family was forced to leave its home. <P>

Police reports said over 100 people were involved in disturbances on Saturday and Sunday nights. The violence flared during demonstrations by strictly Orthodox Jews against the sentencing of 18-year-old Stamford Hill resident Eli Cohen for indecent assault against a five-year-old girl. <code>&quot;</code>Well, you must be thinking, obviously these intensely religious Jews were upset that someone had molested a five-year-old Jewish girl.<P>

They presumably were angry because the child molester wasn't given strict enough punishment for his crime. Wrong. The Jews were furious for two reasons: First, that charges were brought against a Jew for something that Orthodox Jews do not regard as a crime. Second, that the little girl's parents had committed the unforgivable sin of mesira by reporting the rape of their daughter to the Gentile authorities. <P>

The Talmud, the authoritative compilation of commentary on Jewish oral law, prescribes death for a moser, a Jew who gives evidence against another Jew to a non-Jew. <P>

The Jewish Chronicle article continues: <code>&quot;</code>Trouble started early on Friday evening when a brick smashed a window at the home of the girl's family, who cannot be named for legal reasons. <P><P>
As Shabbat [i.e., the Sabbath, Saturday] ended the father of the family was warned that demonstrations were likely. His wife left the house and drove away, keeping in touch with her husband by car phone. <code>&quot;</code>I was in the car, together with two daughters of a family friend, when a large number of men stopped cars in front of me and behind me and then took metal bars to try to smash the windows, <code>&quot;</code> the mother said. <P>

Police rescued the mother and at the same time were attempting to control over 100 demonstrators, mostly young men, who were shouting abuse and threatening violence outside the family's home. Eggs were thrown at police officers and a number of arrests were made, although no one was charged. 
<P>
Demonstrators then mounted a picket outside Stoke-Newington Police Station until almost 3 AM. One man who witnessed the demonstration outside the family's home said: <code>&quot;</code>The street was crammed solid with people. The crowd were chanting `moiser' and `get out of town.' <code>&quot;</code>Other witnesses said that during the protest men and women had maintained religious separation. The men stood in front of the house and the women stood to the side. <P>

By Sunday both the parents were understood to be in a safe house outside of Stamford Hill, and there was a visible police presence in the area.... A notice was displayed in local synagogues making it clear that police intended to take a firm line in any further demonstration. <P>

If the same story, related so matter-of-factly in the Jewish Chronicle, had been printed in the Times or any other publication for Gentiles the Jews would have screamed about <code>&quot;</code>anti-Semitism<code>&quot;</code> and denied that the incident even happened. <P>

A few Gentile readers might have been aghast that Jews who lived in the same city with them had attempted to murder a Jewish family for reporting the rape of their five-year-old daughter by another Jew, but most readers simply wouldn't be able to comprehend it. They wouldn't be able to believe that Jews really are that alien, because Christian apologists for the Jews have been telling us for so long that Jews are just like us, except they have a different religion.<P>

<H1>The Talmud: Judaism's holiest book documented and exposed </H1>

<B>&copy;1994 by The Old Order Brotherhood. All Rights Reserved</B><BR>
<BR>
The Talmud is Judaism's holiest book. Its authority takes precedence over the Old Testament in Judaism. Evidence of this may be found in the Talmud itself, Erubin 21b (Soncino edition): &quot;My son, be more careful in the observance of the words of the Scribes than in the words of the Torah (Old Testament).&quot;<P>
The supremacy of the Talmud over the Bible in the Israeli state may also be seen in the case of the Black Ethiopian Jews. Ethiopians have more knowledge of the Old Testament than the Israelis.<P>
However, their religion is so ancient it pre-dates the Scribes Talmud, of which they have no knowledge. According to the N.Y. Times of Sept. 29, 1992, p.4: &quot;The problem is that Ethiopian Jewish tradition goes no further than the Bible or Torah; the later Talmud and other commentaries that form the basis of modern traditions never came their way.&quot; Because they don't traffic in Talmudic traditions, the Black Ethiopians are discriminated against and have been forbidden to perform marriages, funerals and other services in the Israeli state.<P>
Rabbi Joseph D. Soloveitchik is regarded as one of the most influential rabbis of the 20th century, the &quot;unchallenged leader&quot; of Orthodox Judaism and the top international authority on halakha (Jewish religious law). Soloveitchik was responsible for instructing and ordaining more than 2,000 rabbis, &quot;an entire generation&quot; of Jewish leadership.<P>
N.Y. Times religion reporter Ari Goldman described the basis of the rabbis authority: &quot;Soloveitchik came from a long line of distinguished Talmudic scholars...Until his early 20s, he devoted himself almost exclusively to the study of the Talmud...He came to Yeshiva University's Elchanan Theological Seminary where he remained the pre-eminent teacher in the Talmud...He held the title of Leib Merkin professor of Talmud...sitting with his feet crossed in front of a table bearing an open volume of the Talmud.&quot; (N.Y. Times, April 10, 1993, p. 38).<P>
Nowhere does Goldman refer to Soloveitchiks knowledge of the Bible as the basis for being one of the top world authorities on Jewish law. The rabbis credentials are predicated upon his mastery of the Talmud. All other studies are clearly secondary. Britains Jewish Chronicle of March 26, 1993 states that in religious school (yeshiva), Jews are &quot;devoted to the Talmud to the exclusion of everything else.&quot;<P>
The Scribes claim the Talmud is partly a collection of traditions Moses gave them in oral form. These had not yet been written down in Jesus time. Christ condemned the traditions of the Mishnah (early Talmud) and those who taught it (Scribes and Pharisees), because it nullified Biblical teachings.<P>
The famous warning of Our Lord about the tradition that voids Scripture (cf. Mark 7:13), which is regularly used against Catholicism by Protestants, is actually a direct reference to the Talmud or more properly, the forerunner of the first part of it, the Mishnah, which existed in oral form during Christ*s lifetime, before being committed to writing. All of Mark chapter 7, from verse one through thirteen, represents Our Lord*s pointed condemnation of the Mishnah.<P>
Unfortunately, due to the abysmal ignorance of our day, the widespread Christian notion is that the Old Testament is the supreme book of Judaism. But this is not so. The Pharisees teach for doctrine the commandments of rabbis, not God; the Talmudic commentary on the Bible is their supreme law and not the Bible itself. That commentary does indeed, as Jesus said, void the laws of God, not uphold them. As a reader of Talmud (in the rabbinically authorized Soncino version) I know this to be true.<P>
There is a small Jewish sect which makes considerable effort to eschew Talmud and adhere to the Old Testament alone. These are the Karaites, a most hated and severely persecuted group within Judaism.<P>
To the Mishnah the rabbis later added the Gemara (rabbinical commentaries). Together these comprise the Talmud. There are two versions, the Jerusalem Talmud and the Babylonian Talmud. The Babylonian Talmud is regarded as the authoritative version: &quot;The authority of the Babylonian Talmud is also greater than that of the Jerusalem Talmud. In cases of doubt the former is decisive.&quot; (R.C. Musaph-Andriesse, From Torah to Kabbalah: A Basic Introduction to the Writings of Judaism, p. 40).<P>
This study is based on the Jewish-authorized, English translation of the Babylonian Talmud: the Soncino edition. Every selection we cite is documented directly from the text of the authoritative Soncino Talmud. We have published herein the authenticated sayings of the Jewish Talmud. Look them up for yourself. To verify the Talmud passages cited, refer to the Soncino edition Talmud, which may be found in large university and seminary libraries. The Soncino Talmud may also be purchased from book dealers.<P>
Translations: The translators of the Talmud sometimes translate the Hebrew word goyim (Gentiles) under any number of terms such as heathen, Cuthean, Egyptian, idolater etc. But these are actually references to Gentiles (all non-Jews). See for example footnote 5 of the Soncino edition Talmud: Cuthean (Samaritan) was here substituted for the original goy... Christians are sometimes referred to by the code word Min or Minim.<P>
It is the standard disinformation practice of the Pharisees to deny the existence of the following Talmudic scriptures and to claim they are the fabrications of &quot;anti-Semites.&quot; This disinformation can only obtain cachet among those too lazy to go to the English-language books of the Talmud and look these passages up for themselves. Hebrew University Professor emeritus Israel Shahak in his monumental 1994 work, &quot;Jewish History, Jewish Religion&quot; (London:Pluto Press), has confirmed the malice and racism contained in Talmud.<P>
Like the courageous Prof. Shahak, we publish the following educational material in the hope of liberating people, both Jewish and non-Jewish, from the superstitions, hate-mongering and barbarities of Talmud. The implementation of Talmudic philosophy has caused untold suffering throughout history and now in occupied Palestine it is used as a justification for the mass murder of Palestinian civilians.<P>
Some Teachings of the Talmud Erubin 21b. Whosoever disobeys the rabbis deserves death and will be punished by being boiled in hot excrement in hell.<P>
Moed Kattan 17a . If a Jew is tempted to do evil he should go to a city where he is not known and do the evil there.<P>
Non-Jews are Not Human Baba Mezia 114a-114b. Only Jews are human (&quot;Only ye are designated men&quot;). Also see Kerithoth 6b under the sub-head, &quot;Oil of Anointing&quot; and Berakoth 58a in which Gentile women are designated animals (&quot;she-asses&quot;).<P>
Jews are Divine Sanhedrin 58b. If a heathen (Gentile) hits a Jew, the Gentile must be killed. Hitting a Jew is the same as hitting God.<P>
O.K. to Cheat Non-Jews Sanhedrin 57a . A Jew need not pay a Gentile (&quot;Cuthean&quot;) the wages owed him for work.<P>
Jews Have Superior Legal Status Baba Kamma 37b. &quot;If an ox of an Israelite gores an ox of a Canaanite there is no liability; but if an ox of a Canaanite gores an ox of an Israelite...the payment is to be in full.&quot;<P>
Jews May Steal from Non-Jews Baba Mezia 24a . If a Jew finds an object lost by a Gentile (&quot;heathen&quot;) it does not have to be returned. (Affirmed also in Baba Kamma 113b).<P>
Sanhedrin 76a . God will not spare a Jew who &quot;marries his daughter to an old man or takes a wife for his infant son or returns a lost article to a Cuthean...&quot;<P>
Jews May Rob and Kill Non-Jews Sanhedrin 57a . When a Jew murders a Gentile (&quot;Cuthean&quot;), there will be no death penalty. What a Jew steals from a Gentile he may keep.<P>
Baba Kamma 37b. Gentiles are outside the protection of the law and God has &quot;exposed their money to Israel.&quot;<P>
Jews May Lie to Non-Jews Baba Kamma 113a. Jews may use lies (&quot;subterfuges&quot;) to circumvent a Gentile.<P>
Non-Jewish Children Sub-Human Yebamoth 98a. All Gentile children are animals.<P>
Abodah Zarah 36b . Gentile girls are in a state of niddah (filth) from birth.<P>
Abodah Zarah 22a-22b . Gentiles prefer sex with cows.<P>
Abodah Zarah 67b . &quot;The vessels of Gentiles, do they not impart a worsened flavor to the food cooked in them?&quot;<P>
Insults Against Blessed Mary Sanhedrin 106a . Says Jesus mother was a whore: &quot;She who was the descendant of princes and governors played the harlot with carpenters.&quot; Also in footnote #2 to Shabbath 104b it is stated that in the &quot;uncensored&quot; text of the Talmud it is written that Jesus mother, &quot;Miriam the hairdresser,&quot; had sex with many men.<P>
Gloats over Christ Dying Young A passage from Sanhedrin 106 gloats over the early age at which Jesus died: &quot;Hast thou heard how old Balaam (Jesus) was?-He replied: It is not actually stated but since it is written, Bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days it follows that he was thirty-three or thirty-four years old.&quot;<P>
Says Jesus was a Sorcerer Sanhedrin 43a . Says Jesus (&quot;Yeshu&quot; and in footnote #6, Yeshu &quot;the Nazarene&quot;) was executed because he practiced sorcery.<P>
Horrible Blasphemy of Our Lord Gittin 57a . Says Jesus ( see footnote #4) is being boiled &quot;hot excrement&quot;.<P>
Sanhedrin 43a . Jesus deserved execution: &quot;On the eve of the Passover, Yeshu was hanged...Do you suppose that he was one for whom a defense could be made? Was he not a Mesith (enticer)?&quot;<P>
Attacks Christians and their Books Rosh Hashanah 17a . Christians (&quot;minim&quot;) and others who reject the Talmud will go to hell and be punished there for all generations (see footnote #11 for the definition of minim).<P>
Sanhedrin 90a . Those who read the New Testament (uncanonical books, see footnote #9) will have no portion in the world to come.<P>
Shabbath 116a (p. 569). Jews must destroy the books of the Christians, i.e. the New Testament. See footnote #6.<P>
Israel Shahak reports that the Zionists burned hundreds of New Testament books in Occupied Palestine on March 23, 1980 (cf. Jewish History, Jewish Religion, p. 21).<P>
Sick and Insane Teachings Gittin 69a . To heal his flesh a Jew should take dust that lies within the shadow of an outdoor toilet, mix it with honey and eat it.<P>
Shabbath 41a. The law regulating the rule for how to urinate in a holy way is given.<P>
Yebamoth 63a. States that Adam had sexual intercourse with all the animals in the Garden of Eden.<P>
Yebamoth 63a . Declares that agriculture is the lowest of occupations.<P>
Sanhedrin 55b . A Jew may marry a three year old girl (specifically, three years &quot;and a day&quot; old).<P>
Sanhedrin 54b . A Jew may have sex with a child as long as the child is less than nine years old.<P>
Kethuboth 11b . &quot;When a grown-up man has intercourse with a little girl it is nothing.&quot;<P>

Abodah Zarah 17a. States that there is not a whore in the world that Rabbi Eleazar has not had sex with.<P>
Hagigah 27a . States that no rabbi can ever go to hell.<P>
Baba Mezia 59b. A rabbi debates God and defeats Him. God admits the rabbi won the debate.<P>
Gittin 70a . The Rabbis taught: &quot;On coming from a privy (outdoor toilet) a man should not have sexual intercourse till he has waited long enough to walk half a mile, because the demon of the privy is with him for that time; if he does, his children will be epileptic.&quot;<P>
Toilet and excrement obsessions are laced throughout Talmud and were exhibited in Spielberg*s Schindlers List where the Hollywood director shows a Jewish child jumping through a toilet seat in an outhouse and falling into a pool of liquefied excrement. There the child meets two other Jewish children partially immersed who inform the interloper that this cesspool is their hiding spot exclusively and that he must find his own. These are the kind of disgusting and morbid, psychotic images which Jewish kids are exposed to constantly in the cinematic liturgy of Holocaustianity and for that matter, in the Talmud as well.<P>
Gittin 69b (p. 329). To heal the disease of pleurisy (&quot;catarrh&quot;) a Jew should &quot;take the excrement of a white dog and knead it with balsam, but if he can possibly avoid it he should not eat the dogs excrement as it loosens the limbs.&quot;<P>
Pesahim 111a. It is forbidden for dogs, women or palm trees to pass between two men, nor may others walk between dogs, women or palm trees. Special dangers are involved if the women are menstruating or sitting at a crossroads.<P>
Menahoth 43b-44a . A Jewish man is obligated to say the following prayer every day: Thank you God for not making me a Gentile, a woman or a slave.<P>
Shabbath 86a-86b . Because Jews are holy they do not have sex during the day unless the house can be made dark. A Jewish scholar can have sex during the day if he uses his garment like a tent to make it dark.<P>
Tall Tales of a Roman Holocaust Here are two early &quot;Holocaust&quot; tales from the Talmud: Gittin 57b . Claims that four billion Jews were killed by the Romans in the city of Bethar. Gittin 58a claims that 16 million Jewish children were wrapped in scrolls and burned alive<P>
by the Romans. (Ancient demography indicates that there were not 16 million Jews in the entire world at that time, much less 16 million Jewish children or four billion Jews).<P>
A Revealing Admission Abodah Zarah 70a . The question was asked of the rabbi whether some wine stolen in Pumbeditha might be used or if it was defiled, due to the fact that the thieves might have been Gentiles (a Gentile touching wine would make the wine unclean). The rabbi says not to worry, that the wine is permissible for Jewish use because the majority of the thieves in Pumbeditha, the place where the wine was stolen, are Jews<P>
Pharisaic Rituals Erubin 21b (p. 150). &quot;Rabbi Akiba said to him, &quot;Give me some water to wash my hands.&quot; &quot;It will not suffice for drinking,&quot; the other complained, &quot;will it suffice for washing your hands?&quot; &quot;What can I do? the former replied, &quot;when for neglecting the words of the Rabbis one deserves death? It is better that I myself should die than that I transgress against the opinion of my colleagues.&quot;[This is the ritual hand washing condemned by Jesus in Matthew 15: 1-9].<P>
&quot;Great Rabbi&quot; Deceives A Woman Kallah 51a (Soncino Minor Tractates). Teaches that God approves of rabbis who lie: &quot;The elders were once sitting in the gate when two young lads passed by; one covered his head and the other uncovered his head. Of him who uncovered his head Rabbi Eliezer remarked that he is a bastard. Rabbi Joshua remarked that he is the son of a niddah (a child conceived during a womans menstrual period). Rabbi Akiba said that he is both a bastard and a son of a niddah. &quot;They said, &quot;What induced you to contradict the opinion of your colleagues?&quot; He replied, &quot;I will prove it concerning him.&quot; He went to the lads mother and found her sitting in the market selling beans. &quot;He said to her, &quot;My daughter, if you will answer the question I will put to you, I will bring you to the world to come.&quot; (eternal life). She said to him, &quot;Swear it to me.&quot; Rabbi Akiba, &quot;taking the oath with his lips but annulling it in his heart,&quot; said to her, &quot;What is the status of your son?&quot; She replied, &quot;When I entered the bridal chamber I was niddah (menstruating) and my husband kept away from me; but my best man had intercourse with me and this son was born to me.&quot; Consequently the child was both a bastard and the son of a niddah. It was declared, &quot;..Blessed be the God of Israel Who Revealed His Secret to Rabbi Akiba...&quot;<P>
In addition to the theme that God rewards clever liars the preceding discussion is actually about Christ (the lad who &quot;uncovered his head&quot;). The reference to the lad*s mother is of course to the mother of Jesus, Blessed Mary (called Miriam and sometimes, Miriam the hairdresser, in Talmud).<P>
Genocide Advocated by Talmud Minor Tractates. Soferim 15, Rule 10. This is the saying of Rabbi Simon ben Yohai: Tob shebe goyyim harog (&quot;Even the best of the Gentiles should all be killed&quot;).<P>
This passage is not from the Soncino edition but is from the original Hebrew of the Babylonian Talmud as quoted by the 1907 Jewish Encyclopedia, published by Funk and Wagnalls and compiled by Isidore Singer, under the entry, &quot;Gentile,&quot; (p. 617).<P>
This original Talmud passage has been concealed in translation. The Jewish Encyclopedia states that, &quot;...in the various versions the reading has been altered, The best among the Egyptians being generally substituted.&quot; In the Soncino version: &quot;the best of the heathens&quot; (Minor Tractates, Soferim 41a-b]. Israelis annually take part in a national pilgrimage to the grave of Simon ben Yohai, to honor this rabbi who advocated the extermination of non-Jews. (&quot;Jewish Press&quot; of June 9, 1989, p. 56B).<P>
On Purim, Feb. 25, 1994, Israeli army officer Baruch Goldstein, an orthodox Jew from Brooklyn, massacred 40 Palestinian civilians, including children, while they knelt in prayer in a mosque. Goldstein was a disciple of the late Rabbi Kahane who has stated that his view of Arabs as &quot;dogs&quot; is &quot;from the Talmud.&quot; (Cf. CBS &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, &quot;Kahane&quot;).<P>
Univ. of Jerusalem Prof. Ehud Sprinzak described Kahane and Goldsteins philosophy: &quot;They believe it's God's will that they commit violence against &quot;goyim,&quot; a Hebrew term for non-Jews.&quot; (NY Daily News, Feb. 26, 1994, p. 5).<P>
Rabbi Yitzhak Ginsburg declared, &quot;We have to recognize that Jewish blood and the blood of a goy are not the same thing.&quot; (NY Times, June 6, 1989, p.5). Rabbi Yaacov Perrin says, &quot;One million Arabs are not worth a Jewish fingernail.&quot; (NY Daily News, Feb. 28, 1994, p.6).<P>
Judeo-Christian Response to Talmud Neither the &quot;modern&quot; popes or the modern preachers of Protestantism, have ever insisted that the rabbis of Judaism repudiate or condemn the Talmud. On the contrary, the heads of &quot;Judeo-Churchianity&quot; have urged the followers of Christ to obey, honor and support the followers of the Talmud. Therefore, it should be obvious that &quot;Judeo-Churchianity&quot; is the worst betrayer of Jesus Christ on Earth today.<P>

<H1>What world famous men<BR> said about the Jews</H1>

<B>Introduction</B> <BR>
The Jews are the only people in the world who have found hostility in every country in which they settled in any numbers. The big question is - WHY?<P>
Today it is taught in the schools that &quot;Anti-Semitism&quot; began in Germany in the 1930s after which they were deported. What is not studied is the fact that at one time or other the Jews have been expelled from every nation in Europe! When the Jews first began to immigrate to America the early colonialists in New York, Charleston and Savannah tried to ban their entry. Benjamin Franklin pleaded with the members of the Continental Congress to enter a specific ban against Jewish immigration into the U. S. Constitution to bar them for all time to come.<P>
The Jews claim that they are &quot;only&quot; a religion. The truth is that the Jews are a RACE. Less than 30% are members of any Synagogue. Whether they are Orthodox religious, atheists, capitalists or communists - they still claim to be Jews - members of the Jewish race! Every race has inherited traits. In the case of the Jews they include trading, money-changing, usury, and a loathing for &quot;productive labor&quot; which is scorned as beneath the dignity of the Jews in their &quot;bible&quot; called &quot;THE TALMUD.&quot;<P>
The Jews have not changed since the days when Jesus Christ took up a whip and drove &quot;the money changers out of the Temple.&quot; Jews have always united to form monopolies. Today they control all the department store chains and speciality shops along with the lucrative jewelry and animal fur trade. Jews dominate the fields of all precious metals such as gold, silver, platinum, tin, lead, etc. They will always ban together to drive Gentile competitors out of business.<P>
Today America is being flooded with Jewish immigrants from Russia and even 20,000 per year leave Israel for the U. S. - all with dollar signs in their eyes. Jews have used their vaunted money-power to seize control of the Democratic Party and constitute over 50% of all its financial contributions. Today they are buying up more and more major U. S. companies. While only 3% of the population, the Jews control over 25% of the nation's wealth and this percentage rises every year. They are the only racial group totally organized to work for political domination over America.<P>
Opposition to the Jews did not begin in Germany but dates back before the birth of Christ over 2,000 years ago! Study the statements made by &quot;The world's greatest men.&quot; They reveal why the &quot;wandering Jews&quot; have made enemies out of every host country that ever accepted them.<P>
<B>CICERO (Marcus Tullius Cicero). First century B.C. Roman stateman, writer.</B><BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&quot;Softly! Softly! I want none but the judges to hear me. The Jews have already gotten me into a fine mess, as they have many other gentleman. I have no desire to furnish further grist for their mills.&quot; (Oration in Defense of Flaccus)</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
Cicero was serving as defense counsel at the trial of Flaccus, a Roman official who interfered with Jewish gold shipments to their international headquarters (then, as now) in Jerusalem. Cicero himself certainly was not a nobody, and for one of this stature to have to &quot;speak softly&quot; shows that he was in the presence of a dangerously powerful sphere of influence.<BR>
and on another occasion Cicero wrote:<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&quot;The Jews belong to a dark and repulsive force. One knows how numerous this clique is, how they stick together and what power they exercise through their unions. They are a nation of rascals and deceivers.&quot;<BR></BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>SENECA (Lucius Annaeus Seneca). First century Roman philosopher.</B><BR><BLOCKQUOTE> &quot;The customs of that most criminal nation have gained such strength that they have now been received in all lands. The conquered have given laws to the conquerors.&quot; (De Superstitione)</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<B>DIO CASSIUS. Second century Roman historian.</B> Describing the savage Jewish uprising against the Roman empire that has been acknowledged as the turning point downward in the course of that great state-form:<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&quot;The Jews were destroying both Greeks and Romans. They ate the flesh of their victims, made belts for themselves out of their entrails, and daubed themselves with their blood... In all, 220,000 men perished in Cyrene and 240,000 in Cyprus, and for this reason no Jew may set foot in Cyprus today.&quot; (Roman History)</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<B>DIODORUS SICULUS. First century Greek historian.</B>Observed that Jews treated other people as enemies and inferiors.<BLOCKQUOTE> &quot;Usury&quot; is the practice of lending money at excessive interest rates. This has for centuries caused great misery and poverty for Gentiles. It has brought strong condemnation of the Jews!</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<B>BERNARDINO OF FELTRO. 15th century Italian priest.</B> A mild man who extolled patience and charity in normal circumstances, he described himself as a &quot;barking dog&quot; when dealing with Jews: <BLOCKQUOTE>&quot;Jewish usurers bleed the poor to death and grow fat on their substance, and I who live on alms, who feed on the bread of the poor, shall I then be mute before outraged charity? Dogs bark to protect those who feed them, and I, who am feed by the poor, shall I see them robbed of what belongs to them and keep silent?&quot; (E. Flornoy, Le Bienbeureux Bernardin the Feltre)</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<B>AQUINAS, THOMAS, Saint. 13th century scholastic philosopher.</B> In his &quot;On the Governance of the Jews,&quot; he wrote: <BLOCKQUOTE>&quot;The Jews should not be allowed to keep what they have obtained from others by usury; it were best that they were compelled to worked so that they could earn their living instead of doing nothing but becoming avaricious.&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<B>HILAIARE BELLOC, in the book THE JEWS, page 9</B> <BLOCKQUOTE>&quot;There is already something like a Jewish monopoly in high finance ... There is the same element of Jewish monopoly in the silver trade, and in the control of various other metals, notably lead, nickel, quicksilver. What is most disquieting of all, this tendency to monopoly is spreading like a disease.&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<B>H. H. BEAMISH, in New York Speech, October 30, 1937</B> <BLOCKQUOTE>&quot;The Boer War occurred 37 years ago. Boer means farmer. Many criticized a great power like Britain for trying to wipe out the Boers. Upon making inquiry, I found all the gold and diamond mines of South Africa were owned by Jews; that Rothschild controlled gold; Samuels controlled silver, Baum controlled other mining, and Moses controlled base metals. Anything these people touch they inevitably pollute.&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<B>W.

<B>REV. GORDON WINROD, in his book The Keys to Christian Understanding, pages 114 - 115</B> <BLOCKQUOTE>&quot;Judaism does not know Jesus Christ. Judaism hates Jesus Christ. When St. Paul was in Judaism, before he was converted to Christianity, he hated Jesus Christ and persecuted Christians and Christianity.&quot;<BR>
Paul said: &quot;You have heard of my earlier career in Judaism - how furiously I persecuted the Church of God, and made havoc of it; and how in devotion to Judaism I out-stripped many men of may own age among my people, being far more zealous than they for the tradition of my forefathers.&quot; (Gal. 1:13, 14, Weymouth Translation)</BLOCKQUOTE>
While in Judaism, Paul persecuted Christians because of his intense hatred for Christians and because of his conformity to the tradition of the fathers. This shows that the tradition of teachings of Judaism are filled with hate for Christians.<BR>
Few people know of this because they do not carefully read their Scriptures and because of the great pains which Jews have take to deceive the Christians. Care has been exerted by the Jews to hide their ECONOMIC-POLITICAL conspiracy for complete world domination UNDER high sounding words that have a &quot;RELIGIOUS&quot; ring in the ears of Christians.<BR>
The Jews use such &quot;religious&quot; sounding words as &quot;the Jewish faith,&quot; &quot;the Jewish religion,&quot; &quot;Jewish spiritual values,&quot; &quot;Jewish religious doctrines,&quot; and like phrases which deceive and lead the unlearned into total equanimity.<BR>
Behind this mask of religiosity stands a complete plan for world government, world power, world conquest, a Jewish kingdom of this world, and the destruction of Christianity.<BR><BR>

<B>LUTHER, MARTIN. 16th century German religious reformer.</B><BLOCKQUOTE> &quot;They are the real liars and bloodhounds, who have not only perverted and falsified the entire Scriptures from beginning to end and without ceasing with their interpretations. And all of the anxious sighing, longing and hoping of their hearts is directed to the time when some day they would like to deal with us heathen as they dealt with the heathen in Persia at the time of Esther... On how they love the book of Esther, which so nicely agrees with their bloodthirsty, revengeful and murderous desire and hope. (1)<BR>
The sun never did shine on a more bloodthirsty and revengeful people as they, who imagine to be the people of God, and who desire to and think they must murder and crush the heathen. And the foremost undertaking which they expect of their Messiah is that he should slay and murder the whole world with the sword. As they at first demonstrated against us Christians and would like to do now, if they only could; have also tried it often and have been repeatedly struck on their snouts...<BR>
Their breath stinks for the gold and silver of the heathen; since no people under the sun always have been, still are, and always will remain more avaricious than they, as can be noticed in their cursed usury. They also find comfort with this: &quot;When the Messiah comes, He shall take all the gold and silver in the world and distribute it among the Jews. (2) Thus, wherever they can direct Scripture to their insatiable avarice, they wickedly do so.<BR>
Therefore know, my dear Christians, that next to the Devil, you have no more bitter, more poisonous, more vehement and enemy than a real Jew who earnestly desires to be a Jew. There may be some among them who believe what the cow or the goose believes. But all of them are surrounded with their blood and circumcision. In history, therefore, they are often accused of poisoning wells, stealing children and mutilating them; as in Trent, Weszensee and the like. Of course they deny this. Be it so or not, however, I know full well that the ready will is not lacking with them if they could only transform it into deeds, in secret or openly. (3)<BR>
A person who does not know the Devil, might wonder why they are so at enemity with the Christians above all others; for which they have no reason, since we only do good to them.<BR>
They live among us in our homes, under our protection, use land and highways, market and streets. Princes and government sit by, snore and have their maws open, let the Jews take from their purse and chest, steal and rob whatever they will. That is, they permit themselves and their subjects to be abused and sucked dry and reduced to beggars with their own money, through the usury of the Jews. For the Jews, as foreigners, certainly should have nothing from us; and what they have certainly must be ours. They do not work, do not earn anything from us, neither do we donate or give it to them. Yet they have our money and goods and are lords in our land where they are supposed to be in exile!<BR>
If a thief steals ten gulden he must hang; if he robs people on the highway, his head is gone. But a Jew, when he steals ten tons of gold through his usury is dearer than God himself!<BR>
Do not their TALMUD and rabbis write that it is no sin to kill if a Jew kills a heathen, but it is a sin if he kills a brother in Israel? It is no sin if he does not keep his oath to a heathen. Therefore, to steal and rob (as they do with their moneylending) from a heathen, is a divine service... And they are the masters of the world and we are their servants - yea, their cattle!<BR>
I maintain that in three fables of Aesop there is more wisdom to be found than in all the books of the Talmudists and rabbis and more than ever could come into the hearts of the Jews...<BR>
Should someone think I am saying too much - I am saying much too little! For I see in [their] writings how they curse us Goyim and wish as all evil in their schools and prayers. They rob us of our money through usury, and wherever they are able, they play us all manner of mean tricks... No heathen has done such things and none would to so except the Devil himself and those whom he possesses - as he possesses the Jews.<BR>
Burgensis, who was a very learned rabbi among them and by the grace of God became a Christian (which seldom occurs), is much moved that in their schools they so horribly curse us Christians (as Lyra also writes) and from that draws the conclusion that they must not be the people of God.<BR>
Now behold what a nice, thick, fat lie it is when they complain about being captives among us! Jerusalem was destroyed more than 1,400 years ago during that time we Christians have been tortured and persecuted by the Jews in all the world. On top of that, we do not know to this day what Devil brought them into our country. We did not fetch them from Jerusalem!... Yes, we have and hold them captive, as I would like to keep my rheumatism, and all other diseases and misfortunes, who must wait as a poor servant, with money and property and everything I have! I wish they were in Jerusalem with the other Jews and whomsoever they would like to have with them.<P>
 Now what are we going to do with these rejected, condemned Jewish people?... Let us apply the ordinary wisdom of other nations like France, Spain, Bohemia, et al., who made them give an account of what they had stolen through usury, and divided it evenly; but expelled them from their country;. For as heard before, God's wrath is so great over them that through soft mercy they only become more wicked, through hard treatment, however, only a little better. Therefore, away with them!<BR>
How much more unbearable it is that we should permit the entire Christendom and all of us to be bought with our own money, be slandered and cursed by the Jews, who on top of all that be made rich and our lords, who laugh us to scorn and are tickled by their audacity!<BR>
What a joyful affair that would be for the Devil and his angels, and cause them to laugh through their snouts like a sow grinning at her little pigs, but deserving real wrath before God. (From THE JEWS AND THEIR LIES)<BR>
Maybe mild-hearted and gentle Christians will believe that I am too rigorous and drastic against the poor, afflicted Jews, believing that I ridicule them and treat them with much sarcasm. By my word, I am far too weak to be able to ridicule such a satanic brood. I would fain to do so, but they are far greater adepts at mockery than I and possess a god who is master in this art. It is the Evil One himself.<BR>
Even with no further evidence than the Old Testament, I would maintain, and no person on earth could alter my opinion, that the Jews as they are today are veritably a mixture of all the depraved and malevolent knaves of the whole world over, who have then been dispersed in all countries, similarly to the Tartars, Gypsies and such folk.&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

In whatever country Jews have settled in any great number, they have lowered its moral tone; depreciated its commercial integrity; have segregated themselves and have not been assimilated; have sneered at and tried to undermine the Christian religion upon which that nation is founded, by objecting to its restrictions; have built up a state within the state; and when opposed have tried to strangle that country to death financially, as in the case of Spain and Portugal.<BR>
For over 1,700 years, the Jews have been bewailing their sad fate in that they have been exiled from their homeland, as they call Palestine. But gentlemen, did the world give it to them in fee simple, they would at once find some reason for not returning. Why? Because they are vampires, and vampires do not live on vampires. They cannot live only among themselves. They must subsist on Christians and other people not of their race.<BR>
If you do not exclude them from these United States, in their Constitution, in less than 200 years they will have swarmed here in such great numbers that they will dominate and devour the land and change our form of government, for which we Americans have shed our blood, given our lives our substance and jeopardized our liberty.<BR>
If you do not exclude them, in less than 200 years our descendants will be working in the fields to furnish them substance, while they will be in the counting houses rubbing their hands. I warn you, gentlemen, if you do not exclude Jews for all time, your children will curse you in your graves.<BR>

<B>WORLD FAMOUS MEN</B> of the past accused the Jews of founding Communism. This charge is well founded. The Communist philosopy was drawn up by Karl Marx who descended from a long line of Rabbis. His ideology of anti-Christian and Socialist thought is outlined in the Jewish &quot;TALMUD&quot; which is the &quot;bible&quot; of the Jews. Of the four political groups which overthrew the Christan Czar of Russia two were 100% Jewish. They were the Mensheviks and The Jewish Bund. The other two were the Socialist Revolutionary Party and the Bolsheviks. Both were headed by Jews but had some Gentile members. Today we now know that Lenin was Jewish and all of the leaders of his first government were Jews. They were Trotsky, Zinoviev, Kamenev and Sverdlow. The wealthiest Jewish banker in the world at that time, Jacob Schiff of Kuhn, Loeb investment bank of New York City, gave Trotsky and Lenin $20 million to overthrow the Czar and establish the Soviet tyranny (according to the &quot;NEW YORK JOURNAL-AMERICAN&quot; of February 3, 1949.)<BR><BR>
<B>CHURCHILL, WINSTON. 20th century British politician.</B> In 1920, he wrote a long newspaper article of the recent Bolshevik seizure of Russia. After praising what he called the &quot;national Jews&quot; of Russia, he said:<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&quot;In violent opposition to all this sphere of Jewish efforts rise the schemes of the International Jews. The adherents of this sinister confederacy are mostly men reared up among the unhappy populations of countries where Jews are persecuted on account of their race. Most, if not all, of them have forsaken the faith of their forefathers, and divorced from their minds all spiritual hopes of the next world. This movement among the Jews is not new. From the days of Spartacus-Weishaupt to those of Karl Marx, and down to Trotsky (Russia), Bela Kun (Hungary), Rosa Luxemburg (Germany), and Emma Goldman (United States), this world-wide revolutionary conspiracy for the overthrow of civilization and for the reconstitution of society on the basis of arrested development, of envious malevolence, and impossible equality, has been steadily growing. It played, as a modern writer, Mrs. Webster has ably shown, a definite recognizable part in the tragedy of the French Revolution. It has been the mainspring of every subversive movement during the Nineteenth Century; and now at last this band of extraordinary personalities from the underworlds of the great cities of Europe and America have gripped the Russian people by the hair of their heads and have become practically the undisputed masters of the enormous empire.<BR>
There is no need to exaggerate the part played in the creating of Bolshevism and in the actual bringing about of the Russian Revolution by these international and for the most part atheistic Jews. It is certainly the very great one; it probably outweighs all others. With the notable exception of Lenin, the majority of the leading figures are Jews. Moreover, the principal inspiration and driving power comes from the Jewish leaders... In the Soviet institutions the predominance of Jews is even more astounding. And the prominent if not the principal part in the system of terrorism applied by the extraordinary Commissions for combating Counter Revolution has been take by Jews, and in some notable cases by Jewesses. The same evil prominence was obtained by Jews in the brief period of terror during which Bela Kun ruled in Hungary. The same phenomenon has been presented in Germany (especially Bavaria), so far as this madness has been allowed to prey upon the temporary prostration of the German people. Although in all these countries there are many nonJews every whit as bad as the worst of the Jewish revolutionaries, the part played by the latter in proportion to their numbers in the population is astonishing.

Now this entire Jewish world, which constitutes an exploiting sect, a people of leeches, a voracious parasite, Marx feels an instinctive inclination and a great respect for the Rothschilds. This may seem strange. What could there be in common between communism and high finance? Ho ho! The communism of Marx seeks a strong state centralization, and where this exists there must inevitably exist a state central bank, and where this exists, there the parasitic Jewish nation, which speculates upon the labor of the people, will always find the means for its existence...<BR>
In reality, this would be for the proletariat a barrack regime, under which the workingmen and the working closely and intimately connected with one another, regarless not only of frontiers but of political differences as well - this Jewish world is today largely at the disposal of Marx or Rothschil. I am sure that, on the one hand, the Rothschilds appreciate the merits of Marx, and that on the other hand, women, converted into a uniform mass, would rise, fall asleep, work and live at the beat of the drum; the privilege of ruling would be in the hands of the skilled and the learned, with a wide scope left for profitable crooked deals carried on by the Jews, who would be attracted by the enormous extension of the international speculations of the national banks...

This startling piece of prediction is particularly impressive to those who have observed the Soviet scene and notice its strange relationship with capitalist financiers - overwhelmingly Jewish - since the revolution.

<B>GRANT, USYSSES S. 19th century American general, politician.</B> While in command of the 13th Army Corps, headquartered at Oxford, Mississippi, he became so infuriated at Jewish camp-followers attempting to penetrate the conquered territory that he finally attempted to expel the Jews:<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&quot;I have long since believed that in spite of all the vigilance that can be infused into post commanders, the special regulations of the Treasury Department have been violated, and that mostly by Jews and other unprincipled traders. So well satisfied have I been of this that I instructed the commanding officers at Columbus to refuse all permits to Jews to come South, and I have frequently had them expelled from the department, but they come in with their carpet-sacks in spite of all that can be done to prevent it. The Jews seem to be a privileged class that can travel anywhere. They will land at any woodyard on the river and make their way through the country. If not permitted to buy cotton themselves, they will act as agents for someone else, who will be at military post with a Treasury permit to receive cotton and pay for it in Treasury notes which the Jew will buy up at an agreed rate, paying gold. (Letters to C. P. Wolcott, assistant secretary of war, Washington, December 17, 1862)<BR>
1. The Jews, as a class, violating every regulation of trade established by the Treasury Department, and also Department orders, are hereby expelled from the Department.<BR>
2. Within twenty-four hours from the receipt of this order by Post Commanders, they will see that all of this class of people are furnished with passes and required to leave, and anyone returning after such notification, will be arrested and held in confinement until an opportunity occurs of sending them out as prisoners, unless furnished with permits from these headquarters.<BR>
3. No permits will be given these people to visit headquarters for the purpose of making personal application for trade permits.<BR>

<B>OLMSTED, GREDERICK LAW. 19th century American architect, historian.</B> <BLOCKQUOTE>&quot;A swarm of Jews has, within the last ten years, settled in every Southern town, many of them men of no character, opening cheap clothing and trinket shops, ruining or driving out of business many of the old retailers, and engaging in an unlawful trade with the simple Negroes, which is found very profitable. (The Cotton Kingdom. For other views on Jewish involvement in exploiting the South, see ULYSSES S. GRANT and MARK TWAIN.)</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<B>TWAIN, MARK (S. L. Clemens). 19th century American writer.</B> <BLOCKQUOTE>&quot;In the U.S. cotton states, after the war... the Jew came down in force, set up shop on the plantation, supplied all the Negroes' wants on credit, and at the end of the season was the proprietor of the Negro's share of the present crop and part of the next one. Before long, the whites detested the Jew. (1)<BR>
The Jew is being legislated out of Russia. The reason is not concealed. The movement was instituted because the Christian peasant stood no chance against his commercial abilities. The Jew was always ready to lend on a crop. When settlement day came, he owned the crop; the next year he owned the farm - like Joseph. (2)<BR>
In the England of John's time everybody got into debt to the Jew. He gathered all lucrative enterprises into his hands. He was the King of Commerce. He had to be banished from the realm. For like reasons, Spain had to banish him 400 years ago, and Austria a couple of centuries later.<BR>
In all ages Christian Europe has been obliged to curtail his activities. If he entered upon a trade, the Christian had to retire from it. If he set up as a doctor, he took the business. If he exploited agriculture, the other farmers had to get at something else. The law had to step in to save the Christian from the poor-house. Still, almost bereft of employments, he found ways to make money. Even to get rich. This history has a most sordid and practical commercial look. Religious prejudices may account for one part of it, bit not for the other nine.<BR>
Protestants have persecuted Catholics - but they did not take their livelihoods away from them. Catholics have persecuted Protestants - bit they never closed agriculture and the handicrafts against them. I feel convinced that the Crucifixion has not much to do with the world's attitude toward the Jew; that the reasons for it are much older than that event ...<BR>
I am convinced that the persecution of the Jew is not in any large degree due to religious prejudice. No, the Jew is a money-getter. He made it the end and aim of his life. He was at it in Rome. He has been at it ever since. His success has made the whole human race his enemy.<BR>
You will say that the Jew is everywhere numerically feeble. When I read in the Cyclopedia Britannica that the Jewish population in the United States was 250,000 I wrote the editor and explained to him that I was personally acquainted with more Jews than that, and that his figures were without doubt a misprint for 25,000,000. People told me that they had reasons to suspect that for business reasons, many Jews did not report themselves as Jews. It looks plausible. I am strongly of the opinion that we have an immense Jewish population in America. I am assured by men competent to speak that the Jews are exceedingly active in politics. (&quot;Concerning the Jews,&quot; Harper's Monthly Magazine, September 1899)</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
Twain's opinion on the Jews is probably the best-kept secret in American literary history. Immediately after his death, his eccentric daughter Clara married - or was married by - the Jewish piano player, Ossip Galbrilowitsch. Twain's publishers were given speedy instructions to delete &quot;Concerning the Jews&quot; from the collected works, where it had appeared in the book The Man that Corrupted Hadleybury &amp; Other Stories. (1) Since Jews provided most of the agitators and orators who pushed forward the Abolition campaign that culminated in the Civil War (which Jewish bankers largely financed, on both sides), it seems a legitimate question whether there was any preplanning for the wholesale - and retail - economic looting done by mainly Jewish carpetbaggers after the war. (2) We have cited a host of other writers on the terrible economic depredation that Jewry visited on the people of Tzarist Russia.<BR><BR>
<B>ERNEST RENAN, French historian</B> <BLOCKQUOTE>&quot;The Jews are not merely a different religious community, but - and this is the most important factor - ethnically an altogether different race.

<B>MENCKEN, H. L. 20th century American writer.</B><BLOCKQUOTE> &quot;The Jews could be put down very plausibly as the most unpleasant race ever heard of. As commonly encountered they lack any of the qualities that mark the civilized man: courage, dignity, incorruptibility, ease, confidence. They have vanity without pride, voluptuousness without taste, and learning without wisdom. Their fortitude, such as it is, is wasted upon puerile objects, and their charity is mainly a form of display.&quot; (Treatise on the Gods)<BR>
The fact that what are commonly spoken of as rights are often really privileges is demonstrated in the case of the Jews. They resent bitterly their exclusion from certain hotels, resorts and other places of gathering, and make determined efforts to horn in. But the moment any considerable number of them horns in, the attractions of the place diminish, and the more pushful Jews turn to one where they are still nicht gewuenscht ... (&quot;not wanted.&quot;)<BR>
&quot;I am one of the few Goyim who have ever actually tackled the TALMUD. I suppose you now expect me to add that it is a profound and noble work, worthy of hard study by all other GOYIM. Unhappily, my report must differ from this expectation. It seems to me, save for a few bright spots, to be quite indistinguishable from rubbish...&quot;<BR>
&quot;The Jewish theory that the GOYIM envy the superior ability of the Jews is not borne out by the facts. Most GOYIM, in fact, deny that the Jew is superior, and point in evidence to his failure to take the first prizes: he has to be content with the seconds. No Jewish composer has ever come within miles of Bach, Beethoven and Brahms; no Jew has ever challenged the top-flight painters of the world, and no Jewish scientist has equaled Newton, Darwin, Pasteur or Mendel. In the latter bracket such apparent exception as Ehrlich, Freud and Einstein are only apparent. Ehrlich, in fact, contributed less to biochemical fact than to biochemical theory, and most of his theory was dubious. Freud was nine-tenths quack, and there is sound reason for believing that even Einstein will not hold up: in the long run his curved space may be classed with the psychosomatic bumps of Gall and Spurzheim. But whether this inferiority of the Jew is real or only a delusion, it must be manifest that it is generally accepted. The GOY does not, in fact, believe that the Jew is better than the non-Jew; the most he will admit is that the Jew is smarter at achieving worldly success. But this he ascribes to sharp practices, not to superior ability.&quot; (Minority Report: H. L. Mencken's Notebooks)</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

This craving for bouquets by Jews is a symptom of racial degeneration. The Jews are worse than my own people.

Only when a body's inner death is manifest, do outside elements win the power of judgment in it - yet merely to destroy it.<BR>
On one thing am I clear: that is the influence which the Jews have gained upon our mental life, as displayed in the deflection and falsification of our highest culture-tendencies.

<B>FRANCO, FRANCISCO. 20th century Spanish statesman.</B> In his victory speech in Madrid, on May 19, 1939, he declared: <BLOCKQUOTE>&quot;Let us be under no illusion.

<B>H. H. BEAMISH, in a New York address, October 30 - November 1, 1937</B> <BLOCKQUOTE>&quot;In 1848 the word &quot;anti-Semitic&quot; was invented by the Jews to prevent the use of the word &quot;Jew.&quot; The right word for them is &quot;Jew&quot; ...<BR>
&quot;I implore all of you to be accurate - call them Jews. There is no need to be delicate on this Jewish question. You must face them in this country. The Jew should be satisfied here. I was here forty-seven years ago; your doors were thrown open to the Jews and they were free. No he has got you absolutely by the throat - that is your reward.&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<B>CHRISTEA, PATRIARCH. 20th century Romanian prelate.</B> <BLOCKQUOTE>&quot;The Jews have caused an epidemic of corruption and social unrest. They monopolize the press, which, with foreign help, flays all the spiritual treasures of the Romanians. To defend ourselves is a national and patriotic duty - not anti-Semitism. Lack of measures to get rid of the plague would indicate that we are lazy cowards who let ourselves be carried alive to our graves. Why should we not get rid of these parasites who suck Romanian and Christian blood? It is logical and holy to react against them.&quot; (New York Herald Tribune, August 17, 1937)</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<B>HOUSTON STEWART CHAMBERLAIN, world famed author of Foundations of the Nineteenth Century, Vol. I, page 337</B><BLOCKQUOTE> &quot;The revelation of Christ has no significance for the Jew! ... I have searched through a whole library of Jewish books in the expectation of finding - naturally not belief in the Divinity of Christ, nor the idea of redemption, but the purely human feeling for the greatness of suffering Savior - but in vain. A Jew who feels that, is, in fact, no longer a Jew, but a denier of Judiasm. And while we find, even in Mohammed's Koran, at least a vague conception of the importance of Christ and profound reverence for His personality, a cultured leading Jew of the nineteenth century (Graetz) calls Christ &quot;the new birth with the death mask,&quot; which inflicted new and painful wounds upon the Jewish people; he cannot see anything else in Him. In view of the Cross he assures us that &quot;the Jews do not require this convulsive emotion for their spiritual improvement,&quot; and adds, &quot;particularly not among the middle classes of inhabitants of the cities.&quot; His comprehension goes further. In a book, republished in 1880, by a Spanish Jew (Mose de Leon) Jesus Christ is called a &quot;dead dog&quot; that lies &quot;buried in a dunghill.&quot; Besides, the Jews have taken care to issue in the latter part of the nineteens century several editions (naturally in Hebrew) of the so-called &quot;censured passages&quot; from the Talmud, those passages usually omitted in which Christ is exposed to our scorn and hatred as a &quot;fool,&quot; &quot;sorcerer,&quot; &quot;profane person,&quot; &quot;idolater,&quot; &quot;dog,&quot; &quot;bastard,&quot; &quot;child of lust,&quot; etc.: so, too, His sublime Mother.&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

&quot;You seem to me to be the maddest of the lot. The Kaffirs, the Hottentots, and the Negroes of Guinea are much more reasonable and more honest people than your ancestors, the Jews.

&quot;I know that there are some Jews in the English colonies. These marranos go wherever there is money to be made...

<H1>Who rules America?</H1>

<B>The alien grip on our news and entertainment media must be broken.</B><P>
There is no greater power in the world today than that wielded by the manipulators of public opinion in America. No king or pope of old, no conquering general or high priest ever disposed of a power even remotely approaching that of the few dozen men who control America's mass news and entertainment media.<P>
Their power is not distant and impersonal; it reaches into every home in America, and it works its will during nearly every waking hour. It is the power which shapes and molds the mind of virtually every citizen, young or old, rich or poor, simple or sophisticated.<P>
The mass media form for us our image of the world and then tell us what to think about that image. Essentially everything we know -- or think we know -- about events outside our own neighborhood or circle of acquaintances comes to us via our daily newspaper, our weekly news magazine, our radio, or our television.<P>
It is not just the heavy-handed suppression of certain news stories from our newspapers or the blatant propagandizing of history-distorting TV <code>&quot;</code>docudramas<code>&quot;</code> which characterizes the opinion-manipulating techniques of the media masters. They exercise both subtlety and thoroughness in their management of both the news and the entertainment which they present to us.<P>
For example, the way in which the news is covered: which items are emphasized and which are played down, the reporter's choice of words, tone of voice, and facial expressions; the wording of headlines; the choice of illustrations -- all of these things subliminally and yet profoundly affect the way in which we interpret what we see or hear.<P>
On top of this, of course, the columnists and editors remove any remaining doubt from our minds as to just what we are to think about it all. Employing carefully developed psychological techniques, they guide our thought and opinion so that we can be in tune with the <code>&quot;</code>in<code>&quot;</code> crowd, the <code>&quot;</code>beautiful people,<code>&quot;</code> the <code>&quot;</code>smart money.&quot;<P>
They let us know exactly what our attitudes should be toward various types of people and behavior by placing those people or that behavior in the context of a TV drama or situation comedy and having the other TV characters react to them in the Politically Correct way.<P>
<B>Molding American Minds</B><BR>
For example, a racially mixed couple will be respected, liked, and socially sought after by other characters, as will a <code>&quot;</code>take charge<code>&quot;</code> Black scholar or businessman, or a sensitive and talented homosexual, or a poor but honest and hardworking illegal alien from Mexico. On the other hand, a White racist -- that is, any racially conscious White person who looks askance at miscegenation or at the rapidly darkening racial situation in America -- is portrayed, at best, as a despicable bigot who is reviled by the other characters, or, at worst, as a dangerous psychopath who is fascinated by firearms and is a menace to all law-abiding citizens. The White racist <code>&quot;</code>gun nut,<code>&quot;</code> in fact, has become a familiar stereotype on TV shows.<P>
The average American, of whose daily life TV-watching takes such an unhealthy portion, distinguishes between these fictional situations and reality only with difficulty, if at all. He responds to the televised actions, statements, and attitudes of TV actors much as he does to his own peers in real life. For all too many Americans the real world has been replaced by the false reality of the TV environment, and it is to this false reality that his urge to conform responds. Thus, when a TV scriptwriter expresses approval of some ideas and actions through the TV characters for whom he is writing, and disapproval of others, he exerts a powerful pressure on millions of viewers toward conformity with his own views.<P>
And as it is with TV entertainment, so it is also with the news, whether televised or printed. The insidious thing about this form of thought control is that even when we realize that entertainment or news is biased, the media masters still are able to manipulate most of us. This is because they not only slant what they present, but they establish tacit boundaries and ground rules for the permissible spectrum of opinion.<P>
As an example, consider the media treatment of Middle East news. Some editors or commentators are slavishly pro-Israel in their every utterance, while others seem nearly neutral. No one, however, dares suggest that the U.S. government is backing the wrong side in the Arab-Jewish conflict and that it served Jewish interests rather than American interests to send U.S. forces to cripple Iraq, Israel's principal rival in the Middle East. Thus, a spectrum of permissible opinion, from pro-Israel to nearly neutral, is established. Another example is the media treatment of South Africa. Some commentators seem almost dispassionate in reporting the news of racial strife from that country, while in the voices of other commentators there is open hatred of the White South Africans and unrestrained admiration for the Blacks. All of the media spokesmen without exception, however, take the Black side; they differ only in the degree of their partisanship.<P>
Because there are differences in degree, however, most Americans fail to realize that they are being manipulated. Even the citizen who complains about <code>&quot;</code>managed news<code>&quot;</code> falls into the trap of thinking that because he is presented with an apparent spectrum of opinion he can escape the thought controllers' influence by believing the editor or commentator of his choice. It's a <code>&quot;</code>heads I win, tails you lose<code>&quot;</code> situation. Every point on the permissible spectrum of public opinion is acceptable to the media masters -- and no impermissible fact or viewpoint is allowed any exposure at all, if they can prevent it.<P>

The control of the opinion-molding media is monolithic. All of the controlled media -- television, radio, newspapers, magazines, books, motion pictures -- speak with a single voice, each reinforcing the other. Despite the appearance of variety, there is no real dissent, no alternative source of facts or ideas accessible to the great mass of people which might allow them to form opinions at odds with those of the media masters. They are presented with a single view of the world -- a world in which every voice proclaims the equality of the races, the inerrant nature of the Jewish <code>&quot;</code>Holocaust<code>&quot;</code> tale, the wickedness of attempting to halt a flood of non-White aliens from pouring across our borders, the danger of permitting citizens to keep and bear arms, the moral equivalence of all sexual orientations, and the desirability of a <code>&quot;</code>pluralistic,<code>&quot;</code> cosmopolitan society rather than a homogeneous one. It is a view of the world designed by the media masters to suit their own ends -- and the pressure to conform to that view is overwhelming. People adapt their opinions to it, vote in accord with it, and shape their lives to fit it.<P>
<B>Television Broadcasting</B> <BR>
And who are these all-powerful masters of the media? For a partial answer, consider television broadcasting, which undoubtedly has become the most powerful medium for determining the way Americans think and behave.<P>
Not counting certain specialized cable news systems, virtually all national and international TV news broadcast in the United States is gathered, filmed, edited, and put on the air by just three companies: American Broadcasting Companies (ABC), Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS), and National Broadcasting Company (NBC). Most televised entertainment programs viewed by Americans are broadcast by the same three networks. Each of these three has been under the absolute control of a single man over a long enough period of time -- ranging from 32 years to 55 years -- for him to staff the corporation at every level with officers of his choosing and thus to place his imprint finally, totally, and indelibly upon it.<P>
<B>In each case that man has been a Jew</B>.<BR>
Until 1985, when ABC merged with Capital Cities Communications, Inc., a New York-based media conglomerate, the chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer (CEO) of the network was Leonard Harry Goldenson, a Jew. He had headed the network since he became president of the predecessor corporation, American Broadcasting-Paramount Theaters, Inc., in 1953. (The name was changed to American Broadcasting Companies, Inc., in 1965.) In an interview published in the April 1, 1985, issue of Newsweek, Goldenson boasted, <code>&quot;</code>I built this company [ABC] from scratch.<code>&quot;</code><P>
Under the 1985 merger terms, Goldenson became chairman of the executive committee of the new company, Capital Cities/ABC, Inc. Although the chairman and CEO of Capital Cities now is Thomas Murphy, a Gentile, he has made no move to replace the men at ABC who served Goldenson, and the network retains its Jewish character today.<P>
CBS was under the domination of William S. Paley for more than half a century. The son of immigrant Jews from Russia, Paley left the family cigar business in 1928, when he was 27, to buy United Independent Broadcasters for $500,000. He renamed it Columbia Broadcasting System and made himself president. He became chairman of the board in 1946 and held that post until his partial retirement in 1983.<P>
When independent broadcaster Ted Turner, a Gentile, made a bid to buy CBS in 1985, there was panic in media boardrooms across the nation. Turner had made a fortune in advertising and then had built a successful cable-TV news network, CNN. <P>
Although Turner employed a number of Jews in key executive positions in CNN and had never taken public positions contrary to Jewish interests, he is a man with a large ego and a strong personality and was regarded by Paley and the other Jews at CBS as uncontrollable: a loose cannon who might at some time in the future turn against them. Furthermore, Jewish newsman Daniel Schorr, who had worked for Turner, publicly charged that his former boss held a personal dislike for Jews. To block Turner's bid CBS executives invited billionaire Jewish theater, hotel, insurance, and cigarette magnate Laurence Tisch to launch a <code>&quot;</code>friendly<code>&quot;</code> takeover of the company, and since 1986 Tisch has been the chairman and CEO of CBS, removing any threat of non-Jewish influence there.<P>
NBC was formerly a subsidiary of Radio Corporation of America (RCA), which was controlled for 40 years, beginning in 1930, by David Sarnoff, another Jewish immigrant from Russia. When Sarnoff died in 1970 his son Robert took over. In 1986 General Electric Co. merged with RCA, and now NBC is a wholly owned subsidiary of General Electric.<P>
There has been no move by top G-E management to change the Jewish <code>&quot;</code>profile<code>&quot;</code> of NBC or to replace key Jewish personnel. To the contrary, new Jewish executives have been added: examples are Steve Friedman, hired in May 1990 as executive producer of NBC Nightly News and succeeded in January 1993 by Jeff Zuker.<P>
<B>Entertainment Industry</B><BR>
The extraordinary concentration of Jews in the TV industry certainly explains much of the bias of television news. As important as the control of television news programming is, however, television entertainment is even more decisive in determining the way Americans think. Tens of millions of Americans, especially younger ones, never watch network TV news broadcasts, but instead keep their sets tuned to the entertainment programs. And it is in the entertainment field that Jews have maintained the firmest control.<P>
The man in charge of the television entertainment division at CBS is Jeff Sagansky. At ABC the entertainment division is run by two men: Ted Harbert handles the business end of the division, and Stuart Bloomberg is in charge of entertainment programming. Brandon Tartikoff became president of NBC Entertainment in 1980 and held that post for a decade, until he was promoted to chairman in 1990. When he left NBC in July 1991 to take the post of chairman at Paramount Pictures the new president of NBC Entertainment, Warren Littlefield, assumed control. Sagansky, Bloomberg, and Littlefield pick the programs their networks will broadcast: the game shows, the interview shows, the situation comedies, the historical <code>&quot;</code>docudramas,<code>&quot;</code> the family series, the adventure series, the specials. They tell the program developers what they want to see in the programs. They veto anything they don't like. They determine the slant each program will have. They decide just how hard to push various propaganda themes in their network programming: interracial marriage, homosexuality, feminism, gun control, <code>&quot;</code>Holocaust<code>&quot;</code> re-enactments, the menace of <code>&quot;</code>White extremism.<code>&quot;</code><P>
Only one in 36 U.S. citizens (2.8 per cent) is a Jew. But nearly all of the men who shape young Americans' concept of reality, of good and evil, of permissible and impermissible behavior are Jews. In particular, Sagansky and Bloomberg are Jews. So is Tartikoff. Littlefield is the only Gentile who has had a significant role in TV entertainment programming in recent years.<P>
This Jewish control of the American entertainment industry and its influence on the American psyche goes far beyond television programming for the major networks; it also includes virtually everything which comes out of Hollywood's film studios. The May 1990 issue of American Film magazine listed the top 10 (in terms of gross revenues in 1989) U.S. entertainment companies and their CEOs and ranked them by size. They were, in descending order, Time Warner Communications (Steven J. Ross), Walt Disney Co. (Michael D. Eisner), NBC (Robert C. Wright), Paramount Communications (Martin S. Davis), CBS (Laurence A. Tisch), 20th Century Fox Film Corp. (Barry Diller), Columbia Pictures Entertainment (Victor A. Kaufman), Viacom Inc. (Sumner Redstone), Capital Cities/ABC (Thomas S. Murphy), and MCA Inc. (Lew Wasserman). Of the 10 top entertainment CEOs listed above, eight -- Ross, Eisner, Davis, Tisch, Diller, Kaufman, Redstone, and Wasserman -- are Jews. Only two of the top-10 entertainment companies have Gentile CEOs -- NBC and Capital Cities/ABC -- and one of those -- Capital Cities/ABC -- has a Jew in charge of its entertainment division.<P>
There have been a few personnel changes since the 1989 survey, of course. When Japan's Sony Corporation of America bought Columbia Pictures in October 1989, Victor Kaufman was replaced by Peter Guber, also a Jew. Guber's overseer is Sony's vice-chairman Michael P. Schulhof, who arranged the takeover; he is a Jew too. In 1991 MCA was bought by Matsushita, one of Sony's Japanese rivals, but Wasserman remains in his old post. As a general rule, the Japanese are motivated solely by economic interests in their buying of American media, and they leave the propaganda to the Jews. More often than not, in fact, Jews are the brokers of such Japanese media buyouts. Just as Schulhof handled the Sony takeover of Columbia, the Matsushita-MCA deal was arranged by Jewish media magnate Michael Ovitz and Texas-Jewish wheeler-dealer Robert Strauss, later appointed as George Bush's ambassador to Moscow.<P>
Steven J. Ross died in December 1992, and now the top post at Time Warner is held by CEO (and chairman) Gerald Levin, also a Jew.<P>
Barry Diller left Fox in February 1992. Rupert Murdoch, owner of News Corporation, Fox's parent company, took a hand in the management of Fox for a few months, but in November 1992 Peter Chernin, formerly head of the Fox Entertainment division, moved up to the top job as chairman of 20th Century Fox Films Corp. Chernin is a Jew. Under him, as president of Fox Entertainment Group since November 1992, is Sandy Grushow, also a Jew.<P>
And Sumner Redstone (born Murray Rothstein) has gained much prominence since 1989, as two of his Viacom subsidiaries, MTV and Nickelodeon, have acquired larger and larger shares of the juvenile television audience. Redstone, who actually owns 76 per cent of the shares of Viacom ($3 billion), is the largest single purveyor of race-mixing propaganda to White teenagers and sub-teens in America and Europe. MTV pumps its racially mixed rock and rap videos into 210 million homes in 71 countries and is the dominant cultural influence on White teenagers around the world. Nickelodeon has by far the largest share of the four-to-11-year-old TV audience in America and also is expanding rapidly into Europe; most of its shows do not yet display the blatant degeneracy which is MTV's trademark, but Redstone is gradually nudging the fare presented to his kiddie viewers toward the same poison purveyed by MTV.<P>

It is difficult to believe that such an overwhelming degree of control of the entertainment industry by Jews came about without a deliberate, concerted effort on their part.<P>

Radio Broadcasting The <code>&quot;</code>big three<code>&quot;</code> TV networks -- ABC, CBS, and NBC -- not only have a virtual monopoly on commercial network television broadcasting in the United States; they account for most of commercial network radio broadcasting as well -- or they did until recently. For many years their only significant competitor in the latter arena, Mutual Broadcasting System (MBS), with 941 affiliated radio stations (but no TV stations) across the country, was headed by Martin Rubenstein, a Jew. In 1985 Norman J. Pattiz, also a Jew, took over MBS as chairman and CEO. Two years later Pattiz, through his holding company, Westwood One, Inc., bought the NBC Radio Network from General Electric. The MBS and NBC stations together make Pattiz the number-two radio broadcaster in the nation, behind only Capital Cities/ABC. The current MBS vice-president in charge of news broadcasting, Ron Nessen, who formerly held the position of White House press secretary under Gerald Ford, is also a Jew. Newspapers After television, daily newspapers are the most influential mass medium in America. Sixty-three million of them are sold (and presumably read) each day. These millions are divided among some 1,640 different publications. One might conclude that the sheer number of different newspapers across America would provide a safeguard against minority control and distortion. Alas, such is not the case. There is less independence, less competition, and much less representation of majority interests than a casual observer would think.<P>
Only 412 (25 per cent) of the 1,640 publications are independently owned; the rest belong to multi-newspaper chains. Only 121 of the total number have circulations of more than 100,000. Only a handful are large enough to maintain independent reporting staffs outside their own communities; the rest must depend on these few for all of their national and international news.<P>
In only 54 cities in America are there more than one daily newspaper, and competition is frequently nominal even among them, as between morning and afternoon editions under the same ownership. Examples of this are the Huntsville, Alabama, morning News and afternoon Times; the Birmingham, Alabama, morning Post Herald and afternoon News; the Mobile, Alabama, morning Register and afternoon Press; the Springfield, Massachusetts, morning Union, afternoon News, and Sunday-only Republican; the Syracuse, New York, morning Post-Standard and afternoon Herald-Journal -- all owned by the Jewish Newhouse brothers through their holding company, Advance Publications.<P>
The Newhouse media empire provides an example of more than the lack of real competition among America's daily newspapers; it also illustrates the insatiable appetite Jews have shown for all the organs of opinion control on which they could fasten their grip. The Newhouses own 31 daily newspapers, including several large and important ones, such as the Cleveland Plain Dealer, the Newark Star-Ledger, and the New Orleans Times-Picayune; the nation's largest trade book publishing conglomerate, Random House, with all its subsidiaries; Newhouse Broadcasting, consisting of 12 television broadcasting stations and 87 cable-TV systems, including some of the country's largest cable networks; the Sunday supplement Parade, with a circulation of more than 22 million copies per week; some two dozen major magazines, including the New Yorker, Vogue, Mademoiselle, Glamour, Vanity Fair, Bride's, Gentlemen's Quarterly, Self, House &amp; Garden, and all the other magazines of the wholly owned Conde Nast group.<P>
This Jewish media empire was founded by the late Samuel Newhouse, an immigrant from Russia. When he died in 1979 at the age of 84, he bequeathed media holdings worth an estimated $1.3 billion to his two sons, Samuel and Donald. With a number of further acquisitions, the net worth of Advance Publications has grown to more than $8 billion today.<P>
The gobbling up of so many newspapers by the Newhouse family was in large degree made possible by the fact that newspapers are not supported by their subscribers, but by their advertisers. It is advertising revenue -- not the small change collected from a newspaper's readers -- that largely pays the editor's salary and yields the owner's profit.<P>
Whenever the large advertisers in a city choose to favor one newspaper over another with their business, the favored newspaper will flourish while its competitor dies. Since the beginning of this century, when Jewish mercantile power in America became a dominant economic force, there has been a steady rise in the number of American newspapers in Jewish hands, accompanied by a steady decline in the number of competing Gentile newspapers -- primarily as a result of selective advertising policies by Jewish merchants.<P>
Furthermore, even those newspapers still under Gentile ownership and management are so thoroughly dependent upon Jewish advertising revenue that their editorial and news reporting policies are largely constrained by Jewish likes and dislikes. It holds true in the newspaper business as elsewhere that he who pays the piper calls the tune.<P>
<B>Three Jewish Newspapers</B><BR>
The suppression of competition and the establishment of local monopolies on the dissemination of news and opinion have characterized the rise of Jewish control over America's newspapers. The resulting ability of the Jews to use the press as an unopposed instrument of Jewish policy could hardly be better illustrated than by the examples of the nation's three most prestigious and influential newspapers: the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, and the Washington Post. These three, dominating America's financial and political capitals, are the newspapers which set the trends and the guidelines for nearly all the others. They are the ones which decide what is news and what isn't, at the national and international levels. They originate the news; the others merely copy it. And all three newspapers are in Jewish hands.<P>
The New York Times is the unofficial social, fashion, entertainment, political, and cultural guide of the nation. It tells America's <code>&quot;</code>smart set<code>&quot;</code> which books to buy and which films to see; which opinions are in style at the moment; which politicians, educators, spiritual leaders, artists, and businessmen are the real comers. And for a few decades in the last century it was a genuinely American newspaper. The New York Times was founded in 1851 by two Gentiles, Henry J. Raymond and George Jones. After their deaths, it was purchased in 1896 from Jones's estate by a wealthy Jewish publisher, Adolph Ochs. His great-grandson, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, Jr., is the paper's current publisher and CEO. The executive editor is Max Frankel, and the managing editor is Joseph Lelyveld. Both are Jews.<P>
The Sulzberger family also owns, through the New York Times Co., 33 other newspapers, including the Boston Globe, purchased in June 1993 for $1.1 billion; twelve magazines, including McCall's and Family Circle with circulations of more than 5 million each; seven radio and TV broadcasting stations; a cable-TV system; and three book publishing companies. The New York Times News Service transmits news stories, features, and photographs from the New York Times by wire to 506 other newspapers, news agencies, and magazines.<P>
Of similar national importance is the Washington Post, which, by establishing its <code>&quot;</code>leaks<code>&quot;</code> throughout government agencies in Washington, has an inside track on news involving the Federal government.<P>
The Washington Post, like the New York Times, had a non-Jewish origin. It was established in 1877 by Stilson Hutchins, purchased from him in 1905 by John R. McLean, and later inherited by Edward B. McLean. In June 1933, however, at the height of the Great Depression, the newspaper was forced into bankruptcy. It was purchased at a bankruptcy auction by Eugene Meyer, a Jewish financier and former partner of the infamous Bernard Baruch, industry czar in America during the First World War. The Washington Post is now run by Katherine Meyer Graham, Eugene Meyer's daughter. She is the principal stockholder and the board chairman of the Washington Post Co. In 1979 she appointed her son Donald publisher of the paper. He now also holds the posts of president and CEO of the Washington Post Co.<P>
The Washington Post Co. has a number of other media holdings in newspapers, television, and magazines, most notably the nation's number-two weekly newsmagazine, Newsweek.<P>
The Wall Street Journal, which sells 2.1 million copies each weekday, is the nation's largest-circulation daily newspaper. It is owned by Dow Jones &amp; Co., Inc., a New York corporation which also publishes 24 other daily newspapers and the weekly financial tabloid Barron's, among other things. The chairman and CEO of Dow Jones is Peter R. Kann, who is a Jew. Kann also holds the posts of chairman and publisher of the Wall Street Journal.<P>
New York's other major newspapers are in no better hands than the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal. In January 1993 the New York Daily News was bought from the estate of the late Jewish media mogul Robert Maxwell (born Ludvik Hoch) by Jewish real-estate developer Mortimer B. Zuckerman. <P>
The Village Voice is the personal property of Leonard Stern, the billionaire Jewish owner of the Hartz Mountain pet supply firm. The New York Post, suffering from severe financial problems, has been bouncing back and forth for a year among a succession of especially sleazy Jewish billionaires -- Peter Kalikow, Steven Hoffenberg, Abraham Hirshfeld -- and Australian newspaper mogul Rupert Murdoch. Other Mass Media The story is pretty much the same for other media as it is for television, radio, and newspapers. Consider, for example, newsmagazines. There are only three of any note published in the United States: Time, Newsweek, and U.S. News &amp; World Report.<P>
Time, with a weekly circulation of 4.1 million, is published by a subsidiary of Time Warner Communications, the new media conglomerate formed by the 1989 merger of Time Inc. with Warner Communications. The CEO of Time Warner Communications, as mentioned above, is Gerald Levin, a Jew.<BR>
Newsweek, as mentioned above, is published by the Washington Post Co., under the Jewess Katherine Meyer Graham. Its weekly circulation is 3.2 million.<P>
U.S. News &amp; World Report, with a weekly circulation of 2.3 million, is owned and published by the aforementioned Mortimer B. Zuckerman, who also has taken the position of editor-in-chief of the magazine for himself. Zuckerman also owns the Atlantic Monthly and New York's tabloid newspaper, the Daily News.<P>

<B>Or consider books.</B><BR>
 There are literally thousands of publishers in the United States, and among these thousands are many with little or no direct Jewish control; there are some which actually dare to publish books not approved by the Jewish Establishment. But all of the latter publishers are very small, and their books seldom reach the great mass of Americans who buy their reading material from drugstore news racks or from the chain bookstores.<P>
Among the giant publishing conglomerates, however, the situation is quite kosher. Three of the six largest book publishers in the United States, according to Publishers Weekly, are owned or controlled by Jews. The three are first-place Random House (with its many subsidiaries, including Crown Publishing Group), third-place Simon &amp; Schuster, and sixth-place Time Warner Trade Group (including Warner Books and Little, Brown).<P>
As pointed out above, the Newhouse family owns Random House, and Gerald Levin is CEO of Time Warner Communications, of which Time Warner Trade Group is a division. Simon &amp; Schuster is a subsidiary of Paramount Communications, Inc. (formerly Gulf and Western, Inc.), of whom the chairman and CEO is Martin S. Davis, as already noted.<P>
Another publisher of special significance is Western Publishing. Although it ranks only 13th in size among all U.S. publishers, it ranks first among publishers of children's books, with more than 50 per cent of the market. Its chairman and CEO is Richard Bernstein, a Jew.<P>
Those are the facts of media control in America. Anyone willing to spend a few hours in a large library looking into current editions of yearbooks on the radio and television industries and into directories of newspapers and magazines; into registers of corporations and their officers, such as those published by Standard and Poors and by Dun and Bradstreet; and into standard biographical reference works can verify their accuracy. They are undeniable, and when confronted with them Jewish spokesmen customarily will use evasive tactics. <code>&quot;</code>Ted Turner isn't a Jew!<code>&quot;</code> they will announce triumphantly, as if that settled the issue. If pressed further they will accuse the confronter of <code>&quot;</code>anti-Semitism<code>&quot;</code> for even raising the subject. It is fear of this accusation which keeps many persons silent who know the facts.<P>
<B>But we must not remain silent on this most important of issues!</B><BR> 
The Jewish control of the American mass media is the single most important fact of life, not just in America, but in the whole world today. There is nothing -- plague, famine, economic collapse, even nuclear war -- more dangerous to the future of our people.<P>
By permitting the Jews to control our news and entertainment media we are doing more than merely giving them a decisive influence on our political system and virtual control of our government; we also are giving them control of the minds and souls of our children, whose attitudes and ideas are shaped more by Jewish television and Jewish films than by parents, schools, or any other influence. The Jew-controlled entertainment media have taken the lead in persuading a whole generation that homosexuality is a normal and acceptable way of life; that there is nothing at all wrong with White women dating or marrying Black men, or with White men marrying Asiatic women; that all races are inherently equal in ability and character -- except that the character of the White race is suspect because of a history of oppressing other races; and that any effort by Whites at racial self-preservation is reprehensible. <P>
<B>Our Responsibility</B><BR>
We must oppose the further spreading of this poison among our people, and we must break the power of those who are spreading it. It would be intolerable for such power to be in the hands of any alien minority, with values and interests different from our own. But to permit the Jews, with their 3,000-year history of nation-wrecking, from ancient Egypt to Russia, to hold such power over us is tantamount to race suicide. Indeed, the fact that so many White Americans today are so filled with a sense of racial guilt and self-hatred that they actively seek the death of their own race is a deliberate consequence of Jewish media control. Once we have absorbed and understood the fact of Jewish media control, it is our inescapable responsibility to do whatever is necessary to break that control. We must shrink from nothing in combating this evil power which has fastened its deadly grip on our people and is injecting its lethal poison into their minds and souls. If we fail to destroy it, it certainly will destroy our race.<P>
Let us begin now to acquire knowledge and take action toward this necessary end.<P>

<H1>The ADL: The drive to outlaw free speech and thought</H1>
<BODY>
<B>Question:</B> What does the current media campaign to outlaw the private ownership of semiautomatic weapons by U.S. citizens have to do with the rapidly growing corpus of legislation dealing with <code>&quot;</code>hate crimes<code>&quot;</code>?<P>
<B>Answer:</B> Success of the first is necessary to insure compliance with the second, and both are the creatures of a quasi-governmental secret-police agency of whose existence most Americans are unaware.<P>
There is underway in America a vast, well-oiled, heavily financed campaign to limit sharply the rights of Americans under the First Amendment to their Constitution and to eliminate altogether their rights under the Second Amendment. It already has scored notable successes in rolling back the most basic American freedoms. It is gearing up now for a drive to achieve total victory in this decade.<P>
The principal instrument in this campaign is a secret-police agency more sinister, more cunning, and infinitely more malevolent than the Soviet Committee for State Security -- the KGB -- ever was. Its initials are ADL.Those initials stand for Anti-Defamation League, an innocuous-sounding name wholly out of keeping with the character of the organization. <P>
To understand its significance we must look into its origins. The ADL is the action arm of B'nai B'rith, the international Jewish secret society, whose Hebrew name means in English <code>&quot;</code>Sons of the Covenant.<code>&quot;</code> The <code>&quot;</code>covenant<code>&quot;</code> referred to is the one supposedly entered into between the ancient Hebrews and their tribal deity Yahweh more than 3,000 years ago.<P>
Its terms are spelled out in Deuteronomy, the fifth book of Moses. The Jews pledged their allegiance to Yahweh in return for his promise to take them as his <code>&quot;</code>chosen people<code>&quot;</code> and to give them dominion over all the lands and the other peoples of the earth: <code>&quot;</code>Every place whereon the soles of your feet shall tread shall be yours.<code>&quot;</code> (Deut. 11: 24) B'nai B'rith sees as its task the taking of all necessary measures for this promise to be fulfilled.<P>
The ADL itself was organized in the United States as a subdivision of B'nai B'rith in 1913, and its ostensible purpose was to counter the <code>&quot;</code>defamation<code>&quot;</code> of Jews, whose public image was even worse then than now. The ADL went about its work in characteristically heavy-handed fashion, bullying and intimidating those who said or published anything the organization considered incompatible with Jewish interests, and lobbying legislators and other public officials to obtain legislation or rulings which would advance Jewish aims. If a prominent businessman, educator, or politician made a public statement the Jews did not like, the ADL would attempt to persuade him to retract it, hinting at economic or political reprisals if he refused. If intimidation failed, the ADL often would turn to defamation, feeding derogatory statements about the target to newspapers under Jewish control or friendly to Jewish interests until he was thoroughly discredited in the eyes of the public.<P>
Typical of ADL efforts in the period prior to the Second World War was its attempt to ban a book, Conquest of a Continent, by Madison Grant, the noted naturalist and president of the New York Zoological Society. The book was published in 1933 by Charles Scribner's Sons and bore an enthusiastic introduction by Professor Henry Fairfield Osborn, the most prominent American paleontologist of his day. In the book Grant outlined the racial history of North America and argued for the reform of immigration laws in order to keep America primarily Northern European in its racial composition.<P>
Jews are hardly mentioned in the book, and in no way can it be considered a <code>&quot;</code>defamation<code>&quot;</code> of them. Jewish policy then as now, however, was to change the European racial character of the United States by cutting off the flow of immigrants (other than Jews) from Europe and increasing the flow from the non-White world. <P>
Consequently the ADL mounted a campaign with publishers, asking them not to review the book or mention it in any way in their own publications, and with booksellers, asking them not to handle the book. A form letter dated December 13, 1933, mailed from the national headquarters of the ADL (then in Chicago), and signed by the then-director of the organization, Richard E. Gutstadt, notified publishers that Grant's book <code>&quot;</code>is extremely antagonistic to Jewish interests<code>&quot;</code> and added: <code>&quot;</code>We are interested in stifling the sale of this book.<code>&quot;</code><P>
Grant's book is only one of many which received the same attention from the ADL. As time passed the organization's censorship activity became more sophisticated and more effective. Defamation of offending authors, speakers, or public officials became a more often used weapon. In line with this defamation activity the ADL's undercover investigative capabilities were greatly expanded. A network of unpaid Jewish agents all across the country reported to ADL headquarters, where dossiers were built up on tens of thousands of American citizens. Information from these dossiers, which might contain everything from basic biographical and employment data to rumors about marital difficulties or drinking problems, was used to fabricate defamatory news releases on anyone the ADL wanted to discredit.<P>
By the early 1940s the ADL had strengthened its position as an information source for the news media -- the result in part of the increased number of Jews in controlling positions in the media. It also had established informal relationships with a number of local, state, and Federal police departments. It often was the case that when the Federal Bureau of Investigation was interested in the affairs of a person involved in patriotic or <code>&quot;</code>right wing<code>&quot;</code> activity, the ADL already would have a dossier on him as someone actually or potentially hostile to Jewish interests and would happily share the dossier with the FBI. Sometimes the ADL would initiate the contact: if its informants had provided information to headquarters suggesting that an alleged <code>&quot;</code>anti-Semite<code>&quot;</code> might not have paid enough income tax or might have an unregistered firearm hidden in his attic, a tip would be given to the appropriate police agency.<P>
In the past half-century the ADL's links with the media and with law-enforcement agencies have grown enormously. Today virtually all the controlled news media routinely print anything given to them by the ADL, as if it had come over the Associated Press wire, and they routinely go to the ADL for commentary whenever any news story is being prepared on a person known to oppose Jewish policies.<P>
Likewise, the ADL has become the standard source to which government investigative agencies turn whenever their target is such a person. In the latter case the flow of information goes in both directions: not only does the ADL have the opportunity to peek into the government's confidential investigative files, but its agents are even invited to accompany the FBI when raids or arrests are being made on a target of interest to it.<P>
The biggest development for the ADL in the postwar period came as a result of the Jews' land-grab in the Middle East and the formation of the state of Israel. The coordinating center for B'nai B'rith's activities moved from New York to Jerusalem. Investigating, defaming, and intimidating Americans who did not agree with the Israel-first foreign policy of the U.S. government became one of the ADL's chief concerns. Patriots who protested Washington's failure to take reprisals in 1967 when the Israelis deliberately rocketed, strafed, and torpedoed the USS Liberty, killing 34 Americans and wounding 171 others, were denounced as <code>&quot;</code>anti-Semites<code>&quot;</code> by the ADL. In 1974, when NATIONAL VANGUARD editor William Pierce sued U.S. Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger in an effort to halt the flow of U.S. weapons and military supplies to Israel, the ADL jumped into the suit on the side of the government as an amicus curiae.<P>
As early as 1971, in sworn testimony in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, a top B'nai B'rith official, Saul Joftes, formerly director general of the B'nai B'rith's Office of International Affairs, admitted that B'nai B'rith <code>&quot;</code>engages in international politics and more often than not does the bidding of the government of Israel. Its leaders make frequent trips to Israel for indoctrination and instructions.<code>&quot;</code> The issue at stake in the court case was whether or not B'nai B'rith's U.S. affiliate -- and the ADL -- should be prosecuted for failing to register as agents of a foreign power under the U.S. Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938.<P>
The fix was in, however; by the 1970s the ADL and B'nai B'rith had become <code>&quot;</code>untouchables.<code>&quot;</code> Not only did they escape prosecution, they continued to operate as tax-exempt <code>&quot;</code>religious and charitable<code>&quot;</code> organizations.<P>
Silencing and discrediting Americans who disapproved of U.S. taxpayers' money being used to support Israel's wars of expansion in the Middle East was not the only ADL activity in the postwar period. The organization worked hard and effectively to advance other Jewish goals: the opponents of increased non-White immigration were attacked, aid was given to the pulling down of the barriers against racial mixing, new restrictions on the rights of citizens to keep and bear arms were supported. The ADL played a significant role in every facet of B'nai B'rith's program to demoralize, dilute, disorganize, and disarm White Americans -- all in the name of the fight against <code>&quot;</code>bigotry.<code>&quot;</code><P>
When, during the madness of the 1960s, the Jews finally succeeded in pushing through a new immigration law designed to bring more non-Whites into the United States, the ADL crowed about its success. The November 1965 issue of the ADL Bulletin, the group's internal publication, carried an article by the director of the ADL's law department, Sol Rabkin, who was present at the signing of the new law by President Lyndon Johnson. (Also present at the signing was Benjamin R. Epstein, then the national director of the ADL.) Under the heading <code>&quot;</code>The restrictive national origins quota system is finally abolished -- after a forty year fight,<code>&quot;</code> Rabkin boasted: <code>&quot;</code>The Anti-Defamation League is proud of the educational role it played in helping to bring this about.<code>&quot;</code><P>
The same issue of the ADL Bulletin had a notice of the appointment of the director of the ADL's Washington office, Herman Edelsberg, to the government post of executive director of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, where he could work more effectively to force the racial mixing of employees in shops and offices all across America. In this regard it is interesting to note that the ADL actually has two <code>&quot;</code>equal opportunity<code>&quot;</code> programs. One -- that headed by Mr. Edelsberg in 1965 and by others since then -- is to give Blacks and other minorities precedence over Whites in hiring and promotion for blue-collar and clerical employment. The other is to oppose Black demands for precedence in admissions to law schools and medical schools, and for hiring and promotion in certain professional occupations where Jews are heavily over-represented.<P>
By the mid-1970s B'nai B'rith had had very substantial success in virtually every phase of its campaign to undermine White society in America. It still was moving aggressively on a dozen fronts: introducing resolutions to require <code>&quot;</code>Holocaust<code>&quot;</code> indoctrination for Gentile children in the public schools; demanding the rewriting of school textbooks and the reworking of school curricula to make them appropriately <code>&quot;</code>multi-cultural<code>&quot;</code> and eliminate what the ADL complained was the <code>&quot;</code>principally white, Protestant, Anglo-Saxon view of America<code>&quot;</code> presented by older texts and curricula; pushing Christian churches, both Protestant and Catholic, to make even further changes in their doctrines, so that their teachings about Jews would consist of nothing but the most fulsome praise; lobbying the government to punish American companies refusing to trade with Israel; asking for more restrictive anti-gun laws; etc.<P>
These ongoing programs were only a part of the ADL's activity, however. The late 1970s saw a slowing of the frantic social change which had kept America in turmoil for nearly two decades. Much of that turmoil had been planned and instigated by B'nai B'rith. Even before the beginning of the 1980s and the relative stasis of the Reagan era, B'nai B'rith was planning new programs to head off any White backlash which might undo the changes it had wrought in American society. A new emphasis on secret-police activity characterized these programs.<P>
At an ADL banquet in Palm Beach, Florida, early in 1975, as reported in the March 1975 issue of the ADL Bulletin, ADL Chairman Seymour Graubard boasted that the <code>&quot;</code>ADL, to the limits of its financial ability, is expanding its intelligence operation . . .<code>&quot;</code><P>
The building of dossiers on the opponents and potential opponents of the Jews' plan for America was no longer enough, however. During times of economic prosperity the old tactics of defamation and intimidation might be sufficient to keep the goyim in line, but a severe and prolonged economic decline could stiffen the spines of White Americans to the point where they no longer would be frightened into silence by the ADL's power of the smear. It became prudent, in the view of the leaders of B'nai B'rith, to enlist the police powers of government in order to silence and disarm their critics before any substantial backlash developed. To this end the ADL launched a new legislative lobbying campaign of ominous import.<P>
The ADL's lawyers drew up a series of <code>&quot;</code>model statutes<code>&quot;</code> to be introduced by the organization's agents into the Congress and state legislatures. Some of these ADL-designed statutes are aimed at a more rapid phasing-out of citizens' rights to keep and bear arms. The ADL always has been a leading advocate of gun control -- much more so than the public has realized, because often while other gun-control organizations are out front holding press conferences and making headlines, it is the ADL pulling the strings for them behind the scenes. Beginning in the 1980s, however, there was a new urgency to the organization's efforts. The rationale used by the ADL now is that new, sweeping anti-gun laws are needed to protect law-abiding citizens from <code>&quot;</code>right-wing terrorism.<code>&quot;</code> The ADL Bulletin has warned that <code>&quot;</code>arms and stores of ammunition are being collected in uncounted numbers, and extremists have made clear that they are ready to use them.<code>&quot;</code> To back up this claim that armed White <code>&quot;</code>extremists<code>&quot;</code> are a growing menace the ADL has fed a steady stream of alarmist reports to the controlled news media. An excellent illustration of the way in which the ADL has carried on its anti-gun campaign is provided by its <code>&quot;</code>model anti-paramilitary training statute,<code>&quot;</code> designed to prevent White patriots from acquiring or providing instruction in the martial arts.<P>
The organization unveiled this model statute in 1980. By November 1981 the ADL Bulletin was able to boast that ADL agents had succeeded in having bills based on the statute enacted into law by the legislatures of California, Connecticut, and North Carolina. By early 1987 the number of states which had knuckled under to ADL pressure had grown to 14. The ADL Bulletin for March 1987 reported on its success in having one major newspaper serve as an ADL mouthpiece in this regard: <code>&quot;</code>In the Atlanta Constitution, ADL's model anti-paramilitary training statute won editorial words of praise while the newspaper suggested that Georgia should pass such a law.<P>
The article reported that ADL has spotted secret camps from Alabama to California and from Connecticut to Texas which have <code>&quot;</code>a mix of vitriol and violence (that) poses a danger to all peace-loving Americans but particularly to minorities. There ought to be a law against paramilitary camps of this kind -- and in 14 states there is,<code>&quot;</code> said the editorial.<<P>
The piece went on to praise the fact that while holding pathological hatemongers at bay, the ADL model aims to satisfy such constitutional considerations as the rights of free speech and free association.<BR>
<code>&quot;</code>The ADL's steamroller had picked up considerable speed by 1987, and just three months later the June 1987 issue of the ADL Bulletin bragged: <code>&quot;</code>Now there are 18. The number of states adopting anti-paramilitary training statutes based on ADL's model legislation has reached 18 with Georgia, West Virginia, Virginia, and Idaho enacting such laws in recent months.&quot;<P>
In a letter to Howard Ross, director of ADL's Western Pennsylvania-West Virginia Regional Office, West Virginia's Governor Arch A. Moore, Jr., expressed his appreciation for the League's cooperation in moving the legislation to passage.<P>
<code>&quot;</code>The ADL also worked diligently to subvert the law-enforcement establishment and to put as many individual law-enforcement officers into its pockets as possible. For the chiefs of big-city police departments, expense-paid <code>&quot;</code>fact finding<code>&quot;</code> trips to Israel could be arranged. For others there were ADL-sponsored <code>&quot;</code>training seminars,<code>&quot;</code> where politically ambitious police officials could be told of the advantages to be had by directing more of their energies and resources to the repression of <code>&quot;</code>White extremists.<code>&quot;</code> <P>
For example, the October 1987 issue of the ADL Bulletin reported: <code>&quot;</code>Some 200 law-enforcement officers ranging from FBI agents to chiefs of police, sheriffs, and attorneys general in the 13 Western states from California to Wyoming attended a special seminar on combatting terrorism, arranged by Betsy Rosenthal, ADL's Western Civil Rights area director, and Harvey B. Schechter, Western States area director.<P>
The Los Angeles Police Academy was the scene of the all-day session. The keynote speakers were Arieh Ivtsan, Israel's Ambassador to Liberia and immediate past commissioner of the Israeli National Police Force, and Irwin Suall, director of ADL's Civil Rights Division Fact Finding Department.<P>
Packets distributed to the attendees included ADL's reports on <code>&quot;</code>Extremism Targets the Prisons<code>&quot;</code> and <code>&quot;</code>Propaganda of the Deed,<code>&quot;</code> the League's Security Handbook and a list of recent publications on extremism and extremist groups with an ADL-prepared synopsis. <code>&quot;</code>By sponsoring such seminars the ADL has reinforced its image as a quasi-governmental agency, to which genuine law-enforcement agencies are justified in turning for advice and information. Perhaps most important, policemen and police agencies accustomed to thinking of their responsibility as combatting drug dealers, robbers, rapists, burglars, automobile thieves, murderers, and the like are informed that there is a new type of criminal about which they should be even more concerned: the <code>&quot;</code>extremist.<code>&quot;</code> <P>
The ADL, of course, defines the term for them and tells them who fits the definition.<P>
Despite the ADL's pretense of concern for <code>&quot;</code>Constitutional considerations,<code>&quot;</code> its model anti-paramilitary training law, in fact, totally disregards the rights of free speech and free association. It prohibits certain types of speech, if that speech is involved in training or instruction in the martial arts, and it prohibits association for the purpose of hearing such speech. And the ADL campaign to push its model law through all of the state legislatures is based on fraud, deceit, and political corruption.<BR>
The way it worked in West Virginia provides a good illustration. There has not been any paramilitary training in that state -- at least, not within the memory of any news reporters or law-enforcement people there spoken to by this writer: no reason, in other words, for even the most timid of West Virginia's minority citizens (barely two percent of the state's population) to feel threatened by paramilitary activity -- and so not a very good prospect for the ADL's anti-paramilitary training law. Then, in mid-1985, William Pierce, editor of this magazine and author (using his nom de plume Andrew Macdonald) of The Turner Diaries, a novel about urban guerrilla warfare and White revolution, left his home of 18 years in the Washington, D.C., area and resettled himself on a mountainside in a remote, wilderness area of West Virginia, the better to commune with his God and write the words which need to be written about this troubled era.<BR>
That was all the ADL needed to launch its campaign in the state. The only newspaper printed in West Virginia which is circulated statewide is the Charleston Gazette, and it is entirely at the disposal of the ADL. Early in 1986 it carried the first of a series of ADL-sponsored scare stories about Dr. Pierce's move to the state. He had not come to West Virginia to meditate and to write, the stories claimed, but to build a terrorist training camp. The 360 acres of forested mountain land he had bought were regularly referred to as <code>&quot;</code>a compound.<code>&quot;</code> It was surrounded by an electrified fence patrolled by armed men. One of the buildings on the land was located directly over a <code>&quot;</code>large complex of limestone caverns reported to be heavily stocked with weapons.<code>&quot;</code> It was believed that missile silos were being dug into the mountainside. Supporting these alarmist stories was the local sheriff, who happily provided newsmen with confirmation about the electrified fence, the weapons-filled caves, and the armed men. The <code>&quot;</code>compound,<code>&quot;</code> he asserted, was adjacent to one of the largest wilderness areas in the eastern United States, and he was quite worried about any run-in with Dr. Pierce or his associates which might involve <code>&quot;</code>gunplay.<code>&quot;</code><P>
The ADL then trotted the sheriff over to the state legislature in Charleston to tell the same story to the state's lawmakers. West Virginia politics is probably not much more corrupt than that of other states, such as Massachusetts, New York, and New Jersey. But that's bad enough, and the ADL was able to enlist the state's attorney general, Charlie Brown, and its governor, Arch Moore, as well as the aforementioned sheriff, in its campaign to protect the citizens of West Virginia from Dr. Pierce and his terrorist training camp. The attorney general spoke at meetings and seminars organized by the ADL to alert the public to the danger. And as usual the Jewish group rounded up a number of non-Jewish groups to front for it: the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the West Virginia Education Association, a board of Presbyterian preachers, the Rainbow Coalition, and several others. The ADL named its collection of front groups <code>&quot;</code>Citizens for Passage of an Unlawful Paramilitary Training Act<code>&quot;</code> and, operating it like a ventriloquist's dummy, called for the enactment of its model statute in the name of <code>&quot;</code>the citizens of West Virginia.<code>&quot;</code><P>
There was, of course, not a shred of truth in the stories about electrified fences, weapons-filled caves, missile silos, or training camps of any sort, terrorist or otherwise. But the news media being what they are, and politics being what it is, there were no news stories to contradict those of the Charleston Gazette, and no member of the state legislature saw fit to investigate the matter himself, even to the extent of taking a personal look at the alleged terrorist training camp or giving Dr. Pierce a telephone call to ask a few questions. The ADL's word on the matter was accepted, and the ADL's bill was enacted by the legislature and signed by the governor.<P>
Sneaking laws against paramilitary training through state legislatures is only one facet of the ADL's effort to disarm America's citizens, but it is an important facet because it reveals the political motive behind the ADL's anti-gun drive. The ADL is not concerned about drug addicts with <code>&quot;</code>Saturday night specials,<code>&quot;</code> but it is very much concerned about armed patriots who might not approve of the Jewish plan for America. The organization has been active recently in fanning the hysteria over <code>&quot;</code>assault<code>&quot;</code> rifles and in instigating the passage of laws at the state and local levels to prohibit their ownership. <P>
Even more dangerous than the ADL's anti-gun and anti-paramilitary activities, however, is its campaign to establish a new category of crime: so-called <code>&quot;</code>hate crime.<code>&quot;</code> Defined roughly, it is any act or speech motivated by hostile feelings based on race, ethnicity, religion, or sexual orientation. Thus, if you are a White man, and you punch a Black man in the nose because you do not like Blacks as a general rule, it is not simply an assault; it is a <code>&quot;</code>hate crime,<code>&quot;</code> and if you are convicted of it in a jurisdiction where the ADL has succeeded in having its model <code>&quot;</code>ethnic intimidation<code>&quot;</code> bill enacted into law, you will be sent to prison for three times as long as if you'd punched your mother-in-law instead (assuming she's White).<P>
A <code>&quot;</code>hate crime<code>&quot;</code> also occurs if you are a White person who is generally well disposed toward Blacks, but you become engaged in a shouting match with one of them -- perhaps a dispute over a parking space -- and in the heat of the fray call him a <code>&quot;</code>Black bastard.<code>&quot;</code> That, you see, is <code>&quot;</code>ethnic intimidation,<code>&quot;</code> even if no blows are exchanged, and the ADL would like to send you to the state penitentiary for five years for it. You also commit a <code>&quot;</code>hate crime<code>&quot;</code> if you shout <code>&quot;</code>nigger!<code>&quot;</code> at a Black driver who cuts you off on the highway.<P>
The ADL has been promoting <code>&quot;</code>hate crime<code>&quot;</code> laws for more than a decade. The January 1981 issue of the ADL Bulletin reported: <code>&quot;</code>A joint New York State/ADL Committee on Public Policy has endorsed legislation. . . which would make graffitti and harassment based on religion, ethnicity, and race an offense under Civil Rights statutes [emphasis added]. The New Jersey regional office [of the ADL] is working with both the State Police and the County Prosecutor's Association. At ADL's initiative an Ethnic Terrorism Bill, which would change the act of anti-Semitic or racial vandalism from a misdemeanor to a third-degree crime has been introduced in the New Jersey Legislature.<code>&quot;</code>Less than a year later, in November 1981, the ADL Bulletin was able to boast: <code>&quot;</code>Gov. Brendan Byrne of New Jersey signed into law an ethnic terrorism bill that makes racial or religious vandalism a crime punishable by three to five years in prison and a fine of up to $7,500.<P>
ADL's regional board called for such legislation in 1979. . . and ADL was in the forefront of the two-year effort to win passage of the bill. <code>&quot;</code>Much of the early ADL propaganda in favor of <code>&quot;</code>hate crime<code>&quot;</code> legislation attempted to cloak the ADL's true aim behind a pretended concern for protecting places of worship from <code>&quot;</code>religious vandalism.<code>&quot;</code> Thus the February 1982 issue of the ADL Bulletin reported: <code>&quot;</code>ADL has developed a model religious vandalism law to provide those states that do not have such legislation with a single, comprehensive, constitutionally sound approach to this problem.<P>
The model statute's first and second sections create penalties for vandalism against houses of worship, cemeteries, schools and community centers, and also for committing certain crimes <code>&quot;</code>by reason of the race, color, religion or national origin of another person<code>&quot;</code> [emphasis added].<code>&quot;</code><P>
A year later, in February 1983, the ADL Bulletin was able to claim substantial progress at the state level: <code>&quot;</code>Mr. Perlmutter [then the ADL's national director] expressed the hope that other states would follow the lead of the 12 thus far -- Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Washington -- which have enacted laws imposing stiffer penalties for persons convicted of religious or racial vandalism or other acts motivated by bigotry [emphasis added].<code>&quot;</code><P>
At that time the ADL, however, was still far short of its ultimate legislative goal: a Federal law prohibiting any expression of hostility toward, or any criticism of, Jews or other non-Whites by Whites. In the mid-1980s it shifted the emphasis of its campaign from the state to the national level. Its strategy was two-pronged: first, to condition legislators and publicists and then the general public to accept the concept of <code>&quot;</code>hate crime<code>&quot;</code> as a distinct, new category of crime; and second, to persuade the American people that a new body of legislation is needed to protect them from such crime -- needed so urgently, in fact, that they should be willing to sacrifice the First and Second Amendments to the Constitution in order to be safe from a dangerous new breed of <code>&quot;</code>hate criminals.<code>&quot;</code><P>
To implement the first prong of that strategy the ADL formulated another of its <code>&quot;</code>model statutes<code>&quot;</code>: a hate-crimes statistics reporting statute. Lobbying intensely, the ADL used its media outlets to publicize its own statistics, which not surprisingly showed a sharp rise in <code>&quot;</code>hate crimes<code>&quot;</code> throughout the latter half of the decade. A Federal law was needed, the ADL claimed, to track such crime. In January 1990 the organization reported that <code>&quot;</code>hate crimes<code>&quot;</code> had reached an all-time high during 1989. Leading the list were 1,432 <code>&quot;</code>anti-Semitic incidents<code>&quot;</code> reported by its agents around the country, ranging from swastikas daubed on driveways to arson. In April 1990 the Congress passed, and President Bush signed, the desired law. The new Hate Crimes Statistics Act requires the Justice Department to gather the statistics that the ADL formerly had gathered. All incidents in which hatred or prejudice based on race, ethnicity, religion, or sexual orientation is alleged to be a motive will henceforth be subject to special Federal scrutiny and record keeping. If a homosexual in Norfolk, Virginia, makes a pass at a sailor and has his teeth knocked out for his trouble, the Justice Department in Washington wants to know all about it. If a Vietnamese <code>&quot;</code>refugee<code>&quot;</code> in Los Angeles finds a <code>&quot;</code>gooks go home<code>&quot;</code> message chalked on the windshield of his car, the FBI will investigate. It's the law now.<P>
One might wonder why the ADL went to so much trouble to persuade the Federal government to duplicate one of the Jewish group's functions. The reason, of course, is not that more crime statistics are needed by anyone, least of all by the ADL; it is that now the Federal government has officially recognized the ADL's definition of a new category of crime. Now it will be the government, not just some Jewish group with a strange name, investigating and publicizing every hostile word or act based on race, religion, or sexual orientation. That is the first step toward persuading the Congress to enact, and the public to accept, new laws.<P>
There will continue to be a screen of words -- <code>&quot;</code>terrorism,<code>&quot;</code> <code>&quot;</code>religious vandalism,<code>&quot;</code> and <code>&quot;</code>hate, hate, hate<code>&quot;</code> -- thrown up to disguise the true goals of those pushing for Federal <code>&quot;</code>hate crime<code>&quot;</code> legislation. As a result of this obfuscation the impression in many minds will be that the purpose of such legislation is merely to penalize those who paint swastikas on Jewish tombstones or set fire to synagogues. Who could object to a law against that? What the ADL really has in mind is revealed by an incident which occurred at the beginning of this year in West Milford, New Jersey. A young White man, 22-year-old Richard E. Lindstrom, stuck a three-inch by five-inch, orange-and-black sticker on a traffic sign and was arrested by a policeman who saw him do it. The message on the sticker was: <code>&quot;</code>Earth's most endangered species: the White race. Help preserve it. Write or call National Alliance, ...<code>&quot;</code> Ordinarily one would expect someone in Mr. Lindstrom's position to receive a citation for littering. In 1981, however, the ADL had succeeded in persuading the legislators of New Jersey to enact a so-called <code>&quot;</code>Ethnic Terrorism Law,<code>&quot;</code> and he was charged under that law. He was facing as much as five years in prison and a fine of $7,500 for posting a sticker asking the public to help preserve the White race.<P>
Anyone who understands the B'nai B'rith mentality can see the logic in that. To suggest that the White race (and, of course, one understands that <code>&quot;</code>White<code>&quot;</code> means European, or Aryan, excluding Semites) ought to be preserved is to challenge the Yahweh-given right of the Sons of the Covenant to rule the earth and its peoples as they see fit. That's clearly anti-Semitic. That stabs terror into the heart of every righteous Holocaust survivor. Therefore, Mr. Lindstrom committed an act of <code>&quot;</code>ethnic terrorism<code>&quot;</code> and ought to be put away for good.<P>
Under the circumstances, however, to have tried him on an <code>&quot;</code>ethnic terrorism<code>&quot;</code> charge at this time would have been premature and might even have jeopardized the ADL's campaign for a comprehensive Federal <code>&quot;</code>hate crime<code>&quot;</code> law. There were vague mutterings from the American Civil Liberties Union, and it was even conceivable that some of the more loosely controlled elements in the news media might publicize the case and cause a White backlash around the country. Cooler heads in the local ADL office eventually prevailed, and the charge against Mr. Lindstrom was reduced to one of littering. Five years from now they might be able to make the <code>&quot;</code>ethnic terrorism<code>&quot;</code> charge stick, but not in 1990.<P>
To ensure that they not only will have the Federal laws in place they are seeking by the end of this decade, but also will be able to make them stick, the ADL and other Jewish groups are coordinating their efforts. For the past few years they have been using the controlled entertainment media in an especially insidious way to condition the American people to accept passively the yoke planned for them. They have created a new film genre -- the <code>&quot;</code>White terrorist<code>&quot;</code> film -- to persuade the public that there is a growing danger from armed White <code>&quot;</code>haters.<code>&quot;</code><P>
In 1987 we were hit with Into the Homeland, a film which attempts to convince East Coast city dwellers that the rural heartland of the Midwest is on the point of being taken over by heavily armed Christian Fundamentalists who not only don't like non-Whites, but who deal murderously with anyone of any hue who gets in their way. Only viewers with sharp eyes will catch the acknowledgement to the ADL among the credits at the end of the film. The film uses the scenario developed in a special report issued by the ADL in 1986, <code>&quot;</code>The American Farmer and the Extremists.<code>&quot;</code><P>
In 1988 we were treated to a number of other films of the same ilk, the three most notable of them being Betrayed, Skinheads -- the Second Coming of Hate, and Talk Radio. The first of this trio, which was the most widely seen, portrays the White <code>&quot;</code>haters<code>&quot;</code> of the rural Midwest as not only heavily armed but also well organized and well financed, with top-level political connections in Washington. Their favorite Saturday-night pastime is to kidnap a Black from a nearby town, turn him loose in the woods, and then hunt him down and kill him.<P>
Skinheads -- the Second Coming of Hate is the first in a series of Jewish films portraying working-class urban White youths who affect the skinhead dress and tonsure as viciously depraved, murderous thugs who hate not only Blacks and Jews but the whole world. The guidelines for these films are set in several ADL publications, most notably <code>&quot;</code>`Shaved for Battle': Skinheads Target America's Youth<code>&quot;</code> (1987) and <code>&quot;</code>Young and Violent: The Growing Menace of America's Neo-Nazi Skinheads<code>&quot;</code> (1988).<P>
Talk Radio, loosely based on the 1984 assassination of Jewish radio host Alan Berg in Denver, allegedly by White revolutionaries, advances the thesis that people who haven't wholeheartedly embraced the brave, new pluralistic world of racial mixing, homosexuality, and feminism promoted by the ADL -- i.e., White racists -- are hair-trigger psychotics who may explode with murderous fury at the least provocation. It is the only one of the 1988 films which is even remotely credible to a sophisticated viewer. Most American television and cinema viewers are anything but sophisticated, unfortunately. The Jews already have succeeded in convincing many of them that certain completely legal acts or patterns of behavior are illegal. After seeing so many television episodes in which a hateful Ku Klux Klansman sneaks around like a criminal and is treated like a criminal by the other actors, the viewer can hardly be blamed for having the confused notion that there's something inherently illegal about being a member of the Ku Klux Klan.<P>
In 1989, among many others, we had Dead Bang and So Proudly We Hail, two anti-skinhead films which distort the skinhead life-style into something far beyond the bounds of reality. Skinheads are depicted as the violence-prone storm troopers of a huge, sophisticated, highly organized neo-Nazi network. The latter of these films was a made-for-TV film written and directed by Lionel Chetwynd of the American Jewish Committee. In a booklet published by the Jewish group in conjunction with the broadcast of the film over CBS-affiliated stations, Skinheads: Who They Are &amp; What to Do When They Come to Town, Chetwynd writes: <BLOCKQUOTE><code>&quot;</code><code>&quot;</code>So Proudly We Hail<code>&quot;</code> is my way of speaking out. Through a fictionalized account based on real events, the film demonstrates how hate can be cultivated and grown into ideology. <code>&quot;</code></BLOCKQUOTE>One can only wonder what <code>&quot;</code>real events<code>&quot;</code> Chetwynd had in mind. The film shows a neo-Nazi organization developed to a level that real neo-Nazis can only dream about. And it drags out old, long-discredited Jewish canards about lampshades made from the skin of flayed Jewish concentration-camp victims and the like. The bulk of the American Jewish Committee's booklet shows as little regard for the truth as the film itself, consisting mainly of absurdly exaggerated claims of the menace to ordinary citizens from skinheads and exhortations to support various Jewish <code>&quot;</code>model statutes<code>&quot;</code> on <code>&quot;</code>hate crimes<code>&quot;</code> and outlawing semiautomatic weapons.<P>
In 1990, the <code>&quot;</code>White terrorist<code>&quot;</code> genre is expanding to include segments of several popular cops-and-robbers television series, as well as full-length films. And the dual purpose remains: to both repulse and frighten the average American. Racially conscious White men and women must be perceived by the conforming television viewer as both hateful and dangerous.<P>
Within the next few years the ADL hopes to have enforceable Federal <code>&quot;</code>hate crime<code>&quot;</code> legislation in place which, in the name of preventing <code>&quot;</code>religious vandalism<code>&quot;</code> or <code>&quot;</code>ethnic intimidation,<code>&quot;</code> will make it illegal to print, possess, sell, or post a sticker of the sort Richard Lindstrom put on a traffic sign in West Milford, New Jersey, earlier this year. Not just stickers, but also books, pamphlets, leaflets -- or any public utterance -- offensive to a racial or religious minority or to homosexuals will be outlawed. Whether or not a person was motivated by a dislike for Blacks, Jews, homosexuals, or some other officially protected minority when he took some action against one of them will determine his punishment, and anything that he has said or written in the past may be used to infer what his motivation was. <code>&quot;</code>Hate crime<code>&quot;</code> will have become <code>&quot;</code>thought crime.<code>&quot;</code><P>
Lest there be any doubt that this is what the Jews actually are aiming for, consider the following comments by Jewish lawyer Bruce Fein, who writes on legal topics for a number of publications. The comments come from a feature article by him published in the May 1, 1990, edition of the Washington Times, and the article in turn is based on his remarks at an Oxford-Northwestern Debate in Washington the preceding month: <BLOCKQUOTE><code>&quot;</code>Should speech intended to ignite religious or racial animosity be prohibited? Let the answer speak from the weeping cemeteries around the world overflowing with the victims of racial and religious prejudice. ...What is the paramount purpose of speech in a civilized society? It is to trigger contemplation, reason and tolerance for competing ideas as the moving force for private and political action. ...What is the purpose of racially or religiously bigoted speech? It is to arouse unthinking hatred, violence and intolerance in the audience... In sum, the invectives of the racial or religious bigot are no more free speech than is [sic] the vulgar pornographic ululations of Annie Sprinkle a cousin of the Bolshoi Ballet. If the law supposes otherwise, as Mr. Bumble observed, <code>&quot;</code>the law is a ass, a idiot.<code>&quot;</code> If racially or religiously bigoted speech were innocuous, then it might be ignored by governments. But it is not.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The ugliest marks in the history of the United States have stemmed from the incitements to racial prejudice practiced by Theodore Bilbo, Orville Faubus, the Ku Klux Klan, and the producers of <code>&quot;</code>The Birth of a Nation.<code>&quot;</code> Diatribes of these types create an explosive social nitroglycerine waiting for an epithet or racial incident to spark violence. ...It is said that if racially or religiously bigoted speech is squelched, there will be no stopping point to prevention of genuine free speech. Nonsense! The progress of civilization has been the progress of making refinements and differentiations in the law. Prohibitions on racially or religiously derogatory speech have existed in the United States, Canada, Great Britain, West Germany, and elsewhere without undermining democracy, political dissent or debate. ...Prohibiting racially and religiously bigoted speech is praiseworthy because it seeks to elevate, not to degrade, because it draws from human experience, not from woolly dogmas or academic slogans, because it salutes reason as the backbone of freedom and tolerance. Is that clear enough?<code>&quot;</code></BLOCKQUOTE>
Those <code>&quot;</code>woolly dogmas<code>&quot;</code> and <code>&quot;</code>academic slogans<code>&quot;</code> this smart-mouth Jew boy dismisses with a sneer are the things that the founders of this nation were prepared to defend with their lives, things that men of our race have given their lives for often in the past. He and his fellow Jews evidently believe, however, that the present generation of Americans have had their minds and their spines sufficiently softened by 40 years of Jewish propaganda so that they won't even look up from their television screens when our freedom to speak our minds is taken away from us and Jewish <code>&quot;</code>reason<code>&quot;</code> becomes the law of the land.<P>
He is correct, of course, in indicating that speech is restricted in many other countries -- although hardly without undermining dissent or debate. In Canada, Great Britain, West Germany, France, and Sweden, to mention just a few places, the Jews have succeeded in making it a criminal offense to question their perennially profitable <code>&quot;</code>Holocaust<code>&quot;</code> claims, for example. The German-Canadian publisher Ernst Z&uuml;ndel, whose case has been discussed several times in these pages, has been convicted and sentenced in Canada for that very <code>&quot;</code>hate crime.<code>&quot;</code> In Sweden last December a radio broadcaster was sentenced to prison and the license of his station was revoked because he criticized Israeli actions against Palestinians in a way that Jews considered derogatory.<P>
George Orwell missed the date by a few years -- at least, for the United States -- but it is clear that if B'nai B'rith has its way the Thought Police will be a fact of life here in the near future, and racism will be a crime -- not Jewish racism (also known as Zionism), of course, or Black racism, just racism of the White variety. Mr. Fein and his compatriots in the ADL are counting on having patriotic Americans disarmed by that time, so that they will be powerless to resist those designated by the government to enforce the laws against <code>&quot;</code>thought crime.<code>&quot;</code> Be that as it may, Fein and Company should be aware that there still will be a few White Americans, with or without assault rifles, willing to die for their freedom -- but they don't intend to be the only ones to die. Got that, Jew boy?<P>

The motto of Israel's spy agency, Mossad, is, according to recently defected Mossad agent Victor Ostrovsky: <code>&quot;</code>By way of deception thou shalt do war.<code>&quot;</code> <P>
That motto describes more than the modus operandi of the world's most ruthless and feared organization of professional assassins and espionage agents; it really describes the modus vivendi of an entire race. It is necessary to understand that fact before one can hope to understand fully the role of the Jews in national and world affairs.<P>
The concept of a race eternally at war with the rest of the world is alien to us. It is difficult to believe or even to grasp. When we examine such a concept and begin sifting the evidence it is easy to become confused. On the one hand we have the Old Testament injunctions to the Hebrews from their tribal god, speaking through their prophets, to annihilate every Gentile nation over which they gain power:<BR>
<code>&quot;</code>And thou shalt consume all the peoples which the Lord thy God shall deliver unto thee; thine eye shall not pity them...thou shalt save alive nothing that breatheth.<code>&quot;</code> (Deuteronomy 7:16, 20:16)<P>
Similarly bloodthirsty, explicit injunctions are repeated so often in the Jews' holy books that we can only assume that they are meant to be taken seriously. The historical evidence suggests that in ancient times the Jews did indeed take their religion seriously: they were notorious everywhere and at all times as implacable haters of humanity who in turn were thoroughly despised by every other people among whom they lived.<P>
Then on the other hand we have the modern, American Jew in the role of humanitarian, shunning the instruments of war and urging that all citizens, including himself, be disarmed, in order to make the streets of our cities kinder and gentler. Not only do the Jews provide the principal impetus to America's gun-control effort, but they are found in the forefront of every other squishy, do-good movement, from those ostensibly aimed at reducing hostility between the races to those designed to increase tolerance of homosexuals and their practices.<P>
How are we to make sense of this apparently conflicting evidence?<BR>
Is the Jew in the U.S. Congress who cites the rising murder statistics and then demands that the government confiscate all privately owned firearms trying to deceive us as to his intentions? When he talks peace and disarmament is he really thinking war against the Gentiles? And what of the carefully cultivated media image of the Jew as a gentle, inoffensive victim of bigotry, always being persecuted but never persecuting others? Is that also deception? And even if it is, does it necessarily mean that beneath the Jew's mask of benevolence and innocence hides the malevolent visage of a cunning predator? Perhaps for every bloodsucking Jewish swindler like Ivan Boesky or Michael Milken there is a Jewish benefactor of mankind like polio vaccine developer Jonas Salk, and for every bloody-handed Jewish gangster like Ariel Sharon, Meyer Lansky, or Yitzhak Shamir there is a Jewish Nobel Peace Prize winner like Menachem Begin, Henry Kissinger--or the appropriately named Elie Wiesel. Or are we also being deceived when the Salks and the Kissingers are held up to us as reasons for not condemning all Jews for the transgressions of some?<P>
By way of deception thou shalt do war.<BR>
Does that injunction mean: <code>&quot;</code>If you must wage war--if it is impossible to avoid war--then you stand a better chance of winning by being tricky<code>&quot;</code>? Or does it mean: <code>&quot;</code>Thou shalt wage war, and thou shalt deceive<code>&quot;</code>?<P>
The answer to this question is important. If it is the former--if the Jews, as a whole, are not malevolent, if they have broken with their Old Testament tradition and no longer feel that their racial mission is to destroy all other peoples, but they merely feel that when forced to defend themselves they are justified in using all means, including deception, then we may be able to live on the same planet with them, at a distance. We don't have to like them or agree with their policies, but we can see the possibility, at least, of some sort of peaceful coexistence, once a separation of peoples has been accomplished.<P>
In seeking the answer we should keep in mind that deception is, in itself, hostile. A policy of systematic deception is tantamount to a policy of war. If we discover that the Jews (as a whole, not just a few swindlers among them) have been deceiving us deliberately and systematically over an extended period of time on any matter of substance, then we may infer that they regard the relationship between us as one of war, and we should respond accordingly.<P>
The pursuit of this inference may be the only path to an unmuddied answer. After all, how do we know that someone is waging war against us? If he makes an open declaration of war and then begins shooting and bombing us, the matter is clear enough. But if, because he always follows a policy of deception, he declares that he is not at war with us and only has our best interests at heart, we may have difficulty in deciding whether the injury he causes us is deliberate or inadvertent.<P>
Suppose he undertakes courses of action which damage us in ways somewhat less directly than shooting and bombing--ways such as bringing hordes of non-Whites across our borders, breaking down the barriers to racial mixing in our society, encouraging permissiveness, undermining our institutions, promoting cultural bolshevism--all the while claiming that he does not regard these things as harmful. If we were a more practical people we might pay less attention to what the Jew says and more to what he does; we might stop worrying about his motive, judge him on the basis of the effect his presence has had on us, and then act accordingly. Unfortunately, there are many who cannot in good conscience take a stand against the Jew without knowing what is in his heart--and the Jew is aware of this. We must catch him deliberately lying to us, deceiving us systematically and massively, in order to infer that his intent is hostile.<P>
That's one reason why the unraveling of the <code>&quot;</code>Holocaust<code>&quot;</code> myth is so important to us--and why the Jew clings so desperately to every lie in its fabric.<P>
We should draw some sort of conclusion from the consistency of the Jew's actions. Virtually everything he does is harmful to us. Without much exaggeration we can say that whenever the Jew takes a stand on a new issue, the proper position for us is on the other side. Everyone who has read any Jewish literature--i.e., literature by Jews about Jews--has encountered the traditional Jewish character who whenever he must make a decision about something the goyim have done asks himself: <code>&quot;</code>Is it good for the Jews?<code>&quot;</code> That's an admirable trait in any person, Jew or Gentile: always being concerned first about the welfare of his community, of his tribe, of his race. The Jewish author more often than not sprinkles a bit of dissimulation over it, however, suggesting that it may be unfashionably parochial, but it is excusable on the grounds that the Jews have been obliged by bitter experience to be wary of anything the Gentile does. It goes without saying, of course, that the same author would regard it as totally inexcusable for a Gentile to use a similar criterion: to ask himself about some policy or action of the Jews, <code>&quot;</code>Is it good for the White race, for Gentiles?<code>&quot;</code> Such a character could only be cast in the role of villain. And what we never encounter in Jewish literature is a Jewish character weighing a Jewish policy by asking himself: <code>&quot;</code>Is it bad for the goyim?<code>&quot;</code> Unspoken though it may be, however, it seems that this criterion plays as large a role as the first in determining Jewish policies.<P>
Perhaps to them it is just another way of saying the same thing--although they are very careful not to phrase it that way. At least, they have been since the Second World War; before that they sometimes seemed to think that the goyim couldn't read, and chutzpah got the better of discretion. In 1924, for example, the prominent Jewish publicist Maurice Samuel, author of a score of serious books on Jewish matters and recipient of numerous awards from Jewish organizations, wrote in his You Gentiles, a book addressed to his hosts:<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE><code>&quot;</code>We Jews, we, the destroyers, will remain the destroyers forever. Nothing that you will do will meet our needs and demands. We will forever destroy because we need a world of our own, a God-world, which it is not in your nature to build.<code>&quot;</code></BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
Even here, however, there is deception, with the will to destroy masked as piety.<P>
Think of the enormous demographic and social changes which have transformed our world since the Second World War. In 1941 the United States was for all practical purposes a White country. Blacks and other minorities existed, but they were not seen in White residential areas, White schools, White recreational facilities, or most White workplaces. They had a negligible influence on the political process, on public morality, and on the national culture. Racial intermarriage was illegal in most jurisdictions and extremely rare everywhere. America's city streets were safe by night and by day. There was no drug problem; the use of marijuana, heroin, and other drugs was confined almost entirely to Blacks and Hispanics, in their own, separate communities. Teenage pregnancy (among Whites) was as rare as a public display of homosexuality. Schools were orderly, disciplined, and safe.<P>
America had its problems, of course. Whites, even when they are in control of their own destiny, are not angels. Greed, meanness, superstition, and stupidity were reflected in a thousand social and cultural ills. A thoroughly corrupt political system, inevitable in a democracy, provided the country with its top political leaders and public officials. Blacks and other racial minorities, though invisible and powerless, were a festering sore which eventually would have to be dealt with.<P>
The country, however, was still White and gave every indication of staying that way; in the years immediately prior to the war immigration to the United States was predominantly White, with immigrants from Europe outnumbering those from Asia and Latin America combined by five to one. America's problems were still soluble and Western civilization was still viable, still capable of being cleansed and renewed. Furthermore, in Germany a man was showing the race the way to save itself.<P>
In response to that man's efforts most of the Western world engaged in an all-out war to destroy him, his works, and his followers. His ideas and teachings became anathema, and the half-century which followed was dedicated to justifying the slaughter and destruction of the war by promoting the antitheses of those ideas and teachings.<P>
He had taught that the White race is the most progressive race and is inherently superior to the non-White races in its civilization-building capacity, and so the elevation of the social and economic levels of non-Whites at the expense of Whites became the premier postwar goal.<P>
He had taught that racial mixing is a crime against Nature, that our race must strive above all else to maintain the integrity of its gene pool, and so racial mixing became the postwar fashion: schoolchildren were bused to achieve mixing in the schools, forced housing laws were passed to achieve residential mixing, laws against miscegenation were struck down everywhere, and the immigration laws were changed to bring a new flood of non-Whites into the country.<P>
He had taught that the building of self-discipline in young people, the strengthening of their will-power and of their ability for self-control, is the most important task of a nation's educational system, and so in postwar America discipline became a dirty word, and permissiveness became the norm.He had taught that, just as races differ in their innate abilities, so also do the individuals within a race, and that a healthy and progressive society must conform its institutions to this natural inequality among its members. Consequently, in postwar America egalitarianism became the new religion, and leveling the aim of government. <P>
To seek out the best and brightest, in our schools and elsewhere, and give them the recognition and the special training to enable them to move upward to positions of leadership--even to admit the possibility that some were better and brighter than others and could contribute more to civilization--became taboo.<P>
He had taught a healthy, complementary relationship between men and women, with the former as providers and protectors and the latter as nurturers, and the new society he built in Germany was family centered, with laws and institutions aimed at strengthening the family and helping it to provide a sound environment for healthy children. <P>
Therefore, after his works were destroyed the victors denounced sexual complementarity as <code>&quot;</code>repressive<code>&quot;</code> and brought women out of the home and into the workforce by the millions, with children relegated to day-care centers. Every sex-role distinction was officially discouraged or outlawed, even to the point of bringing women into the armed forces on an equal footing with men. Feminism and homosexuality have flourished with governmental protection.Today we can see the consequences of these postwar policies all around us, and it is a matter of public record that the Jews have been the primary instigators and propagandists for each of these policies without exception.<P>
They had non-Jewish collaborators in abundance, of course. The legislator primarily responsible for the change in postwar immigration patterns, the late Jewish Congressman from Brooklyn, Emanuel Celler, for many years chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, chose as a co-sponsor for his 1965 immigration bill the Gentile Senator from Massachusetts Edward (Teddy) Kennedy. The <code>&quot;</code>civil rights<code>&quot;</code> revolutionaries who were organizing <code>&quot;</code>sit ins<code>&quot;</code> and <code>&quot;</code>freedom rides<code>&quot;</code> during the 1950s and 1960s received their financing, their legal assistance, and their media support from Jews, but without an utterly corrupt and unprincipled Gentile collaborator in the form of Lyndon Johnson, first as Senate majority leader (1955-1961) and later as President (1963-1968), the series of legislative coups which made the agenda of the revolutionaries the law of the land would not have come so easily.<P>
Collaboration has come from Blacks as well as Whites. Many of the organizations pushing for legislated <code>&quot;</code>equality<code>&quot;</code> between Blacks and Whites have been headed by Blacks in recent years. The most venerable of them, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, was given its first Black president as long ago as 1975, after an unbroken succession of Jews (although the separate NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, which bills itself as <code>&quot;</code>the legal arm of the civil rights movement,<code>&quot;</code> is still strictly kosher, with a Jewish chief).<P>
In no area of endeavor have the Jews had more willing non-Jewish collaborators than in the postwar promotion of permissiveness. Jews Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin may have been the most flamboyant spokesmen for permissiveness during the 1960s with their <code>&quot;</code>if it feels good, do it<code>&quot;</code> and <code>&quot;</code>kill your parents<code>&quot;</code> maxims for young Americans, but dozens of well-known Gentiles were right on their coattails, from <code>&quot;</code>New Age<code>&quot;</code> guru Timothy Leary with his campaign to popularize LSD and other psychedelic drugs to soft-porn publisher Hugh Hefner and his advocacy of <code>&quot;</code>the Playboy philosophy.<code>&quot;</code><P>
It is, after all, hardly the case that Jewry forced its way into America with tanks and machine guns and compelled the unwilling Aryans to stand by and watch while their civilization was destroyed and their race corrupted by the Semitic invaders. From the beginning the prey collaborated with the predators at all levels: the primitive Bible-beaters who for generations have been taught by their own kind that the Jews are <code>&quot;</code>God's Chosen People<code>&quot;</code> and that it's bad luck to cross them; the jaded, self-indulgent great grandsons and great granddaughters of an earlier generation of hard-headed, hard-working pioneers and entrepreneurs, eager to be amused and titillated by every new fashion in ideology, art, music, or life-style dangled before them by wordy, alien hucksters; hungry opportunists in business, in education, and in the cultural establishment, ready to take the part of the obnoxiously pushy but admirably well-organized strangers, once those strangers had established sufficiently strong beachheads to be able to offer favors in return; and, of course, the politicians, democracy's inevitable maggots, who are ready to ally themselves with the Devil himself if they think they can gain a temporary personal advantage by doing so.<P>
It is clear that when cleanup time comes there's as much weeding to be done in our own garden as in any other race's. An inattentive observer might even conclude that the Jews are no more blameworthy for the bad directions taken by our society than our own worst elements are; that as opportunists they merely look for ways to turn the weaknesses they find in us to their own advantage. Did they push for opening our borders to the Third World because they had a long-range plan to mongrelize us, or were they merely going along with greedy and irresponsible elements of our own race who wanted to keep the cost of labor down? Have they been the principal promoters behind every destructive fashion in painting and music in order to cut us loose from our cultural moorings, thereby confusing our sense of identity and making us easier prey, or simply because they have recognized the lack of aesthetic discrimination on the part of our consuming masses and are as eager as the confidence men of any race to sell the suckers whatever they'll buy? Do they use their control of the entertainment industry to promote the acceptance--and in many cases the approval--of homosexuality, feminism, and interracial sex as a way of softening us up morally and preparing us for slaughter, or are they simply trying to please and thereby win as customers for their commercial sponsors the more degenerate elements of our population?<P>
An inattentive observer might be stumped by such questions. A more attentive observer, however, will note the details, the specifics, as well as the generalities, and he will understand that those details, taken together, are not consistent with simple opportunism but only with war by way of deception.<P>
Forcing the stream of immigration into America after the Second World War to change from White to Brown and Yellow has most notably kept the cost of farm labor down, but Jews are not farmers, and it is difficult to see how they could expect to benefit economically from this change. The influx of non-White immigrants also has kept the cost of certain other types of labor down--restaurant workers, unskilled construction workers--but the connection to any vital Jewish business interest is tenuous at best.<P>
There can be no doubt that culture distortion has been enormously profitable for Jews. With a controlling economic interest in every facet of the popular-culture industry from art galleries to music records, tapes, and compact discs, they make money from nearly every product that the culture-consuming public can be persuaded to buy. And since no one has ever lost a nickel by underestimating the taste of the public, the deliberate Jewish debasement of art and music is understandable on the grounds of greed alone. But the specific directions are not. <P>
In the production and promotion of what might be called <code>&quot;</code>consumer music,<code>&quot;</code> for example, the one great change which has taken place since the Second World War has been the ascendancy of African rhythm over European music. Fifty years ago one could walk into any record store catering to the general public and find 78-rpm phonograph discs with a number of different types of music: classical, hillbilly (a form of White American folk music known today as <code>&quot;</code>bluegrass<code>&quot;</code> and subsumed under the more general heading <code>&quot;</code>country and western<code>&quot;</code>), numerous samples of genuine folk music from Europe, the religious music of the more primitive Christian fundamentalists (<code>&quot;</code>gospel<code>&quot;</code>), and a wide-ranging selection of <code>&quot;</code>popular<code>&quot;</code> music. The last category contained everything from the songs of Stephen Foster to the vacuous, fluffy stuff of the musical comedies which were especially popular then.<P>
Jews already had established a strong beachhead in popular music production--Sigmund Romberg, Richard Rodgers, Oscar Hammerstein, George Gershwin, Jerome Kern, Irving Berlin--but, at least, most popular music, even that composed by Jews, was still based on European forms. Jazz (and the <code>&quot;</code>swing<code>&quot;</code> and <code>&quot;</code>big band<code>&quot;</code> forms into which it evolved) was for all practical purposes the only non-White music being peddled to White consumers, and it constituted a relatively small minority of the wares. Eighty per cent of the music was White in form and origin, with classical music still very prominently represented. By the end of the Second World War jazz-influenced popular music was evolving away from its Black roots into hybrid forms that most people considered more White than Black.<P>
The introduction of the long-playing record, which for the first time permitted people to listen to an entire symphony without changing records, and of high-fidelity sound systems even brought about a renewal of public interest in classical music. At this point the people controlling the music industry could have moved in any of a number of directions. They chose to put their heaviest promotional efforts behind another music form with Black roots: rock 'n' roll.<P>
Rock also evolved, of course. Today in its many forms, some of which have moved rather far from their Black origins, it dominates consumer music. And the masters of the industry have begun pushing yet another non-White music form, more blatantly Negroid than anything heretofore: rap. Today one must look hard to find even a handful of classical cassettes or compact discs in the music section of a K-Mart or other consumer emporium. European folk music can be had only from a few specialty stores. The majority of the music offered to the consuming public is in some significant sense non-White. Economic democracy might be invoked to explain, at least in part, the displacement of structure by rhythm, as the taste of the average consumer has become more primitive. But it is clear that deliberate promotion has had much to do with this trend. Why have the promoters so consistently chosen directions which weaken and dilute the White cultural heritage?<P>
Certainly, the feminists, homosexuals, and race-mixers are pleased to see themselves depicted on television and cinema screens as people of a morally superior sort, as role models for the younger generation of goyim. Perhaps they even show their appreciation by buying more of the products of the sponsors of Star Trek, True Colors, and other brave, new television productions. But feminists, queers, and interracial couples still make up only a rather small minority of the population, despite the best efforts of the media masters. Wouldn't it make better economic sense to cater to the majority? There are as many approximately normal consumers who feel at least a twinge of disgust when a television program tries to persuade them that hard-drinking, hard-swearing female soldiers or cops are <code>&quot;</code>normal<code>&quot;</code> as there are bull-dykes who will run out and buy the sponsor's brand of beer. And there certainly must be more healthy viewers who seethe with suppressed rage when they see a White woman kissing a Black man on the screen than there are avant-garde sickos who applaud such an abomination.<P>
No, opportunism does not explain the Jews' destructiveness. There is no doubt that they are opportunists. But their opportunism is too consistently destructive. They have too inerrant an instinct for what will be bad for the goyim.<P>
Can their behavior be explained in terms of an alien brand of idealism--an idealism which evolved in the marketplaces and bazaars of the Middle East over the last five thousand years and is natural for them, but which leads to disaster when applied to European society and institutions? Was their support for communism from the middle of the last century up until its recent collapse really based on their sympathy for the oppressed proletariat and their desire for social and economic justice, as they claim? They themselves have been oppressed, they say, and so they have a natural sympathy for the underdog. They will tell you that the reason they promote feminism, argue for the acceptance of homosexuals, and demand the integration of Blacks into every facet of our lives is that their religion requires it of them; the ethics of Judaism is egalitarian, and it specifies that each man be judged only by his or her character.<P>
Undoubtedly there have been naive, starry-eyed idealists among communism's Gentile propagandists--at least, in those countries which had not yet experienced communism in practice; the great American writer Jack London was one, and there certainly may have been a few Jewish idealists of Marxism as well. But only a person who has no knowledge of communism in practice can believe that those who engineered its revolutionary triumph in Russia or commissared its institutions in Eastern Europe after the Second World War were seekers of justice for the workers.<P>
As for the claim that Jews have an affection for justice and equality greater than that of other races, we only need to look at the ways in which this alleged affection manifests itself in that part of the world where it should be seen in its purest form: namely, Israel and the Israeli-occupied Arab territories. Ask any Palestinian about Jewish justice!<P>
Judaism, of course, is unequivocally opposed to feminism and homosexuality--for Jews. Furthermore, it is a race-based religion, which defines its adherents in terms of their bloodline and declares them inherently superior to all other races. How does their promotion of feminism among the goyim, for instance, square with the well-known Jewish prayer, <I><code>&quot;</code>I thank you, oh Lord, for not having made me a goy, a slave, or a woman,<code>&quot;</code></I> which is recited every day by the Orthodox faithful? In the Talmud, that authoritative compendium of the Jewish oral law, there are a thousand other reminders to the Jew that he is absolutely superior to all other life forms:<BLOCKQUOTE> <code>&quot;</code>Heaven and earth were created only for the sake of the Jews.<code>&quot;</code> (Vayikra Rabba 36)</BLOCKQUOTE><P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><code>&quot;</code>The Jews are human beings, but the goyim are not human beings; they are only beasts.<code>&quot;</code> (Baba Mezia 114)<code>&quot;</code></BLOCKQUOTE><P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Yahweh created the non-Jew in human form so that the Jew would not have to be served by beasts. The non-Jew is consequently an animal in human form and is condemned to serve the Jew day and night.<code>&quot;</code> (Midrash Talpioth 225)</BLOCKQUOTE><P>
So much for Jewish egalitarianism. Jewish solicitude for Blacks in America today is as much a fraud as was the claim of Jewish sympathy for the oppressed proletariat of Russia on the eve of the Bolshevik Revolution.<P>
What truly lies in the Jewish heart was revealed by an exceptional Jew, Baruch Spinoza (like Ostrovsky, a renegade), who wrote in the 17th century:<P>
<code>&quot;</code>The love of the Hebrews for their country was not only patriotism but also piety and was cherished and nurtured by daily rites until, like their hatred of other nations, it was absolutely perverse. . .  Such daily reprobation naturally gave rise to a lasting hatred, deeply implanted in the heart: for of all hatred, none is more deep and tenacious than that which springs from extreme devoutness or piety and is itself cherished as pious.<code>&quot;</code> (Tractatus Theologico-Politicus, Chapter 17)<P>
The Jewish role in the non-Jewish world and the Jewish motivation for the policies pursued by the Jewish community would be much easier to perceive if the Jews acted in a more consistent and straightforward way: if they spoke with a single voice and spoke truly, saying what really was on their minds. But, then, consistency and straightforwardness would violate the cardinal rule: By way of deception thou shalt do war. Nevertheless, on a somewhat higher plane of subtlety, there is a consistency in the Jews' inconsistency. On virtually every major issue--political, social, cultural, moral, or what have you--where there are two principal sides or factions, one will find Jews pushing in both directions and serving as spokesmen for both factions--but with a difference. <P>
Consider: For many years prior to Mikhail Gorbachev's recent dismantling of the Soviet power bloc and the general recognition of Marxism as a fraudulent, unworkable system, communism's principal apologists and apparatchiks in the West were Jews. So were a number of anti-communist spokesmen.<P>
During the Second World War, of course, the communists could do no wrong in the eyes of the West's controlled media, because they were helping to destroy the man about whom the Jewish media masters had nightmares. Thus, while Soviet butchers were torturing thousands of patriots to death in the police cellars of the Baltic countries and liquidating the Polish leadership stratum at the killing pits in the Katyn woods, Jewish communists in the United States were stealing the plans and test results from America's atomic bomb program and sending them to their colleagues in the Soviet Union.<P>
After the war was over, however, and a reaction began to set in among White Americans as they realized that the communist beast they had unleashed against Eastern Europe might end up devouring them too, it was time for Jews to begin hedging their bets: it was time for the media to begin quoting <code>&quot;</code>responsible<code>&quot;</code> anti-communists. (The <code>&quot;</code>responsible<code>&quot;</code> ones were those who failed to mention the Jewishness of the system they were speaking out against.) While the memory of Jewish atomic spies Julius and Ethyl Rosenberg was still fresh and Jewish communist sympathizers such as Robert Oppenheimer were being weeded out of America's atomic weapons program, Jewish scientist Edward Teller became the spokesman for anti-communist Americans who wanted a strong, nuclear-armed America able to stand up to the Soviet Union. Three decades later, after Jews had rooted for the Viet Cong communists throughout the war in Vietnam, Jews began flocking to the neoconservative movement to speak up for an America strong enough to defend Israel's interests in the Middle East against the Soviet Union's Arab clients there. Often they were the same Jews who had been cheering for the Reds a year or two earlier. That really confused the goyim.<P>
Consider: Whenever a gaggle of eggheads gets together in some area to sponsor a classical-music FM radio station as a sole outpost of European culture in a sea of African rock-and-rap rhythm or sub-dimwit gospel bleating, there surely will be a Jew or two among them. And when they are interviewed by the local press, it surely will be one of those Jews who is quoted. That helps to spike any nasty rumors as to who's behind all of the garbage-music programming at the other stations.<P>
Consider: As detailed elsewhere in this magazine, the madness of <code>&quot;</code>political correctness<code>&quot;</code> which has infected America's colleges and universities is Jewish through and through. And as also pointed out elsewhere in this magazine many of those who are urging their colleagues to hold the line against <code>&quot;</code>political correctness<code>&quot;</code> also are Jews (at least, the ones appointed by the media to be spokesmen for academic freedom are). This not only ensures that the Jews manning the PC barricades won't be criticized as Jews for wrecking our universities, but it pre-empts those who might try to swing things too far back toward academic freedom. <P>
Consider: While Jew Howard Metzenbaum in the U. S. Senate and Jew Charles Schumer in the U. S. House of Representatives spearhead the legislative drive to strip Americans of their right to armed self-defense and are unanimously and vociferously supported in this effort by the Jewish media, a tiny, Milwaukee-based, Jewish pro-gun group calling itself Jews for the Preservation of Firearms Ownership (JPFO) manages to attract far more attention to itself than its size ordinarily would merit. JPFO is not just a group of pro-gun people who coincidentally happen to be Jews; it is a group of people who are shouting to the world: <code>&quot;</code>Hey, look at me; I am a Jew, and I am in favor of gun ownership.<code>&quot;</code> Whenever a JPFO spokesman is quoted in the news media--which is often enough to give the impression that his organization is right up there with the National Rifle Association, fighting for gun owners' rights--he flaunts his Jewishness.<P>
It doesn't take a genius to figure out that in any contest it's a good strategy to control your principal opposition. That way you can put on a great show of bad guys versus good guys struggling against each other, but you are always in a position to make the contest go in either direction you want and only as far as you want. Not only do you pre-empt any real opposition, but you keep the goyim fooled and deflect any criticism of your role in the affair.<P>
<B>By way of deception thou shalt do war.</B><P>
The deception is masterfully done. It suffices to keep most of the people fooled most of the time. Only a careful study of the details of a number of different social phenomena in which Jews are involved parts the veil of lies and trickery sufficiently for us to see a clear pattern.<P>
The pattern is this: Jews come into any homogeneous society--and such was America at the beginning of this century--as outsiders, as strangers. The society is effectively closed to them. They cannot easily penetrate its institutions. They cannot get their hands on the levers of power. If they try they are noticed, suspected, and resisted. And they always must try. In this they apparently cannot restrain themselves.<P>
To make way for themselves, to open up possibilities for penetration and control, they must break down the structure of the society, corrupt its institutions, undermine its solidarity, weaken its sense of identity, obliterate its traditions, destroy its homogeneity. Thus they inevitably will be in favor of democracy, of permissiveness, of every form of self-indulgence and indiscipline. They will be proponents of cosmopolitanism, of egalitarianism, of multiculturalism. They will oppose patriotism (except when they are inciting their hosts to fight a war on behalf of Jewish interests). They will agitate endlessly for change, change, change, and they will call it progress. And no matter what they are for or against they will have at least some of their number taking the opposite side: If they are promoting the public acceptance of homosexuality, they also will have a few prominent Jewish publicists bemoaning the downfall of traditional morality and warning of the consequences of the confusion of sexual roles. If their aim is to neutralize the universities as institutions for passing on the historical, intellectual, and cultural traditions of our people to a new generation of potential leaders, at the same time that they are organizing Red Guard brigades to enforce Political Correctness they will have a contingent beating the drums for tradition and free inquiry. If they are working feverishly to disarm White Americans in order to prevent the latter from exercising their right of revolution they will go to the Jews for the Preservation of Firearms Ownership for a contrary statement now and then.<P>
What does all of this prove? In the strictest sense of the word, nothing; it is only suggestive. If you watch a person flip a penny five hundred times, and it always comes up tails, you cannot be absolutely certain that the penny has two tails. But you at least ought to suspect that someone has been working on that penny in his machine shop.<P>
If you study the historical record and observe that every matter of importance in which the Jews have been involved turns out badly for us, even though there are usually a few Jews on our side of the matter, you cannot be absolutely certain that the game is rigged. But you at least ought to suspect that the Jews are following their ancient maxim and waging war against us by way of deception.<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Stormfront was the first White Nationalist site on the Web, going online
in March 1995. It was followed shortly by Reuben Logsdon's &quot;Cyberhate.&quot;
This precipitated an organized hate campaign by the Simon Wiesenthal Center
and similar groups to pressure our providers into yanking our accounts.
Since then, despite the best efforts of Rabbi Cooper and Company to censor
&quot;objectionable&quot; ideas, dozens of new sites have appeared. It's
becoming difficult for me to keep up with all of them, but I'll try to
keep this list updated with the most substantial of the new entries, along
with any URL changes for the old ones. </P>

<P>Please don't ask me to link sites at BHI's <A HREF="http://www.geocities.com">Geocities</A>.
This company offers free web pages, but it's adopted a policy of censoring
pro-White pages as soon as it finds them. Listing them here would only
hasten that process. <A HREF="http://www.aol.com">America Online</A> also
falls into this category.</P>

<DD>Pat Buchanan is a traditional populist conservative whose views frequently
coincide with those of White Nationalists. He was outspokenly opposed to
affirmative action and other anti-White programs long before it was fashionable
to do so. He called Capitol Hill &quot;Israeli-occupied territory.&quot;
He unflinchingly defended John Demjanjuk, the retired Cleveland auto worker
extradited to Israel for &quot;Nazi war crimes,&quot; and he was later
vindicated when the Israeli Supreme Court was forced to release Demjanjuk
in the face of new evidence released after the fall of the USSR. Though
he apparently does not understand the central importance of Race, his campaign
attracted some good people. This site, formerly the Buchanan for President
page, is now run by Linda Muller as a private project.</DD>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>These newsgroups are unmoderated and have a very high noise level. Some
of the shrillest &quot;anti-racists&quot; feel completely safe spewing
their vitriol from behind a computer terminal, so be prepared if you've
never visited the usenet world. After a while, you may find aggressive
use of the &quot;kill files&quot; feature found on most newsreaders will
make these forums more readable. You might also want to subscribe to the
<A HREF="#Stormfront-L">Stormfront-L</A> discussion mailing list as an

<P><B>When the veil of fiction was rent, man shuddered before &quot;Nature,
red in tooth and claw.&quot; Nature had always been that and always will
be, and the hands of man, even when he fashions and defends the noblest

only the strong and resolute nations survive, while the weak, especially
the morally weak, who babble about brotherhood and peace, are biologically
degenerate and doomed to extinction.</B></P>

The group says the MarylandMotor Vehicle Administration's (MVA) recall violates their right to freespeech.  The recall was announced on January 2nd after the MVA said itreceived numerous complaints that the plates were offensive to blacks.  TheSons of Confederate Veterans are asking for an injunction stopping therecall and $1,000 in damages for each plate that is recalled.<p><em> Anton H., ANA Editor</em><hr width=85% align=center size=1 noshade><br><h3><em>Tight Security at Burmeister Trial</em></h3><p> <b><a href="mailto:ana@stormfront.org">(ANA)</a></b>The murder trial against former Fort Bragg soldier James Burmeister beganyesterday (1/21/97) under tight security.  Burmeister is accused ofshooting a black couple to death in December 1995.  Police said the murderswere racially motivated and it was reported that Burmeister is a skinhead.The state is seeking the death penalty in the case.  The judge ordered thateveryone must present identification every time they enter the courthouse.He also prohibited purses, briefcases, backpacks, bags and containers ofany kind.  Cell phones and pagers were also banned from the courthouse.<p><em> Anton H., ANA Editor</em><hr width=85% align=center size=1 noshade><br><h3><em>3 Arrested at Georgia Anti-King March</em></h3><p> <b><a href="mailto:ana@stormfront.org">(ANA)</a></b>Three people were arrested at a protest march in a mainly white county inGeorgia yesterday (1/20/97).  About 15 protesters waving Confederate andAmerican flags marched to the Forsyth county courthouse for a three-hourrally.  A spokesman for the sheriff's office said a member of theNationalist Movement was charged with simple assault and twocounter-demonstrators were charged with disorderly conduct.  The marchcelebrated the 10th anniversary of a Martin Luther King march by about 75people which drew over 2,500 counter-demonstrators and ended in rock andbottle throwing.<p><em> Anton H., ANA Editor</em><hr width=85% align=center size=1 noshade><br><h3><em>Hess' Son Speaks on German TV</em></h3><p> <b><a href="mailto:ana@stormfront.org">(ANA)</a></b>On Sunday (1/5/97) Wolf Ruediger Hess said on German television that his father, Rudolf Hess, was "absolutely innocent" and said he was killed by the English because he had proof that Britain wanted to continue World War II.  The program was broadcast on WDR, a privately-owned channel.  Also during the program Hess spoke of Hitler's government, saying "Seven million unemployed, empty public coffers, and after four years, everything was resolved.  [The government] in Bonn would be well inspired if they had someone with Hitler's ideas."  A spokeswoman for WDR said they were making no apologies for the broadcast because the chairman of the discussion reacted immediately in condemning Hess' views.  She also said about 30 to 40 complaints were received after the broadcast.<p><em> Anton H., ANA Editor</em><hr width=85% align=center size=1 noshade><br><h3><em>MD Special License Plate Angers Blacks</em></h3><p> <b><a href="mailto:ana@stormfront.org">(ANA)</a></b>Black leaders in Maryland are angered that the Confederate flag will be appearing on special license plates.  Maryland's Motor Vehicle Administration authorized the plates for members of the nonprofit group Sons of the Confederate Veterans (SCV).  Leroy W. Warren Jr. of the NAACP said "The state should not be selling those kinds of license plates.  There is no justifiable reason to remind people of the darkest days in this country's history."  Maryland State Senator Larry Young, who is also chairman of the Legislative Black Caucus, said "I'm taken aback.  I thought our climate was becoming progressive, but this situation shows obviously not."  A SCV member who requested the plate said "We did not choose to enter this program to evoke a controversy or fly a symbol into anybody's face.  It's a demonstration of pride just like any other institution would want to instill pride in their membership."  The Motor Vehicle Administration said officials did not find the design objectionable when they reviewed the application two years ago.  They also said they will now take another look.<p><em> Anton H., ANA Editor</em><hr width=85% align=center size=1 noshade><center><IMG WIDTH=468 HEIGHT=14 BORDER=0 ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="images/barred.gif"></center><br><CENTER><IMG WIDTH=228 HEIGHT=305 BORDER=0 ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="images/bornwhit.gif"></CENTER><hr><hr><A HREF="defaultf.htm"><IMG WIDTH=35 HEIGHT=35 BORDER=0 ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="images/wplogos.gif">Return to main page</A> | <a href="current2.htm">Previous News Items</a> | <a href="mailto:dblack@jbx.com">E-mail Stormfront</a> | <a href="lform.htm">Post to the letters page</a></body></html>

The plan calls for an increase in the minority work force at Texaco from 23 percent to 29 percent within the next four years.  The proportion of negro employees is also planned to rise from 9 percent to 13 percent during the same time.  Texaco also wants the percentage of negroes among management to climb from 4 percent to 6.6 percent.  Managers will also be rewarded for hiring and promoting women and minorities.  Texaco also plans to spend almost $200 million per year on contracts with minority-owned companies.  The company will also try to arrange with financial institutions to help negroes secure loans to buy, lease and franchise Texaco outlets and will try to expand minority management of its $1.4 billion pension fund.<p><em> Anton H., ANA Editor</em><hr width=85% align=center size=1 noshade><br><h3><em>Three Teens Arrested For Smashing Menorah</em></h3><p> <b><a href="mailto:ana@stormfront.org">(ANA)</a></b>Three Pennsylvania teenagers were arrested yesterday (12/13/96) for smashing a Jewish family's menorah.  Police said the teens shattered the Markovitz's front window last Sunday with baseball bats and then threw the electric menorah on the ground.  District Attorney Alan RUBENSTEIN said the three "didn't seem to be part of an organized group, like Aryan Nation."  The teens were charged with ethnic intimidation, vandalism and several lesser charges.  One was released on $100,000 bail, and the others were released to their parents because they are juveniles.<p><em> Anton H., ANA Editor</em><hr width=85% align=center size=1 noshade><br><h3><em>Spanish Bookstore Raided</em></h3><p> <b><a href="mailto:ana@stormfront.org">(ANA)</a></b>Yesterday (12/12/96) Spanish police raided a book store in Barcelona, Spain, and seized over 7,000 books and other material they say "espoused Nazism" and denied the "Holocaust."  The owner of the store, Pedro Varela, was arrested and later released on bail.  Police said most of the books, which were written in Spanish, German and English, were published in South America.  Swastika flags and "xenophobic videos" were also seized.  A law has recently been passed in Spain which makes in illegal to "defend genocide."<p><em> Anton H., ANA Editor</em><hr width=85% align=center size=1 noshade><br><h3><em>Prison Guard Investigated For Flying Swastika</em></h3><p> <b><a href="mailto:ana@stormfront.org">(ANA)</a></b>Edward Kuhnel, a New York state prison guard, is being investigated for flying a swastika flag from his porch.  Kuhnel is a guard at the maximum-security Eastern Correctional Facility, which is about 70 miles north of New York City.  He said he has no intention of removing the flag.  He told the media on Monday (12/9/96) "I am not a racist and not a Nazi.  I like the color of the flag. I put the American flag out, too."  A spokesman for the State Department of Correctional Services said Kuhnel has violated a rule prohibiting guards from participating in activities that "discredit the prison department and display sympathy or support for racist views."  Kuhnel was suspended for several months in 1988 for displaying materials at the prison indicating that he belonged to the National Association for the Advancement of White People.  An attempt to fire him failed because there was not enough proof that it was a "racist group."

<p>Learn your history or you will live some one elses! I was suprised to read a woman previous
my entry stating that she had a relative fighting for the South in the Civil War. She was proud of that, however she found Stormfront "wrong". I dare say if you asked your ancestor his belief it would differ from yours, my darling liberal!
<p>White woman your ignorance is our curse, every time you date outside your race, you destroy the blood of your family, your culture and pride. You lower yourself and disgrace your soul.
Please open a history book, it is your genes that are responsible for  higher culture.

<h3><i>Response to slavery messages...</i></h3>

<p><tt>Oct 17 19:47 EDT 1995</tt>

<p>After reading several posts concerning the slavery of Africans in the 
United States, I would like to make a couple of comments.

<p>My great-great-great grandfather had a plantation in the south during
the time of slavery.  He owned many slaves and had a very successful
operation.  When the United States government ended slavery, he 
allowed them to leave if they wanted.  But these slaves did not want
to leave.  Granted, he did not torture his slaves just as a rancher
would not torture his cattle.  He had an investment in the slaves and
harming them in any way would hurt his pocket.  You'll also find that 
many of the plantation owners worked alongside the blacks.    

<p>So, to the several blacks that have posted on the Stormfront Web 
site, I suggest this: African slaves did not abhor slavery as much
as is popularly portrayed.  They knew nothing else and when freed, 
many stayed right where they were at, working in the fields.  

<p>To suggest that I owe the African-American people anything because
of something my ancestors did is rediculous.  The African-Americans
in the United States who are complaining today were not even the 
ones who were allegedly oppressed.  

<p>Blacks in America should thank Whites for bringing them to the United
States.  The opportunities available for Blacks in the United States
today are tremendous and it is not "Whitey's" fault if Blacks do not
take advantage of them.  You must ask yourself one question:  Would
you rather be where you are at right now, in the United States, or 
would you rather be in Africa spearing animals and dying of huge
famines and droughts?  

<p>I am proud of my White heritage.  Every race is ethnocentric.  Blacks
have the right to be proud of their African heritage.  Just as Asians,
Latinos, and even Jews have.  But when non-White races label Whites
for ethnocentrism, it is a double-standard.  If a million White men
marched in Washington, it would be considered evil.  But when a 
million black men march in Washington, it is considered a good thing.
Racism is present in every race.  It is an innate part of human
existance.  

<p>After 120 years of no slavery in the United States, the usual complaint
by blacks that their statistical information is lower because of 
slavery is invalid.  Blacks are not born into a life of crime and are
not born into a life of welfare.  They choose this option.  The 
Arizona Republic printed the following statistics on Monday, October 16,
1995 as part of the Million Man March articles.  

<ul>
<dt>In 1994, nearly 30 percent of all black males in their 20s were
   either incarcerated or on probation or parole.

<dt>The homicide rate is 72 per 100,000 black men, compared with 14.2
   for black women, 9.3 for white men and 3 for white women.

<dt>Average unemployment for black men is 12 percent;  it is 11 percent
   for black women, 5.4 percent for white men and 5.2 percent for
   white women.
</ul>
<p>Why do people lock their doors when a group of young black men walk 
down the street?  This is the reason.  


<p>So, blacks hold in their hands the key to ending any discrimination
against them.  What do they need to do?  Stop committing (as many)
crimes, stop killing people, and get jobs.  The perceived discrimination
that blacks complain about will end when they take responsibility for
their own actions.  

<p>As for the topic of drug use and abuse and the attempt to shift the
blame to "Whitey" for bringing the drugs "from Columbia to America"
to poison the black culture, this is utterly rediculous.  Drug use
and abuse is a problem across all races, not just blacks.  However,
many blacks feel that they needn't try to get a job or succeed in
society.  What better way to make a living (and a profitable one at
that) than to sell drugs.  Blacks are the ones selling drugs to other
Blacks.  And when the drugs come from Columbia, blame the Latino and 
Mexican race, not Whites.  

<p>When blacks do not perceive me as a racist because I love my heritage,
my anger will stop.  I do not hate on the basis of skin color.  There
are far better reasons to hate someone than the color of their skin.  
Not allowing me to be proud of my European heritage is at the top of the
list.


<p>"We must secure the existance of our people, 
            and a future for White children."

<h3><i>The MILLION MAN MARCH</i></h3>

<p><tt>Tue Oct 17 17:20 EDT 1995</tt>

<p>What a scary picture on the front page of today's newspaper.  Hundreds of thousand's of blacks led by Louis Farrakhan marching on the mall outside of the capital.  If White Americans had of tried to do that there would have been a riot caused by the blacks.  The message was for black men to take responsibility for their lives and those of their families.  Good message. Nothing wrong with that.  But look who the leader is.  Farrakhan!  

<p>Wake up black people!!! If you want equality and justice you do not select a leader who preaches hatred.  He is fooling you. He is preaching the Gospel now to get you to believe in him, but once he has you he will start telling you that white people are bad.  He is leading you to confrontation and you don't even know it.

<h3><i>Asians in Norway</i></h3>

<p><tt>Mon Oct 16 23:27 EDT 1995</tt>

<p>Dear Stormfront, I am a twenty-seven year old male in Northern 
Norway, married to a beautiful wife, Katia, and father of a 
beautiful daughter, Save.

<p>Please forgive my grammer. I have 
had very little contact with any "non-white" races, having
spent my life in Norway. But here in Velijord, our nearest neighbors
are Filipinos, or asians. I was a white supremacist when I was
younger boy, but I have changed that slightly. I do not know if
I support my previous views anylonger. Our neighbors are good 
people, and have helped us from time to time. I admit that I was
at first, bothered by them. Or perhaps, just fearful. But that 
turned out to be just a presumption that was unfounded. 

<p>I was
convinced to visit the United States, San Francisco to be exact,
to see if what television showed us was true. There were a great
number of Asians and whites in San Francisco, and I was surprised
to see such a mixture, but not surpised to see that they worked
so well together. In fact, one of my younger ideals when I was a 
skinhead was to somehow bring up a fourth reich with the Aryans 
of Europe, beginning in Germany, and to once again align 
this supremacist movement with the Japanese, who were ironically
better friends and allies to Adolf Hitler than the Italians were.
They reflected loyalty, honestly, and dogmatism, almost aryan in
their zeal. But anyway, in San Francisco, I was treated very well
by the Asians and especially my friends family. 

<p>Perhaps the only 
bad experience I had there was when we went a place called Oakland
and went to a mall. A group of black men approached us and asked
us to give them some money. My friend began to take out his
wallet when one of them suddenly struck him in the face. I was
suddenly angery and kicked the black man in the groin with my boots
(which I still retained from my skinhead days in Oslow). The others
came at me and my friend then, and we fought them off amazingly.
He apologized to me afterward for what had happened, and I 
could not understand why. They had attacked us, not the other
way around. We returned back to Norway, both of us a little
bruised from our encounter. I have realized that Asians are a
good people, and that I do not mind them as neighbors and friends.
But I am wondering now about how I would feel if black people
would move in to my country, and if they would show the same 
kindness. I was fearful of my daughter, Save, playing with my 
friend's daughter because I was still very prejudiced. But I have
found that my fears are not founded. They are now very good friends.
I still support white pride. I favor co-existence with Asians. But
I question whether or not blacks will be the same way. Please
understand that I am not a racist, but that I am trying to understand.

<p><tt>Mon Oct 16 19:07 EDT 1995</tt>

<p>This is to reply to all those who have sent me email concerning my "racist" attitude in the letter I have posted on this website. I am not a racist but I do believe in that we all come from different cultures and that if we  arn't careful we will lose the white culture. My only  purpose to protect that. If you don't like it then that is just too bad, as we are all allowed differences in thought..Although if you talk to any of the people who have been so kind to email me, my thoughts are invalid because they are the not what they believe .

<p>How come when a black man like Lois Farakhan gets up and calls us whites

gets up and says that kind of stuff I'd be a bigot. Its nice to know that

<h3><i>Wake Up Call</i></h3>

<p><tt>Mon Oct 16 15:38 EDT 1995</tt>

<p>I write this on the morning of the so-called "Million Man March" on Washington,
and would like to make a few points by relating some experiences on the way to work 
this morning.  First off, let me preface this by saying that I do not
"hate" other races, but I am proud to be Aryan.  

<p>I took public transportation to work this morning; a relatively short subway ride.  As the journey 
progressed, I noticed more and more blacks boarding the train bound for
the "Million Man March" site.  I felt a mob mentality take over, as is 
common where blacks congregate.  The black mob begin to shout, verbally abuse,
and generally harass the white commuters.  I heard such things as "It's time
to take over" and "You can't hide from this."

<p>As I took note of all this, I pondered a couple of things;

<p>1.  This march was better organized than any of us had figured.  The blacks
exhibited a solidarity that I have seldom seen whitebread America muster.

<p>2.  These people hate us, and they want blood.  

<p>My point is this; These people were clearly together and spoke with one 
voice.  I have yet to witness white-collar average joe American exhibit 
this sort of cohesiveness; we're all too busy taking care of our own
asses.  White America, it's time to wake up and smell the slime.  We've
given blacks every opportunity in the form of affirmative action, quotas,
welfare, public dole; you name it.  It's not opportunity they want, they
want control of the country.  They want to see all whites enslaved or
hanging from trees.  This "Million Man March" has done nothing but affirm
my belief that a race war is imminent.  What I am saying, White Folks, 
is you'd better be ready to fight, because the blacks sure as hell are.

<p>We as white Americans have gone soft; we've lost our values, lost our 
direction.  Our society is going the way of ancient Rome, permiated with
laziness, greed, lust, gluttony, etc.  We must come together before it
is too late, because very soon the time to defend ourselves from this
black onslaught will arrive.  We will have to stand and fight for our families
and our way of life; we must begin preparation now.  If we fail, we have
no one to blame but ourselves.

<h3><i>I Wonder</i></h3>

<p><tt>Mon Oct 16 12:22 EDT 1995</tt>

<p>I mistakenly came across this page in my Internet travels.  I always wondered if such a place existed, kind of curious I guess.  But after discovering your little world of hate I find myself disgusted.  You people are cowards.  Afraid to face the world as it is and desperate to live this hassle free life where all your inadequacies can be blamed on the black man or the Jew.  I am a white male who has no complaints with any particular race.  Maybe you people should get on with living and give up your fantasies of a pure world.  How pure would it be with a bunch of blood thirsty hate mongers running loose?  Now I don't believe for one second that my heartfelt letter will have any effect on the dedicated subscribers of the Stormfront but I do feel that I have a right to judge and comment on your beliefs and lack of values.  Feel free to E-mail a letter back and tell me why I should hate the niggers and beat on some Jews.  Also I feel that the name Stormfront is really cute!
  and spooky.  I'm sure the Nigger-haters Club of the World would suffice too, but then again it wouldn't be approved of by the furherur.  I could sit here and give freaked out bible quotes and biological babble why were all equal but it would be a waster of time on your shrivelled black hearts.  Thank You for taking the time to read this.

<h3><i>It's time to rethink our motives</i></h3>

<p><tt>Sun Oct 15 17:33 EDT 1995</tt>

<p>My question to all the readers is where do I fit in?  I am a blond-haired, blue-eyed white
male.  I am exceptionally right-wing.  I believe in the following:

<p>1) Mixing of the races will eventually lead to the extinction of the caucasian race.

<p>2) Blacks are the primary cause of all crimes.

<p>3) Immigration is undermining America's foundation.

<p>4) An armed society is an honest society.

<p>I maintain a cache of weapons, ammunition, and I firmly believe that one day
I will need to use these in order to defend my family, property, and self.

<p>My family's lineage includes Confederate soldiers, Klan members, slave masters,
etc.  I am also a proud member of Sons of the Confederacy and Florida Pioneers.
The other half of my family (my mother's side) are Jewish immigrants from Russia.
I am Jewish.  I was Bar Mitzvah'd.  I am marrying a Jewish girl in less than three
weeks.  She feels the same way I do about most issues.

<p>My questions are as follows:

<p>1) There are a lot of white people in my position, ones who are "disqualified" from the white nationalist movement by a RELIGION, not a race. 

<p>2) Am I precluded from all "activities" because I am Jewish, as I will proudly admit, even though I would make most Stormfront readers look like tree-hugging homos.

<p>I want straight answers, no BS.  Where does everyone stand on this issue?
Unfortunately, I don't have time to write a well-thought out letter and I have a couple of coworkers
with wandering eyes. Please respond.

<h3><i>"Rights"</i></h3>

<p><tt>Fri Oct 13 12:34 EDT 1995</tt>

<p>While the Rodney King beating was wrong, Reno and the US Justice Dept
wasted no time in bringing "civil rights" charges against Powell and
Koon, and they are now in prison.  Where is the US Justice Dept's
civil rights suit against OJ???  No where, of course.  Seems like ole
Rodney has more "civil rights" than Simpson's now dead wife, Goldman,
and Vicki weaver, for that matter.

<p>The stench of hypocrisy that rises from the Rodhamite/Clintonista
Justice Dept is unbelievable.  Now, if the people of Los Angeles
reacted to the OJ verdict according to the Maxine Waters theory of
civic responsibility, whites would have rioted, and burned the place
to the ground.  This did not happen.  But watch,  whites will continue
to flee the cities, vote Republican, and have their duly elected
representatives end the welfare state that has ruined this country.
So, maybe the OJ verdict is good, after all.

<h3><i>Waco and Ruby Ridge</i></h3>

<p><tt>Fri Oct 13 04:58 EDT 1995</tt>

<p>I wish to add a few viewpoints of my own to the above-listed debates. First off, I disagree with a lot of people concerning the "massacre" in Waco. I live not too far from there, and kept up with the entire episode. Though I do believe that the BATF and FBI really screwed up in their methods of storming the compound at Mount Carmel (yes, I agree that they were wrong in most aspects), the reason that the government agencies went there in the first place was to arrest David Koresh. The man was a terribly misguided lunatic who brainwashed his followers into believing that he was the son of God. Those of us in the social sciences call that a "cult." David Koresh broke the law by stockpiling illegal arms. The only way we can fight to keep our constitutional rights to bear arms is though the court system and by exercising our right to vote. If you don't like certain laws, do what you can to change them. Creation of fanatical fringe groups only hurts such causes.

<p>Like I said, I'm not denying that government agencies screwed up royally. However, when people mention about all the innocent lives of children lost in the fracas at Waco, we must consider that the children who died in that episode remained there by the orders of David Koresh. Young children do not have the learned experience of most adults to discern a true difference between right and wrong. They only can believe what is taught to them; when that teacher is a raving madman, and no one provides alternative views and information, they thereby are forced to believe in only one thing. In this case, it meant believing in dying for a cause. I see so many similarities between the incident at Waco and what happened many years earlier in Guyana. The so-called "Reverend" Jim Jones convinced many people to commit suicide there. David Koresh did the same thing at Waco. Some say that the fire at the compound in Waco was caused by the government, but I have viewed footage of the incident, even some that is unpublished, with great scrutiny. In my viewing of this footage, I was able to see that the fires *did* originate from within the building. Furthermore, there were people who were inside and who survived, that have made statements attesting to the same. Therefore, I can only come to the conclusion that what happened in Waco was not only our governments' latest mistake, but that the main cause of what happened was due to the misguidance of those under the "spell," so to speak, of David Koresh.

<p>Unlike the incident at Waco, my information concerning what happened at Ruby Ridge is quite limited. The only information I have is what I saw from the news media. I understand that the government went there to serve an arrest warrant to someone for (does this sound familiar?) stockpiling illegal armaments. *However*, I will agree with most others that the government added one more big screwup to their growing list. I simply cannot believe that someone "accidentally" shot the man's wife through the head. *Very* simple logic would tell anyone with an IQ higher than a simian that, if someone is a sharpshooter, they *should* be able to discern the difference between a suspected male and a female, even more so one holding an infant. If the man who fired that shot was able to line up the crosshairs on his scope well enough to shoot her through the head, he certainly should have been able to tell *who* he was shooting at. I feel that there are WAY too many gung-ho, trigger-happy people working for governmental agencies. Some of these guys need to sign up for mercenary work and go find a war some place. It's not like there is a shortage of wars these days. At least then they would be able to satiate their primordial desires to kill others, but this time shoot at people who can actually shoot back. Hell, they'd not only be doing themselves a favour, but they just might do *us* a favour by getting killed by the very people they are killing.

<p>It's no wonder there are so many people today who are dissatisfied with our government. And though I still feel the main way to remedy this is through our collective powers at the polls, we do have to keep in mind that we are up against others with the right to vote who still believe that everything our government does is for the good of everyone. *They* are the ones we need to educate; unfortunately, most of them are too pompous to even listen, thinking that they are so superior because they have lots of money and went to Harvard or wherever. They just don't seem to realize that a degree from an Ivy League institution does not necessarily make one intelligent or enlightened. So what else can we do? Join a militia group? Not me, folks; some of those groups scare me even more than my own government does. Too many of them are filled with hate mongers who want nothing less than to perpetuate the same sort of crimes that Hitler and his followers did. I do not wish to blindly fol!
 low those in power in this country, nor do I wish to align myself with a group of people who, sooner or later, will think of a reason to disclude me from their little clique. All I want is for our goverment to be responsible and representative of the majority of the people, not just cowtow to those who can pad their pockets.

<p>Any suggestions?

<p>It is very interesting how many "Americans" quickly yell obscene names
at other racial groups, yet when you boil it down they don't actually
have a source of hate besides "Mr/Ms So-and-so says that they ....".

<p>The key to effective political objective achievement is to know your enemy
and therefore knowing his / her weaknesses.  I often refer to Sun Tsu's
"Art of War".  That book really helps you get in focus how you can
aim your political weapon, and therefore come off as an individual and
/ or group that is not just "A screaming crowd of yahoos."

<p>Remember my young ones, the mad dog is the first shot, but the 
sly dog is the last suspected.

<h3><i>Space & Race</i></h3>

<p><tt>Wed Oct 11 19:27 EDT 1995</tt>

<p>aa107547@midnet.csd.scarolina.edu made some good points in a recent 
letter.  In particular, I strongly agree with your statements about the need for "life" to expand into
the nearly limitless resources of outer space.  And, of course, as you
pointed out, space exploration has been a very "white" project.

<p>With regard to miscegenation, I notice that very few people have spoken
about the struggle among different genes to replicate themselves in
competition with other genes.  Once this genetic competition -- the
so-called "selfish gene" theory -- is recognized, then the logical next
step is to compare the ability of race-specific genes to compete.  Here
the answer is clear to anyone who has taken high school biology:
The genes of the white race are recessive, while the genes of non-whites
are dominant.  So when whites and non-whites cross-breed, the non-white
genes will (statistically) predominate nearly always (with very few
exceptions).  Therefore, it is perfectly natural for white genes, and
hence the white race, to preserve itself by avoiding race mixing.
Our very genes demand such a strategy, else we will disappear as a
race.  And that would be the greatest tragedy of all.

<h3><i>WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO WHITE PRIDE???</i></h3>

<p><tt>Tue Oct 10 08:38 EDT 1995</tt>

<p>This is by far the best site for the White American that I have encountered
so far!!!  I no longer feel alone in my previously hidden "racist" views.

<p>I am a student at the University of California at Davis and I am constantly
exposed to the active discrimination that is set against white people in a
country that was founded by their own ancestors:

<p>1.When I applied for college I witnessed the grim reality of AFFIRMATIVE
ACTION:  My SAT score totaled 1470 (720-math;750-verbal) and I had a
cumulative 4.0 GPA,  yet I was passed up for a number of scholarships
by LESS QUALIFIED minority members.  The most glaring examples of this 
are a number of minority freeloaders ,(with SAT's and GPA's which were 
substantially lower than my own), who were given REGENTS SCHOLARSHIPS.
<p>2.I recently paid a visit to a friend who is staying in the same dorm
that is home to the Universiy's "ethnic diversity" program.
He and his room mate are the only two white people in the entire dorm 
and are alienated by the other 150 people of various minority groups 
who reside there.As I entered the building I was regarded with suspicious, almost hateful,
stares from everyone I passed. I was obviously regarded as an outsider
for no other reason than my being white.
<p>I am sick of seeing white men of my own age be affected by this stigma that is attached
to being white. I have seen yong white men insult their own race so as not to seem 
racist. I am sick of seeing these young men abandon their pride in their race and adopt 
the ways of other races so as to make themselves seem "less white". 

<p>There is an 18 year
old white male named Ben who lives in the room next to mine who has abandoned all pride
in being white. He listens only to rap "music",the lyrics of which often harbors open insults
against whites. Ben has attempted to adopt the manners of speech and thought of the very people
who, through their music, are insulting him. Yesterday I heard this confused fool actually say
"It's so funny when rappers put white guys on their albums, it makes white people sound SO 
STUPID".  To hear that made my heart fill with anger and sorrow, that a white person could so 
insult themself and their entire race. The real tragedy is that this is happening everywhere.
There isn't a place I go that I don't see a young person so ashamed of being white
that they have replaced their pride in their own race with pride for a race that ISN'T THEIRS.
<p>I have felt alone in my pride of my race until I read this site. Thanks 
again.

<h3><i>Separatism, not racism!!</i></h3>

<p><tt>Mon Oct  9 02:01 EDT 1995</tt>

<p>I think there is a common misconception. I have seen the tv talk shows and read the articles, and when there are other groups who are singing the praises of unity it is great, e.g. The Nation of Islam. However, when a white man steps up and says "we have to unite and keep ourselves together" he gets crucified and branded a racist. 

<p>I will be honest, I am not a racist, but I hate this whole idea of being squashed into one super-culture with everyone else. I am not african-american or latin-american. I am white, if anything I am a European-American. I think it is good to see a few white people standing up for themselves. I am tired of being called a racist because I am proud to be white. I think it is truly time to stand up and be counted, and recognized as what I am... a White American Male and damned proud of it! I want my children to grow up to marry whites. I want to keep my family lineage white, is that so wrong? Do I have to put up with all this "the white man is holding me down" crap? 

<p>Anyhow, I just wanted to say, to all of you here with the guts to speak your mind, good job. I don't like the ignorant racist rhetoric, but I do like to see people, white people, stand up for what they believe in!!

<h2>My Indian Odyssey</h2>
<h1>A Ghost from India Haunts Me Still</h1>
<h3>by David Duke</h3>

<p>
<i><strong>My Indian Odyssey</strong> is an excerpt from David Duke's forthcoming
autobiography. These passages were written about his journey to
India in 1971. At that time he was returning from Vientianne,
Laos, where he had instructed anti-Communist Laotian Army and
Air Force officers near the end of the Vietnam War. Representative Duke can be reached
at PO Box 88, Covington, LA 70434, or through his <a href="http://www.duke.org">Web page</a>. </i>
<hr size=4>
<br>
<p>

<font size=+4>W</font>ho can forget the day on which he first
sees one of the Seven Wonders of the World? I vividly remember
the details of the August day when I first saw the Taj Mahal.

<p>
Armed with a camera and a frayed note-pad,
I trotted out of the YMCA at about 5:30 in the morning. The cool
air felt good as I walked briskly toward the center of New Delhi.
Thousands of chirping birds serenaded me as I walked along the
main boulevards. A fat, bushy-tailed squirrel dared to cross my
path a few inches from my shoes, having learned no fear of man.
Such an abundance of small birds and animals was quite a contrast
from what I had seen in Laos and Thailand. Indo-Chinese cities
have a scarcity of small game because overpopulation has encouraged
the people to eat almost anything that moves which is not poisonous.
In India, however, small game is protected by religious sanction
-- and religious taboos in India seem even more powerful than
hunger. 
<p>
Small animals were not the only creatures
in great abundance in India, for so were the people. Along one
long sidewalk I saw hundreds of wooden shelves, each about the
size of a refrigerator laying on its side. Each served as home
for one or more people. Even less fortunate souls lay on the grass
or in the brown dust with a tattered blanket serving as their
only shelter. Some had only rags to protect themselves from the
elements. About a block from the YMCA, an old man grunted as he
squatted and defecated in the gutter; a little further on, a bony
couple engaged in pleasureless sexual intercourse while two children
sat beside them and played in the dust. Millions in India live
out their lives on the public streets awash in dust and mud. There
they are born; and there they bathe, eat, sleep, excrete, and
copulate. As attested by the teeming population, breeding is their
most successful endeavor.
<p>
As I penetrated deeper into the center
of New Delhi, I found that there were, however, many modern structures.
Most of them housed branches of European firms doing business
in India. Many Indian Government buildings had been constructed
in the colonial style of the twenties and thirties under the auspices
of English imperial rule. The contrast between abject human debasement
only a few steps away from monumental achievements was disconcerting;
but my eyes slowly got used to the stark disparity as I headed
for one of the main, commercial squares.
<p>
About 8:30 I reached the square where
I planned to inquire about bus service to Agra, site of the famed
Taj Mahal. The streets were buzzing with activity. The grass on
the boulevard's center ground was being mowed by a cylindrical
lawnmower pulled by a large white bull. It was guided by a turbaned
Indian dressed in white of a similar shade to the animal's. Near
some tour buses, I learned that I could ride to Agra and back
in a taxi cab (a round trip of over two hundred miles) for only
twelve dollars. I met a young Cambridge student of English derivation
traveling during his summer vacation, and we decided to share
a cab after getting some breakfast at the main coffee house on
the square.
<p>
Six Indians behind the counter worked
at a furious pace, serving hundreds of patrons. Each worker had
a separate job. Only one washed dishes, and cleanliness was not
one of his finer points, for he looked as though he moonlighted
as a grave-digger. Crusty black dirt trimmed the tips of his fingernails;
the lighter spots on his face and neck ,on diffident inspection,
turned out to be streaks where sweat and drool had washed off
some layers of muck. After hundreds of washings from the same
filthy water, his dish rag could only be adequately compared to
mummy wrappings. Plates and utensils were wiped according to immediate
necessity right before the eyes of the customer.
<p>
It was easy to convince myself that
I really wasn't hungry, but Rodney Johnson, my new English friend,
wolfed down coffee and fried eggs without the slightest suggestion
of discomfort. In fact, it perturbed me that he seemed to actually
enjoy it. Perhaps he simply wanted to keep up the British image
of true colonial grit. 
<p>
We hired a run down taxi of a make I
couldn't identify. Some sort of strange religious symbols hung
from the rearview mirror, and the clear plastic seats immediately
stuck to our bare legs as the three hour trip to Agra began. A
dozen books I had read on India didn't prepare me as I gazed at
the worsening panorama of horrors unfolding as we sped from the
business district of New Delhi. There were hundreds of rickety,
bug-eyed children, and I even saw two emaciated corpses lying
on the street, treated like so much refuse to be hauled away.
Incoherent squabbling and bargaining of the marketplace pounded
on my auditory nerves, and strange stenches filled my nostrils
from time to time. Sometimes the odors came from the fires made
from briquettes of bovine and human dung used as fuel. Amid the
ruins and rubble lay intermittent piles of ancient garbage being
picked over by the starving, looking for even the tiniest of rotting
morsels.
<p>
Once in a while an old temple or structure
would heave into view out of this sea of desolation and offer
a brief glimpse into a high culture that had been. The mind of
this young Westerner visiting India for the first time was not
going to be ensnared by the ugliness and the decay, for gradually,
in the midst of the ruins and putrefaction, I resurrected in my
imagination the once beautiful, magnificent empire of India. I
could feel the vitality and creativity that had ruled this land
thousands of years before; I could see the farmers and tradesmen,
the artisans and musicians, the road builders and architects.
<p>
As the cab began to wind out of the
stifling, heat-magnifying city and emerged into the countryside,
I thought about the once great Indian civilization. Green rice
fields sped by the window of my cab as I weighed what I had learned
from books and from the conversations I had with Indian college
professors over the previous few days. The historical facts that
swirled in my mind mingled with indelible impressions I harvested
with my own eyes.
<p>
Aryans, or Indo-European Caucasians
created the great Indian, or Hindu Civilization. Aryans swept
over the Himalayas to the Indian sub-continent and conquered the
aboriginal people. The original term &quot;India&quot; was coined
by the Aryan invaders from their Sanskrit word Sindu for the river
now called the Indus. Sanskrit is perhaps the oldest of the Indo-European
languages, having a common origin to all the modern languages
of Europe. Composed in about 1500 BC, the Hindu religious texts
of the Rig Veta tell the story of the long struggle between the
Aryans and the aboriginal people of the Indian subcontinent. Sixteen
Aryan states were partitioned by the sixth century AD, and Brahmanism
became the chief religion of the India. After the conquest, the
conquering race initiated a caste system to preserve their status
and their racial identity. The Hindu word for caste is &quot;Varna,&quot;
which means color. Today the word is usually associated with occupation
or trade; but the occupations evolved originally on the basis
of ethnicity. The palest of skin were called the Brahmin, the
warrior-priest class, the top of the social ladder. Untouchables,
or Pariahs, the racially mixed, or &quot;raceless ones,&quot;
were at the bottom.
<p>
Over the past few centuries, the clear
racial differences faded, but one can still notice the lighter
hues and taller statures of the higher castes. Many scholars consider
Sanskrit the oldest and purest of the Indo-European languages.
In modern India, the greatest insult one could pay a fellow Indian
is to call him &quot;black.&quot;
<p>
In spite of all the organized government
and media efforts to root out racial feeling, there is still ample
evidence that race does matter in modern India. Rodney told me
that the &quot;personal ad&quot; columns catering to the English-speaking
Indians are interesting in that the skin color of the advertiser
is always described very precisely. Before I left India, I found
that the ads often had an emphasis on the degree of lightness
of the perspective husband or wife.
<p>
The average Christian conservative of
the Western world would be aghast at the exuberant interest displayed
by the ancient Indians in sex and the ways they publicly displayed
sexual experiences through art. Hindu history, though, seems to
indicate that it was not any preoccupation with sex that brought
down the high culture, as much as the racial impact of that obsession.
In spite of strict religious and civil taboos, the ancient Aryans
crossed the color line. Slavery, or a similar system, makes servant
women easily obtainable and has proven a dangerous temptation
for some of the basest of the slave holders. Only a small percentage
of each generation had sexual liaisons with the lower castes,
but over dozens of generations a gradual change in the racial
composition had occurred, almost imperceptible in a single generation,
but dramatic after a millennium.
<p>
Perhaps one of the problems of the Indian
civilization, I reflected, (and of every one since) is that the
most creative, most intelligent and most-successful people have
had many distractions from sex and family, while the lower classes
find sex a much more important form of recreation and fulfillment,
in fact it is the one highly enjoyable pastime the poor can always
afford. Every civilization has a lower average birthrate among
its most talented elements while its less intelligent and unproductive
tend to proliferate, India was no exception.
<p>
Traveling 45 m.p.h. with all the taxi's
windows down, it was still so hot and dusty that my British friend
and I felt as though we could not get enough air. However, India
was not the dry, desert-like expanse that I had pictured. Certainly
there are arid areas in India, but great portions of the country
are humid and wet. During my stay I saw beautiful sea ports, green
fertile valleys, thick forests and jungles, mountains that glittered
with the reflection of their vast mineral wealth. The road we
traveled on was far from dry. Rice field followed rice field,
and there were numerous waterholes -- usually beset by cows cooling
their sacred hides. 
<p>
At mid-morning we decided to stop for
a little refreshment, and the cab driver pulled off the highway
by a little shanty cafe'. By that time my hunger had overcome
my lack of enthusiasm for Indian dish washing. My English friend,
undaunted as ever, ordered some fried eggs. I optimistically thought
that eggs fried in a hot skillet, albeit dirty, wouldn't do much
harm, so I put my order in. Since the coffee was boiling hot,
I consented to have some of it, as well.
<p>
After letting them cool a bit, I ravenously
consumed a nice yellow spoonful of eggs. A feeling like liquid
fire spread from my tongue to the roof of my mouth, and clear
back to my larynx. It spread from my throat into my esophagus
and stomach. My eyes watered. My nose ran. I tried to swallow,
but I couldn't. I looked at the swarthy, beady-eyed driver, then
at the proprietor of the shanty and imagined a criminal conspiracy
between them. I imagined the authorities finding my poisoned,
pain-contorted body in a rice paddy a few days later, stripped
of identification, passport, camera and money.
<p>
Then, through a blurry film, could see
Rodney wolfing down his eggs like they were milk chocolate. Maybe
what I had taken for British bravado was only true affection for
this land and its traits.
<p>
I believed that I stumbled onto the
reason why almost all the food in India is intolerably hot; for
as famished as I was, that one bite was more than enough for me
that morning. Suddenly, I wasn't hungry any more, but no longer
from fear of dirty utensils, for I figured that few germs could
have survived the heat of the little red infernos the Indians
call peppers. Growing up in south Louisiana, I had always been
exposed to very spicy food, but those Indian peppers could have
passed for glowing embers of lava! Only the English could have
colonized this place, for only they, like Rodney, had the stomach
for it. 
<p>
Near the shanty were hordes of small
children. A number of them had deformities such as full or partial
blindness and amputated limbs. The cab driver told me that many
are purposely mutilated by their own parents to increase their
intake from begging. As he spoke I grew angry and bitter at such
cruelty and corruption.
<p>
As we drove on, I found the poverty
of New Delhi duplicated in the countryside. We passed many settlements
teeming with rag-swathed, skeleton people--a sight that no Westerner
can view without compassion. There are children starving everywhere.
Cruel, open sores adorned their bodies; and unrelenting flies
swarmed to make a meal of the abundant rotting flesh. 
<p>
The probable first impulse of any American
who learns of India's plight is to send money and food; but by
sending such assistance he is really only compounding the agony.
The reason that so many are starving is the chronically high birth
rate. The resulting overpopulation outstrips the ability of the
people to feed themselves. Unless the givers tie aid to absolute
guarantees of population control, the increased food simply feeds
another reproducing generation that in turn only multiples the
problem! Despite this self-evident fact, Western nations have
poured unending food and medical supplies into India. The purpose
of the relief at its start early in this century was to help the
thousands who were starving. Paradoxically, because of our generosity
we can now proudly report that hundreds-of-millions starve in
India! The sunken faces of the malnourished, sick and mutilated
children around the nation are the results of misplaced humanitarianism
that has only increased human suffering and death.
<p>
At our next stop on this trip to the
Taj Mahal, my attention was diverted from the suffering of the
Indian people, to an innocent victim of those people. We had stopped
at a small bazaar along the road. Present were fakirs, snake charmers,
and animal trainers. One turban-crowned Indian had what he called
a &quot;dancing bear.&quot; A worn, leather leash was tightened
around the bear's neck, causing him to choke and gag. It was stifling
hot and this poor creature sweated profusely, soaking his heavy
coat and contributing to the severe skin infections that scarred
his body and had removed large patches of fur.
<p>
This bear was so emaciated that it was
frightening, for as he would stand and perform his tortured dance
he had an eerie resemblance to a man. I'll never forget the pitiful
look on that bear's face as the trainer whipped him with his stiff
cane pole. In human-like fashion the bear placed his paws over
his head to protect himself from the blows. Streaks of red blood
colored his digits. As I stood in the hot sun watching the wincing
bear I began to boil with anger.
<p>
I moved through the crowd with clenched
fists. It would have been so easy to wrench that pole from that
puny little torturer and give him a dose of the pain he was inflicting
on that pitiful bear. One more strike at that bear and I would
have at him, I thought. Then I felt a tug on my arm and heard
the calm, evenly modulated voice of the Englishman whispering
that he felt exactly the same way, but asking me, &quot;What are
you going to do, go to war against the whole Indian nation?&quot;
<p>
&quot;After all,&quot; he added &quot;this
atrocity is but a microcosm of the cruelty that exists here.&quot;
<p>
I stumbled back to the cab wondering
how many times in a man's life he must turn his head when justice
demands he act. Regardless of how much pity I have for the people
if India, it is true that every people ultimately is responsible
for its conditions of life, for its general health and well-being.
After gazing on the poor mistreated animal who has no control
over its destiny, a sadness came over me that was greater than
any I had felt since arriving in this forlorn nation.
<p>
On both sides of the highway onward
to Agra were cattle, thousands of them. The driver explained that
they were sacred. As he explained their religious sanctification
and protection, I thought about the great cattle industry the
nation could have. Later in the shops in Agra, I saw rats and
birds scampering around the food in the bins and not receiving
a second glance from the proprietors or their skinny customers.
In some areas of India even the rats are sacred.
<p>
Agra and New Delhi are far cleaner cities
(by their standards; all are abominable by ours) than the other
large cities like Calcutta or Bombay. In northern India the people
are taller, lighter skinned, and more sturdily built than those
of the hot coastal areas. Occasionally, I encountered a native
Indian who could easily pass for a southern European, or even
a Louisiana Creole. (a Creole has French and Spanish ancestry)
<p>
I had always wanted to see the Taj Mahal.
My father had described it to me a number of times, and my excitement
grew as we neared the famous structure. Anticipation welled-up,
tingling me like a cool breeze across my sweaty body. The Taj
Mahal was built long after the great flowering of the Aryan Civilization,
yet it contains many architectural and artistic qualities that
reflect the earlier era. As we passed through the shaded arches
of the outlying buildings, the whitish-blue, cloudless sky was
bright with glare. Then the great temple came into view, standing
magnificently, gleaming white in the sun. I had stepped out of
the filth, rot, and decay of modern India into an earlier era
of beauty, order and art. Sitting on the edge of the reflecting
pool, I just stared, losing all track of time. It is difficult
for me to describe my emotions, for I was completely overwhelmed
by its beauty. Rodney and I, usually both quite glib, sat motionless
and mute, and when one finally did speak the words automatically
came out in whispers of reverence for the splendor looming before
us.

<p>
After a while, historical reality began
to crowd in on me. I knew that most of the modern day Indian visitors
I saw around me were but poor reflections of the men and women
who walked these grounds centuries ago. Tourists from all over
the world find the temple very beautiful, but once they learn
of its origins, they leave saddened, for the great Taj Mahal was
built as a remembrance, a sepulcher if you will, by a man whose
wife died giving birth to her fourteenth child. I saw it as a
metaphor, a funerary monument to the memory of a people who gave
the earth great beauty.
<p>
Another feeling came over me as I viewed
the Taj Mahal in the sunlight. The rounded dome with its white,
bone-like features resembled a huge skull, symbolizing the spiritual
cranium of the Aryan people, one that once housed and held talented
and powerful minds; but which now only served as a magnificent
gravestone of a high culture and genetic treasure that is no more.
<p>
Unlike the thousands of decaying and
collapsing ancient temples around the rest of India, the Taj Mahal
is not pock-marked. Even just a few inches away, one can view
the overwhelming beauty in its inlaid stones and artwork, just
as one appreciates the architecture from a distance. The cool,
moist air of the interior of the Taj Mahal made me reluctant to
leave and begin the journey back to Delhi.
<p>
On the long road back, Rodney slept,
while I rested my head on the window frame and peered into the
dusty countryside, taking in the sights and sounds as nonchalantly
as if I had traveled on the road a thousand times. When I got
back to the YMCA, I took off my shoes and curled up on my musty
cot, falling asleep with my camera still around my neck.
<p>
A couple days later I decided to explore
some of the other old temples that dot the countryside. I hired
a cab, and it wasn't very long before I spotted a suitable target.
Soon I was walking across a grassy, dry area toward a huge temple
I could see in the distance. A few hundred feet from the paved
highway, I literally stumbled across another road; and it was,
in a word, magnificent. It was extremely old. Only a part of the
road was visible; the rest was covered with sediment. Stone had
been carved in perfect blocks and laid over a base of gravel.
The road was as level as a billiard table and would still be usable
if the weeds that had grown up in the cleavages of the stone were
cut.
<p>
As I walked over the ancient road and
through the thick patches of dry weeds toward the temple, I reviewed
all that I had read about India and all that I had seen firsthand:
the fact that the highest classes were the lightest-skinned, that
nothing was more insulting to an Indian than calling him &quot;black,&quot;
that Varna (caste) is the Indian word for color, that Sanskrit
is an ancient Indo-European language with direct links to every
other European language. A great deal of Sanskrit literature describes
many of the Aryan leaders as having light eyes and light hair.
I thought about the splendor that once was, and about the incessant
squalor I had witnessed since my arrival. I wondered about what
I might find at the temple looming ahead.
<p>
As I got closer to the temple, I noticed
that the dome was partially caved-in. Only two walls were left
standing. Still closer, I saw thousands of pock-marks all over
the structure, each of which once housed a precious stone, but
had long since been picked clean. I wondered if all the temples
and monuments of Europe and America will eventually endure the
same fate as this one.
<p>
Around the corner of the temple, on
the partially shaded side, I saw something that will forever remain
burned in my memory. There in the shade sat a little, brown, half-caste
Indian girl. She was thoroughly emaciated and resembled some sort
of hideous doll, but she moved slightly, and her animated bones
and skin had a terrifying effect. She was so malnourished that
her face had not developed properly, but her eyes were very large,
and in their own way hauntingly beautiful. On one cheek was an
open sore nearly the size of a quarter; there were more sores
on her arms, chest and legs, and each sore was covered by dozens
of flies. Occasionally, she would brush her frail hand over one
of the sores causing the flies to retreat. Inevitably though,
once her hand had passed, they returned to their grim feeding
like iron fillings to a magnet. She held out her hand to me, begging
for a few rupees. I dug my hand deep into my pocket, pulled out
all the Indian coins I had and carefully tipped them softly into
her dark, skeleton-like hand. Turning, I stumbled out into the
hot Indian sun, with my eyes blinded by tears.
<p>
On the way back to my room I wondered
if, in a few hundred years, some half-black descendant of mine
would be sitting among the ruins of our civilization, brushing
away the flies, waiting to die. Every day our nation grows a little
darker from the torrential immigration of non-whites , high non-white
birthrates, and increasing racial miscegenation; and with each
passing day, we see the quality of our lives decline. Crime is
ever on the increase, drug activity proliferates, educational
quality declines, and the American standard of living suffers.
The healthy racial values of our forefathers are ridiculed and
replaced by the pseudo-science of egalitarianism. Treason to our
heritage prospers and corruption feeds in the highest places.


<IMG WIDTH=144 HEIGHT=214 HSPACE=10 BORDER=0 ALIGN=LEFT hspace=15 vspace=5 SRC="images/indian1.gif">

<p>
All that keeps our society afloat are
the small number of scientists and technicians (predominately
Caucasian) who continue to create technological wizardry that
cushions the impact of the economic slide caused by lower individual
productivity, and the dependency of the growing welfare underclass.
Somehow, the increasingly hard-pressed, White middle class keeps
the wheels turning (and taxes flowing into the social structure),
but with lessening efficiency.
<p>
To the plaudits of the media, the Brahmins
of America and the West are slowly being replaced by the pariahs,
the Untouchables. Seeing that child in that prophetic setting
was my glimpse of a remorseless fate toward which the United States
and the Western World are hurdling. If that future is to be altered,
it will require each person who understands the racial truth -
- to forge by this knowledge -- policies that will preserve our
own heritage in our respective nations in the same way we now
seek to preserve the endangered whales or rare eagles.
<p>
The nation of India, like most of the
Third World, has already passed the point of no return. She cannot
feed or otherwise adequately take care of herself, not even with
repeated injections of Western capital, aid, and technology. The
huge populace of modern-day India cannot sustain the level of
culture and economic well-being that its high-caste forebears
originally created.
<p>
It is not, however, too late for America
and the West. No matter how dark our destiny may appear, there
is enough genetic treasure among our people to fashion a road
to the stars. Those who know the racial truth often excuse their
inaction by expressing pessimism. Suggesting that &quot;the battle
is already lost&quot; is often simply an excuse for cowardice.
Our race's evolutionary struggle for survival became the meaning
of my life when I looked into that little Indian girl's forlorn
face, for I then knew exactly what I must do. Prospects of victory
or defeat became irrelevant to my responsibility and my honor.
My life was from that defining moment, in the service of my people
and the Promethean task ahead. 

<img width=144 height=214 hspace=10 border=0 align=right hspace=15 vspace=5 src="images/indian2.gif">
<p>
When I grow tired and weary in this
battle, and I find my character smeared or my personal life attacked,
her gaunt face is there to haunt me, to drive me onward. When
my personal safety, or that of my loved ones is explicitly threatened,
her pleading countenance is there to remind me in the most graphic
human terms what failure means for our progeny. I learned that
I had to take personal responsibility for the well-being of my
people. By that, I don't mean that I felt it was my destiny to
lead, but it was my personal responsibility to do all that I could
for the survival of my heritage. In the crisis our race now faces,
all of us who know the truth must carry that same personal responsibility,
and with it the understanding that any individual danger or suffering
must be endured when the fate of our whole people is at stake.
Such was the altruism that brought our forebears through the crucible
of the Ice Ages of prehistoric Europe, and now we must draw from
that genetically imprinted trait as we stand on the brink of being
inundated by the masses of the Third World.
<p>
Before my journey to India, the racial
ideals that I believed in l abstract concepts and principles.
In the moment I saw that emaciated child in the ruins, all my
thoughts and concepts were dramatically transformed from sterile
contemplations into the reality of flesh and blood. I finally
realized that my cause is different than that of an athletic contest,
business competition, winning of an election, or even struggling
for an important new scientific discovery. It is not about being
right or wrong about ideas, but about life itself; the natural
laws that provide it's beauty, character, and meaning. I had already
committed myself to the struggle for my race's survival long before
I saw that fated child, but that experience changed an intellectual
commitment into an almost holy obligation.
<p>
An often quoted passage from the <i>Bhagavad
Gita</i> came to my mind with powerful meaning:

<p><em><strong>Likewise having regard for duty to
your caste<br>
For in a warrior, there exists no
better thing than<br>
A fight required of duty</strong> 

<p>(Chapter 2, verse 30)</em><br>

<p>
I realized that day in the scorching
Indian sun that I had to adopt the spirit of a warrior -- that
my race was in a life and death struggle that transcended the
centuries. Selfish pursuits seemed trivial, and my life became
from that moment interwoven with the Cause, a Cause that I knew
that I would never abandon. Through years of heartbreak and hardship,
physical weariness and character assassination, but also in the
exhilarating moments of success and acclaim, my heart has remained
true. The flame that ignited in me on that hot August day is still
white hot and imperishable.<br>

<p><h1>What Is Racism?</h1>
<p><h4>by Thomas Jackson</h4>

<p><i>Originally Published in American Renaissance, Vol 2, No. 8
</i>
<hr>
<p>There is surely no nation in the world that holds "racism"
in greater horror than does the United States. Compared to other
kinds of offenses, it is thought to be somehow more
reprehensible. The press and public have become so used to tales
of murder, rape, robbery, and arson, that any but the most
spectacular crimes are shrugged off as part of the inevitable
texture of American life. "Racism" is never shrugged off.        
For example, when a white Georgetown Law School student reported
earlier this year that black students are not as qualified as
white students, it set off a booming, national controversy about
"racism." If the student had merely murdered someone he would
have attracted far less attention and criticism.
      
<p>Racism is, indeed, the national obsession. Universities
are on full alert for it, newspapers and politicians denounce it,
churches preach against it, America is said to be racked with it,
but just what <b>is</b> racism?
      
<p>Dictionaries are not much help in understanding what is
meant by the word. They usually define it as the belief that
one's own ethnic stock is superior to others, or as the belief
that culture and behavior are rooted in race. When Americans
speak of racism they mean a great deal more than this.        
Nevertheless, the dictionary definition of racism is a clue to
understanding what Americans <b>do</b> mean. A peculiarly American
meaning derives from the current dogma that all ethnic stocks are
equal. Despite clear evidence to the contrary, all races have
been declared to be equally talented and hard- working, and
anyone who questions the dogma is thought to be not merely wrong
but evil.
      
<p>The dogma has logical consequences that are profoundly
important. If blacks, for example, are equal to whites in every
way, what accounts for their poverty, criminality, and
dissipation? Since any theory of racial differences has been
outlawed, the only possible explanation for black failure is
white racism. And since blacks are markedly poor, crime-prone,
and dissipated, America must be racked with pervasive racism.
Nothing else could be keeping them in such an abject state.      
                                                                                      
<p>All public discourse on race today is locked into this 
rigid logic. Any explanation for black failure that does not 
depend on white wickedness threatens to veer off into the forbidden
territory of racial differences. Thus, even if today's whites can
find in their hearts no desire to oppress blacks, yesterday's
whites must have oppressed them. If whites do not consciously
oppress blacks, they must oppress them Unconsciously. If no
obviously racist individuals can be identified, then societal
<b>institutions</b> must be racist. Or, since blacks are failing so
terribly in America, there simply must be millions of white
people we do not know about, who are working day and night to
keep blacks in misery. The dogma of racial equality leaves no
room for an explanation of black failure that is not, in some
fashion, an indictment of white people.

<p>The logical consequences of this are clear. Since we are
required to believe that the only explanation for non-white
failure is white racism, every time a non-white is poor, commits
a crime, goes on welfare, or takes drugs, white society stands
accused of yet another act of racism. All failure or misbehavior
by non-whites is standing proof that white society is riddled
with hatred and bigotry. For precisely so long as non-whites fail
to succeed in life at exactly the same level as whites, whites
will be, by definition, thwarting and oppressing them. This
obligatory pattern of thinking leads to strange conclusions.
First of all, racism is a sin that is thought to be committed
almost exclusively by white people. Indeed, a black congressman
from Chicago, Gus Savage, and Coleman Young, the black mayor of
Detroit, have argued that only white people <b>can</b> be racist.
Likewise, in 1987, the affirmative action officer of the State
Insurance Fund of New York issued a company pamphlet in which
she explained that <b>all</b> whites are racist and that <b>only</b> whites
can be racist. How else could the plight of blacks be explained
without flirting with the possibility of racial inequality?      

<p>Although some blacks and liberal whites concede that non-whites
can, perhaps, be racist, they invariably add that non-whites have
been forced into it as self-defense because of centuries of white
oppression. What appears to be non-white racism is so
understandable and forgivable that it hardly deserves the name.
Thus, whether or not an act is called racism depends on the race
of the racist. What would surely be called racism when done by
whites is thought to be normal when done by anyone else. The
reverse is also true.
      
<p>Examples of this sort of double standard are so common,
it is almost tedious to list them: When a white man kills a black
man and uses the word "nigger" while doing so, there is an 
enormous media uproar and the nation beats its collective breast;
when members of the black Yahweh cult carry out ritual murders of
random whites, the media are silent (see AR of March, 1991).
College campuses forbid pejorative statements about non-whites as
"racist," but ignore scurrilous attacks on whites.
      
<p>At election time, if 60 percent of the white voters vote
for a white candidate, and 95 percent of the black voters vote
for the black opponent, it is white who are accused of racial
bias. There are 107 "historically black" colleges, whose
fundamental blackness must be preserved in the name of diversity,
but all historically white colleges must be forcibly integrated
in the name of... the same thing. To resist would be racist.     
      
<p>"Black pride" is said to be a wonderful and worthy thing, but
anything that could be construed as an expression of white pride
is a form of hatred. It is perfectly natural for third-world
immigrants to expect school instruction and driver's tests in
their own languages, whereas for native Americans to ask them to
learn English is racist.
      
<p>Blatant anti-white prejudice, in the form of affirmative
action, is now the law of the land. Anything remotely like
affirmative action, if practiced in favor of whites, would be
attacked as despicable favoritism.
      
<p>All across the country, black, Hispanic, and Asian clubs
and caucuses are thought to be fine expressions of ethnic
solidarity, but any club or association expressly for whites is
by definition racist. The National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) campaigns openly for black
advantage but is a respected "civil rights" organization. The
National Association for the Advancement of White People (NAAWP)
campaigns merely for equal treatment of all races, but is said to
be viciously racist.
      
<p>At a few college campuses, students opposed to
affirmative action have set up student unions for whites,
analogous to those for blacks, Hispanics, etc, and have been
roundly condemned as racists. Recently, when the white students
at Lowell High School in San Francisco found themselves to be a
minority, they asked for a racially exclusive club like the ones
that non- whites have. They were turned down in horror. Indeed,
in America today, any club not specifically formed to be a white
enclave but whose members simply happen all to be white is
branded as racist.
      
<p>Today, one of the favorite slogans that define the
asymmetric quality of American racism is "celebration of
diversity." It has begun to dawn on a few people that "diversity"
is always achieved at the expense of whites (and sometimes men),
and never the other way around. No one proposes that Howard
University be made more diverse by admitting whites, Hispanics,
or Asians. No one ever suggests that National Hispanic University
in San Jose (CA) would benefit from the diversity of having
non-Hispanics on campus. No one suggests that the Black
Congressional Caucus or the executive ranks of the NAACP or the
Mexican-American Legal Defense and Educational Fund suffer from a
lack of diversity. Somehow, it is perfectly legitimate for them
to celebrate <b>homogeneity</b>. And yet any all-white group - a
company, a town, a school, a club, a neighborhood - is thought to
suffer from a crippling lack of diversity that must be remedied
as quickly as possible. Only when whites have been reduced to a
minority has "diversity" been achieved.
      
<p>Let us put it bluntly: To "celebrate" or "embrace"
diversity, as we are so often asked to do, is no different from
<b>deploring an excess of whites</b>. In fact, the entire nation is
thought to suffer from an excess of whites. Our current
immigration policies are structured so that approximately 90
percent of our annual 800,000 legal immigrants are non-white. The
several million illegal immigrants that enter the country every
year are virtually all non-white. It would be racist not to be
grateful for this laudable contribution to "diversity."        
It is, of course, only white nations that are called upon to
practice this kind of "diversity." It is almost criminal to
imagine a nation of any other race countenancing blatant
dispossession of this kind.
      
<p>What if the United States were pouring its poorest,
least educated citizens across the border into Mexico? Could
anyone be fooled into thinking that Mexico was being "culturally
enriched?" What if the state of Chihuahua were losing its
majority population to poor whites who demanded that schools be
taught in English, who insisted on celebrating the Fourth of
July, who demanded the right to vote even if they weren't
citizens, who clamored for "affirmative action" in jobs and
schooling?
      
<p>Would Mexico - or any other non-white nation - tolerate
this kind of cultural and demographic depredation? Of course not.
Yet white Americans are supposed to look upon the flood of
Hispanics and Asians entering their country as a priceless
cultural gift. They are supposed to "celebrate" their own loss
of influence, their own dwindling numbers, their own
dispossession, for to do otherwise would be hopelessly racist.   
      
<p>There is another curious asymmetry about American racism.
When non- whites advance their own racial purposes, no one ever
accuses them of "hating" another group. Blacks can join "civil
rights" groups and Hispanics can be activists without fear of
being branded as bigots and hate mongers. They can agitate openly
for racial preferences that can come only at the expense of
whites. They can demand preferential treatment of all kinds
without anyone ever suggesting that they are "anti-white."       
                                                                        
<p>Whites, on the other hand, need only express their opposition 
to affirmative action to be called haters. They need only subject
racial policies that are clearly prejudicial to themselves to be
called racists. Should they actually go so far as to say that
they prefer the company of their own kind, that they wish to be
left alone to enjoy the fruits of their European heritage, they
are irredeemably wicked and hateful.
      
<p>Here, then is the final, baffling inconsistency about
American race relations. All non-whites are allowed to prefer the
company of their own kind, to think of themselves as groups with
interests distinct from those of the whole, and to work openly
for group advantage. None of this is thought to be racist. At the
same time, <b>whites</b> must <b>also</b> champion the racial interests of
non-whites. They must sacrifice their own future on the altar of
"diversity" and cooperate in their own dispossession. They are to
encourage, even to subsidize, the displacement of a European
people and culture by alien peoples and cultures. To put it in
the simplest possible terms, white people are cheerfully to
slaughter their own society, to commit racial and cultural
suicide. To refuse to do so would be racism.
      
<p>Of course, the entire non-white enterprise in the United
States is perfectly natural and healthy. Nothing could be more
natural than to love one's people and to hope that it should
flourish. Filipinos and El Salvadorans are doubtless astonished
to discover that simply by setting foot in the United States they
are entitled to affirmative action preferences over native-born
whites, but can they be blamed for accepting them? Is it
surprising that they should want their languages, their cultures,
their brothers and sisters to take possession and put their mark
indelibly on the land? If the once-great people of a once-great
nation is bent upon self-destruction and is prepared to hand
over land and power to whomever shows up and asks for it, why
should Mexicans and Cambodians complain?
      
<p>No, it is the white enterprise in the United States that
is unnatural, unhealthy, and without historical precedent. Whites
have let themselves be convinced that it is racist merely to
object to dispossession, much less to work for their own
interests. Never in the history of the world has a dominant
people thrown open the gates to strangers, and poured out its
wealth to aliens. Never before has a people been fooled into
thinking that there was virtue or nobility in surrendering its
heritage, and giving away to others its place in history.        
Of all the races in America, only whites have been tricked into
thinking that a preference for one's own kind is racism. Only
whites are ever told that a love for their own people is somehow
"hatred" of others. All healthy people prefer the company of
their own kind, and it has nothing to do with hatred. All men
love their families more than their neighbors, but this does not
mean that they hate their neighbors. Whites who love their racial
family need bear no ill will towards non-whites. They only wish
to be left alone to participate in the unfolding of their racial
and cultural destinies.
      
<p>What whites in America are being asked to do is
therefore utterly unnatural. They are being asked to devote
themselves to the interests of other races and to ignore the
interests of their own. This is like asking a man to forsake his
own children and love the children of his neighbors, since to do
otherwise would be "racist."
      
<p>What then, is "racism?" It is considerably more than any
dictionary is likely to say. It is any opposition by whites to
official policies of racial preference for non-whites. It is any
preference by whites for their own people and culture. It is any
resistance by whites to the idea of becoming a minority people.
It is any unwillingness to be pushed aside. It is, in short, any
of the normal aspirations of people-hood that have defined
nations since the beginning of history - but only so long as the
aspirations are those of whites.

<P><B>by Bob Matthews</B></P>

<P>Morris Dees has written a book that purports to be about America's militia
movement entitled <B><I>Gathering Storm</I></B> with a subtitle of <I>America's
Militia Threat</I>. Though the title would make one think it is about the
militia, it is in fact a book largely about Louis Beam, a long-time patriot,
writer, and speaker. The militia movement is mentioned as a by-product
of the attack on Beam.</P>

<P>Dees wastes no time launching his verbal ICBM's at Beam. From the first
sentence to the last page Beam is castigated for his speeches against what
is wrong in America today. Beam's speech at Estes Park, Co. in 1992 plays
a central part of the book. Page one, line one (quoted without Dees' own
distracting commentary) begins thusly:</P>

<UL>
<P>Louis Beam minced no words.</P>

<P>&quot;I warn you calmly, coldly, and wit<TT>h</TT>out reservation that
over the next ten years you will come to hate government more than anything
in your life. The federal government in north Idaho has demonstrated brutally,
horribly, and with great terror how it will enforce its claim that we are
religious fanatics and enemies of the state. We must in one voice, cry
out that we will not tolerate their stinking, murdering, lying, corrupt
government.</P>

<P>Men, in the name of our Father, we are called upon to make a decision,
a decision that you will make in the quietness of your heart, in the still
places of the night.</P>

<P>As you lie on your bed and you look up at the ceiling tonight, you must
answer the question: Will it be liberty or will it be death? As for me,
give me liberty or give me death!&quot;</P>
</UL>

<P>Dees claims that Beam evokes the image of Adolf Hitler speaking to the
assembled millions in pre-war Germany. Reassembling Beam's speech from
the dissection performed by Dees leaves us with something like the following
paragraph, this time with Dees' interjections included.</P>

<UL>
<P>&quot;We bear the torch of light, of justice, of liberty, and we will
be heard,&quot; Beam shouted over the cheers of his audience. &quot;We
will not yield this country to the forces of darkness, oppression, and
tyranny. I cannot compromise with such men, they are men without principle.
I cannot reason with such men, they are men without reason. But I can warn
them, and it is a warning they must take to heart. I and many others in
this country, many in this room tonight , will not roll over and play dead
for your New World Order.&quot; The amens, hallelujahs, and applause that
erupted from the audience made Beam's closing words almost inaudible.</P>
</UL>

<P>Dees believes that &quot;There is nothing harmless about Louis Beam.
Charismatic, intelligent, and well spoken, Beam moves people... He was,
and is, far and away the most dangerous...of leaders.&quot; [I spare the
reader of this review the name calling Dees engages in at this point in
the book]</P>

<P>One thing is for sure. Beam knows the government. In the course of the
speech he makes a forbidding prediction that has sadly come true.</P>

<UL>
<P>&quot;The attack on the Weaver family by federal assassins was an attack
upon every family in the United States. This time the federal terrorists,
masquerading as officers, came for Randy Weaver. Next time they may come
for you... If federal terrorism goes unchallenged, then no one in this
nation is safe. Government terrorism, if ignored, does not go away, but
gets worse. Like a lion having tasted the blood of human victims, they
will come for more, new victims.&quot;</P>
</UL>

<P>Less than a year later black-booted thugs would pour from a cattle truck
in Waco, resulting in the horrible death of nearly a hundred people by
bullets and fire.</P>

<P>It is clear from a quick reading of <B><I>Gathering Storm</I></B> that
Beam's main crime and reason for being targeted by Dees is his ability
to appeal to the hearts of men in his speeches. Those who have heard him
speak often refer to him as the &quot;Patrick Henry&quot; of the American
Right. So is it Hitler or Henry? This is a decision that will be made by
those who listen to him speak. Has Adolf Hitler come to America with a
Texas drawl, or has Patrick Henry returned to once again urge his countrymen
to rebel against government tyranny?</P>

<P>You be the judge. A tape of this speech can be ordered from Stormfront
publications.</P>

<p><em>An Essay by L. R. Beam </em></center>


<p>

The internet, perhaps the last truly free means of information exchange
in the Western World, may soon be choked by censorship and governmental
controls. The circumscribing of the net may cause the death of what has
become the first people-to-people exchange of ideas and information on a
world wide basis.  The forces behind this effort appear at first glance
to be an unlikely coalition of conspirators, the CIA, some Jewish
Religious groups, and various foreign governments.  While this unholy
alliance for censorship and control may seem unusual to some, politics
makes the bed for these strange fellows.  Indisputably, an international
cabal of special interest groups both within and out of governments are
working both openly and secretly to end the unregulated direct exchange
of information between people.  At stake is nothing less then the
regaining of information control which the internet has shattered.  Up
for grabs is nothing more than the  thinking and decision making
abilities of informed men.  

<p>

Information has flowed from the top down for most of this century.
Filtering of information by middle men from government, newspapers,
radio, and then television has left most Americans depending upon Paul
Harvey "for the rest of the story."  Suddenly, almost without warning,
the internet mushroomed into popularity connecting people all over the
world together electronically and thereby threatening the power of those
who disseminate information.   If  information is power,  then the
control of information is more power.  The ideas of men are shaped by
what they are told.  For those who hope to erect a "New World Order"
upon what they view as the antiquated ashes of free speech, control of
the internet has jumped to near top of the list of "things to do." 
Governments and religious groups manipulate and control people by what
they are allowed to know or not know.  A decision has been made by the
information brokers to end unregulated information exchange.  Overnight
the propaganda begins as these forces build their case for control and
censorship.

<p>

Quickly the nightly news lights up with horror stories of pornography on
the net. Minutes later the same channel runs four hours of lurid
programming bringing profanity, sex, sodomitizers and violence into the
homes of viewers who were just shocked about porno on the net.
Newspapers carrier feature length stories about children being lured
from home over the computer telephone line, as if somehow typing a
request to a child for sex over the phone line is more effective than
saying it over the same phone line. The Anti-Defamation League issues a
report saying that bomb plans can be found on the net along with anti-
Jewish opinion.  As if the same were not available in every public
library in the United States.  Politicians in Washington began to talk
about "protecting the children."  The same politicians who's destructive
social policies and no win wars have destroyed more mothers sons than
all the pagan empires of the past.  Rabbi Abraham Cooper calls for
censorship of politically incorrect ideas in Canada and asks for the
establishment of an "internet police."  A delegation from the Nazi-
hunting Simon Wiesenthal Center in Vienna Austria, which has for the
most part ran out of eighty year old former Nazis to hunt, takes on the
new task of information censors and asks Italian Prime Minister
Lamberto Dini, European Union president to back World Jewish Congress
initiatives to stop those who disagree on the impact and importance of 
the holocaust from using the internet. Then in a joint effort of the ADL
and the Simon Wiesenthal Center letters are mailed to Internet service
providers in early 1996 urging providers not to carry messages that
contain non-complimentary opinion about Jews, which is quickly labeled
as "cyberhate speech."  This is but a glimpse of the public efforts of
the information censors to unleash "info police" on the net.  It is
clear that those who have previously served as the middlemen of
politically correct information are distraught at their having been
taken out of the loop.  

<p>

Meanwhile, sources within the federal government, who wish to remain
unnamed, reveal that there are considerable behind the scene efforts to
bring the flow of information under government control.  In the
labyrinthine bunkers of the CIA in Arlington Virginia, a team of
planners has begun discussion on how to control the net by establishing
internet node servers throughout the system that will act as a
"strainer" of unwanted electronic information flow  (there are
indications this process has begun now).  The Army Security Agency
(ASA), which has the worlds most sophisticated signals intelligence and
electronic monitoring capabilities has began setting up clandestine
servers to monitor traffic, catalog, classify, and achieve.  

<p>

>From the above sampling of events, it is clear that both government and
pressure groups with sacred cows to defend have determined that
uncontrolled information flow between people is a threat to their
interests.  The results of this statist thinking will lead to a "war on
information" similar to the  "war on drugs," curtailing free speech and
informed opinion.  Like the war on drugs the real objective will not be
to save society  but rather to control society.  CYBER WARS are breaking
out between the people and government over the flow of information. 
What is wanted by these would be internet thought police is nothing less
then the right of government and religious (in this case Judaism) 
imprimatur on the transfer of electronic information: an electron iron
curtain.

<p>

Efforts at censorship by religious groups are not new to this continent. 
The Spanish Catholic church which saw nothing of value among the
writings of Aztecs and Mayans ordered their books burned in contempt.  
Like them, Rabbi Abraham Cooper and the Anti-defamation League see
nothing of value in the words of those who beg to disagree. Black robed
priests yelled the smear words of the 16th century "Vile heretic!" and
labeled non-catholics "pagan savages."  Rabbi Cooper and his religious
cohorts of the new inquisition cry "anti-Semitic" and label those who
believe differently "hatemongers."  The words have changed, but for
those shouting them the objective is the same: eliminate the opposition,
the opponent is never answered; he is discredited.  Fear kept many
silent who would have otherwise opposed the Catholic Inquisition.  Fear
of the rack and straps of being labeled anti-Semitic will keep many
quite today.   The call now for censorship by Rabbis is much like the
pyres of Priests in the fifteenth century it is an electronic
equivalent of book burning. The zealots willingness to accept only his
personal vision of the world around him has led mankind down this same
pernicious path before. Intolerance it is clear, is not solely a non-
Jewish characteristic.  A new inquisition has begun.  This one will seek
out the heretics of the internet for the stake.   Each age it seems, has
it's TORQUEMADA. 

<p>

A warning of what is to come: as the Federal Government, Anti-Defamation
League, and the Central Intelligence Agency seek to squelch or control
the net, look for senseless acts of random electronic violence.  These
acts of subterfuge will be committed by computer nerds at CIA and the
ADL or their  agent provocateurs and will appear to have been
perpetrated by  "white racists," "neo-nazis," "patriots,"  "extremist
anti-government radicals," "hackers," or other identifiable dissidents
of the right and left.  The purpose of these incidents will be similar
to those of a drive by shooting to terrorize people into submission.  In
this case consent is wanted for censorship rather than drug turf but the
principal is the same: a political/religious gang wants control.
Understand that establishment media, as the propaganda arm of the
government, will on cue make the call for censorship of the net. Those
who have the resources to employ the best politicians money can buy also
own newspapers, radio and television networks,  for all serve their
design.  That design being the control of people through the filtering
of information and repressive laws.  After investing billions of dollars
in media/information empires and politicians,  all geared to work in
tangent keeping people under control, these modern day equivalents of
the book burners of former ages will not willingly let unfettered
information exchange hinder their efforts. With at least four federal
agencies (FBI, CIA, FINCEN, and ASA) investing hundreds of millions in
advanced computer systems designed solely to monitor and track people
technological warfare between the people and government will be a major
component of  the rest of this century and perhaps longer.  

<p>

The new head of the CIA John Deutsch was hand picked by Bill Clinton and
his backers to carry  forward plans for a technological police state to
rest upon the typical shoulders of bullet proof vests, black boots, and
front doors shattering under their assault. Air Force Lieutenant Colonel
Edward G. Lansdale, CIA operative par excellence, personally recruited
the new CIA director for his first Government job in the early 1960's at
just 22.  Deutsch became one of Secretary of Defense Robert MacNamara's
('we never intended to win in Viet Nam') whiz kids in the Pentagon who
would help to design the Vietnam War; a slaughterhouse for other kids
not so fortuity  as to have political connections.  Deutsch has held
political posts under Democratic administrations and advisory or
academic positions during Republican administrations.  Deutsch became
part of the elite permanent government of the United States that is
accountable to no one, and immune to the oversight process.  The shell
game of elections and political parties have no effect on their
careers..  This select cadre move in and out of various Federal agencies
and advisory positions, always on the public dole, never elected,
spending their entire lives trying to control the affairs of others. 
Much like the secret CIA Air Base (Area 51) at Groom Lake in
southeastern Nevada, there is an aureole of secrecy surrounding their
lives and functions.   Deutsch's grandfather was a diamond merchant who
ran the Zionist Federation of Belgium and he is therefore expected to
work closely with the ADL and other pro-censorship groups.  President
Clinton appointed Deutsch as Director Central Intelligence in May of
1995 at the moment when the bombing of the Federal kindergarten in
Oklahoma had allowed his Administration to launch a maximum
political/propaganda counter-offensive against the rapidly growing
discontent with, and mistrust of  the federal government.  Black smoke,
mutilated bodies, dying children, crying distraught mothers, created
exactly the atmosphere the government needed to turn things around. 
John Deutsch is the man in charge of that effort for the government.

<p>

Censorship is a word of many meanings.  In a narrow sense it of course
may refer to suppression of information, or ideas.  In a broader sense
however, it is the rape of the human mind:  Taking away that which is
needed to make fair, informed opinions about this life.  The mental
rapist of today is no different in his goals than the back ally pervert
who by force assaults a defenseless woman, taking from someone else that
which he has no right to.  Both acts are the works of the most
contemptible sorts of humankind, desperate men, fearful of the light of
day.  What is being called for by the online information censors is the
equivalent to Bosnian  ethnic cleansing' a sort of information cleansing
of the internet.  

<p>

It seems ironic to many that the ADL which has made innumerable calls
for "diversity" would spearhead these efforts at censorship. What is
being called for by them, the Simon Wiesenthal Center, and Rabbi Cooper
is the equivalent to Bosnian ethnic cleansing' a sort of information
cleansing of the internet.  Perhaps a new organizational motto of  
"Many Cultures, One Opinion" would be more in line with true ADL
objectives. It is not  just a little bit odd that the same people who
fear firearms in the hands of the people fear information in the minds
of people. The ADL supported the recent government ban on certain types
of firearms just as it supports government action to censor the net.  As
firearms laws only disarm honest citizens who obey the laws, information
bans only effect people who desire to think for themselves.  One pundit
has already quipped that "I'll give up my information when they pry my
cold dead fingers from the keyboard."

<p>

In closing the author would like to make two additional things clear. 
First, there are Jews who oppose censorship although to this point their
voice is but a whisper compared to the intolerance of the Anti-
Defamation League and Rabbi Cooper.  Second, that writing about Jewish
religious leaders and government spymasters operating in a collusive
effort to erect an electron iron curtain to restrict freedom of speech
and information does not make one anti-Semitic or anti-government.  The
truth <em>is</em> anti-Semitic.  The government <em>is</em> erecting a police state.  The
author opposes both oppressive religious groups and repressive
government.  If speaking the truth and opposing tyranny makes one anti-Semitic 
and anti-government, then I am both...

<h3>Who we are. Where we came from.</h3></center>
<br>
<center><p><em>Learn about your heritage in this synopsis of another soon-to-be-published book by <a href="mailto:odin@pixie.co.za">Odin</a></em></center>.

<br>Great causes, which have fallen and risen...
<br>Civilizations which have conquered their known worlds...
<br>Technological wonders of which others can only dream...
<p>All these are achievements of the White race, very possibly the greatest race that has ever walked the face of this earth.
But who is the White race, and where did they come from?
<p>Broadly speaking there are three main sub divisions within the White race - Nordic, Alpine and Mediterranean.
<h3>SUB GROUPS</h3>
<p>Although these names seem to be referring to geographic places, they did in fact originally mean certain physical types.
<p>The Nordic sub group is recognizable by their tallness, light hair and eye colour and long skull.
<p>The Alpine sub group is recognizable by their shorter stature, round skulls and brown eyes and hair.
<p>The Mediterranean sub group is recognizable by their middle size stature, and their dark eyes and hair. The Mediterranean skull shape can be long or round.
<p>There are other sub groupings of the White Race, but these are generally mixed types - for example the Dinarics (found in Poland especially) who have light hair and eyes but the round skulls of the Alpine - the product of a Nordic - Alpine mix.
<h3>ORIGIN</h3>
<p>When did this broad category of races appear?
<p>Evolutionists would have you believe that the human kind originated in Africa, and as this early man migrated north, so did his pigmentation become light and his eye and hair colour lighter - by evolution of course.
<p>Creationists would have you believe that mankind was created by a God suddenly somewhere in the Middle East.
<p>Both theories are just that - theories, and the archaeological evidence tells quite a different story. The archaeological evidence consists of skeletal remains found at various sites around the world. From these skeletal types we can determine the size and physical features of the people who lived at that time.
<h3>NEANDERTHAL MAN</h3>
<p>What we see is that until about 40,000 or 30,000 years ago there was a race of beings who walked upright - called Homo Erectus. Homo Erectus was a two-legged creature who possessed very low mental faculties. This Homo Erectus is what is commonly known as Neanderthal man. His physical features were a small skull and particularly small cranial - brain - capacity. His arms were longer in relation to his body size that Homo Sapiens, and he was prognathic - a fancy scientific term which means that the forehead slopes back and the teeth stick out significantly - usually further than the furthest point of the nose or the chin.
<p>The evolutionists would have us believe that Homo Sapiens (which is Latin for Wise Man) evolved from Homo Erectus - but of course this is where the evolutionary theory falls flat - there is no conclusive genetic link between Neanderthal man and Homo Sapiens. On the contrary, the archaeological evidence would indicate that at the end of the last great ice age - which may have lasted hundreds of thousands of years and which only finally receded about 40,000 years ago, Homo Sapiens appeared out of the north and swept down through Europe, physically destroying Neanderthal man.
<h3>UPPER PALEOLITHIC</h3>
<p>For 20,000 years during this closing ice age - called the Upper Paleolithic period - a term referring only to the type of culture that existed amongst these early Homo Sapiens - our ancestors, the White race's ancestors, lived as hunter gatherers in Europe.
<p>Their physical remains and artifacts from this time are plentiful - and what is really amazing is how far spread out they were. This first race of people with whom we can claim a genetic affinity, were what is called the proto Nordic racial type - tall, light hair and eyes.
<p>In certain isolated areas in Europe you can still find perfect living examples of this racial type, and they differ only slightly in height from modern day Nordics.
<p>This great proto Nordic race lived in a broad band spanning from Spain right across Europe all the way to central Asia and even to the Pacific rim, where skeletal remains have been found as well.
<p>In Siberia and Asia they were eventually absorbed by the Mongoloid races and the same happened in the Pacific rim - for example the Ainu people of Japan - that society's highest class - are very clearly crosses of Mongoloids and Whites. They differ so substantially from the rest of the Japanese population that this is visible even to the Western eye.
<h3>PASTORAL PEOPLE</h3>
<p>When this great Ice age finally ended, some of these White hunters became a pastoral people. The first artifacts made from bone and stone date from this period - about 35,000 years ago. With established settlements came developments such as fire, paintings stone blades and the fashioning of animal bones into weapons and tools. Sewing needles were also developed during this period.
<p>Musical instruments also made their appearance- at certain sites in Southern France flutes dating back 27,000 years have been found. A typical settlement would have about 5 to 20 families living together. Coal was also first used as a fuel at about this time.
<p>They fired clay statues in ovens, had bows and arrows (a weapon which first appeared on the scene about 10,000 years ago).
<p>Their greatest failing was that they left no written records of their achievements - only paintings on rock walls.
<h3>ALPINES AND MEDITERRANEANS</h3>
<p>With the total disappearance of the Ice Age certain biological changes did start to creep into this proto Nordic race. In Southern and Central Europe, a process of an increasing head breadth began to develop which eventually resulted in the Alpine race.
<p>The Mediterranean race also appeared at about this time - also originally of Nordic extraction, it appears as if they developed their own physical characteristics due to long periods of isolation around the Mediterranean basin.
<p>I must stress here that what we today know as "Mediterraneans" are in fact different to these original Mediterraneans. The Mediterraneans commonly referred to today are much darker that the original Mediterraneans. The reason for this difference we will see presently.
<p>The most well preserved example of this age comes from caves in Southern France, called the Azilian culture, after the caves at Mes d'Azil. Here stones were found with what appears to be writing on them dating from this period - but they have never been deciphered and it remains to this day speculation as to what they exactly are.
<h3>NEOLITHIC AGE</h3>
<p>As climatic conditions improved, so occurred what is called the Neolithic revolution. Again, this is a fancy term indicating only a change in living style. Neolithic means the establishment of farms and crops and even more settled lifestyles.
<p>Although there are isolated examples of proto Nordics having established farms at the beginning of the Neolithic period in Northern Europe, the fact is that the climatic conditions were not ripe for large scale farming. The proto Nordics, Alpines and darker Mediterraneans who were living in the more climatically favourable Middle East were the first to start with large scale farming and settlements. Cereal crops were planted in the Middle east 10,000 years ago. 
<p>The cereal grain farmers spread their skills westwards, penetrating central Europe about 8000 years ago - when these crops first started appearing in Italy and the Balkans.
<h3>SEMITES AND MONGOLS</h3>
<p>Here we must of course bear in mind that the inhabitants of the Middle East at this period in history were not the same people who inhabit that region now! The Semites and Mongols (who lived further east) were still migrating North and West from ancient homelands in the South and East. 
<p>The people who lived in the Middle East at the time we are talking about now were a mixture of proto Nordics, Alpines and Mediterraneans, with Mediterraneans being in the majority. Although they do not predate the Upper Paleothic settlements in Europe - they can most certainly be said to have provided much of the impetus for early White civilization.
<p>Having said that, it was so that almost without fail the leadership elite of these Middle Eastern inhabitants were Nordics. A few examples: the first Egyptian societies were clearly White. The majority of the population were Mediterraneans, while the leadership elite was Nordic. The mummified remains of numerous pharaohs and common folk from the first great Egyptian civilization have these undeniable racial characteristics, while the first written reference to blond hair is made on the wall of the tomb of the pharaoh Cheops - his daughter, Queen Hetep-Heres II, is identified as having blond hair. Cheops was of course the builder of the great Pyramids we still see today outside Cairo.
<p>These racial types dominated in the Middle East for nearly 10,000 years, eventually being displaced and intermingle with massive waves of Semitic and Mongoloid invaders.
<h3>SUMERIA</h3>
<p>The first great White Egyptian civilization was in fact predated by about some 3000 years by the great Sumerian civilization - another  population whose racial make up was predominantly Mediterranean with a Nordic ruling elite.  This civilization, founded between the two great rivers, the Tigris and the Euphrates, even built pyramids - called Ziggurats - of their own long before the Egyptians apparently stole the idea from them.
<p>The Sumerian civilization was the first truly literate civilization, and was established as late as 3000 BC - some 5000 years ago. The most famous city state of the Sumerians was Babylon, which later became one of the wonders of the ancient world because of its beautiful hanging gardens. 
<p>The first great novel - a recreational work of fiction, was written down in Babylon - The Epic of Gilgamesh (which interestingly enough has as part of its story line the flooding of the world - clearly this was from where the later Hebrew religionists took the idea of Noah's Ark and the flood.)
<p>The first written law statutes also date from this Sumerian civilization - the Law code of Hammurabi, which dates from 1 760 BC.
<p>A number of other smaller White civilizations sprang up at this time in this region as well, each of them contributing in their own way to the advancement of civilization.
<h3>CARTHAGE</h3>
<p>Amongst them were the Phonecians, a people originally of Greek origin who established our modern alphabet and through trade established themselves as a powerful nation in the Mediterranean. The Phoenicians founded the city of Carthage, in present day Tunis, just opposite the bottom of the Italian peninsula. Carthage was of course to become one of the Roman empire's greatest enemies.
<h3>OLD EUROPEAN CIVILIZATION</h3>
<p>The neolithic (farming) revolution slowly spread through Europe, first along the Grecian peninsula, Italy, up the Danube River and reaching Northern Europe about 7000 years ago.
<p>These civilizations are what is know as the "Old European civilization" and included such places as Crete (the palace at that island's capital city, Knossos, had by the way, the first running water toilets - this about 4500 years ago!)
<h3>MODERN NORDIC</h3>
<p>By this time the modern day Nordic racial type had fully developed, and it may come as news to some of you that original large Nordic concentrations were not in fact in Scandinavia, but in modern day Ukraine and South Eastern Russia (hence Whites are mistakenly called Caucasians - after the Causacas mountains - by those who don't know better).
<p>The town of Kiev, was for example one of the biggest Nordic cities, dating from about 7000 years ago, and had a population of 20,000 - huge by standards of the time.
<p>These Nordics slowly crept westward, invading and re-invading Western Europe for a period of nearly 6000 years, finally resulting in the establishment of a new Nordic heartland in Northern Europe.
<p>These people developed a linear script and their own language. Very little of this language remains, although there are those who argue that the Hungarian language - which is exclusive and bears no relation to any other European language except to a Baltic dialect - is the purest surviving example of this language.
<p>These original Nordic tribes had stone buildings and worked bronze and copper. How much of this metal working skill was passed South to the Middle Eastern civilizations remains a matter of debate.
<p>However, what is for sure is that successive waves of Nordic tribes started invading central and Southern Europe in earnest about 6 400 years ago, and caused the Mediterranean civilizations (the "Old European" civilizations) to topple. Nordic tribes occupied large regions of Turkey, Crete, Greece and Southern Europe and Italy.
<p>The invading Nordics did not kill the largely Mediterranean populations of these areas - obviously feeling some type of racial kinship, but instead just ruled over them.
<p>Some Nordic tribes migrated into the Far East - as far as China, where some Nordic remains have been found in burial chambers. The details we have about this is too sketchy to speculate on what effect this may have had on the undeniably advanced Chinese culture.
<p>These Nordic tribes also invaded Egypt, but were in turn occupied by a Semitic invasion - the Hyskos, who wee only expelled after 100 years of their rule.
<h3>GREECE</h3>
<p>It was some of these invading Nordic tribes, around the year 2100 BC  - some 4000 years ago - laid the basis for the great age of Greek culture. From this period we owe much in terms of philosophers, mathematicians and great soldiers. This flowering of Greek civilization lasted till just after the founding of the greatest empire the world has known, in Rome.
<p>In 1595AD - some 3500 years ago - the city of Babylon was captured by these Nordic invaders. Another invading tribe was called the Philistines by the Egyptians - and these people established what is believed to be a harsh rule over the increasing number of Semites in the Middle East. The Semites developed a fanatical hatred of the Philistines, which they developed into their religion. 
<p>This was developed to the point where today anyone who has been raised a Christian knows that to call someone a Philistine is to insult him, even though the person using that insult may not even know who the Philistines were.
<h3>INDO-ARYANS</h3>
<p>Around the year 1500 BC - say 3500 years ago - Nordic tribes, who were sun worshippers, and who used the sanskrit (or Sumerian) language and their symbols, invaded central Asia and occupied territory as far as the North of India. These invaders were what is known as the Indo-Europeans, or the original Aryans. In fact, all of those countries spanning their age of conquest bear names directly related to them - India, Iran, Iraq are all corruptions of the original word Aryan.
<p>One of the symbols the Aryans had was the sunwheel, representing the sun and well being, which later developed into the swastika. This symbol was taken up in to the Indo-Aryan's religion, and transported over into the Hindu religion, which sprang from a corruption of the Indo-Aryans' beliefs. To this day you will find swastikas in Hindu temples across the world.
<p>Up until this time then, the development of White race's territorial expansion was such that they were a majority in Europe and Western Russia. Nordics ruled as an elite over a largely Mediterranean population into the Middle East. In areas further East, that is Iran and Northern India, the population grew steadily darker and less White, till at the furthest outpost in India the Nordic invaders were a distinct minority.
<h3>TURNING POINT</h3>
<p>At this stage in history the first great turning point in White civilization came about. The White Egyptians started using Nubian - or Black - labour to provide the manpower needed to build their great pyramids, while in other Central Eastern countries the Semitic or Arabic populations began to increase as they too were increasingly used as labour by the ruling Whites.
<p>Herein lies the key to understanding the rise and fall of all civilizations - as long as a race maintains its territorial integrity and does not start to rely on others to provide its labour, that civilization will stand intact. Once it starts to allow large numbers of other races into its midst, to do the labour, then that civilization falls. 
<p>A civilization stands or falls by the homogeneity of its population, and nothing else.
<p>To digress for one minute to explain this another way : no-one will argue that the Chinese people have built a civilization in China. If however the Australian aborigines had to immigrate to China in their millions, then in a few years the character of Chinese civilization would changed to that of an aboriginal one. 
<p>Those who occupy the territory, not those who own the territory, determine the nature of that society. This is an immutable law which cannot be escaped.
<h3>INDIA</h3>
<p>In India, for example, the Indo- Aryans established a strict segregation system to keep themselves separate from the local native population. This system was so strict that it has lasted to this day as is today known as the caste system. However, even the strictest segregation (and punishments such as death for miscegenation) did not prevent the majority population from eventually swallowing up the ruling Nordics till today when only a few very high caste Brahmin Indians could still pass as Europeans.
<p>Now exactly the same thing happened in central Asia, Egypt, Sumeria, and to a lesser degree, Turkey. Slowly but surely, as these civilizations relied more and more on others to do their work for them, their population became darker and darker. Today Egypt is not populated by the people who built the pyramids - and the same applies to any other original site of White culture in that region.
<h3>GREECE</h3>
<p>The Nordic civilizations in Greece also fell prey to this trap, and the last great Grecian leader, Pericles, actually enacted a law in the year 451 BC limiting citizenship of the state by racial descent. However, some 400 years later this law was changed as the population shifts had become more and more evident. Today there are significant genetic differences between many inhabitants of Greece and the original inhabitants of that country, although this change is not as complete as in a place such as Egypt.
<p>Thus, only the Nordics who invaded Eastward into Europe, have left any significant genetic heritage today, mainly because the original inhabitants of this region were genetically compatible with the Nordic invaders.
<h3>ALEXANDER THE GREAT</h3>
<p>Possibly one of the best known rulers of the period leading up the Christian year 0 was Alexander the Great. His tribe of Nordic invaders had settled the land known as Macedonia - just to the north of present day Greece. Alexander set about invading the already struggling Greece and eventually most of the known world, including poor old Egypt once again. 
<p>Alexander was however an exponent of multi culturalism, and established his new capital at Babylon. He even forced his army's senior officers to take Asiatic wives!
<p>Upon Alexander's' early death at Babylon, virtually all of his senior officers who had been forced into these multi racial marriages renounced their Asiatic wives, and Alexander's empire was split up amongst his generals. 
<p>The most famous one of these generals was Ptolemy, who established the Ptolemic reign in Egypt. The best known Ptolemic Egyptian queen was Cleopatra, who was of course born in Macedonia and not in Egypt at all. This Ptolemic reign provided a new short lease of life to Egypt, but soon the by then overwhelmingly Arabic population took over once again.
<h3>ROME</h3>
<p>Then came the great civilization of Rome. Originally the inhabitants of the Italian peninsula were settled neolithic - or agricultural Mediterranean peoples, but starting about 1000 BC - 3000 years ago - Italy also fell victim to the invading bands of Nordics flooding across Eastern Europe. In the 9th century BC the last of these Nordic invasions took place - and the last tribe to invade carried the name the Latini - and it is from them that the word Latin came.
<p>Together with other invading Nordic tribes, the Latini amalgamated with the Mediterraneans in Italy and formed the core of the Roman people. 
<p>One of the most prominent of the Mediterranean peoples in Italy before the arrival of the Latini, were the Etruscans, and for a long while they in fact ruled over the Nordic tribes coming south. The Etruscans were the first established and civilized - in the sense of having an establishes system of reading, writing, technology and so on - in Italy.
<p>In 753 the city of Rome was established, and was immediately under the control of the Etruscan rulers. The Etruscan king was however expelled from Rome in the year 509 BC.
<p>By the 4th century BC - 2000 years ago - the Latini, or as the became known the Romans, after their great city, had become the dominant tribe in all Italy. They were predominantly Nordic in racial make-up, with a fair admixture of Mediterranean blood.
<p>The Romans quickly advanced beyond all of their neighbours because they were the first to systemize and organize the state into a modern bureaucracy. Laws, Army discipline, training, advanced weaponry and learning enabled them to start conquering all of the less civilized peoples around them, and they soon conquered virtually all of Western Europe, including the British Isles, where the neolithic age had been plodding on uninterruptedly for many years.
<p>The only time that the Romans were in fact stopped was by their distant Nordic cousins in central Germany. The Germanic king Herman inflicted a massive defeat upon the Roman forces at the battle of Detmold in the year 9AD, and the Romans then never advanced further eastward in Germany past the present day city of Cologne.
<p>The Roman Empire however also extended South and East - and included many peoples into its reign who were definitely not Roman stock material.
<p>The city of Carthage proved to be one of Rome's greatest foes, and it was only after several years' fierce war and an invasion of Italy by the Great Carthaginian leader, Hannibal, that Rome finally overcame the city. The way they dealt with Carthage was insightful of the Roman mindset of the time - they killed all males, enslaved the females, burned the city down and then ploughed it over, pouring salt in the furrows. Nothing ever even grew on that place again.
<p>Citizenship rights, which were at the beginning jealously guarded and in fact racially linked - only Roman citizens born in Rome of Roman parents could become citizens - were changed as the Empire expanded. With each new conquest and addition,  the definition of citizenship become broader and broader.
<p>Cato the Censor, a Roman leader who lived from 234 to 149 BC was one who saw the dangers of extending citizenship rights to non Romans, and he tried to introduce a number of measures to boost the Roman birthrate and to exclude foreigners.  Augustus Caesar followed this up by issuing a decree that every Roman male between the age of 25 and 60 must be married - an hopefully produce offspring. In 9AD the Roman government announced tax concessions for Roman citizens having large families.
<p>All these efforts were ultimately in vain, and by the year AD 70, all manner of foreigners had been given Roman citizenship. In this way the Romanised Jew Josephus, who wrote an excellent account of the Roman war with the Jews in Palestine, was actually employed by the Romans to write that history.
<h3>PALESTINE</h3>
<p>The issue of Palestine and the Jews must be addressed quickly as a religion which came from this region - Christianity - has played such a pivotal role in modern Western Civilization.
<p>What happened in Palestine was that a Semitic tribe called the Hebrews had set up a particularly ethnocentric religion - a God for a specific people, which was a new concept amongst religions, as all other Gods could be for all people, but the Hebrew God was only for the Hebrew tribe.
<p>A small band of Hebrew heretics however objected to this ethnocentric religion, and founded a break away sect, called the Essenes. The Essenes preached that their God was in fact a god for all people, and they objected to the more chauvinist Hebrew god. The Essenes were persecuted by the majority of Hebrew tribe elders, and they were forced to hide many of their works and writings - and this is where the now famous Dead Sea Scrolls come form.
<p>The Essenes claimed that one of their leaders who had been persecuted had been able to perform miracles and had risen from the dead. Although these Essene claims have never been substantiated, it certainly appears to have been the basis or role model for the Jesus Christ of the Christian New Testament.
<h3>MISSIONARIES</h3>
<p>This Essene religion was reworked and revamped extensively after the Roman Jewish War of AD 70, and some Jewish converts to it set themselves up as missionaries and started trying to convert the rest of the world - after failing fairly spectacularly to convert any large numbers of Hebrews themselves.
<p>The most well known of these early missionaries was Paul of Tarsus, whose real name was of course Saul of Tarsus.
<p>Incidentally, the first Roman reference to Jesus Christ was made in Josephus' book The Jewish wars, which appeared in AD 70. In this book passing reference is made to a sect amongst Jews which claimed that the messiah, Jesus Christ, had been to them. It is interesting that the Biblical figure of Jesus Christ does not appear in any prior Roman records, especially when he is supposed to have played such a major role in the time period around the year 0.
<p>Despite their best efforts, the new cult's missionaries - who started calling themselves Christians as the story about Jesus was built up over several years - did in fact not have things all their own way. The Christian religion did battle with a number of other religions in the Middle East and in the Roman Empire - and the Christians were of course persecuted furiously by more than one Roman emperor who tried to stamp out what they saw as a subversive religion.
<h3>EDICT OF MILAN</h3>
<p>Christianity was in fact just another cult until the year 313, when the Emperor Constantine issued the Edict of Milan guaranteeing equal status to all religions, including Christianity, in the Roman Empire.
<p>The reason why he did this remains a matter of debate. There is a evidence to show that his mother was an early Christian convert, and influenced him, but the popular story is that as he was about to do battle with a rival Roman general for the throne, he saw a flaming Cross in the sky with the words In Hoc Signo Vinces - In this sign you will win. He allegedly took this as a sign from the Christian God that he would win if he converted to Christianity. Constantine did win, and did officially convert to Christianity.
<p>With the conversion of the Emperor of the Rome to Christianity, the veritable flood gates opened and almost overnight Christianity became the most popular religion in the Roman Empire.
<p>In the year 325 Constantine called together what is known as the Council of Nicosea, where elders of the foundling church actually physically put the Bible together, discarding chapters and books of loose manuscripts that Christian preachers had been using for years - when they did not fit in with the whole story.
<p>Constantine also founded a new city, which he wanted to be a Christian city unsullied by the paganism of Rome. Modestly, he called the city Constantinople, nowadays called Istanbul.
<h3>EMPIRE SPLIT</h3>
<p>The new Eastern capital soon became more important than Rome itself, to the point that 50 years after Constantine's death, the empire was formally divided into two - the Eastern and the Western empires, each with their own capitals.
<h3>ATTILLA THE HUN</h3>
<p>The Western Roman Empire had long since been battling to contain the Nordic Germanic tribes battering against its northern borders. The German tribes had until then been relatively stable but in 451 AD they were propelled into action by a Mongolian invasion from the Far East under the great Mongoloid leader, Attilla the Hun. The Huns, being ferocious warriors and excellent horsemen, demolished the Nordic tribes situated to the East, by name the Ostrogoths. 
<p>The other German, or Gothic tribes actually petitioned the Romans for help against the Huns. Attilla however had everything his own way for as long as he lived, and the Mongoloid Huns' threat to Europe was only finally defeated after he died in 453 AD.
<h3>ROME SACKED</h3>
<p>The largest remaining Gothic tribe, the Visigoths, then launched a renewed assault on the  Western Roman Empire, under a dynamic leader name Alaric.  This tribe sacked Rome in the year 410 AD, and although there remained thereafter a semblance of emperors after this, in reality the Western Empire had disappeared. Historians mark the official end of the Western Empire in the year 476, when a German general, Adovacarr, who had been employed as mercenary by the Roman government, simply declared himself ruler of Rome without bothering to seek anybody's approval.
<h3>ISLAM</h3>
<p>The Eastern Empire did not far much better - surrounded by for the most part by racially alien elements, the furthest extent of the Christian outpost which Constantine had hoped for was quickly reduced to the immediate territory surrounding the city of Constantinople itself. The lands of virtually the entire Middle East had also by this time undergone huge racial changes, so that the vast majority of inhabitants were no longer racially classifiable as White. 
<h3>HOLY ROMAN EMPIRE</h3>
<p>In the West, meanwhile, the Gothic invaders quickly realized that they were in many respects culturally inferior to the Romans, and quickly took on the Roman ways of learning and government.
<p>The Gothic tribes began to settle themselves in distinct areas - with the Franks setting in present day France, the Saxons and Angles settling in the British Isles after the withdrawal of the last Roman legions there around 300AD, and so on.
<p>Each king of the various Gothic tribes all aspired to be like the Romans before them, and collectively they laid the basis for the origin of the Holy Roman Empire - an attempt to emulate the Roman days of Glory but this time with Christianity as well.
<h3>CHARLEMAGNE</h3>
<p>A series of Christian kings in Europe cemented the victory of Christianity, the most famous of which was Charlemagne, who succeeded to the Frankish throne in 758 AD. He ruled over what is today Western Germany and France, and he was a furious Christian missionary who did not hesitate to kill non believers. In one well known and documented incident, Charlemagne had 5000 Odinist Saxons beheaded in front of the Roman based head of the Christian Church, the pope, and then went about mass as usual, according to his biographer, the monk Einhard.
<h3>PAGAN RITUALS</h3>
<p>Through sheer terror rather than logical persuasion, Christianity then became the dominant religion of the previously pagan Europe -although they never quite succeeded in rooting out some pagan customs. 
<p>Easter, for example, comes from the old pagan god of fertility, Eoster (or Ostara), who used as her symbols the egg and the rabbit - potent signs of fertility. Most Christians today of course have no idea where their Easter bunny comes from, or why we still today have Easter Eggs. What happened was that the Eoster feast marked the start of Spring in Europe, and as this celebration as to deeply ingrained in these Gothic tribes, the Christianising Church elders simply took this feast and in arbitrary fashion made it into the date of Jesus Christ's cruxifiction.
<p>The same happened with the Winter solstice- originally a pagan celebration to mark the turning point of winter - the longest night of winter - with a fire and a pine tree. Solstice was then combined with the date of Jesus Christ's birth, again in an arbitrary fashion.
<p>However, the church was for a long time uneasy with the pagan undertones of the celebration - after all, pine trees, which are native to Scandinavia, and the exchange of gifts are nowhere to be found in the Bible - and this led to the church officially banning the celebration of Christmas no less than three times - all of course unsuccessfully.<p>In any event, by hook or by crook, Western Europe was, for the most part, won over to Christianity.
<h3>MUSLIM INVASION</h3>
<p>The Frankish king Charlemagne did not only spend his converting pagans at sword point - he also undertook several successful attacks against Islam - all in the name of Christianity. Islam propagated conversion by the sword, and this inspired (and still inspires) many Muslims to regard it as their duty to wage a holy war for their God, who strangely enough, if one reads the Koran properly, is the same God as of the Old and New Testament of the Christians.
<p>This zeal caused Islamic armies to invade both North Africa, Spain, the Balkans and Greece at various stages in history, occupying these territories for nearly 400 years at a time. They were eventually driven off by combined Christian - read White - armies, but 400 years of Muslim occupation left a clear genetic mark on the population. The Muslim/White racial mixes in these regions is today quite incorrectly labelled by those who do not know better as the Mediterranean people. They are in reality Arabic - Mediterranean crosses.
<p>Just as a matter of interest, the Muslims in Bosnia that we hear so much about these days also dates from the Islamic invasion of the Balkan peninsula.
<h3>CRUSADES</h3>
<p>Although the Islamic invasion into Europe was beaten off, the Christian invasion of Palestine to try and dislodge the Muslims there - called the Crusades, and which lasted nearly 150 years, were a failure. Constantinople, the last Eastern Christian outpost, had by the time of the Crusades, been reduced to city state status, and eventually fell to Islam in 1453.
<p>A renewed Islamic offensive into Eastern Europe was only turned back in 1532 when a Turkish Muslim army was defeated outside Vienna in that year. This battle marked the last Islamic invasion of Europe until the second half of the 20th century - our era, when a renewed non violent wave of Muslim immigration into Europe started.
<h3>DARK AGES</h3>
<p>The introduction of Christianity into Europe had one important side affect at this time - the doctrinal teachings actually forbid much intellectual development. Ironically it was up to some Arabic Muslims, who had seized ancient pagan Greek and Roman works during their forays into Europe, who kept alive much of these writings and teachings. The Roman Catholic Church - as the first original Christian church was called - very often simply outlawed any pagan works, suppressing them and persecuting anybody who tried to study them. 
<p>In this way for example, the astronomer Nicolas Copernicus, who, based on his reading of ancient Greek astronomical texts and his own observations, claimed in public that the sun was the centre of the universe, and not the earth, as was claimed by the Church. 
<p>The Church had him place under house arrest for this - but he was lucky. Many other scientists were branded as devils or witches and actually killed for making simple scientific observations. 
<p>The Church for example tried very hard to suppress evidence that the earth was round - although the Ptolemic Egyptians had known this centuries earlier, and they had in fact calculated the circumference of the earth. The Church quoted the scriptures as specifically referring to the four corners of the earth, and, as only a square can have corners, it was un Biblical to say that the earth was round.
<p>This suppression of learning brought about what is today known as the Dark Ages in Europe - the emergence of the Church as the most powerful factor in life in Europe. This was the age of the theocratic state, where the church held absolute sway, even over kings. 
<p>Learning was brought to a halt. Feudalism reigned supreme, society was divided into peasants, nobles and the clergy, and social divisions were created which have scarred Europe to this day.
<h3>RENAISSANCE AND REFORMATION</h3>
<p>This absolute control by the Roman Catholic Church was broken by two events: the Reformation and the Renaissance. The Reformation started out as a theological revolt against certain teachings, but soon developed into a full blown political revolt against rule from Rome.  A large number of Christians broke with the Catholic Church, protesting certain teachings - and became known as "protestants." 
<p>The Anglican Church was of course founded by the English King Henry 8 after the Pope refused to allow him to divorce one of his unfortunate wives - surely a good enough reason to start a new church if ever there was one! Still today the Anglican church is counted as one of the Protestant churches.
<p>The Luther led Reformation started in Germany and quickly spread to most Northern European countries - and thereupon followed a series of religious wars between Catholics and Protestants which, it has been estimated, killed nearly one third of Europe's population. Lingering elements of this conflict lie at the root of the conflict in Northern Ireland to this day.
<p>In some countries the Catholics regained control - in others they lost. Germany still to this day has an interesting division - the south is Catholic and the north Protestant. This was the basis of a war known was the Thirty years which virtually destroyed Germany as these two Christian groups battled each other for supremacy, each claiming to have the true version of the ultimate truth.
<p>The Renaissance - which is French for rebirth or renewal - allowed the open rereading for the first time in centuries of ancient pagan works, scientific development and technological advances. It was as if a curse had been lifted - suddenly it was no longer dangerous to be a scientist, or to explore the unknown. It was truly a rebirth of civilization, emerging from the Church imposed Dark Ages.  
<p>It is no coincidence that the end of the age of the theocratic state also marked the start of a new surge in Western civilization.
<p>Suddenly Europe was on the advance - scientific breakthroughs, great works of art, the discovery of new worlds - there seemed to be no end to it. Explorers set out to discover sea routes around Africa, to the Americas, to India. 
<p>White settlements were established in the most far flung corners of the globe - from Australia to South Africa, from America to Canada.
<h3>NEW WORLDS, OLD FACTS</h3>
<p>In each of these places, great feats and exceptional heroism was displayed by the European settlers in taming these wild lands. In America and South Africa, Great Treks of equal ardour and bravery were undertaken, and in all the colonies little replicas of Europe were established. 
<p>However, once again the faults that the ancient civilizations had made, were made in the new colonies. Instead of flooding the new areas with their own kind to do the labour, the colonists found that it was apparently easier to get the local races to do the labour. In this way in Africa majority White occupation was never achieved, and only achieved in Australia with the virtual physical extermination of the Aborigine population.
<p>The American Indians were however either too proud or to weak to provide the wanted labour - and no sooner had the Whites established their society than they imported hundreds of thousands of Black slaves from Africa. After engaging in a civil war over whether these slaves should be freed or not, the American state declared these African slaves free and equal citizens -  and today virtually all major American cities are Black ghettos. A modern day visitor to America who only tours the big cities might well believe that America is a majority Black country.
<p>In South Africa, Black labour was used from the very beginning, and this economic entanglement contradicted Afrikaner attempts to enforce social segregation from the top down. The reliance on Black labour made it inevitable that the Whites in South Africa would lose power - it had happened in every other civilization which engaged in this practice.
<h3>EUROPEAN NATIONALISMS</h3>
<p>Modern European history has also been marked by competing nationalism - which has led to a number of murderous internecine wars. Pointless conflicts such as the Napoleonic wars, the religious wars, the First and Second World Wars -  these bloody and ultimately unnecessary wars lasted right up to the second half of the 20th century.
<p>By the end of the 19th century, the world had been effectively colonized by the White Race. On every virtually every continent the White master held sway - the British Empire stretched right round the globe, leading to the saying that the sun never set on the empire.
<p>America was booming - Southern Africa, Australia, New Zealand were all firmly established as White ruled nations. It seemed as if nothing could go wrong.
<h3>ADVANCE</h3>
<p>Huge technological advances - inconceivable a hundred years ago - are now old hat. Going to the moon - it was done 25 years ago already! Computers? A modern 1995 BMW motor vehicle has more computing power on board than what the Apollo 11 rocket had in 1969! There seems to be no end to the wonders that the technological wizards of Europe and America can produce - with of course faithful duplication and mass production by the Chinese and Japanese!
<p>However, now as we approach the end of the 20th century, we see the all too familiar signs - the same signs which preceded the fall of the ancient White civilizations  - the reliance on alien labour and the mass immigration of racial foreigners into White heartlands. 
<p>The demographics of Europe and America are changing every year - getting darker.  
<p>In Germany the Turkish invasion of the 20 Century proceeds without check. Kreuzberg in Berlin, is now the second biggest Turkish city in the world outside of Istanbul! Brixton in London is almost as Black as Soweto. Black Swedish pop starts are at the top of the pop music charts in Europe. European territorial integrity has been broken.
<h3>PARALLELS</h3>
<p>It does not take a genius or a fortune teller to see the parallels. As the demographic face of the two White modern heartlands-  Europe and America - change, so does the nature of those civilizations. Population trends say that in 100 years America will have an absolute non White majority. Europe is not far behind this projection.
<p>This time however, unlike ancient Egypt, India or other civilizations, there are no new White barbarians ready to take up the reins of Western civilization. There are no new territories to be developed and opened up.
<p>If things proceed unchecked, it is not far fetched to say that the 21st century will see the final disappearance of the White Race from this globe. 40,000 years of this great epoch could be wiped out.
<p>Who will change it? Who will rescue the West? I do not know. All I can do is help to sound the clarion call, and hope that the call will not go unanswered.

<H1>White Nationalism FAQ</H1>

<H4>by Yggdrasil</H4>

<P><IMG SRC="images/celt.gif" HEIGHT=180 WIDTH=180 ALIGN=RIGHT></P>

<P><B>Q.</B> What is White Nationalism?</P>

<P><B>A.</B> The idea that Whites may need to create a separate nation
as a means of defending themselves.</P>

<P><B>Q.</B> Do White Nationalists feel they are superior to other races?</P>

<P><B>A.</B> No. The desire of White Nationalists to form their own nation
has nothing to do with superiority or inferiority.</P>

<P><B>Q.</B> Do White Nationalists seek to dominate other races?</P>

<P><B>A.</B> Not at all. In fact, formation of a White nation removes any
possibility of White dominance of other races, as well as the plausibility
of the accusation that Whites wish to dominate others.</P>

<P><B>Q.</B> Do White Nationalists seek to insulate themselves from competition
from other races?</P>

<P><B>A.</B> No. A separate White nation would establish a policy of free
trade with its new neighbors. Labor markets are global, and the formation
of a White nation would not protect Whites from economic competition.</P>

<P><B>Q.</B> Well if White Nationalists don't feel superior, don't want
to dominate others, and don't seek protection from competition, then why
would they want a separate nation?</P>

<P><B>A.</B> To avoid exploitation.</P>

<P><B>Q.</B> Exploitation? This is rich! So how is it that Whites are exploited?</P>

<P><B>A.</B> It is a long list. Burdensome racial preference schemes in
hiring, racial preference schemes in university admissions, racial preference
schemes in government contracting and small business loans. Beyond quotas
there is the denial of rights of free speech and of due process to Whites
who are critical of these governmental policies. We have special punishments
for assaults committed by Whites if the motives might be racial. In addition,
Whites pay a proportion of the costs of the welfare state that is disproportionate
to what they receive in benefits.</P>

<P>But the most exploitative aspect of the situation is that neither the
racial quotas, the business preferences, the loss of freedom of speech,
nor the disproportionate contributions to the welfare state have managed
to sate the appetites of non-Whites living in the United States.</P>

<P>The more Whites sacrifice, the more non-Whites demand. Many Whites are
beginning to believe that no amount of tribute, other than mass suicide,
would satisfy the non-White demands.</P>

<P>If our presence stirs up that much hatred in the hearts of non-Whites,
then the only sensible course of action is to separate ourselves from them.</P>

<P>Q. You claim that non-Whites are the aggressors and haters in race relations.
Aren't you afraid that most Whites will think this is ridiculous?</P>

<P><B>A.</B> Not in the slightest. For the past 30 years most Whites have
taken part in a mass migration or &quot;White flight&quot; away from neighborhoods
inhabited by non-Whites. Aggressors don't flee. For example, on a per-capita
basis, Blacks are 49 times more likely to assault a White than a White
is to assault a Black. Assaults by Whites against Blacks are approximately
40 times scarcer than they would be if races were randomly mixed and assault
rates did not vary by race. The best measure of racism is the number of
non-economically motivated attacks. White score low in this regard, non-Whites
high.</P>

<P>The fact is that non-Whites are clamoring to enter this country in droves.
Whites are fleeing en masse to formerly uninhabited areas to escape these
new arrivals.</P>

<P><B>Q.</B> But how can Whites be exploited when it is Whites who have
enacted these racial preferences, the taxation, the welfare payments and
set immigration quotas?</P>

<P><B>A.</B> Excellent question! It is true that Whites are exploited by
their fellow Whites. In fact, we do not expect any resistance by non-Whites
to the formation of a separate nation. We expect White integrationist elites
to resist. They are the ones who have a great deal to lose.</P>

<P><B>Q.</B> If life in America is so bad for Whites why don't you just
move back to Europe?</P>

<P><B>A.</B> We are a majority. We do not have to move back. We can resolve
to defend ourselves against this onslaught. We have the option of peacefully
ceding lands already inhabited by non-Whites to separate non-White nations.
We would save money, and could restore our civil liberties and free ourselves
from constant threats of violence by so doing.</P>

<P><B>Q.</B> What would your separate state look like?</P>

<P><B>A.</B> The truth is we don't know yet. Our separate state would follow
the geographic outlines of White flight. The model for this state would
be the modern gerrymander created by the Voting Rights Act to create majority
non-White congressional districts. We would simply cede these to a separate
nation. The mechanics of this process will be explained more fully later
in a post entitled &quot;sweating the details.&quot;</P>

<P><B>Q.</B> Would all Whites be welcome in your separate state?</P>

<P><B>A.</B> Absolutely. There would be no restriction by country of origin,
and no genetic tests, skin color or hair color tests or any nonsense like
that. The only restriction would be that those who would wish to recreate
the present system by importing non-Whites and then encouraging their hostility
would not be welcome. They would have to remain in or move to the lands
ceded to the non-Whites.</P>

<P><B>Q.</B> Would Asians be welcome in your separate state?</P>

<P><B>A.</B> Absolutely. As a general rule, Asians show very little aggression
towards Whites, either personally or politically. Thus, there is no reason
to exclude them. There is no desire on the part of White Nationalists to
insulate themselves from competition from non-Whites who are already here,
and who get along well with us.</P>

<P><B>Q.</B> Would the same hold true for Hispanics.</P>

<P><B>A.</B> The census bureau classifies half of all Hispanics as White.
White Nationalists generally feel the same way. That portion of the Hispanic
population that blends in and displays no hostility of a personal or political
kind may remain. That group of Hispanics who want to see the Southwestern
U.S. annexed to Mexico would not be welcome.</P>

<P><B>Q.</B> You are proposing that inclusion and exclusion be based on
ideology and feelings. Won't your act of nation splitting turn into a witch
hunt?</P>

<P><B>A.</B> For White liberals it is definitely going to feel like a witch
hunt! When the time comes, those who are guilty of &quot;integrationism&quot;
should do the sensible thing and flee. It will spare us all a lot of pain.</P>

<P><B>Q.</B> Is this White nation something that you intend to pursue right
away?</P>

<P><B>A.</B> No. The White nation is, by most accounts, about 20 years
off. When the rest of the U.S. begins to look like Southern California
it will happen more or less automatically, without much of a push from
us.</P>

<P><B>Q.</B> Why do you use the term &quot;European-American?&quot;</P>

<P><B>A.</B> All Whites are descended from European immigrants, and we
are not actually &quot;White.&quot; The term European-American has political
significance for two reasons. First, it recognizes that most people in
the U.S. of European extraction have intermarried to such an extent that
it is no longer possible to identify American Whites as &quot;Irish&quot;
or &quot;German&quot; or &quot;Italian.&quot; But more important, use of
the term &quot;European-American&quot; is intended to recognize that White
elites in the United States have exploited differences based on religion
and European national origin to divide European-Americans, with the intention
of rendering us unable to defend ourselves against non-White demands.</P>

<P><B>Q.</B> What is White separatism?</P>

<P>A White separatists will agree on most points with a White Nationalist,
except that he may not see a need to establish a separate nation within
the present territorial boundaries of the U.S.</P>

<P><B>Q.</B> What is a White supremacist?</P>

<P><B>A.</B> That is a White who wishes to subjugate other races by force,
ordinarily by military conquest. White supremacists are very rare in 1995,
and there is no visible trend or base of support which would allow them
to carry such a political program into effect.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Aryan Nations</B> is not a new right-wing organization
suddenly appearing on the scene. Aryan Nations is the on-going work of
Jesus the Christ regathering His people, calling His people to a state
for their nation to bring in His Kingdom! We hail His Victory!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1><B>WE BELIEVE</B> in the preservation of our Race, individually
and collectively, as a people as demanded and directed by Yahweh. We believe
our Racial Nation has a right and is under obligation to preserve itself
and its members.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1><B>WE BELIEVE</B> that Adam, man of Genesis, is the placing
of the White Race upon this earth. Not all races descend from Adam. Adam
is the father of the White Race only. (Adam in the original Hebrew is translated:
&quot;to show blood in the face; turn rosy.&quot;) Genesis 5:1</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1><B>WE BELIEVE</B> that the true, literal children of the
Bible are the twelve tribes of Israel, now scattered throughout the world
and now known as the Anglo-Saxon, Germanic, Teutonic, Scandinavian, Celtic
peoples of the earth. We know that the Bible is written to the family of
Abraham, descending from Shem back to Adam. Yahweh blessed Abraham and
promised that he would be the &quot;father of nations.&quot; This same
promise continued through the seedline of Abraham's son Isaac, and again
to Isaac's son Jacob, the patriarch of the twelve tribes, whose name Yahweh
changed to Israel (Meaning: &quot;he will rule as God&quot;). Genesis 32:28;
Exodus 12:31; 16:4; 19:20; Revelations 21:12</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1><B>WE BELIEVE</B> that there are literal children of Satan
in the world today. These children are the descendants of Cain, who was
a result of Eve's original sin, her physical seduction by Satan. We know
that because of this sin there is a battle and a natural enmity between
the children of Satan and the children of The Most High God (Yahweh). Genesis
3:15; 1 John 3:12</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1><B>WE BELIEVE</B> that the Cananite Jew is the natural
enemy of our Aryan (White) Race. This is attested by scripture and all
secular history. The Jew is like a destroying virus that attacks our racial
body to destroy our Aryan culture and the purity of our Race. Those of
our Race who resist these attacks are called &quot;chosen and faithful.&quot;
John 8:44; 1 Thessalonians 2:15; Revelations 17:14</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1><B>WE BELIEVE</B> that there is a battle being fought
this day between the children of darkness (today known as Jews) and the
children of light (Yahweh, The Everliving God), the Aryan Race, the true
Israel of the bible. Revelations 12:10-11</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1><B>WE BELIEVE</B> in the gam-ma'di'on (ga'ma'di-on), n.;
pl. -DIA (-a). [MGr., dim. of gamma.] A cross formed of four capital gammas
(I'), esp. in the figure of a swastika. Gamma among early Christians symbolized
Christ as a cornerstone of the church. WEBSTERS DICTIONARY.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1><B>WE BELIEVE</B> that the present world problems are
a result of our disobedience to Divine Law.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1><B>WE BELIEVE</B> that there is a day of reckoning. The
usurper will be thrown out by the terrible might of Yahweh's people, as
they return to their roots and their special destiny. We know there is
soon to be a day of judgment and a day when Christ's Kingdom (government)
will be established on earth, as it is in heaven. &quot;And in the days
of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never
be destroyed; and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it
shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms and it shall stand
forever. The saints of the Most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom,
and all dominions shall serve and obey Him.&quot; Daniel 2:44; 7:18; 7:27</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1><B>WHITE RACISM:</B> Where does it come from?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>What is the actual driving force behind the &quot;racist&quot;
White Christian Nationalist's fight for the preservation of the Aryan Race?
The news media would scream an immense and piercing shriek of &quot;HATE&quot;
if they could catch the slightest whisper of such a question coming from
ruddy Aryan lips. But those long standing warriors in this Struggle know
that the answer has a much greater depth and meaning than the anti-Christ
Jews, mongrel hordes and liberal White race-mixers could even begin to
fathom. . . that of LOVE.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The depths of Love are rooted and very deep in a real
White Nationalist's soul and spirit, no form of &quot;hate&quot; could
even begin to compare. At least not a hate motivated by ungrounded reasoning.
It is not hate that makes the average White man look upon a mixed racial
couple with a scowl on his face and loathing in his hear. It is not hate
that makes the White housewife throw down the daily jewspaper in repulsion
and anger after reading of yet another child-molester or rapist sentenced
by corrupt courts to a couple short years in prison or on parole. It is
not hate that makes the White workingman curse over his beer about the
latest boatload of mud-creatures dumped upon our shores to be given job
preference over the White citizens who build this land. It is not hate
that brings rage into the heart of a White Christian farmer when he reads
of billions loaned or given away as &quot;aid&quot; to foreigners when
he can't get the smallest break from an unmerciful government to save his
failing farm. No, it is not hate, IT'S LOVE.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1><B>FOUNDATIONS</B> <B>BIOGRAPHY OF ARYAN NATIONS</B> Richard
G. Butler</FONT></P>

<P><IMG SRC="animages/an4.gif"  ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE=+1>Who are we, and
who is Richard G. Butler? We are the continuing direct-line Church of Jesus
Christ Christian as originally founded by Dr. Wesley Swift of Lancaster,
California. After Dr. Swift's death, the church has been carried on by
Richard G. Butler.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Mr. Butler received his formal education and training
in southern California, including Aeronautical Engineering at Los Angeles
City College. His early experience in the aircraft industry included management
of maintenance assembly and repair of major assemblies for commercial and
military aircraft in the United States, Africa and India.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In 1946, and the following 18 years, he organized and
operated a machine plant for the production and precision machining of
automotive parts and engine assemblies and aircraft parts. Subsequently
from 1964 through 1973, Mr. Butler was a marketing analyst for new inventions.
In 1968 he became a Senior Manufacturing Engineer for Lockheed Aircraft
Co. at their Palmdale, California, plant, where extensive development was
under way for the L-1011 aircraft. He resigned from this corporate associateship
to devote full energy and time to his greatest and all-consuming desire
to serve God and Nation.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Pastor Butler is a co-inventor for rapid repair of tubeless
tires and holds both U.S. and Canadian patents thereon. He is a pilot and
during World War II was among other duties, a Flight Engineer Instructor
in the U.S. Air Force. His background reflects a broad experience in the
United States and foreign countries concerning alien races, their work
habits, status of &quot;culture&quot; and &quot;religions.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Returning home from wartime activities in 1946, Mr. Butler
was deeply troubled concerning the future of his nation from what he had
observed first hand overseas and events resulting from governmental edicts
that seemed to be always contrary to the best interest of the nation, and
of the White Race, in particular. While active in business life, the closest
thing to his heart was the future of his nation; therefore, most all available
spare time was spent studying and delving into various service and political
organizations, trying to arouse attention of friends, acquaintances, members
of fraternal organizations, and business associates into action concerning
the threat of Jewish communism.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The media publicity received from these efforts, while
nearly disastrous to business and professional life, turned out to be the
greatest of all blessings, in that he was let to Kingdom Identity with
the meeting and forming of the closest, most rewarding of all personal
relationships with Dr. Wesley A. Swift, starting in 1961 and continuing
until Dr. Swift's passing in 1971.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The years of study were spent under Dr. Swift in his magnificent
library with line upon line, precept upon precept, and revelations over
the years from Dr. Swift and Rev. Bertrand Comparet. They shared the blows
of the enemy from their combined efforts in the Christian Defense League,
of which Pastor Butler was the National Director from 1962 to 1965.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Upon the passing of Dr. Swift, Mr. Butler continued holding
services for the congregation of the Church of Jesus Christ Christian,
until he moved to northern Idaho to expand the Kingdom Identity program
and to form the foundation for a &quot;Call to the Nation&quot; or Aryan
Nations.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>We seek to let every Aryan son and daughter of Yahweh
know what their duty is to the Covenent (Constitution) that Yahweh their
God has made with them as Nations of His people and His blessings come
to, or are withheld from, a Nation--so is it that each citizen of the Nation
is either blessed or cursed. The rewards are in direct proportion to the
ACTION and WILL of the Nation, for our people have the &quot;Law written
on their hearts.&quot; We seek to live and establish a government under
the Law of God, for Your Race is your Nation.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>FIDELITY</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>That for which we fight is to safeguard the existence
and reproduction of our Race, by and of our Nations, the sustenance of
our children and the purity of our blood, the freedom and independence
of the people of our Race, so that we, kindred people, may mature for fulfillment
of the mission allotted to us by the Creator of the universe, our Father
and God. Hail His Victory!</FONT></P>

<h3><i>The Zundelsite is up and running!</i></h3>

<p><tt>Sun Aug 27 20:43 EDT 1995</tt>

<p>This is to thank Stormfront for putting up the URL for Zundelsite. For convenience's sake, I am listing it again.  It is <a TARGET="_top" href="http://www.webcom.com/~ezundel/english/">http://www.webcom.com/~ezundel/english/</a>.  We are asking other individuals or groups involved in this movement to help us advertise it and use it to the fullest, because, as we all know, ZOG will try to shut it down.  By the way, we should use the term ZOG as much as possible, because it is an identifier and helps condense and summarize what this is all about.

<p>Keep up the good work, Don.

<h3><i>White Culture?</i></h3>

<p><tt>Sat Aug 26 15:54 EDT 1995</tt>

<p>I support your right to say what you like, but I question the logic
in some of your motives.  You say you celebrate white culture, and most
essayists here seem to be of the opinion that this white culture could
be destroyed by interracial breeding.  However: What do you consider
to be white culture?

<p>Whites in both the US and canada consist of those of British,
German, Irish, French, and other descents.  Those places have cultures
that should be celebrated.  Culture is not race based.

<p>The only culture that I could see as being in any sort of jeapordy
is that of the Germans.  (To some degree.)  It has gotten to the point
in Germany where waving a flag could get you labeled as a Nazi.  But in
the Americas, I don't see any such problem.

<h3><i>Stand up and be counted</i></h3>

<p><tt>Sat Aug 26 11:03 EDT 1995</tt>

<p>I'm writing this letter wondering where and when a person could attend 
a meeting with other people of this interest. Other groups in this country
have conventions, why not us? The problem with most people is that they 
don't want anyone really to know about how they feel or think. Damnit man
we still have freedom of speech and the right to assembly the last time I looked.
Come on join in, don't be ashamed the blacks have got NAACP and proud of it.
Let's hear more a organization. Post here.

<h3><i>Identity Archaeology & Raymond Capt</i></h3>

<p><tt>Fri Aug 25 18:55 EDT 1995</tt>

<p>The Behistun Rock inscriptuion, and other stuff that is usually
cited to support Identity, is discussed by E. Raymond Capt in
MISSING LINKS or some such title, incl. refs. in title to
Assyrian records. I don't have it in front of me.

<p>Anyway, two points:

<p>(1) Capt never establishes that Khumri (for real Israel no 
question by authorities or anyone) and Kymry (Cimmerians) are 
the same, merely that they are simnilar enough sounding they
COULD be the same. A lot of peoples were dumped into the zone
between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea and many were already 
there. Function: dumppes were to be buffers against those 
already there, for the Assyrians. There are radical changes
in language, order of words, physical culture, etc. to be made
in a scant 200 years if Identity is true. 

<p>To assimilate into the background peoples there, and to be 
their origin, are not the same things.

<p>(2) In Ezra and Nehemiah, lists of Judahite returnees are 
given, which are short by 11,000+ of the total figure of 
returnees given, which was specified as not including servants,
so that doesn't explain it. Also sacrifices were made for "all
Israel," a term used several times. NT mentions Anna of the
tribe of Asher present in Jerusalem at the time of Jesus'
birth. It is thought that the Israelite tribes' members who
were still interested in God were the extra ones.

<p>As for blood, remember John the Baptist condemned those who
counted on their physical descent to make them count, saying
that if God chose He could raise up sons of Abraham from the
stones.

<h3><i>Aryan Singles page</i></h3>

<p><tt>Fri Aug 25 02:50 EDT 1995</tt>

<p>Excellent idea by the previous writer. An Aryan singles column. I tried to write a letter on that subject and submit it a month ago but I guess it didn't get through. This web site is great. Makes us feel so not alone. I could possibly get the page started with the assistance of Mr. Black. Please E-mail me Don and tell me how we do this. Were are all the girls and women of Euro decent? If your a female and you have some friends who would be interested in participating in this page please E-mail and I'll set up some guidelines(with Don's permission of course) And to all you Aryan men, show these Women why white men are the best, be honest and noble.

<p>I just returned to university from my summer vacation, only to find that, in order to get into the Net, I had to enter my name and the last four digits of my social security number. This applies to everyone who wants to use the computers. I asked the lab assistant, and she said that it's basically been done to monitor who uses what and who does what. 

<p>Not that I care if the university knows about my extra-curricular activities (I'm sure they do anyhow), but the very idea that they could monitor my activities on a day-to-day basis is intolerable. Of course, this type of tactic only makes me stronger. Now I understand how my brothers and sisters in more oppressive countries feel (as if there is any country more oppressive than the Jew.S.A). 

<p>My final thought: Don't let ZOG get you down. Stay strong and keep up the fight, for tomorrow does belong to us!

<h3><i>ORIGIN OF CIVILIZATION: WHAT IS RACE?</i></h3>

<p><tt>Tue Aug 22 20:31 EDT 1995</tt>

<p>As a civilized society, we havent examined this question as objectively
as we should. Honest research and study in this field is needed without
the usual prejudice of some at the expense of others. "The Bell Curve"
comes to mind when I say this.

<p>Researchers, specialists, anthropologists, ethnologist, and every
other 'ologist claims that the oldest man/woman, human remains to
be found to substantiate (any) knowledge of the human race has been found
on the continent of AFRICA. That means, ADAM & EVE were of the African
race or whatever name they called themselves at that time, never-
the-less, they were of the Black family/race.

<p>This means that the remaining "human race" of men and women from Brown 
to White stems and therefore wouldn't even EXIST---if it wasn't for the Black
family/race. The logic is very simple, there was one man, one woman created
in the beginning. To this very day, there is no other evidence of any
other human fossil that has been found to deny this fact. From that 
man and woman sprang the rest of civilization, i.e. that including YOU
who are reading this now.

<p>So what does all this mean? It means that our so-called 'civilized' society isnt
as civilized as it claims. How could it be civilized when it despises the Black race for
no good reason at all other than the fact that Black humans suffered for white peoples
benefits.  What kind of logical explanation can a sane and intelligent White Nationalist 
or any other give to humankind to justify this ill behavior? I use the word despise 
understanding that in isolated incidences this word may be too harsh, but in other 
cases and the overwhelming majority of cases...Africans or Black people have been despised!

<p>The Black race is the same race of people who established the arts of civilization from religion, 
science, philosophy, astronomy, and even the calendar.  This fact may be hard for most people to 
believe since the masses have been deceived into believing otherwise, but all one has to do 
is research this information for yourself. 

<p>The Egyptians who once resided on the Northern tip of AFRICA learned how to build
highly complex and sophisticated temples including the grand structure, The Great Pyramid
by King Khufu. I often wonder why the founding fathers of this country used the
very structure (Pyramid) that Black people built and placed it on the back side of 
the dollar bill.

<p>I dont want to ponder too much on Africans contributions to the WORLD in particular
but I wanted to bring up these truths for those of you out there hating what you dont
quite understand. My question and extreme concern again is how a so-called 'civilized'
society can blame the very race it brought up in this society? How else did Africans/Black
people learn anything after being freed from slavery? Europeans in this country taught
Black people the very traits that are complained about today! Europeans created the
many vices that we encounter today and Black people are always to blame. If a White person
provided me with drugs after going to Columbia to get it...then this person is the real blame! 
Making drugs available for the Black community is the cause of their bad habit(s) and only 
the devil would cause temptation to human beings, get my drift.

I close only to say that I wonder about people who hate. It makes very little sense and if you can
educate me as to why this is...Im open ears. I only know that in order to love another, you must
be able to love yourself...COMMON KNOWLEDGE AND TRUE WISDOM.

Please print this letter but leave my e-mail address off.

Thank you,

<h3><i>Interesting yet lacking facts</i></h3>

<p><tt>Tue Aug 22 17:37 EDT 1995</tt>

<p>I have read your information and I have read some of the letters.  
I agree that if you feel that
your rights and / or freedoms are violated that you should stand
up for them.  One thing that I do not agree with is the constant belief
that "Other Races" are out to destroy you.  To be totally honest, it is
"white" race that is always worried about what other groups think of them
and always have the constant xenophobic reaction to other races being in a 
superior position to them.  This is caused by generations of invaisions into the poorly
defended Slavic and European kingdoms.  Ignorance and fear have fed to
the misinformation that is so prevelant in many publications such as
this one.  I would appreciate that you cut the rheoteric and other 
literary "fat" and put some facts that can be empirically "backed up"

<p>Good luck and keep it up.

<h3><i>First time internet user</i></h3>

<p><tt>Tue Aug 22 16:36 EDT 1995</tt>

<p>This is my first time on Internet. I enjoyed reading the letters.

<p>I and most people I meet are (German Kelt) Aryans. Why are Aryans so prejudiced and narrow-minded? Have Aryans been mis-educated and brain-poisoned (Are Aryans so suicidal because they hate themselves?) by the Jewish owned/controlled mass media (according to my concept "media" includes schools and religious organizations, etc.)? Has anyone ever heard the media say anything good about Aryans or any criticism of the Jews who own it? The Jewish agenda includes inciting hatred between Aryans and other races, so Jews expose some Negro crimes so Aryans hate and focus blame on Negroes (who are powerless pawns) instead of on Jews. When Jews blame Aryans for Negro criminality they fulfill the Jewish agenda (devide and conquer?) in many ways at the same time, such as villification of Aryans who Jews say are hate-filled racists who cause Negro crime by unfairly impoverishing the Negro race. Jews want Aryans to believe that Negro genes are in no way responsible for the Negro crime rate being (!) en times that of Aryans, so the Negro can be glorified and miscegenation encouraged. 

<p>How alive or happy can anyone be without pride? Lack of pride is the Aryan's most commonplace mental disease (Christianity claims lack of pride is a virtue). Does the media always do whatever it can (lie, etc.) to glorify American minorities (Negroes, Latin Americans, Jews) and their cultures, etc., but only villifies Aryans? Will we spend eternity in Hell as punishment for being "born in sin" unless we worship a God/Jew quoted in the Bible, in Matthew 15: "I was sent to the lost sheep of the house of Israel and to them alone. It is not right to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs." (I use "The New English Bible" translation.) According to Deuternomy 7, etc., the Hebrew God (imposed on our Aryan ancestors by savage force) chose the Jews to be "above all people that are upon the face of the earth" and told Jews to drive us out of our land and to exterminate us without mercy. "God will put Aryan kings (governments) in the hands of Jews and wipe out the Aryan name/identity from under heaven (Deuteronomy 7.24). How can people without a government or identity defend themselves? The Torah has helped Jews to cherish and preserve Jewish identity for thousands of years. Ezra 9.12 tells Jews never to marry or seek the welfare or prosperity of non-Jews. Jews are unashamed (Jews got chutzpah!) of their racist religion, which is magnitudes more savage than anything Jews ever alleged Aryans to have done (2 Chronicles 8.7, for example). Yet Aryans are even afraid to say the word "Aryan", and hardly know what Aryan means.

<p>An Aryan is a person of Indo-Hittite (Indo-European) ancestry. Germans, Kelts, Slavs (Russians), Kurds, Persians (Iran = Aryan), India Aryans, etc. are more or less pure Aryans. Not all "Whites" are Aryans. Semites (Jews and Arabs), Basques, Caucasians, and southern Europeans, etc. are part of a race which about 35,000 years ago emigrated from Africa to Eurasia, where they miscegenated with or exterminated the Neaderthals, before the Ice Ages. Glaciers cleansed northern Europe by pushing people south, which is why the pre-Aryans of Europe are referred to as the Mediterranean race, and why the Aryan race of Northern Europe (the origin of most "white" Americans) has remain pure enough to maintain the most powerful Aryan civilization. The ancient Aryan civilizations in the Middle East and southern Europe, once the most powerful in the world, have declined due to miscegenation with Mediteraneans.

<p>Aryan civilization was the first on Earth (in Canaan 12,000 years ago), and has led the world in science and technology ever since. According to the "History and Geography of Human Genes" (1994), Aryans (Indo-Hittites) entered Europe from the Fertile Crescent, and the Bible refers to Aryans as Hittites who are part of the Hamite (Canaanite) race, which entered Europe from the Sahara because of drought in the Sahel. The human animal is as savage as any other and also requires domestication (breeding out dangerous behaviors necessary to survival in a savage environment/society) before civilization can exist. Some races have not yet been domesticated.

<p>Would miscegenation be distroying the Aryan race if Aryan education began with a knowledge of Aryan racial identity, history, civilization, etc? Will life ever have access to the infinite resources beyond earth if the potential of Aryan civilization is not maximized by as pure an Aryan race as possible?

<p>I write this in the hope some of you who are reading this are fighters who will help to educate others about the need to preserve Aryan race/civilization and the science and technology which gives life the potential to colonize the Universe beyond this finite planet.

<p>Thanks for the time you have taken to read this.

<p>I am a twenty four year old white male in a time and place where it is not popular to be such. I was quite impressed with your page and the message that you put out on the net. I am often stunned at the way people have abandond their race to try and adopt another one.  am not a racist.  have respect for any man who is willing to work raise a family and be an assest to his community, but it upsets me to see that this country of mine has turned into nation of whiners. If one person can see though the bull that the goverment puts forth and see the racism that others have towards whites (even our oown race hates itself) then your efforts are not in vain. Great job!!!!!!!!!!

<p>I've been on the net a week and I was stunned and horrified to stumble on 
this page.  Homage to the Waffen SS?  Denouncements of miscegenation?
I am a white, southern, American whose great uncle was a general in the
civil war.  But even coming from this background, I cannot understand
the blatant hatred displayed on this web page.  You ask why minorities
are always crying about racism?  This is why! You are why! And I will
tell you that if you try to gain power as a political party there 
are millions of white Americans who will stand up against you and 
strive to put your hatemongering away.
 
<p>You who are denouncing black people-how many have you known?  You who
say that the liberals are hiding the facts about genetic differences
between the races, know this.  The genetic difference between a random
white person and a random black person is no greater than that between
two white people.  Your time is over.  Your hatred will be defeated.

the state of most first world countrys, filling up with third world
people. Why don't they stay where they came from and fix the problems
instead of running out like dogs. Either way it is time for the soon to

<h3><i>SLAVERY AND THE MYTH</i></h3>

<p><tt>Fri Aug 18 20:09 EDT 1995</tt>

<p>There is a serious misconception about Slavery and what occurred in 
Africa. First off, Blacks did not (sell themselves) into slavery...
what idiot would believe this garbage? Question: If you were an African
King/Chief, as there was, and you were told to either sell your tribe 
(people/community) into slavery or be enslaved yourself along with your
family...what would you have done? Blacks in Africa would have never 
sold their brethren if whites and other conquerors didnt have superior
weapons? Unfortunately, whites in those times werent courageous enough
to fight WITHOUT these weapons. To be honest, Africans really had no 
other choice with a gun in their face! Other than that, slavery was 
for those who were either captives of war or criminals and even then,
it wasnt BONDAGE slavery. There are no written records to date concerning
the slavery of any human beings treated as Africans have been treated 
here in America! The slaves mentioned in the Bible were treated better 
than Black slaves in America, at least they didnt get lynched or 
castrated! 

<p>Granted, White Americans of today were not there and did not enslave 
anyone, however, whites of TODAY are benefiting from and are the heirs 
of what AFRICAN-AMERICANS ancestors worked (through slavery) for 350 
years UN-PAID. Blacks are not whining about anything, we simply want 
what was rightfully EARNED. Whites of today just want the usual 
advantages of simply being white and all the things that go along 
with it. We could care less about being white, we want what OUR 
ancestors have EARNED. The white plantation owners sat around and 
watched and made sure the work was done, sure, but it was the Black 
people who actually did the hard work in building this country.  
Where is all the money now...IN OUR GOVERNMENT. So when you think we 
are whining, understand, we not only have a right but it is our duty 
because our ancestors were promised certain things from all this and 
received NOTHING!

<p>I am writing on this because of the response Stormfront received from 
a Connie in Texas who made some vague, yet childish comments.  I didnt 
see anywhere in the letter that I originally wrote that said Connie 
enslaved me. Connie makes silly statements like her being enslaved 
to constant whining and outrages, she meant outrageous Im sure, 
demands from your NAACP. Connie, I dont own the NAACP! Yes, I do have 
balls to gripe but dont put words where they dont belong! You may 
be tired of hearing about Slavery but dont think that we will ever 
forget this atrocity! Question: Are you also tired of  Shindlers List 
by chance?

<p>About the STATISTICS that Mr. Truth wrote about. Understand that 
statistics add up to numbers on paper and has very little to do with 
reality! For instance, you mentioned The Bell Curve which illustrates 
the competence and intelligence of certain races from what I gather. 
If I was to believe this garbage, how would one explain how Africans 
built Pyramids in Africa-Egypt and also how would one explain the 
numerous accomplishments of Africans here in America? You see, statistics 
are numbers and those numbers do not account for the many others 
outside of that perimeter.  Sure, alot of Black people are on welfare, 
but so are alot of whites. Sure, alot of Black people commit crimes, 
but what do you call people like DAHMER, FURHMAN, or PACKWOOD for that 
matter? Saints!  STATISTICS generalize and so do idiots!

<p>In conclusion, Mr. Truth stated that Blacks are dead weight over the 
shoulders of each REGULAR-American. I would like to know from Mr.Truth 
what the hell is a REGULAR-American? IF your answer is white then 
you are exactly what I perceived you to be from the beginning...you 
figure it out! Oh, and if you think that the country would be better 
off without Blacks, you may be right! I Just wish your ancestors would 
have thought about that long before they decided to bring us here!!!!!

<h3><i>Celebrating white heritage</i></h3>

<p><tt>Fri Aug 18 16:08 EDT 1995</tt>

<p>John Smith wants to know:

<p>"SO WHY IS IT THAT WHEN WHITE PEOPLE CELEBRATE THEIR HERITAGE THIS IS LOOKED UPON AS A DISGUSTING "HATE" ACTIVITY???"

<p>That's a good question John.  I think that the answer is that these "celebrations" too often denigrate into things like this:
<p>"To update you a little on the slavery in america. "blacks" sold themselves into slavery!!" (as if whites have never done that)

<p>"the game DOOM is well suited towards our interests. Despite the obvious fantasy elements of the game, it nonetheless reinforces marksmanship, conservation of ammunition and the proper use of cover." (have White-rights activists given up on democracy?  What do you propose to replace it with?)

<p>"the need to pay proper tribute the millions of brave European men and women who fought bravely with the Waffen-SS." (and here I thought the Nazi's were megalomaniacal bastards who killed millions of fellow white people)

<p>If you truly want to be able to state aloud that you are a proud, white, male, you must work to distance yourself, and your fellow proud, white, males from hate-mongers, revisionists and alias-wielding cowards.  The fact that your message is on the same page as these hateful tracts shows why people cannot help but associate them in their minds.

<p>I will be surprised if this gets posted, because Stormfront makes no distinction between white-rights activists and racists.  They would be unlikely to want to broadcast that fact.

<p>Reject hate, scorn haters and be proud of who you are.

<p>1: Congratulations on a well-executed website!

<p>2: Reference the posting Sat 08 JUL 1995 by DECADER, Richmond VA USA
   he might also be interested in the "Deguello" operations against
   wp leaders in the '70's. Frankly, these too sophisticated and 
   effective to have come from "outsider" cointelpro terrorists but
   were far more likely to have come from those who were in sympathy
   with many of our long-range goals. There's probably a place for
   some commentary and history about this as you get some of the
   archives set up, and it's part of the history of <*OUR*> movement!
   I can't think of a better place for the story to be told, and
   retold.

<p>3: Reference "John Doe #2"- now that FBI sniper Lon (women & children
   first) Horiuchi will be forced to appear as a witness at the
   congressional hearings on the Ruby Ridge murders, it'll be 
   interesting to see a profile photo of him side-by-side with the 
   "John Doe #2" sketch, which is no longer available at the FBI 
   website. Watch for him on C-Span!

<h3><i>Inclusion</i></h3>

<p><tt>Thu Aug 17 13:47 EDT 1995</tt>

<p>I think that most of the posts to this website are reflective of the
dissatisfaction of the white people having felt duped by the people
that have tried to further the cause of the disadvantaged in America.
In this regard, when those in policy making positions decided what
was needed to protect the less fortunate they designed programs that
took away from one group perceived privaleges and afforded another
group preferential treatment over and above those of the other. This
has led to divisive nature of politics today. This cannot be construed
as an inprovement of the situation. If policy are exclusive of any one

<h3><i>Great Website!</i></h3>

<p><tt>Wed Aug 16 19:03 EDT 1995</tt>

<p>I was thrilled to discover your website!  This is my first hour on 
the Internet and already I am hooked.  Z.O.G. often confiscates
White Nationalist materieals coming in from the out of the country
so the Internet, and Stormfront, will hopefully allow many other
Canadians hear the truth about the movement.  Keep up the great work!

<h3><i>A divided front?</i></h3>

<p><tt>Aug 13 02:17 EDT 1995</tt>

<p>Reading your pages, it becomes clear to me how thoroughly divided your "movement" is.  I would encourage all of your readers to go through each of the documents on this site and the associated ones, and mark down each statement you disagree with.  At the end you will find that that there are more differences than commonalties.

<p>Pride or hatred?

<p>On the one hand, you claim that all you stand for is white pride and unity.  Pride and unity of any sort are good.

<p>On the other hand, you direct people to web pages called "cyberhate." Skulls play a prominent place in your (collective) imagery.  You seem to embrace hate in your "quote of the day."  You promote records called "Born to hate."  You are glad that Orientals and blacks are fighting at UC.  

<p>Which is it?  Are you dedicated to unity and love or division and hatred?  

<p>Superior or not?

<p>On the one hand, the "White Nationalism FAQ" says "Do White Nationalists do feel that they are superior to other races?  No."  But another piece on the site says: "On the way back to my room I wondered if, in a few hundred years, some half-Black ancestor of mine would be sitting among the ruins of our civilization, brushing away the flies, waiting to die."  Which is it?  Are blacks our genetic ruination or are they different but equal?

<p>Nazi symbolism or Christian?

<p>You have this gothic-Christian cross-like logo on your front page, but nazi logos buried in subpages.

<p>In [1], the author says: "In the United States, we are taught that racial integration is a moral imperative."  Perhaps it has to do with that "we take these truths to be self evident, that all men are created equal"

<p>Anti-British?

<p>In [2] there is a pile of anti-British propaganda.  I wonder what your readers of British ancestry think of that? 

<p>What is a "White?"

<p>All over the place on your site Jews are derided, but David Duke promotes ancient Indians as Aryans???

<p>Waco by the government or for the government?

<p>Some [3] of your writings about Waco say that it was "citizens striking back against the government."  Others [4] say that it was the government that did it.

<p>Christianity or Paganism?

<p>The people at [5] are clearly not Christians.  They laugh at those who: "postulate a divine but nevertheless manlike being who rules man and the world by supernatural law"  That sounds like the Christian God to me.  They sound more like Pagans or Buddhists in their belief in "one reality, which we call Nature"

<p>Barry Manilow, rules or sucks?

<p>At [6] a man denigrates Barry Manilow as an example of the evil infesting our society, but Mr. Cyberhate runs a Barry Manilow home page!

<p>Conclusion:

<p>It is clear that there is no unity or commonality of your beliefs.  You are united only by that most destructive of emotions, fear.  Your hatred is just a result of your fear, of course.  Most hatred is.  Like the obsolete macho men you are (women are obviously underrepresented in the movement), you put on a gruff, tough exterior to hide your fear of that which you do not know or understand (particularly the future).  If you ever got an opportunity to create your own country it would quickly collapse under the weight of your differences (and your penchant for military resolution of social problems).  

<p>Luckily racism (or racialism if you're a politically correct racist) has been on the decline since the beginning of the age of reason so your page stands out as a fantastic anthropological specimen of a dying belief system.  Keep up the good work!

<p>You do, however, misinterpret most of the material here. Opposing British government policies, for example, does not make anyone "anti-British." And in the case of the tongue-in-cheek material on "Cyberhate," I can only ask, "Are you really that dense?"</i>

<p>To update you a little on the slavery in america.  
"blacks" sold themselves into slavery!!
We did not rip them from their homeland, they where not even wanted 
by their own people!  If your black, personaly, im tired of 
hearing you whine about slavery, because I WAS NOT HERE!,i didnt
have a damn thing to do with it, neither did my family, we didnt
arive until after the civil war, but you still have the balls to
gripe to me that "I" enslaved you!  I am the one enslaved to your 
constant whining and the outrages demands from your NAACP.

<p>If you are white, sir , take off your blinders,  be aware of 
the world around you, dont just hide your head in books, but go out and 
live life,  maybe then you will experience what we are talking about, 
maybe then you will get a taste of the racism that is against you!

Currently, I live in Sweden, which soon is bound to be a place where 
the Whites are a minority (if nothing is done soon). Ghettos ascending from nowhere like
mushrooms, filled with non-whites. The estimated number of immigrants is now 18% and rising, 
and by year 2000, we are outnumbered. Our hope right now is to get organized, and seize the power.

<p>Although electronic gaming should in no way displace the Aryan's exercise of mind, body and learning; should one be inclined towards electronic gaming, the game DOOM is well suited towards our interests. Despite the obvious fantasy elements of the game, it nonetheless reinforces marksmanship, conservation of ammunition and the proper use of cover. All of these principles are very important in real life as well. This game can be networked, so that several players can hunt each other as well. All in all, a game that does well to teach partisan/militia tactics.

<p>I think the current state of the country is very depressing.

New York is trying to legalize homosexual marriages.  Meanwhile just
about every pro-white organization is too busy gossiping and back-
stabbing to do anything about it.  The way things are I wouldn't join
any organization, that really sickens me.  All white people need to 
band together or our children have no future.

<p>The Frenchman , Voltaire, said, "I do not agree with what you say

a lie, or just a mistake, I try to correct it. The mistakes of which I speak
are mannt... I shall just mention a few. Peanutbutter,gasmasks,trains, medical
contributions, were all made by the same people you seem so against. Lets just 
everything gets pushed to far, and a race war occurs... without the things I 
mentioned, all sides would suffer more then they would need to. Whats my point? 
just this, they did the things in the advancement of ALL of society, not just 
for themselves. Your fathers may have been saved due to a gasmask, or survied
on peanutbutter, or been evacuated, by things a "minority" created. Dig deeper 
into our history, you will find even grater trueths then you imagined.

<h3><i>WHY IS IT ? </i></h3>

<p><tt>Tue Aug  1 16:24 EDT 1995</tt>

<p>The very concept of Multiculturalism is that every heritage group 
should be proud of their relative background.
We in Canada encourage the different groups to promote and 
rejoice in their respective heritage. 

<p>SO WHY IS IT THAT WHEN WHITE PEOPLE CELEBRATE THEIR 
HERITAGE THIS IS LOOKED UPON AS A DISGUSTING "HATE" ACTIVITY ???

<p>I believe that because whites are viewed by our governments as 
a silent majority, then they don't need to worry about our 
support, instead they feel that they had better coddle up to the 
visible minority special interest groups for votes.  
Its about time that the whites stood up for their own interests, as
do the visible minority groups.   Thats equality!  It doesn't
look like our governments are going to stand up for us, so lets do it
ourselves.

<p>Our government here in Canada does not help this situation, and 
actually makes the situation worse by ill-conceived policies.
Can you believe that here in Ontario, the provincial government 
actually publishes job postings in the newpaper 
which read "women, visible minorities and handicapped people are 
encouraged to apply".

<p>Why didn't they just say "white males need not apply."

<p>Its about time that whites in North America should not feel 
ashamed about beating our own drum and being proud of our heritage.
We represent one of the most successful races on earth.  Just look 
at the state of many of the visible minority nations.
Then look at the white nations.  That comparison should
tell you right there that we whites have a lot to be proud of.

<p>This does not mean that we should be against anyone because of 
colour or ethnic background for that reason alone, but we should 
not be afraid to promote our own racial heritage, that of the whites
from around the world.

<p>We have remained silent long enough.

<h3><i>Be Proud of Your History</i></h3>

<p><tt>Sat Jul 22 16:24 EDT 1995</tt>

<p>Great page design! 

<p>Though not a "socialist," I'm a nationalist who is angry at affirmative action, "multiculturalism," "diversity," and all the other anti-white code words and programs.

<p>Where do they come from? From a single root cause: the belief that "minorities" have been oppressed and harmed by whites, or the "white male system" otherwise known as Western Civilization.

<p>Let's get it right: minorities have it infinitely better in this country than they could ever have hoped for if their ancestors had never come into contact with Europeans. Despite media propaganda, the aborigines who populated this continent before the white man came were not beautiful creatures who lived in harmony with nature; they were illiterate savages who had to kill or be killed. They lived short hard lives of grinding poverty and ignorance. Even the descendants of those who were brought here as slaves are all far better off than they could
have hoped for if they had stayed where they were.

<p>Ever notice how those who hate Western Civilization the most are the first in line for the special favors and handouts so they can live in the white man's modern high-tech world? Funny thing, but I haven't seen any of them actually return to the primitive lifestyle of the ancestors they admire so much. 

<p>Time to get it right: The "oppressor" has given more and taken less than the "oppressed." Maybe its time we stopped getting treated as second class citizens and got a loud THANK-YOU!

<p>I've just started cruising the Web Sites and find yours to be one of the best. Americans of European ancestry are responsible for all the comforts and conveniences we have today. Our forefathers fought, sweated, and suffered in the past so that their children could have it a little easier. Now we see the result: the vast majority of White Americans are so wrapped up in themselves and in trying to be fashionable that they don't even know what we are sprinting towards: our doom. With the help of your website and others, we can achieve Racial Solidarity and establish an Aryan Republic representative of its vast majority of those of European ancestry. Race is everything!

I would like to commend those who are honestly in the frontlines to

<p>If, we were indeed performing some acts of terrorism, then fine, but
the simple fact is that there are those whom are seeking World Conquest,
and they can only accomplish it by 1) Disarming the Nation, 2) Taking
away the Rights of those from the Nation, and 3) Destroying the people
from that Nation.  There are 2 "foes" targeted, and that is the White
race and the Christian religion.

<h3><i>Building Blocks</i></h3>

<p><tt>Tue Jul 18 14:22 EDT 1995</tt>

<p>I don't believe that their exists racism amongst white people anymore.  Instead I believe it is a form of realism.  Americans, since the beginning of their educational upbringing, are taught first with blocks, and then on to letter combinations, to build structure from pieces collected.  As we grow older, the lesson of building relevant creations continues and flourishes.  The same exists in relation to members of the black race.  With enough "bad pieces"-these being pieces one has collected through his/her life which lead to negative feelings towards that race, the individual will feel a negatitivity towards that race.  I believe it is realistic to assume that these pieces are everywhere and hencefourth, racism does not exist, but instead a sense of realism and an awakening...open up you eyes to what you know in your heart white brothers and sisters.

<p>I am A 20 year old  white american with roots in North America 
 dating back 300 years and then into Europe, Normandy France. 
Well  anyways I am proud to here of an organization for the advancement 
of whites. It seems now a days every one feels it is our fault the U.S. is in termoil, 
so we become the oppressed. Could we please stop dwelling on 300 years of slavery?
Damn, every problem non-whites have they blame it on the man. 
I am tired of it and I am glad others are too. I believe the message  "STORMFRONT" 
provides is a positive message to whites, and shows concern, not racial hate.

<p>My name is Jose Muller Vega of spanish and german ancestry.
I am a white Puerto Rican. The reason I am writing to you is the 
following, i would like to know why we Puerto Ricans being of mostly
european heritage are always been discriminated by the kkk and other
white groups, these groups label us as non whites, and this is very
much annoying for most of us we are also white and nobody can take 
that away from us no matter what language we speak. We dont have to 
prove our color to anybody, but for all of those ignorants out there
which cannot differentiate what is or who is a white person;do me a
favor pick up an antropology book or dictionary and look under different race 
and maybe you out there might races and see were the spanish people belong in.
and see were we belong to. please stop this nonsense just because we
have a different culture from white americans does not make us less 
white. 
<p>One very important contribution that us spanish people made in 
in world war 2 was that we were Germany ally, and we were and are
more extremists than you concerning race related subjects. read our
history and you'll find out thank you;

<h3><i>Looking for answers</i></h3>

<p><tt>Wed Jul 12 18:37 EDT 1995</tt>

<p>As a black male, your movement is of intense interest to me. Indeed as the saying goes 
"Hold thy friends close but thine enemies closer....". However I find myself looking 
for certain answers within your numbers.I respest your opinions as your opinions 
and in such a censored world I admire you for taking this stand for what you feel is right. 
Yet just 2 years ago I was beaten and left for dead by a group of Neo Nazi skinheads. 
This is the first thing that confuses me. I may hate everything your movement stands 
for yet it is not my right to violently force that upon others. To be honest, there have been 
times when I smiled at the idea of burning fields of skinheads but still this is not my right, 
to cause others to suffer for there beliefs. 

<p>This brings me to my next question. What society do you expect to build based on 
the persecution of others. Certaintly, it begins with your enemies but history has shown 
us that once that line has been crossed the field is open for persecution of ones former allies. 
Just look at eastern Europe's history or the tortured past of my own motherland, Africa. 

<p>This leads me onto my main query, one of the main problems I have with your movement. 
I am black and the world has made certain I know what goes along with this. But half my 
heritage is white and it is a half I am just as proud off. I am Irish, brought up fiercly Irish 
Catholic and from a very nationalistic family. This form off nationalism, bred by 1100 years 
of struggle is something that many of your ranks have no understanding of. Yet your movement 
tells me I have no right to rejoice in my white heritage. I hope you understand my questions 
and I hope you are not as cowardly as the 7 skinheads who were so brave in their battle 
with me and that you will confront me on paper. I thank you for your time.

<h3><i>Multi-culturalism vs. Multi-racialism</i></h3>

<p><tt>Fri Jul  7 08:23 EDT 1995</tt>

<p>To me the concept of multi-culturalism is one of the most dangerous
concepts in recent history.  Teachers no longer teach the phonetic of Standard
American Colloquial English so that "Cultural Pronounciations" won't be discouraged.
They want separate dialects to flourish.  This can only fragment further
American society.  I must admit, perhaps contrary to some at this site, that
people of different backgrounds can be Americans.  But the must assimulate.
The must speak the American version of English, they can not have any other national loyalties,
They can not form special interest groups, lobbying for special treatment.
This idea of groups having the attitude that they can committ
crimes because what "society" did to the as a race is preposterous.
	
<p>I have a little problem with a National movement being exclusive though.
I want to join a Nationalist movement.  I feel in my heart that Nationalism
is the paste that glues us together.  To form the fist, rather than the open
hand.  I support foreign policies that put America's interest first.
I have little interest in fighting to change the out come of some elses civil
war, unless the US can reap substantial benefits.  

<p>I believe that if the Nationalist movement shifted to
a movement against multi-culturalism rather than multi-racism
our country can become the prosperious power it once was, and
deserves to be.

<p>This may be a FAQ - my wife and I are British by birth,

A few years later the family emigrated  to the US, and my wife and I 
added US Citizenship. This was also conferred automatically
on Peter even though he was under 18, and signed nothing.
The Canadian Embassy now inform him that he 'lost' Canadian
citizenship thereby, leaving him with just US and British citizenship.

<h3><i>Time for Proper Tribute to the Waffen-SS</i></h3>

<p><tt>Mon Jul 31 22:33 EDT 1995</tt>

<p>As the world looks from 1995 back, through the darkened glass of mainstream media distortion to 1945, I would like to highlight the need to pay proper tribute the millions of brave European men and women who fought bravely with the Waffen-SS.

<p>The Waffen (armed)-SS was a military field organization organized much the same way as the army (Wehrmacht) and quite distinct in its mission from the Allgemeine (general or police/civilian-oriented) SS.  Its mission was to provide a top quality elite presence on the battlefield to ensure the favorable resolution of critical tactical situations.

<p>The Waffen-SS is still the finest mass elite fighting force ever assembled.  More than two million men and women served in its ranks from 1939 through 1945.  The Waffen-SS pioneered many tactics and techniques that have been adopted by armies around the world.  For example, the Blitzkrieg ("lightning war") combined arms (infantry/tank/artillery/air) assault technique was often spearheaded by SS units.  The Waffen-SS pioneered the widespread use of the camouflage combat clothing that is used by nearly all armies today.

<p>In order to begin bringing attention to the courage and determination of these soldiers, I would like to mention some of the better known units:

<UL><LI>1st SS Panzer (Armored) Division "Liebstandarte Adolf Hitler" ("Personal Guard Regiment Adolf Hitler"; one of the first Waffen SS formations; distinguished itself on numerous occasions in the East)

<LI>2nd SS Panzer Division "Das Reich" ("The Realm"; the one they always called on when things got hot; often rescued encircled army units in the East against overwhelming Soviet forces; punched its way to within sight of the towers of the Kremlin)

<LI>5th SS Panzer Division "Wiking" ("Viking"; repeatedly gave the Soviets a bloody nose; feared in the East for its fierce assaults)

<LI>9th SS Panser Division "Hohenstauffen" (single-handedly decimated Monty's foolhardy airborne assault into Arnhem, Netherlands in 1944-see movie "A Bridge Too Far")</UL>

<P>There were also numerous Waffen-SS units made up of idealistic young volunteers from all over Europe.  These men hailed from Spain to Latvia and from Croatia to Norway.  Some of these European units that fought just as fiercely as their German brethren were:

<UL><LI>13th Waffen Gebirgs (Mountain) Division der SS (Croatian)

<LI>14th Waffen Grenadier (Infantry) Division der SS (Ukrainian)

<LI>15th Waffen Grenadier Division der SS  (Latvian)

<LI>21st Waffen Gebirgs Division der SS (Albanian)

<LI>28th SS Freiwilligen ("volunteer"; note: nearly all units were volunteer, whether designated as such or not) Grenadier Division (Walloon-Belgian)

<LI>29th Waffen Grenadier Division der SS (Italian)

<LI>31st SS Freiwilligen Grenadier Division (Bohemian-Moravian)

<LI>33rd Waffen Grenadier Division der SS "Charlemagne" (French)

<LI>34th SS Freiwilligen Grenadier Division "Landstorm Nederland" (Dutch)

<LI>41st Waffen Grenadier Division der SS "Kalevala" (Finnish)
</UL>
<P>Thank you for your Stormfront web site.  It is making a big difference for a lot of us out here.  Thanks in particular for the Spanish language section which has enabled an older relative who fought in Russia in WW2 to appreciate some of the news. 

<P>Keep up the good work and let us not forget these brave soldiers.

<h3><i>Ruby Ridge and Waco</i></h3>

<p><tt>Sat Jul 29 15:41 EDT 1995</tt>

<p>There has been anger from the far right and neo-nazi/militia types
concerning the incidents at Waco and Ruby Ridge.  I can understand
to a point the concern over Waco.  Here we had a branch of the 
government go a little trigger happy with Vernon Howell aka David Koresch.
Those people,however, had over 50 days to come out of that compound
and face the charges brought forth by the ATF.  Ultimatly, the entire
blame for the firey ending must be laid at the feed of child molester and
all around wacko, David Koresch.  The only tradegy here was the death
of the children and the 4 goverment agents.
<P>The standoff at Ruby Ridge is another story altogether.  The agent
who shot Mr. Weaver's wife and child was simply defending himself after
coming under fire by Randy Weaver.  I believe the reason Randy Weaver
was aquited of the charges is that is was difficult to prove who 
really fired upon the agents from the house.  It could have been Randy
or his wife.

<p>I am pleased to find this site. In Australia we have the same problems.
Our government is also trying to limit the freedoms of the population 
and take away the rights that helped build our country.
We also have a "Multicultural" society. Most of the immigrants that we 
have in this country have brought their hatred of the white race with them
and we are slowly becoming outnumbered. To even be in some areas of our
larger cities after dark is to be risking attack by machette weilding
groups of blacks or asians. 
<BR>point 1...why are governments taking from the people that contribute 
the most to society and giving it the those who contribute the least.
<BR>point 2...Why dont the so called refugees stay in their own country and
fight for it. I would rather fight and die for my freedoms than leave 
my brothers and sisters to suffer while I hid like a dog in another country.

<h3><i>Pride in accomplishment / Luck in race</i></h3>

<p><tt>Fri Jul 28 21:41 EDT 1995</tt>

<p>I've been on-line for approx. 4 years now and have lapped up my share of rhetoric from the extreme right to the extreme left and I've arrived at the following conclusion. All these hypenated Americans (Afro-American, Hispanic American, etc.) and the white pride folks seem to base their pride in something they had absolutely no control over: their race and ethnicity. I'm 36 years old and have met great people as well as major criminal-types of every race. I try to take pride in my accomplishments rather than the fact I'm white. (This is not to say that I'm not glad to be white, especially in this country. I'm not for "reverse-discrimination but am honest enough to realize that being white has it's advantages...even being a white male!). 

<P>I see your letters represent the spectrum from intelligent "aryans" to the neanderthal "lets send 'em to afrika / six million more" crowd. I disgaree with most every report I see represented as "the truth" since I believe those dedicated to a cause (a white homeland) would consider lying to be an economical weapon of choice. But I'm glad you have the right to print your words. Don't get me wrong though.... when the "jackbooted thugs" come for me (whether their yours or someone else's) I'll be ready!

<p>Has anyone else out there noticed the dramatic increase in inter-
racial dating over the past couple of years?  It seems to me that many
white women are no longer interested in dating white men.  A day
doesn't go by when I don't see one or two mixed couples....on weekends
I often see over a dozen.  What is going on here?  Is it just a "fad".
Is it happening all over the country or is it just here in the
shadow of Wash DC?

<P>I'm a single white male - I'm told I'm attractive, that I have a good
sense of humor...I'm reasonably athletic, gainfully employed and
what I want more than anything else on earth is to be a husband.  But,
I seem to be lacking a quality alot of white women are looking for:
black skin.

<P>I think Stormfront is great...but I have suggestion for you:  Create a
"single whites" section where like-minded men and women can get in
contact.  This maybe a crazy idea from your perspective - but how else
will our race survive if we don't do those things to help promote
its procreation?

<h3><i>Statistics</i></h3>

<p><tt>Sat Jul 22 19:54 EDT 1995</tt>

<p>Dear Sirs,

I enjoy your web page very much, but I don't believe you go far
enough in content.  Please let me explain.  If the average white 
person is ever going to truly understand the reality of the 
differences which exist between the white race and the black race,
they MUST be allowed to view the statistical data which so plainly
and clearly illustates all the points you and I are trying to make.
The liberal media "shields" the average person from the true facts,
because to do otherwise would be "insensitive" or not "politically
correct."  

<P>The true numbers are staggering!  Blacks are ravaging the
nation with crime, and the liberal media is worried about offending
certain members of society with the truth!!!  A sign of the times, 
my friends.  If you'll observe, the media seemingly always points to
crime statistices, HIV/AIDS statistics, illegitimate birth rate
statistics, and health statistics in terms of ALL races combined.  
However, when you actually take the time to read the race dependent
numbers (e.g. The stats which catagorize sets of data according to
race) published by such government organizations as, The Centers For
Disease Control,  The Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Central
Intelligence Agency, it rapidly becomes apparent that the black
community is responsible for a very large and disproportionate amount
of crime and HIV/AIDS in this country!  The media also fails to
indicate that if you are white, and you practice heterosexual sex
with a partner of your own race and whose practices are the same as 
yours, your chances of contracting HIV are far, far lower than those
of homosexuals, blacks, and illicit drug users.  How is it that blacks
comprise less than 13 percent of our society, and account for so much
turmoil?  Read "The Bell Curve" for a better understanding!  Sirs, I
strongly encourage you to produce numerous graphs on your WWW page
which clearly illustrate what the liberal media tries so hard to hide.
If you can help to force these numbers into the light, more people
might join our common cause.  Sadly, because of the media, many people
just aren't aware of the truth.  And if you do decide to create 
graphs, be sure to include the U.S. Goverment sources from which the 
data originates.  This will lend additional credibility to the data.

<P>Sirs, feel free to print this letter, but please withhold my email
address.  I work for the U.S. Government and my job would be at 
jeopardy if it is discovered that I'm writing letters like this one
while I'm at work.  (I know, it's very sad that the "PC" crowd is
killing the first amendment.)  I am very proud of my political
position, but I can't afford to lose my job.  I don't hate all blacks,
and I don't love all whites.  I just feel the country would be
better off without them (blacks) as a whole, and they'd be better off 
back in their natural habitat.  If they continue to stay, they will 
continue to be like a huge "dead weight" over the shoulders of each
REGULAR-American.

<h3><i>Affirmative action</i></h3>

<p>Recently the Atlanta Journal/Constitution solicited our opinion on affirmative action. Below is the text of my letter:

<p>Affirmative action is a failure both to those it is intended to help and to those on whom the onus of mandated madness is imposed. You will always have the poor with you. Using police state tactics Russia spent 70 years trying to create a classless society. Such utopian dreams are in Plato's Republic and this scenario is acted out faithfully by our social insects but never by man, the free thinker.

<p>Our minority citizens, the Koreans, Chinese, Indians inter alios work and succeed in this society. Our African ex-slaves are ironically enslaved by the very social welfare system funded to help them. To further the irony businesses see them as a legal liability due to anti-business legislation. It is simply too dangerous to hire them because they can bring in the "feds" on any whimsical, fancied injustice. 

<p>The white man, be he employer or employee, is tossed into this egregious nightmare of balances and quotas. The employer faces a paperwork jungle of forms to be submitted; the well-qualified prospective employee may not get the job because of the numbers racket played by the E.O.E., etc.
In conclusion, affirmative action is an idealistic, unworkable doctrine of equality. Friedrich Nietzsche foresaw this more than 100 years ago. On equality he wrote: "There is no more poisonous poison anywhere: for it seems to be preached by justice itself, whereas it really is the termination of justice. Equal to the equal, unequal to the unequal - that would be the true slogan of justice; and also its corollary: Never make equal what is unequal."

<h3><i>Who Can You Trust</i></h3>

<p>How does a visitor to your Internet site know that it is not a front
run by the FBI??  I certainly do not mean to impugn your integrity or honor but,
after Waco and Ruby Ridge, it is clear to me that the federal government is out
of control. 

<p>Lies and coverups are the standard fare from Reno, Freeh
and the bleeding heart liberals who have ruined this country. If
Horiuchi is still on the payroll, and if the architect for Ruby Ridge and Waco can
be promoted to the #2 position at the FBI, one does not have to be
a genius to discern a coverup. Where is the accountability?? If one writes
their Senator/Congressman/Congresswoman, neither a Democrat, or a
Republican, will give a straight answer on Weaver's entrapment, the murder
of his son and wife, or explain why Potts was promoted. The reason
is that the Congress has built this moster that can assassinate at will,
and the Congress will NOT rein it in. Just watch the 12 July hearings. All
you will se is hot air, and no action to curb BATF/FBI abuses.

<P><I>[Ed: I would think a WWW page run by the FBI

less well-defined ideology, and it would include incitement to illegal 
action through some sort of organization, as in the COINTELPRO operations 
of the 60s and early 70s. Otherwise, they'd just be collecting more 
names of more dissidents to go along with millions of others. They 
could do the same thing just as effectively by visiting any working class bar.

<P>In actuality, the World Wide Web doesn't lend itself to collecting 
names. Only IP addresses are logged by the server, any one of which could 
represent many users - millions in the case of Prodigy, AOL or Compuserve.

<P>There's also the fact that I've been pretty well known in White Nationalist

<h3><i>Enemies? who are they?</i></h3>

<p>I was stumbling around the web and hit your Web page. It is interesting as
as well as it is designed (congrats).I agree with your use of your rights 
to free speech, yet I disagree with your groups ultimate goals. They appear 
dark and unpleasant for all non-whites. So I ask, what about their rights?

<p>The quoting of Nietzsche is a massive insult to his writings. He spoke
of peace for all man, not they way you use it.

<p>Also, if their was a group like this in power two hundred years ago, 
and they were anti-white, you would all not exist. Something to think about.

This is my basic rough draft/framework as to why I'm pursuing in these particular studies and I would like to know what people think; perhaps you think I should forget about the whole thing orget into a better major. Either way I really want some input. This is a serious paper.

<h3><i>Crossroads of Race</i></h3>

<p>We are at a crossroads my fellow Americans.  To all sides of the poltical and ideological 
spectrums groups claim dominance.  It is time, America, to make that choice. As I see it we have 
three options. 1.  Become a totalitarian state which would be ruled by unfair martial law. 
2. Adopt a new form of government and national idenity. Maybe that will be a white state, 
maybe it will resemble our current government, then again, maybe not. 3. Continue on our path to 
doom of overcrowding and loss of any pride, nationalism or happiness with this country. 

<p>If we do not take the steps now for a peaceful state of white cizens, this will be the battlle cry 10 years from now, when I'm 25, "This wrld rejects me. This world threw me away. This world never gave me a chance. This world gonna have to pay....sometimes I think I could I'm gonna burn this whole world down!!!!!" Trent Reznor.          

<p>And once this crossroads is passed nihlism and anarchy lay in wait.

<h3><i>What kind of people do YOU want living in your Utopia?</i></h3>

<p>This is more or less a follow on from my previous posting on the eight
year old asian girl who had ciggarettes stubbed out on her back by a
racist white guy. One person who claimed to be a member of the Ku Klux 
Klan said he would have gone further and tied the girl to a cartwheel 
and shoved barbed wire into her bodily orifices.

<p>What I want to ask is whether white separatists want people like this 
living in your white Utopia?  Do you realy want someone who do something
like that to a little girl (whatever her colour).  Do you want someone
who'd sooner stub out cigarrettes on a little girl's back than give you
the time of the day.  After all, to do something like that takes more
than 'having pride in your race'.  It takes a person who has something
wrong in their head.

<p>Let's take this further.  Say you where in a balloon 25000 feet above
the Atlantic with an asian doctor (who'd treat anyone regardless of 
skin colour) and a  racist white guy who couldn't find his butt if you
gave him a map. You need to throw someone out because you're running 
out of hot air.  Who would you throw out?

<P><I>[Ed: Your image of White Nationalists is the grotesque media caricature. 
No genuine White Nationalist would engage in gratuitous cruelty against other races. 
No genuine White Nationalist is interested in oppressing other races. We are 
fighting for the right to our own nation free of outside interference, just as 
other races should have the same right.

<P>Multiculturalism has created an enormous amount of resentment and racial animosity
on both sides. Most racial violence is committed by Blacks or browns against Whites, and 
is given little play by the media. Nevertheless, it isn't that hard for the media 
find a few White criminals victimizing non-Whites, and twist this into an indictment 
of White Nationalism.]</I>

<h3><i>FREE AT LAST!  FREE AT LAST!</i></h3>

<p>I'm just dropping a line to all concerned White Separatists who wrote
me with encouragement during my recent incarceration.  After 3 weeks in
the gulag, I am free, and back in business 110%!

<p>Check out the July issue of DETAILS Magazine, it carries a jumbo
story on Resistance Records and yours truly.  Form your own conclusions.
I am working on issue 5 of RESISTANCE Magazine, which will carry some
very interesting articles.

<p>Anyone who saw the CNN piece a couple weeks back may have noticed the
concert footage of RAHOWA.  That footage was taken from our upcoming 2
hour long concert video, on sale in the next issue of RESISTANCE (#5).

<p>Also coming in the same issue is a two CD box set "TRIBUTE TO
SKREWDRIVER".  Over two hours of music!  32 songs!  It is great . . .

<p>Anyways, I am currently out on appeal bail. My appeal comes up on
January 30th, 1996 (or later).  The Canadian ZOG have been gleefully
celebrating my "demise" due to the fact that entry into the U.S. with a
felony conviction is hard. Winning my appeal is very important to my
future movement goals for this reason. Doing the time is not the
problem, it is the transit problems afterwards.  They already
interrogate me for 2 hours when they intercept me trying to enter the
U.S., if they have an actual reason, it will get worse.

<p>Enough said already.  Sorry if the letter is a little disjointed, I
have three weeks worth of missed opportunities to pursue, and our
enemies never rest!

<h3><i>Genocide</i></h3>

<p>In Los Angeles there stands a temple to indoctrinate and punish free
thinkers known as the "Museum of Tolerance"; it was built by the
preserver of the collective human conscience, Simon Wiesenthal. Inside
this Disneyland of correct thought, the "E ticket to ride", is the
portrayal of all white people as the true hateful scourge of mankind. 

<p>My question is why there isn't a permanent display about the genocide
which the Jews themselves have commited. The book of Joshua outlines
seven people groups which the Jews eradicated completely from the Earth.
Has anyone met a Canaanite, Perizite, Amalakite etc. lately? Why isn't
the Museum of Tolerance at least honest about this mass slaughter of
humanity? I support genocide when it is God's will (as was the case in
the book of Joshua) so I'm not condemning them for what they did, but
what gives them the moral high ground to condemn such atrocities as
Hitler may have committed when they themselves have baggage seven times
worse?

<h3><i>End justifies the means?</i></h3>

in a predominately white neighbourhood in which they were accpeted by
all but one particular family. The child of the asian family, a girl
aged eight had ciggarettes stubbed out on her back as she was walking
back from school by the eighteen year old boy of the racist family.

<p>STORMFRONT is one of the few pages I heartily recommend to like-minded people.

<p>Thanks for an excellent resource.

<h3><i>Good job!</i></h3>

<p>Don,

<p>The Stormfront web page looks GREAT! I hope that when the 
National Alliance homepage is finally up, it will be of the same
high quality as yours.

<p>I'd also like to say thanks for creating the link to my FTP site.
The number of people who stop in and get files has more than 
doubled since you created the link to the site. Keep up the good
work!

<p>Sincerely,

<h3><i>Revisionism and Patriotism</i></h3>

<p>Brousing through your pages, I noticed a good deal of Revisionist
literature.  Additionally, there is much devoted to the current Patriot
ideas around today.

<p>Revisionists have always amazed me to the extent that they are able
to further their point.  In the face of mountains of evidence in the
form testimonials, confessions, and archival documents and film they
continue to deny that the Holocasut occured.  They pull this off with a
mix of semantics (there was no *intended* slaughter of the Jews, Jews
were killed, but *not* in gas chambers, etc.) and conspiracy theories
(confessions were beaten out of Germans, survivors are part of a Zionist
plot, films, documents and diaries were forged, etc.) that allows them
to deny the existence of the murder of Europe's Jews without saying
anything at all. Sophistry, if you ask me.

<p>Modern Patriots butcher the ideas of our founding fathers support
their goals.  They consistently ignore the fact that their ideal nation
failed (I'm thinking here of the 13 states as they existed under the
articles of Confederation....or alternately the Confederate States
during the Civil War) for precisely the reason the Union was formed,
lack of a strong Central government.  America was saved from
Jeffersonian Democracy by the federalists and we a huge debt of
grattitude as a nation to men like John Marshall.

<p>Forgive the random tone of this message, and please note that I
avoided any of the name calling you alluded to on the letters page.  I
dare you to post this.

<h3><i>NU AFREKENEN!</i></h3>

<p>I am Filip Dewinter, the mainman of the flemish rightwing
nationalists. I am 30 years old and looking for penpals in the US.

<p>I can only sympathise with the oppinions expressed on this homepage.
In Antwerp we are the biggest party! We will throw out all the Marrokans
and Turkish out of Antwerp and try to stop the islamic invasion!

<p>My main bar is "De Leeuw van Vlaanderen" where they serve Duvel one
of the more extreme beers here in Flanders.

<h3><i>Suggested Actions - Local Control</i></h3>

<p>Purchase a reliable firearm for every member of the family and learn
to use it.  It is necessary to have at least one completely legal
semi-automatic rifle or shotgun for use in cases of self-defense or
civil disorder.

<p>Second, be at least marginally respectful toward your local terror
police.  Buy the sheriff a cup of coffee if you see him at a resturaunt,
or give a friendly wave when you pass the state patrol. The rich man's
militia has the power to selectively enforce laws against us or against
our opponents.  They also serve as information gatherers for power
brokers in Washington and Tel Aviv.  The first step toward breaking
their hold lies in befriending the neighborhood cop, and voting for a
sympathetic boss in the next election.

<p> Anti-White facists in the Republican and Democratic parties are
gearing up for the 1996 corporate buy-out of Washington.  Both will turn
a blind eye to their past policies and attempt to cater to the emerging
body of armed patriots.  There also will be talk of greater anti-crime,
anti-terrorism, and anti-gun legislation to appease frightened liberals.
We'll have to eventually choose the lesser of a few evils, but we must
reserve our charitable funds and time for securing local control.  A few
hundred dollars and forty hours of work won't buy a plank on the
Republican platform, but it can tip the scales in a local sheriff's
election.
<p>There was a time when no jury in the South would convict a Klansman.
As our laws become more and more coercive, we need to return to the old
methods.  As we prepare for the 1996 elections, we should consolidate
local power by infiltrating police departments, befriending potential
jurors, and developing information networks - through radio, phone
trees, and email - that interpret news from a different standpoint than
our mass media.

<li>FHP Independent Plan is a non-federally qualified HMO plan. Rates for medical coverage only effective as of 	July 1,1995.

If the person starts or resumes the use of tobacco, then the non-smoker discount no longer applies.  A person may qualify as a non-smoker more quickly if they complete the <a href="smoking.htm">FHP Smoking Cessation program</a> and refrain from any use of tobacco for a period of two years.
<li>If you wish to apply, coverage will not become effective until FHP, Inc. has reviewed and approved your application and medical history, issued and delivered your contract, and your first premium has been received by FHP.<p>

Adopting a pet can help you stay healthier and happier.  And FHP Health Care and the Arizona Humane Society have teamed up to provide <b>free pet adoptions for older adults (60 years and older) living in Maricopa County.</b>  If you're interested in owing a pet and can provide an appropriate home environment, read on to learn more about P.A.L.S. (Partnering Animals with Loving Seniors).<p>

FHP's sponsorship covers the total cost of pet adoption, including:
<ul>
<li>Vaccinations
<li>Initial medical exam
<li>Spaying/neutering
<li>Identification
<li>Start-up kit of pet supplies
<li>One year membership in the Arizona Humane Society<p>
</ul>

All you have to do is attend an orientation seminar and complete an application that covers the benefits and responsibilities of pet ownership.  Attending does not commit you to adopt a pet nor does it guarantee a pet will be placed for adoption.  You do not have to be an FHP member to participate.<p>

<b>Call 602-303-9488 to attend an orientation seminar close by.</b><p>

Studies have shown that pet companionship may actually improve a person's health and outlook on life.  Lowered blood pressure and a reduction in stress are among the benefits of pet ownership.<p>

<title>How FHP Demonstrates Quality of Care</title>
</head>
<body>

<a name="top"></a>
<center>
<img src="img/b_qality.gif"><br>

<hr size=1 noshade>

FHP monitors and works to improve key indicators of health care quality in our members through FHP's Quality Improvement Committee, comprised of professionals from a variety of health disciplines.  Since 1994, FHP has met and surpassed its goals for all preventive health care measures, including cervical cancer screenings, infant immunizations, coronary artery disease, and mammography.<p>

One set of health care quality indicators is called HEDIS (Healthplan Employer Data Information Data Set).  HEDIS helps employers and consumers understand the value of their health care purchases.  All HMOs, including FHP, compile a host of data to illustrate that their organizations provide both routine and preventive health care measures that adhere to industry standards and goals.  Major areas of measurement required by HEDIS include adult cholesterol screenings, infant immunizations, and mammograms for females over 35 years of age.  No such standards or goals exist in the old-style fee-for-service environment.<p>

Moreover, FHP's Quality Improvement Committee has targeted several important aspects of care to improve upon -- congestive heart failure, diabetes, pneumonia, and hip fractures.  Our belief is that if we can implement prevention programs and measures to reduce the incidence of these ailments, then we can reduce the number of people hospitalized.  This is positive for both the consumer and the health plan -- hospital stays are costly, and who wants to be in a hospital anyway!<p>

Here is how FHP in Arizona fares against national goals.<p>

<h4><b>Taking Care of Your Heart</b><br>
<I>Myra Helms, Registered Dietitian, FHP Health Care</I></h4>

With Spring in the air, our thoughts turn to matters of the heart. So love and romance can continue in your life for many years to come. Here are some important facts and tips to consider about caring for your heart:

<center><img src="img/i_tip.gif" hspace=15></center>

<ul>
<li>Exercise protects the heart. Studies show that men who exercise live 2.1 years longer than those who don't. Talk with your doctor about starting a regular exercise program
that's right for you.<p>

<li>For every one percent reduction in blood cholesterol, the risk for a heart attack can be reduced two percent.  Have your blood cholesterol checked by your doctor if you haven't
done so lately.<p>

<li>Studies show that the typical "couch potato" has a 35 to 50 percent greater risk of developing high blood pressure than someone who gets regular exercise.  If you or someone you know is an overweight "couch potato," the risk is even higher.  Do you know what your blood pressure level is?  To be safe, get your blood pressure checked at your next visit
to the doctor.<p>

<li>You can help lower your risk of developing heart disease by reducing the amount of saturated fat in your diet.  One way of doing this is to eat two meatless meals each week, such as beans and rice or spaghetti without meatballs.  Visit your local book store to find healthy diet cookbooks.<p>
</ul>

Talk to your doctor for more information about keeping your heart -- and that of your loved ones -- healthy.  Or call the
<a href="http://www.amhrt.org">American Heart Association</a> at 1-800-AHA-USA1 (between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m., weekdays except holidays).  They can answer questions on cardiovascular disease and your nearest AHA chapter.<p>

Stay healthy and fit by following seven dietary guidelines recommended by the federal  government and summarized below. Receive a full report by visiting the home page of the
<a href="http://www.usda.gov/fcs/cnpp">USDA Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion</a> or <a href="http://www.os.dhhs.gov">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services</a>.<p>

<ol><b><li>Eat a variety of foods.
<li>Balance  the food you eat with physical activity; maintain  or improve your weight.
<li>Choose a diet with more grains, vegetables, and fruits.
<li>Choose a diet low in fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol.
<li>Choose a diet moderate in sugars.
<li>Choose a diet moderate in salt and sodium.
<li>If you drink alcoholic beverages, do so in moderation.</b></ol><p>

<ul><li>Enjoy eating a variety of foods. Get the many nutrients your body needs by choosing among the varied foods you enjoy from these groups: grain products, vegetables, fruits, milk  and milk products, protein-rich plant foods (beans, nuts), and protein-rich animal foods (lean meat, poultry, fish, and eggs). Remember to choose lean and low fat foods and beverages most often. Many foods you eat contain servings from more than one food group.  For example, soups and stews may contain meat, beans, noodles, and vegetables.<p>

<li>Try to maintain your body weight by balancing what you eat with physical activity. If you are sedentary, try to become more active. If you are already very active, try to continue the same level of activity as you age. More physical activity is better than less, and any is better than none. If your weight is not in the healthy range, try to reduce health risks through better eating and exercise habits. Take steps to keep your weight within the healthy range (neither too high nor too low). Have children's heights and weights checked regularly by a health professional.<p>

<li>Eat more grain products (breads, cereals, pasta, and rice), vegetables, and fruits.  Eat dry beans, lentils, and peas more often. Increase your fiber intake by eating more of a variety of whole grains, whole-grain products, dry beans, fiber-rich vegetables and fruits such as carrots, corn, peas, pears, and berries.<p>

<li>To reduce your intake of fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol, follow these  recommendations which apply to diets consumed over several days and not to single meals or foods.
<ul>
<li>Use fats and oils sparingly.
<li>Use the Nutrition Facts Label to help you choose foods lower in fat, saturated fat,
     and cholesterol.
<li>Eat plenty of grain products, vegetables, and fruits.
<li>Choose low fat milk products, lean meats, fish, poultry, beans, and peas to get essential nutrients without substantially increasing calorie and saturated fat intakes.</ul><p>

<li>Use sugars in moderation -- sparingly if your calorie needs are low. Avoid excessive snacking, brush with a fluoride toothpaste, and floss your teeth regularly. Read the Nutrition Facts Label on foods you buy. The food label lists the content of total carbohydrate and sugars, as well as calories.<p>

<li>Fresh fruits and vegetables have very little sodium. The food groups in the Food Guide Pyramid include some foods that are high in sodium and other foods that have very little sodium or can be prepared in ways that add flavor without adding salt. Read the Nutrition Facts Label to compare and help identify foods lower in sodium within each group.  Use  herb and spices to flavor food.  Try to choose forms of foods that you frequently consume that are lower in sodium and salt.<p>

<li>If you drink alcoholic beverages, do so in moderation, with meals, and when consumption does not put you or others at risk.</ul><p>

<H3>Overview</H3>
FHP, Inc., founded in 1961, is a diversified health care services company based in Fountain Valley, California. Through its federally qualified health maintenance organization (HMO), FHP serves more than 1.7 million people in Arizona, California, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Nevada, New Mexico, Ohio, Texas, Utah, and Guam. The Company is a wholly owned subsidiary of FHP International Corporation (NASDAQ: FHPC). FHP operates several types of managed health care systems. Its staff model HMO provides health care services through salaried physicians and allied health professionals in company-owned or managed facilities. FHP operates 62 medical and dental centers, three acute care hospitals, and two skilled nursing facilities. Most members receive care through independent practice associations (IPAs), in which FHP contracts with more than 41,000 private and group practice physicians and 500 hospitals. FHP also operates ambulance services, pharmacies, laboratories, an optical lens manufacturing facility; FHP-brand over-the-counter pharmaceuticals are packaged at a pharmacy distribution center in California.

<H3>History</H3>
In 1961, Robert Gumbiner, M.D., converted his Long Beach, CA medical practice to the non-profit Family Health Program, providing prepaid health services to 2,000 patients. In the 1970s, FHP established a prepaid dental program, expanded to Guam and Utah, and became a federally qualified HMO. FHP experienced exceptional growth in the 1980s. Senior Plan was launched in 1983, making FHP the first HMO on the West Coast to contract with the federal government to provide prepaid health care services to Medicare beneficiaries. In 1985, the Arizona and New Mexico regions were founded, and the company converted to the for-profit FHP International Corporation. FHP became publicly held in 1986, and opened the FHP Hospital in Fountain Valley the same year. The company exceeded the billion-dollar revenue mark in 1991, its 30th Anniversary, and expanded into Nevada the following year. In 1993, FHP opened its hospital in South Salt Lake, Utah and expanded to Colorado. The following year, FHP expanded into Texas and acquired TakeCare, Inc., a 770,000-member HMO with operations in California, Colorado, Ohio, and Illinois. The $1.1 billion acquisition was the largest in HMO history.<p>

In 1995 <b>FHP in Arizona</b> received full accreditation from the <a href="http://www.ncqa.org">National Committee for Quality Assurance</a> (NCQA), a national organization that reviews the quality and medical management systems of HMOs and other similar prepaid health programs.<p>

FHP's health plans in <a href="losangel.htm">Los Angeles</a> and <a href="denver.htm">Denver</a> were named to the 1995 Sachs HMO Honor Roll, an elite group of only nine HMOs in the U.S. rated as superior in their markets. The Honor Roll was selected from the largest 85 health plans in 27 markets, based on an analysis of 85,000 consumers by the Sachs Group, an independent health care information firm. Survey respondents rated their satisfaction with an HMO's access, convenience, quality and general perception of value. FHP in Los Angeles and Denver were rated best in their market in all four categories. <b>FHP in Phoenix</b> was named in three out of the four categories (access, convenience, and quality).<p>

A.M. Best Company assigned an initial Best's rating of "A-" (Excellent) to FHP Health Care, <b>including FHP's Arizona Region</b>. This rating assignment reflects the company's strong presence in the commercial HMO and Medicare HMO lines of business, its good profitability, as well as the financial strength of the parent organization.<p>

The <a href="fitkids.htm">FHP Fit Kids Club</a> has won several awards for its benefit to the community, including:
<ul>
<li>1996 top ten finalist in the <a href="http://www.aahp.org">American Association of Health Plans</a>' 	Community Leadership Awards.
<li>1995 special recognition award from the national Health Education Information Center as the most 	outstanding comprehensive health education program in the U.S.
<li>1995 commendation from the City of Phoenix's Excellence in Education Commission.
<li>1995 health care advertising merit award from Healthcare Marketing Report.
<li>1994 award from the Public Relations Society of America (Valley of the Sun Chapter) as the most 	outstanding community relations program.
</ul>

In 1995 U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Donna Shalala and the
<a href="http://www.aahp.org">American Association of Health Plans</a> (AAHP) recognized twelve health plans for their successes in increasing the numbers of fully-immunized two-year-olds.  <b>FHP in Arizona received a second runner-up award in the public/private partnership category</b>.<p>

The Arizona Association of Health Maintenance Organizations (AAHMO) and The
<a href="http://www.tapii.org">Arizona Partnership for Infant Immunization</a> (TAPII) won a 1996 Partnership Award from Astra Merck and the National Managed Health Care Congress for their leadership in advancing the cause of infant immunization in Arizona.  <b>FHP is an active member of AAHMO, and two employees serve as chairpersons of TAPII committees</b>.<p>

Notes:
<ul>
<li>FHP Independent Plan is a non-federally qualified HMO plan. Rates for medical coverage only effective as of 	July 1,1995.
<li>Non-smoker means a person who has not smoked or used tobacco in any form during the past five years.  If the person starts or resumes the use of tobacco, then the non-smoker discount no longer applies.  A person may qualify as a non-smoker more quickly if they complete the <a href="smoking.htm">FHP Smoking Cessation program</a> and refrain from any use of tobacco for a period of two years.
<li>If you wish to apply, coverage will not become effective until FHP, Inc. has reviewed and approved your application and medical history, issued and delivered your contract, and your first premium has been received by FHP.<p>
</ul>

<h1>All About PALS</h1>
</center>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>

Adopting a pet can help you stay healthier and happier.  And FHP Health Care and the Arizona Humane Society have teamed up to provide <b>free pet adoptions for older adults (60 years and older) living in Maricopa County.</b>  If you're interested in owing a pet and can provide an appropriate home environment, read on to learn more about P.A.L.S. (Partnering Animals with Loving Seniors).<p>

FHP's sponsorship covers the total cost of pet adoption, including:
<ul>
<li>Vaccinations
<li>Initial medical exam
<li>Spaying/neutering
<li>Identification
<li>Start-up kit of pet supplies
<li>One year membership in the Arizona Humane Society<p>
</ul>

All you have to do is attend an orientation seminar and complete an application that covers the benefits and responsibilities of pet ownership.  Attending does not commit you to adopt a pet nor does it guarantee a pet will be placed for adoption.  You do not have to be an FHP member to participate.<p>

<b>Call 602-303-9488 to attend an orientation seminar close by.</b><p>

Studies have shown that pet companionship may actually improve a person's health and outlook on life.  Lowered blood pressure and a reduction in stress are among the benefits of pet ownership.<p>

<title>How FHP Demonstrates Quality of Care</title>

<h1>FHP Quality of Care</h1>
</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>

FHP monitors and works to improve key indicators of health care quality in our members through FHP's Quality Improvement Committee, comprised of professionals from a variety of health disciplines.  Since 1994, FHP has met and surpassed its goals for all preventive health care measures, including cervical cancer screenings, infant immunizations, coronary artery disease, and mammography.<p>

One set of health care quality indicators is called HEDIS (Healthplan Employer Data Information Data Set).  HEDIS helps employers and consumers understand the value of their health care purchases.  All HMOs, including FHP, compile a host of data to illustrate that their organizations provide both routine and preventive health care measures that adhere to industry standards and goals.  Major areas of measurement required by HEDIS include adult cholesterol screenings, infant immunizations, and mammograms for females over 35 years of age.  No such standards or goals exist in the old-style fee-for-service environment.<p>

Moreover, FHP's Quality Improvement Committee has targeted several important aspects of care to improve upon -- congestive heart failure, diabetes, pneumonia, and hip fractures.  Our belief is that if we can implement prevention programs and measures to reduce the incidence of these ailments, then we can reduce the number of people hospitalized.  This is positive for both the consumer and the health plan -- hospital stays are costly, and who wants to be in a hospital anyway!<p>

Here is how FHP in Arizona fares against national goals.<p>

Where possible, you should take further steps to improve your chances of avoiding illness and staying fit. Print this page out, circle your answers, and consult your primary care physician about what you have learned.<P>

<font size=4><b>Taking Care of Your Heart</b></font><br>
<I>Myra Helms, Registered Dietitian, FHP Health Care</I><p>

With Spring in the air, our thoughts turn to matters of the heart. So love and romance can continue in your life for many years to come. Here are some important facts and tips to consider about caring for your heart:

<ul>
<li>Exercise protects the heart. Studies show that men who exercise live 2.1 years longer than those who don't. Talk with your doctor about starting a regular exercise program
that's right for you.<p>

<li>For every one percent reduction in blood cholesterol, the risk for a heart attack can be reduced two percent.  Have your blood cholesterol checked by your doctor if you haven't
done so lately.<p>

<li>Studies show that the typical "couch potato" has a 35 to 50 percent greater risk of developing high blood pressure than someone who gets regular exercise.  If you or someone you know is an overweight "couch potato," the risk is even higher.  Do you know what your blood pressure level is?  To be safe, get your blood pressure checked at your next visit
to the doctor.<p>

<li>You can help lower your risk of developing heart disease by reducing the amount of saturated fat in your diet.  One way of doing this is to eat two meatless meals each week, such as beans and rice or spaghetti without meatballs.  Visit your local book store to find healthy diet cookbooks.<p>
</ul>

Talk to your doctor for more information about keeping your heart -- and that of your loved ones -- healthy.  Or call the
<a href="http://www.amhrt.org">American Heart Association</a> at 1-800-AHA-USA1 (between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m., weekdays except holidays).  They can answer questions on cardiovascular disease and your nearest AHA chapter.<p>

<h1>Dietary Guidelines for Better Health</h1>
<HR size=1 NOSHADE>
</center>

Stay healthy and fit by following seven dietary guidelines recommended by the federal  government and summarized below. Receive a full report by visiting the home page of the
<a href="http://www.usda.gov/fcs/cnpp">USDA Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion</a> or <a href="http://www.os.dhhs.gov">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services</a>.<p>

<ol><b><li>Eat a variety of foods.
<li>Balance  the food you eat with physical activity; maintain  or improve your weight.
<li>Choose a diet with more grains, vegetables, and fruits.
<li>Choose a diet low in fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol.
<li>Choose a diet moderate in sugars.
<li>Choose a diet moderate in salt and sodium.
<li>If you drink alcoholic beverages, do so in moderation.</b></ol><p>

<ul><li>Enjoy eating a variety of foods. Get the many nutrients your body needs by choosing among the varied foods you enjoy from these groups: grain products, vegetables, fruits, milk  and milk products, protein-rich plant foods (beans, nuts), and protein-rich animal foods (lean meat, poultry, fish, and eggs). Remember to choose lean and low fat foods and beverages most often. Many foods you eat contain servings from more than one food group.  For example, soups and stews may contain meat, beans, noodles, and vegetables.<p>

<li>Try to maintain your body weight by balancing what you eat with physical activity. If you are sedentary, try to become more active. If you are already very active, try to continue the same level of activity as you age. More physical activity is better than less, and any is better than none. If your weight is not in the healthy range, try to reduce health risks through better eating and exercise habits. Take steps to keep your weight within the healthy range (neither too high nor too low). Have children's heights and weights checked regularly by a health professional.<p>

<li>Eat more grain products (breads, cereals, pasta, and rice), vegetables, and fruits.  Eat dry beans, lentils, and peas more often. Increase your fiber intake by eating more of a variety of whole grains, whole-grain products, dry beans, fiber-rich vegetables and fruits such as carrots, corn, peas, pears, and berries.<p>

<li>To reduce your intake of fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol, follow these  recommendations which apply to diets consumed over several days and not to single meals or foods.
<ul>
<li>Use fats and oils sparingly.
<li>Use the Nutrition Facts Label to help you choose foods lower in fat, saturated fat,
     and cholesterol.
<li>Eat plenty of grain products, vegetables, and fruits.
<li>Choose low fat milk products, lean meats, fish, poultry, beans, and peas to get essential nutrients without substantially increasing calorie and saturated fat intakes.</ul><p>

<li>Use sugars in moderation -- sparingly if your calorie needs are low. Avoid excessive snacking, brush with a fluoride toothpaste, and floss your teeth regularly. Read the Nutrition Facts Label on foods you buy. The food label lists the content of total carbohydrate and sugars, as well as calories.<p>

<li>Fresh fruits and vegetables have very little sodium. The food groups in the Food Guide Pyramid include some foods that are high in sodium and other foods that have very little sodium or can be prepared in ways that add flavor without adding salt. Read the Nutrition Facts Label to compare and help identify foods lower in sodium within each group.  Use  herb and spices to flavor food.  Try to choose forms of foods that you frequently consume that are lower in sodium and salt.<p>

<li>If you drink alcoholic beverages, do so in moderation, with meals, and when consumption does not put you or others at risk.</ul><p>

<HR size=1 NOSHADE>
</center>
<H3>Overview</H3>
FHP, Inc., founded in 1961, is a diversified health care services company based in Fountain Valley, California. Through its federally qualified health maintenance organization (HMO), FHP serves more than 1.7 million people in Arizona, California, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Nevada, New Mexico, Ohio, Texas, Utah, and Guam. The Company is a wholly owned subsidiary of FHP International Corporation (NASDAQ: FHPC). FHP operates several types of managed health care systems. Its staff model HMO provides health care services through salaried physicians and allied health professionals in company-owned or managed facilities. FHP operates 62 medical and dental centers, three acute care hospitals, and two skilled nursing facilities. Most members receive care through independent practice associations (IPAs), in which FHP contracts with more than 41,000 private and group practice physicians and 500 hospitals. FHP also operates ambulance services, pharmacies, laboratories, an optical lens 
manufacturing facility; FHP-brand over-the-counter pharmaceuticals are packaged at a pharmacy distribution center in California.<p>

<H3>History</H3>
In 1961, Robert Gumbiner, M.D., converted his Long Beach, CA medical practice to the non-profit Family Health Program, providing prepaid health services to 2,000 patients. In the 1970s, FHP established a prepaid dental program, expanded to Guam and Utah, and became a federally qualified HMO. FHP experienced exceptional growth in the 1980s. Senior Plan was launched in 1983, making FHP the first HMO on the West Coast to contract with the federal government to provide prepaid health care services to Medicare beneficiaries. In 1985, the Arizona and New Mexico regions were founded, and the company converted to the
for-profit FHP International Corporation. FHP became publicly held in 1986, and opened the FHP Hospital in Fountain Valley the same year. The company exceeded the billion-dollar revenue mark in 1991, its 30th Anniversary, and expanded into Nevada the following year. In 1993, FHP opened its hospital in South Salt Lake, Utah and expanded to Colorado. The following year, FHP expanded into Texas and acquired TakeCare, Inc., a 770,000-member HMO with operations in California, Colorado, Ohio, and Illinois. The $1.1 billion acquisition was the largest in HMO history.<p>

<h1>Honors and Accolades</h1>
</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>

In 1995 <b>FHP in Arizona</b> received full accreditation from the <a href="http://www.ncqa.org">National Committee for Quality Assurance</a> (NCQA), a national organization that reviews the quality and medical management systems of HMOs and other similar prepaid health programs.<p>

FHP's health plans in <a href="losangel.htm">Los Angeles</a> and <a href="denver.htm">Denver</a> were named to the 1995 Sachs HMO Honor Roll, an elite group of only nine HMOs in the U.S. rated as superior in their markets. The Honor Roll was selected from the largest 85 health plans in 27 markets, based on an analysis of 85,000 consumers by the Sachs Group, an independent health care information firm. Survey respondents rated their satisfaction with an HMO's access, convenience, quality and general perception of value. FHP in Los Angeles and Denver were rated best in their market in all four categories. <b>FHP in Phoenix</b> was named in three out of the four categories (access, convenience, and quality).<p>

A.M. Best Company assigned an initial Best's rating of "A-" (Excellent) to FHP Health Care, <b>including FHP's Arizona Region</b>. This rating assignment reflects the company's strong presence in the commercial HMO and Medicare HMO lines of business, its good profitability, as well as the financial strength of the parent organization.<p>

The <a href="fitkids.htm">FHP Fit Kids Club</a> has won several awards for its benefit to the community, including:
<ul>
<li>1996 top ten finalist in the <a href="http://www.aahp.org">American Association of Health Plans</a>' 	Community Leadership Awards.
<li>1995 special recognition award from the national Health Education Information Center as the most 	outstanding comprehensive health education program in the U.S.
<li>1995 commendation from the City of Phoenix's Excellence in Education Commission.
<li>1995 health care advertising merit award from Healthcare Marketing Report.
<li>1994 award from the Public Relations Society of America (Valley of the Sun Chapter) as the most 	outstanding community relations program.
</ul>

In 1995 U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Donna Shalala and the
<a href="http://www.aahp.org">American Association of Health Plans</a> (AAHP) recognized twelve health plans for their successes in increasing the numbers of fully-immunized two-year-olds.  <b>FHP in Arizona received a second runner-up award in the public/private partnership category</b>.<p>

The Arizona Association of Health Maintenance Organizations (AAHMO) and The
<a href="http://www.tapii.org">Arizona Partnership for Infant Immunization</a> (TAPII) won a 1996 Partnership Award from Astra Merck and the National Managed Health Care Congress for their leadership in advancing the cause of infant immunization in Arizona.  <b>FHP is an active member of AAHMO, and two employees serve as chairpersons of TAPII committees</b>.<p>

<p>Stuffee is the honorary head of the FHP Fit Kids Club. Stuffee is soft and cute and cuddly.
Oh yes, and six feet tall.<p>

Designed by Jo Winger of the Pittsburgh Children's Museum, Stuffee is the center
of many FHP Fit Kids Club activities. When school groups tour FHP facilities, Stuffee can be
there to greet them. When they call the FHP Fit Kids Club hotline, they hear Stuffee give them important health tips. And when Health Awareness Lesson instructors come to their school,
Stuffee teaches kids some basic things about how their body works.<p>

That's because Stuffee has a heart. And a gall bladder, large and small intestines, liver,
lungs, pancreas, stomach, and esophagus too. All the vital organs kids need to know about --
in colorful, touchable cloth.<p>

<font size=6 color="#4A5A94"><b>Facts About AIDS</b></font>
</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>

<b>Q. What is AIDS?</b><br>
<b>A.</b> AIDS stands for Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome which is an illness that impairs the body's ability to fight infection.<p>

<b>Q. What causes AIDS?</b><br>
<b>A.</b> A virus called HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus).<p>

<hr width=400 align=left size=4>
<font size=4><b>HOW IS HIV SPREAD?</b></font>
<ul>
<li>Unprotected sexual intercourse with an infected person.
<li>Sharing an infected hypodermic needle or syringe.
<li>An infected mother to her baby before, during or after birth.
<li>Blood or blood products (this is very unlikely).
</ul>

HIV is <i>not</i> spread through the air, or through non-sexual everyday activities, such as:
<ul>
<li>Touching or shaking hands.
<li>Sharing food, plates, cups or utensils.
<li>Using rest rooms, water coolers or telephones.
<li>Donating blood.
<li>Swimming in a pool or using a hot tub.
<li>Being bitten by mosquitoes or any other insects.
</ul><hr width=400 align=left size=4><p>

<b>Q.	What steps can I take to reduce the chances of becoming HIV infected.</b><br>
<b>A.</b> Reduce your chances of becoming HIV infected:
<ul>
<li>Do not have sex.	
<li>Have sex with only one partner who is not infected and who doesn't use IV drugs.
<li>Don't shoot drugs of any kind. If you do use illegal drugs, never share a needle or syringe.
<li>Use a latex condom with nonoxynol-9 spermicide if you decide to have sex with anyone other than your 	partner.
<li>Only use a water-based product like K-Y Jelly if you use a lubricant with condoms. Petroleum or oil based products can break down the condoms latex.
<li>Don't mix alcohol or other drugs with sex. Alcohol and drugs can lower inhibitions and affect your 	judgment. This can put you in a high risk situation for HIV infection.
</ul>

<font size=5 color="#4A5A94"><b>Preventing Teenage Alcohol & Other Drug Use</b></font>
</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>

<h3>Prevention</h3>

The exposure to alcohol and drugs is widespread in today's society.  Even when parents teach their children not to use alcohol and drugs, other voices come along to encourage use of these harmful substances. Movies, television, music, and magazines glorify their use and mislead many into an unhealthful lifestyle.<p>

Prevention ensures that people do not develop problems in the first place.  Beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors must be directed toward a lifestyle that discourages alcohol and drug use.<p>

There are three major ways to become involved in prevention programs:<br>
1) as a parent; 2) as a citizen; and 3) as a friend.<p>

<h3>As a Parent</h3>

Our biggest hope of prevention lies with efforts directed at our young people.  Parents can raise their children to make sound decisions about alcohol and drug use. The following suggestions may help you as a parent:<p>
<hr width=400 align=left size=4>
<ul>
<li>Set an example in your own use of alcohol, prescription, and over-the-counter drugs-- avoid the use of 	illegal drugs.
<li>Supervise parties-- do not allow alcohol or drugs during social activities.
<li>Encourage other parents and those who supervise your children to provide a consistent message of no alcohol 	or other drug use.
<li>Teach your children that saying "NO" is O.K.
</ul><hr width=400 align=left size=4>

<h3>As a Citizen</h3>

Help your community stress the benefits of a life free of alcohol and other drugs.  Look to reduce the ability to get alcohol and other drugs in your community.  For example, support school, sports league, and law enforcement policies regarding the use of alcohol and other drugs by youth.  Endorse a prevention/education program for staff and students in grades K-12.<p>

<h3>As a Friend</h3>

If your friend has a substance abuse problem, do not look the other way.  Discuss with your friend the dangerous effects of alcohol or drug abuse.  Encourage your friend to seek professional help.<p>

<b>Resources</b><br>
<font size=2><i>Yellow Pages</i> -- Look under "Alcoholism", "Drug Abuse and Addiction", "Family Counselors", or "Mental Health Services" for the nearest drug treatment or mental health facility.<p>

<i>The National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence, Inc.</i> -- For referrals to treatment services in your area, write the national headquarters at 12 West 21st Street, New York, NY 10010; or call (800) NCA-CALL.<p>

<i>Alcoholics Anonymous</i> -- Write to the national office at P.O. Box 459, Grand Central Station, New York, NY 10163; or call a local chapter.<p>

<i>Student Assistance Program</i> -- Inquire through school district.<p>

<i>Employee Assistance Program</i> -- Inquire through employer.</font><p>

<title>FHP Health & Wellness Library: Ankle Sprains and Strains</title>
</head>
<body>

<a name="top"></a>
<center>
<font size=6 color="#4A5A94"><b>Ankle Sprains and Strains</b></font>
</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>

Ligaments help connect the bones to joints and provide stability during action. When the ankle is twisted severely, the ligament or the bone may give way. If the ligaments are injured, they may be stretched or "strained." If they are partially torn, this is called a "sprain." Most strains and sprains are caused by over use.<p>

<hr width=400 align=left size=4>
<font size=4><b>Symptoms:</b></font><br>
The typical ankle sprain swells either around the bony bump on the outside of the ankle or about two inches in front of and below it. This type of sprain does not need prolonged rest, casting or x-rays.  Pain and some bruising usually occur. Any standing on the ankle may be difficult during the first few days.
<hr width=400 align=left size=4>

<h3>Treatment:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Sprains and strains are best treated by keeping the injured area free of movement.  This can be done by using a elastic bandage, splint, gelatin boot or a plaster cast.  If a ligament or tendon is completely torn, you may need surgery.
<li>Rest the ankle and keep it elevated.  You may need crutches to help you walk.
<li>Wrap ice in a towel and apply it to the ankle for at least thirty minutes, preferably longer.
<li>Heat may be applied 24 hours after the injury.
<li>If medicine is prescribed, follow the directions exactly.
<li>Eat a healthy, well balanced diet.  Injuries heal best when the diet includes proteins such as meat, fish, 	low-fat dairy products and dried beans.
<li>Call your doctor if severe pain continues for more than 24 hours, or if bleeding occurs.
</ul>

<h3>What Is Asthma?</h3>

Asthma is a lung disease that causes breathing problems.  The small airways in the lungs become narrow making it difficult to breathe.  This reaction in the lungs causes an asthma attack that may range from mild to life-threatening.  Although asthma cannot be cured, it can be controlled.<p>

<h3>Symptoms</h3>

Asthma symptoms include:
<ul>
<li>Coughing during or after exercise
<li>Shortness of breath
<li>Wheezing sound when breathing
<li>Tightness in the chest
</ul>

<h3>Triggers</h3>

Asthma symptoms get started or "triggered" by something that bothers the lungs.  Younger people are often affected by allergens, such as plant pollen, while older people are most affected by non-allergic types of irritants, such as smog.  You should identify and avoid as much as possible, those triggers that bring on an asthma attack.<p>

Common asthma triggers include:
<ul>
<li>Allergens (pollens, animals, some foods, house dust)
<li>Vigorous exercise
<li>Infections (flu, colds)
<li>Cold air, hot air, sudden temperature changes
<li>Household products (paints, cleaners, sprays)
<li>Emotional stress & excitement
<li>Occupational dusts & vapors (plastics, grains, metal, wood)
<li>Drugs (aspirin, heart medicines)
<li>Air pollution (cigarette smoke, auto exhaust)
</ul>

<h3>How To Control Your Asthma</h3>

Control your asthma by following three recommendations:
<ol>
<li><i>See A Doctor Regularly About Your Asthma</i> -- Your doctor can help monitor your progress and prescribe the proper treatment to control your asthma.<p>
	
<li><i>Find Out What Triggers Your Asthma And What To Do About Them</i> -- When you know what triggers your asthma, you are then in a position to take action.  For example:
<ul>
<li>Receive allergy shots to reduce your sensitivity to allergens or a yearly flu shots to minimize the risk of 	respiratory infection.
<li>Avoid sudden temperature changes (when you go in and out of air-conditioned stores in the summer).
<li>Don't smoke or stay in a room with people who do.
<li>Avoid exerting yourself, laughing too hard, or any emotionally upsetting situation.
<li>Keep dust in your home to a minimum.  Regularly clean furniture, draperies, and rugs (especially in the 	bedroom).
<li>Avoid any other known irritant (chemicals, medicines, perfumes, spray products, foods, pets, air 	pollution).<p>
</ul>

<li><i>Take Your Asthma Medicines As Your Doctor Has Prescribed</i> -- Two groups of asthma medicines can help control your asthma:<p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Bronchodilators</i> -- <b>Stops</b> asthma attacks after they have started.
<dd><i>Anti-inflammatories</i> -- <b>Prevents</b> asthma attacks from starting.
</dl></ol>
Drink plenty of fluids (6-8 glasses daily) and take all prescribed medications exactly as directed.<p>

<title>FHP Health & Wellness Library: Blood Glucose Monitoring</title>
</head>
<body>

<a name="top"></a>
<center>
<font size=6 color="#4A5A94"><b>Blood Glucose Monitoring</b></font>
</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>

Blood glucose monitoring can help you better control your blood sugar (glucose) level.<p>

<h3>EQUIPMENT:</h3>

The equipment needed depends on the way you test for blood glucose.  The equipment you need may include:
<ul>
<li>Lancet (finger sticker),
<li>Test (reagent) strips,
<li>Watch or clock that shows seconds,
<li>Cotton (optional for some brands),
<li>Alcohol (optional),
<li>Automatic lancet device (optional)
<li>Blood glucose (reflectance) meter (optional),
<li>Log book,
<li>Soap, water, and towel.
</ul>

<h3>STEPS:</h3>

Gather all of your equipment and read the directions carefully as each brand may have different directions. Be aware of the dates on the test strip container. Out-of-date or discolored strips should be thrown away.  You can protect the test strips from light, moisture and heat by keeping the container closed when not in use. You will need one test strip from the container. Do not cut strips in half unless your nurse or doctor has given you approval.<p>

<h3>OBTAINING A DROP OF BLOOD:</h3>
<ol>
<li>The ear lobes and sides of the finger tips (not the pads) are sites that can be used to obtain a drop of 	blood.  Change the sites regularly.
<li>Wash the site with soap and warm water.  Dry the site completely.
	<ul><li>Warm water increases blood flow.
	<li>Careful drying keeps the test accurate.
	<li>Wipe the site with alcohol only if you have been instructed to do so by your nurse or doctor.
	</ul>
<li>Twist off the cap on the lancet.  Do not touch the sterile point.
<li>If using an automatic lancet device, insert the lancet following your brand's directions.
	<ul><li>You can use alcohol to wipe the part of the device that touches the skin.
	<li>Firmly hold the device against the site.
	</ul>
<li>Puncture the skin.
<li>Gently massage the site to get a large drop of blood.
	<ul><li>The drop of blood should hang from the finger (or ear lobe).
	<li>The drop of blood must be big enough to cover all of the test pad. Note:  If you do not get a large 	enough drop of blood, repeat steps 2 to 6.  Hang your arm at your side for about 30 seconds to increase 	blood flow to a finger site.
	</ul>
</ol>

<h3>PERFORMING THE TEST:</h3>
Follow the directions on your brand for these steps.
<ol>
<li>Hold the test strip level and touch the blood drop to the pad.
	<ul><li>The blood must cover all of the pad.
	<li>Some brands do not allow you to smear blood on the pad.
	</ul>
<li>Start timing as soon as the blood touches the test pad.  The right timing is important.
<li>Wipe or blot off the test strip.
<li>Wait the amount of time prescribed in the directions to finish the test.
<li>CHOOSE VISUAL OR METER METHOD NEXT.
</ol>

<table border=1 cellpadding=5>
<tr><th width=50%>Visual Method</th><th>Meter Method</th></tr>

<tr><td>When timing is done, match the color of your test strip to the color scale on the container.</td>
<td>When timing is done, put the test strip into the meter.</td></tr>

<tr><td>1. The color that matches is your blood glucose (sugar) reading.</td>
<td>1. Follow your brand's directions.<br></td></tr>

<tr><td rowspan=2>2. If the color of your test strip falls between two colors, the blood glucose is read as the range between the two numbers (for example, between 80 and 120).<br></td>
<td>2. The number that is shown is the blood glucose (sugar) reading.</td></tr>

<tr><td>3. Some meters may need to be calibrated before use.</td></tr>
</table>

<h3>AFTER THE TEST:</h3>

Put the cap back on the lancet before throwing it out.  Use the lancet only one time.<p>

Write your blood glucose reading, date, and time in your log book.  Your nurse or doctor may tell you to write other things about your diet, exercise, and medication in your log book.  Then look at any directions your nurse or doctor has given you about adjusting your medication, diet, or exercise.  Discuss questions with your nurse or doctor.<p>

Your nurse or doctor may direct you to save your test strips.  They can be saved in a closed container for a few days.  Remember to write the date and time of the test on each strip.<p>

<h3>CARE OF EQUIPMENT:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Store all equipment in a clean, dry place.
<li>Wipe off any blood before storing the equipment.  Use a damp, clean cloth or an alcohol wipe.

<center>
<font size=6 color="#4A5A94"><b>Breathing Easier Using Your Diaphragm</b></font>
</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>

<b>What is diaphragmatic breathing?</b><p>

Diaphragmatic breathing is the most efficient way to breathe.  This is done by keeping your upper chest and shoulders still while you diaphragm and abdominal muscles do the work.<p>

<b>What are the benefits of diaphragmatic breathing?</b><p>

Daily diaphragmatic breathing can help your lungs work more efficiently and make breathing easier.  This also allows more air into your lungs.<p>

Incorrect or chest breathing takes more energy and can cause you to tire easily.<p>

<hr width=400 align=left size=4>
<font size=4><b>Tips for diaphragmatic breathing:</b></font>
<ul>
<li>Sit up in a chair or lying down with your head supported and knees bent.
<li>Put one hand on the center of your stomach and your other hand on your upper chest.
<li>Breathe in through your nose and gently push your stomach out.
<li>Slowly exhale air out through your mouth while gently pushing inward and upward with the hand on your 	stomach.  While exhaling, put your lips together as if playing a trumpet.  Try to prolong exhalation to 	twice the length of inhalation.
<li>Practice this as many times as you can throughout the day.  The best time is when you have a breathing 	treatment.
<li>With enough practice you can make diaphragmatic breathing your natural breathing pattern.

</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>

Caffeine is a stimulant that energizes your brain and body by triggering the release of chemicals into your bloodstream.<p>

More than 250-300mg of caffeine can over stimulate your nervous system and ill effects can occur that are called "coffee nerves".<p>

<h3>Symptoms of too much caffeine</h3>

Your reaction to caffeine depends on the amount that you are accustomed to and, also, on your body weight, physical condition and anxiety levels in general.  Some symptoms of "coffee nerves" include increased heart rate, nervousness, lack of sleep, irritability, muscle tension, headache, trembling, confusion, diarrhea and frequent urination.<p>

<h3>Treatment:</h3>

Abruptly cutting out caffeine may lead to a period of headache and fatigue or other withdrawal symptoms such as anxiety, depression, nausea, vomiting, muscle pain, or stiffness.  You can avoid this discomfort by tapering off caffeine gradually, by using the following guidelines.<p>

<h3>Caffeine Reduction Guidelines:</h3>

Start out on day 1 by mixing a little decaffeinated coffee with your regular coffee.  You can also do this with tea or soda.  Then every 4 to 5 days, use more decaffeinated and less regular, according to the chart below, until by the last day you've successfully switched to only decaffeinated.<p>
<pre>       <font size=4><b>Days     Decaffeinated       Regular</b>
      1-5       cup                cup
      6-9       cup                cup
      10-13     cup                cup
      14+      all decaffeinated</font></pre>

When cutting down your caffeine intake, increase the amount of water you drink.<p>

<font size=6 color="#4A5A94"><b>Cervical Syndrome</b></font> <font size=4>(Cervial Sprain)</font>
</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>

Cervical sprain is a state of abnormal bone structure in the neck.  This condition may be very painful.

<h3>What causes cervical sprain?</h3>

A sprain in the neck can be caused by faulty posture, poor sleeping positions, osteoarthritis in the neck, sport injuries and auto accidents. Irritation, injury, or pressing of the nerves in the neck may cause pain, numbness, tingling and weakness in the arm or hand.

<h3>How is cervical sprain treated?</h3>

<b>Activity:</b> The amount of activity you may engage in will vary a great deal according to the degree of your symptoms. During the severe stage, resting as much as you can will help.  Later you should be as active as your strength will allow.<p>

<b>Diet:</b> Eat a well-rounded diet with enough proteins (meat, fish, cheese) so that your body will have "building blocks" to repair injured tissues.<p>

<h3>Physicial Measures:</h3>

<b>Moist Heat:</b> Take hot showers and let the water beat on the neck and shoulders for 10 to 20 minutes twice a day. Between showers apply hot soaks to the neck (hot towels or cloths wrung out in hot water) or use a heat lamp for 10 to 15 minutes at a time, several times a day.<p>

<b>Posture:</b> Try to improve your posture. Make it a point to pull in your chin and stomach in both sitting and standing poses. When sitting, use a firm chair and force your buttocks to touch the back of the chair.<p>

<b>Sleeping:</b>  Sleep without a pillow, but use instead a cervical pillow or a small towel rolled to 2 inches in width and place it under your neck.<p>

If there are symptoms of nerve root pressure (symptoms extending in the hand or arm), your doctor will give specific instructions.<p>

<h3>Medications:</h3>

Your medications must be fitted to your own particular needs.  Do not take any medicine without telling your doctor.  If medicines are prescribed, be careful to follow the instructions on the label.<p>

<hr width=400 align=left size=4>
<i>Important!</i><br>
Call your doctor if any of the following happens:
<ul>
<li>Pain, numbness, tingling, or weakness develops in arm or face
<li>You develop side effects from prescribed medicine
</ul>

<font size=6 color="#4A5A94"><b>Exercises for Cervical Strain</b></font>
</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>

<h3>General Instructions:</h3>

Stretching exercises are an important part of treatment to relieve discomfort in your neck. They help restore motion and relieve pain from the stiffness. Follow the exercise routine prescribed by your doctor.<p>

The following exercises are more effective when performed in the shower, after a shower or following application of hot, moist towels.  Moist heat relieves pain by increasing blood flow to the muscles of your neck.<p>

Gradually increase the number of times you repeat each exercise as your condition improves, but stop when tired.  They may be done several times during the day, to help relax and relieve tension of the neck and shoulder muscles.<p>

<h3>Exercises:</h3>

Stand under a hot shower for five to ten minutes and perform the following exercises, twice daily if possible.
<ol>
<li>Stand erect. Turn head slowly as far as possible to the right. Return to normal center position and relax. Turn head slowly as far as possible to the left. Return to normal center position and relax.<p>
<li>Stand erect. Try to touch your chin to your chest, slowly. Raise head backwards, looking up at ceiling slowly.<p>
<li>Stand erect. Try to touch left ear to the left shoulder. Return to normal center position and relax. Try to touch right ear to	the right shoulder. Return to normal center position and relax.<p>
<li>Stand erect. Raise both shoulders as close to the ears as possible and hold as you count to five. Relax.	Stretch your shoulders backward as far as possible and hold, then relax.<p>
<li>Stand erect. With one hand grasp the thumb of the other hand behind the back, then  pull downward towards the floor. Take a deep breath, stand on toes, and look at the ceiling while exerting the downward pull. Hold momentarily, then exhale slowly and relax. Repeat ten times every 1-2 hours during the day.<p>
<b>Perform these exercises twice daily, preferably after a hot shower.</b><p>
<li>Lie on back, knees flexed, with a small pillow under your neck. Take a deep breath slowly, fully expanding 	chest, then exhale slowly. Repeat ten times.<p>

</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>

<h3>What is cholesterol?</h3>

Cholesterol is a fatty substance that your body makes and uses.  It can be found in your blood and is in all body cells.<p>

Cholesterol is also found in animals.  Foods from animals, like meats, milk, eggs, fish, and poultry give us dietary cholesterol.  Eating too much dietary cholesterol can be unhealthy.<p>

<h3>Why is too much cholesterol harmful?</h3>

Too much cholesterol in your blood is a major cause of fatty deposit build-up along the inside of the blood vessels.  This build-up (atherosclerosis) puts you at risk for heart disease and stroke.<p>

When a vessel to the heart is clogged, less blood can flow to the heart.  This damages your heart and you may feel pain in your chest (angina).  If part of your heart gets no blood supply, your heart is permanently damaged and you may have a HEART ATTACK.  When a vessel to the brain is clogged, less blood can flow to the brain and possibly cause a STROKE.<p>

<h3>What is HDL and LDL?</h3>

HDL and LDL are two kinds of cholesterol.  HDL (high-density-lipoprotein) removes the excess cholesterol from the walls of your blood vessels to the liver and then out of your body.  HDL is often called the "good" cholesterol.<p>

LDL (low-density-lipoprotein) carries and leaves cholesterol on the walls of your blood vessels.  LDL is often called the "bad" cholesterol.<p>

<h3>How is cholesterol measured?</h3>

Cholesterol is measured by a simple blood test.  The National Cholesterol Education Program recommends that all adults have their blood tested every few years and actively try to keep their cholesterol at normal levels.<p>

<h3>What does my cholesterol test result mean?</h3>

Having a high amount of cholesterol in your blood can indicate your risk for heart disease.  Your individual risk depends on many other factors like, heredity, age, other medical conditions, your diet, stress level, lack of exercise, being a smoker.<p>

Your cholesterol level is measured milligrams per deciliter (mg/dl).  Three general risk categories are:
<pre>     Normal                         200 mg/dl or less
     High normal/borderline risk    200 to 239 mg/dl
     Definite risk                  240 mg/dl and above</pre>

<h3>Should I lower my cholesterol level?</h3>

Your risk of getting heart and blood vessel disease depends not only on your cholesterol level but on your other risk factors.<p>

Your doctor can determine your overall "risk profile" and whether you should try to lower your cholesterol, and by how much.<p>

A low-fat, low-cholesterol diet can do the job for most people at moderate risk; those with high cholesterol levels may need medication and dietary changes in order to lower their cholesterol.<p>

It is estimated that lowering blood cholesterol 1% can reduce the risk of heart disease by 2%.<p>

<h3>What is a cholesterol-lowering diet?</h3>

Food choices that are low in fat, especially saturated fats and low in cholesterol.  It is a modification of what you normally may eat.

<h3>What is saturated fat?</h3>

Saturated fats are usually found in foods of animal origin (eggs, meat, lard, butter, cream, milk, etc.).  Some vegetable fats (palm, coconut oils), chocolate, most shortenings, some margarines and many dairy substitutes also contain saturated fats.  They're usually hard at room temperature.

<h3>What are polyunsaturated oils?</h3>

Vegetable oils (safflower, sunflower, and corn are best, followed by soybean and cottonseed).  Some margarines (liquid and tub varieties are best).

<h3>Which foods have cholesterol?</h3>

Only foods of animal origin contain cholesterol, like meats, fish, poultry, dairy products and egg yolks.

<h3>How do I change my diet?</h3>

See your physician for advice before making major changes in your diet.  Learn what foods are lower in saturated fats and/or cholesterol and chose to eat them at meals.  Be aware of hidden fats when buying foods.  Prepare foods the low-fat way and make wise choices when eating out.<p>

<h3>What are some examples of low-fat, low-cholesterol foods?</h3>
<ul>
<li>FISH, including "white-fish", haddock, swordfish, halibut, trout, tuna, salmon.
<li>LOW-FAT DAIRY PRODUCTS, including nonfat milk, uncreamed cottage cheese, skim-milk cheeses (ricotta, 	mozzarella, gouda), and skim-milk yogurt.
<li>LEAN POULTRY, such as chicken, turkey, or rock cornish hen.
<li>LEAN MEATS, like veal, extra lean cuts of beef, lamb or pork.
<li>All FRUITS, VEGETABLES, GRAINS, HERBS and SPICES.
</ul>

<h3>What are the diet recommendations for cholesterol, and fat?</h3>

The American Heart Association has developed a "heart-smart" diet which has been endorsed by the National Cholesterol Education Program.  They recommend the following for all adults:
<ul>
<li>Cholesterol: no more than 300 mg/dl per day
<li>Total fat: no more than 30% of day's total calories
<li>Saturated fat: no more than 10% of day's total calories
<li>Polyunsaturated: no more than 10% of day's total calories
</ul>

<h3>Are there other things I should do to protect my health?</h3>

Yes.  Maintain proper weight.  Exercise regularly to keep heart and lungs strong.  Don't smoke.  Limit alcohol use, no more than 2 drinks per day.  Have regular physical exams.  It is recommended that persons age 20 or older have their blood cholesterol level checked at least once every 5 years.<p>

<font size=6 color="#4A5A94"><b>HDL's and Your Heart</b></font>
</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>

HDL (high density lipoprotein) cholesterol is considered "good" cholesterol.  It is good because it helps to get rid of LDL (low density lipoprotein), or "bad" cholesterol that deposits on the inside walls of the arteries.  HDL carry the LDL away from the arteries to the liver where the body can eliminate it.<p>

Most people know that high levels of the bad cholesterol (LDL) increase the risk of having a heart attack.  Having too little HDL can also increase the risk.  If your HDL level is below 35 mg/dl, it could it be dangerous.<p>

<hr width=400 align=left size=4>
<font size=4><b>TO RAISE HDL</b></font><p>
Fortunately, you can raise HDL by making some lifestyle changes:
<ul>
<li><i>Diet</i> - Reduce fat intake.  Especially avoid foods high in saturated fat  (such as butter, coconut oil, 	lard, palm oil).
<li><i>Weight Control</i> - Maintain your ideal body weight through proper diet and exercise.
<li><i>Exercise</i> - Get regular exercise such as walking, biking or swimming.
<li><i>Stop Smoking</i> - Not only will it improve HDL levels but it also is an important factor in improving your 	health.
</ul>
<hr width=400 align=left size=4><br>

Some people may require medications in addition to these changes in medications. Talk to your doctor.<p>

<center>
<font size=6 color="#4A5A94"><b>Common Colds</b></font>
</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>

The common cold is caused by a virus.  Colds are not serious and usually pass after 7 to 14 days.  However, complications such as sinusitis, ear infection, bronchitis, and pneumonia can occur.  Children and older adults are at the highest risk for complications.<p>

Colds are spread by close contact with a person who is coughing or sneezing.  The most common way to catch a cold is by shaking hands or touching something the person has touched and then touching your mouth, nose, or eyes.<p>

<hr width=400 align=left size=4>
<font size=4><b>SYMPTOMS:</b></font><p>
Symptoms of a cold include:  coughing, chills, a runny nose, red and watery eyes, sore throat and an achy body.

<h3>PREVENTION:</h3>
Increase your resistance to colds by taking care of yourself:  eat right, exercise regularly and get enough sleep at night.  Decrease your exposure to cold viruses by keeping your distance from people that have colds and washing your hands often.

<h3>TREATMENT:</h3>
The best treatment for a cold is plenty of rest and drinking lots of fluids.  Over the counter medications such as acetaminophen, nose drops, cough medicines, and throat lozenges may help to relieve symptoms.  There is no medication that can cure a cold.  Antibiotics are sometimes given to cure secondary infections.
<hr width=400 align=left size=4>

<h3>CALL YOUR DOCTOR IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING HAPPEN:</h3>
<ul>
<li>A temperature over 101 for more than 24 hours
<li>Bloody discharge from nose or mouth
<li>Chest pain or shortness of breath

Cold sores, or fever blisters, are blisters that appear around the mouth area caused by the herpes virus type I.  Cold sores are common and reoccur anytime.  Usually an outbreak may last 5 to 10 days and are very contagious when the blisters are present.<p>

Cold sores form into red blisters, clustered together and may include painful, itchy and tingling feelings. These blisters fill up with fluid during the infection which later dries up and then disappear. <p>

Presently, there is no cure, drug or vaccine to prevent the herpes virus.<p>

Recurrence of cold sores may be caused by:
<ul>
<li>Illness
<li>Trauma
<li>Stress
<li>Colds
<li>Fever
<li>Prolonged sun exposure
</ul>

<h3>Prevention:</h3>

Since cold sores are contagious, AVOID:
<ul>
<li>Sharing drinking glasses and eating utensils
<li>Kissing anyone
<li>Other physical contact
</ul>

<h3>Treatment:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Let the infection run its course - it will soon heal itself
<li>Reducing anxiety or stress during the outbreaks
<li>Washing your hands often to avoid further infection and spreading the virus
<li>Blistex&reg; or Campho-Phenique&reg; may soothe the pain 
<li>Antibiotic ointment
</ul>

<h3>Call You Doctor If:</h3>
<ul>
<li>You're unsure of the infection
<li>Cold sore lasts more than 2 weeks
<li>You have a fever, headache, and muscle aches
</ul>

<h3>What is spastic colitis?</h3>

Spastic colitis is a common disorder of the large intestine.  It is characterized by pain in the lower abdomen and irregular bowel habits that include either diarrhea or constipation.

<h3>What causes spastic colitis?</h3>

There are many causes of this illness, including emotional problems, poor bowel habits, rapid and irregular eating, abuse of enemas or laxatives, food allergies, infections, and sometimes medications, especially antibiotics.  This illness can not be spread to others, is not inherited, and is not a sign of cancer.

<h3>How is spastic colitis treated?</h3>

<b><i>Activity:</i></b>  Stay active.  Get your body into a state of good shape by exercising daily.<p>

<b><i>Diet:</i></b> Eat a balanced diet.  Increase your intake of fiber or roughage.  Avoid only those foods which you have found to cause trouble in the past.

<h3>Lifestyle Guidelines:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Avoid smoking
<li>Avoid using large amounts of alcohol and abstain from using any drugs
<li>Maintain or reach ideal weight
<li>Confront and resolve conflict in your life

</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>

Constipation is the passage of hard, dry stools. If you pass soft stools you are not constipated regardless of how irregular you might be. The need for a bowel movement every day is a misconception. Some people have bowel movements only once or twice a week. As long as the stools are soft, this is perfectly normal.<p>

The most common cause of constipation is not going to the bathroom when your body signals you to go. After "holding it" for awhile, the urge goes away. The large intestine then draws water from the stools and they become dry and hard to pass.<p>

<hr width=400 align=left size=4>
<font size=4><b>PREVENTION:</b></font><br>
Diet and regular exercise are important in preventing constipation. Increase fiber in your diet by eating more fresh fruits and vegetables and whole grain breads and cereals. Drink plenty of liquids, especially water and juices. Also increase your physicial activity. Take the time to go to the bathroom when you have the urge.<p>

<font size=4><b>TREATMENT:</b></font><br>
Increase fruits, fruit juices and water. Set aside unhurried time for bowel movements. Avoid laxatives if possible. Use a stool softener or very mild laxative if necessary or ask your doctor about taking an enema.
<hr width=400 align=left size=4><p>

<h3>CALL YOUR DOCTOR IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING HAPPEN:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Blood in the stools.
<li>If constipation and other changes in bowel movements occur and are persistent.
</ul>

</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>

If you have diabetes, your body cannot use the food that you eat in the proper way.  Normally, when a person eats, the food is broken down into blood glucose (blood sugar).  This glucose (sugar) is carried to all the cells of the body for fuel.  Insulin, a hormone made in the pancreas, acts as a "key" to let the glucose into the cells.<p>

In people with diabetes, the body does not make enough insulin or does not use the insulin properly.  The result is that the digested food, or glucose, builds up in the blood.  The cells cannot get the energy that they need, because the insulin is not there to let the glucose into the cells.<p>

Treatment of diabetes involves three things:  food, exercise, and medication. Food raises the blood glucose levels, exercise and medication lower blood glucose. Medication may include insulin or oral medication, which helps make any existing insulin more effective. The diet given to people with diabetes is used to help manage blood sugar levels and body weight; it is based on the Food Guide Pyramid, and follows the same dietary recommendations as those people without diabetes. With some practice at meal planning, you can eat the same foods as the rest of your family, so special "dietetic" foods are not necessary.<p>

The Exchange System is the name given to the diet for people with diabetes. An exchange is another name for a serving of food. There are six exchange lists to help make your meal plan work. Each list contains foods that are similar in nutrient content. Using the exchange lists and following your meal plan will give you a variety of food choices, and will help control the amount of food that you eat each day. This balance of food, along with exercise and medication (if necessary) are what give you good blood glucose control.<p>

The food that you eat is made up of three components:  carbohydrates, proteins, and fat.  These are the components that are controlled in a diabetic diet.<p>

Carbohydrates are both simple sugars and starchy foods.  Simple sugars are foods like table sugar, jelly, honey, and sweets, and should be limited as they are most likely to raise blood glucose levels. Breads, cereals, vegetables, fruits, and milk products are called complex carbohydrates.  Complex carbohydrates will not raise blood glucose levels as quickly as simple sugars.  The amount of total carbohydrates that you eat during the day will depend on your specific meal plan.<p>

Proteins are foods that are necessary in the body for tissue repair, muscle building, and growth.  They are found primarily in meat, fish, poultry, eggs, and cheese.<p>

Fats are the most concentrated source of energy.  Fats contain twice as many calories as carbohydrates or proteins.  People with diabetes should limit their daily fat intake, and should try to choose fats from vegetable origins (such as corn oil) instead of fats from animal origin (such as lard or bacon).  The amount of fat that you eat in a day will also depend on your specific meal plan.<p>

Your meal plan will be given to you by your health care professional.<p>

Milk is the body's main source of calcium, a mineral necessary for healthy bones.  Yogurt is also a good source of calcium.  Milk is good to drink, but can also be added to cereal and other foods (such as sugar free pudding - see the Combination Foods list).  The milk list is divided into 3 categories: skim, low fat, and whole depending on the amount of fat and calories.  One milk exchange of each of these includes:<p>

</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>

Foot care is important, especially if you have diabetes or poor circulation.<p>
<h3>SIGNS TO WATCH FOR:</h3>
<ul>
<li>cold or swollen feet
<li>lack of sensation (feeling) 
<li>painful, burning or tingling
<li>slow healing of sores on the feet
</ul>

<b>1.  Check Your Feet Daily</b><p>

Look for any infection (redness, swelling, pus, or pain), dry skin, cracks, blisters, cuts, and any changes in skin color or temperature.  Examine the tops and bottoms, between the toes, and around the toenails.  Use good light; a mirror or magnifying glass can be helpful.<p>

<b>2.  Wash Your Feet Daily With Warm Water and Mild Soap</b><p>

Test the water temperature with your wrist before putting your feet in the water.  It is not necessary to soak your feet, it could even be harmful.<p>

Dry your feet well, especially between the toes.  Use a mild lotion or skin cream daily for dry skin.  You may use lanolin, vegetable oil, Crisco, Vaseline, cold cream, Nivea, and Eucerin.  Do not use creams or lotions between your toes or on open cuts.<p>

Use a little powder for sweaty/perspiring feet.  You may use nonperfumed powder, talcum powder, or cornstarch to help keep your feet dry.  Do not let the powder cake, especially between toes.<p>

Use  a small piece of plain gauze, cotton, or lamb's wool between toes if your toes overlap or if you have trouble with wetness between your toes.<p>

<b>3.  Cut Your Toenails Straight Across With Nail Clippers</b><p>

It will be easier to cut your toenails after bathing, when they are softer.  Use a file (emery board) to remove sharp edges after you have cut the nails.<p>

Do not treat ingrown toenails or corns yourself or use any chemicals (like iodine) or corn and callus removers.  Razor blades, scissors, or other tools to cut toenails, corns, or callouses should not be used.  Call your doctor or nurse to get proper care.<p>

<b>4.  Wear Proper Shoes and Socks</b><p>

Your shoes should be wide and long enough to allow toes to wiggle without pressure.  Shoes should be comfortable, fit well and have good support.  Avoid shoes with seams or buckles that rub on your feet and open shoes and sandals should not be worn if you have foot problems.<p>

To protect your feet, do not go barefoot, especially on hot sand or concrete.  Shake out shoes (to remove small objects) before putting them on, and wear clean, dry socks or stockings every day.  Socks should be colorfast and fit well.  Tight socks, stockings, or garters with elastic tops should also be avoided.<p>

<b>5.  Exercise Your Feet</b><p>

Walking or doing other exercises your doctor or nurse has shown you can help your circulation.<p>

Remember to wear sturdy, comfortable shoes when walking or exercising and to check your feet afterward for blisters, cuts, or redness.  If you have pain or an open sore that rubs the shoe, avoid exercises that will further irritate the sore.<p>

<h3>General Reminders</h3>
<ol>
<li>If you need help in caring for your feet, ask family or friends for assistance.
<li>Do not put heat or cold packs directly on your feet (no heating pads, hot water bottles, or ice packs).  Your feet may not have enough feeling to warn you of injury.  Wear extra cotton socks or use a blanket to keep your feet warm at night.
<li>No smoking. It is bad for your circulation. Crossing your legs also cuts down the circulation to your feet.
<li>Eat a balanced diet.  Limit the amount of cholesterol, saturated fat, and caffeine in your diet.
<li>First aid for minor cuts and scratches:
	<dl><dd>a. Wash the area with warm water and mild soap.
	<dd>b. Dry your foot.
	<dd>c. Cover the area with a dry, sterile bandage.
	<dd>d. Use paper tape instead of adhesive tape.</dl>
<li>Call your doctor or nurse if you have a foot infection (pain, tenderness, swelling, redness, pus, or a warm/hot area), an ingrown toenail, a problem cutting your toenails, or any foot problems or questions.  Remember: early treatment can prevent major foot problems.

</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>

<b>What is Gestational Diabetes?</b><p>

Gestational diabetes is a kind of diabetes that happens only during pregnancy.  Diabetes means that your body does not make enough insulin.  Insulin helps your body use food, it acts as a key to let the sugar from food into your cells.  When there is not enough insulin, the sugar does not go into your cells, instead it stays in your blood as "blood sugar."  Having diabetes means that your blood sugar is too high.<p>

<b>How Do I Know if I Have Gestational Diabetes?</b><p>

Your doctor will do a blood sugar screening test during the sixth month of your pregnancy.  If the results of this test are high, your doctor will also do a glucose tolerance test.  The glucose tolerance test will tell your doctor if you have gestational diabetes.<p>

<b>Are There Any Signs or Symptoms of Gestational Diabetes?</b><p>

Some women with gestational diabetes have increased thirst and hunger, go to the bathroom more often, and feel weak.  You may have one, all, or none of these symptoms, therefore it is very important to have the screening blood sugar test during the sixth month of your pregnancy.<p>

<b>Will Gestational Diabetes Hurt My Baby?</b><p>

Your baby is not at greater risk for birth defects.  However, gestational diabetes can cause some problems to your baby.  If you have gestational diabetes, your baby may get too big, have low blood sugar at birth, have a hard time breathing, and may have slightly yellow skin (jaundice).  These problems can be treated, though.  Your baby will most likely NOT be born with diabetes.<p>

<b>Will Gestational Diabetes Hurt Me?</b><p>

Gestational diabetes might make your blood pressure go up, which can cause your feet and ankles to swell.  You may also have more urinary tract infections during your pregnancy.  Having gestational diabetes also increases your chances of getting diabetes later in life.  About half of the women who get gestational diabetes will develop type II (non-insulin-dependant) diabetes later in life.<p>

<b>How Do I Treat Gestational Diabetes?</b><p>

Some women will have to take oral medicine or insulin to help control gestational diabetes.  Your doctor will determine whether or not this will be necessary for you.  All women with gestational diabetes must have good eating habits.  A weight gain of 25-35 pounds over nine months is normal, and a good meal plan will help keep your weight gain within a normal range.  Some general guidelines include eating regularly, not skipping meals, and avoiding alcohol or tobacco while pregnant.  Ask your health care provider for more information on developing a meal plan that works for you.<p>

Diarrhea is the passage of watery stools, usually repeated several times a day.  Diarrhea is caused when the intestines become over-stimulated and empty themselves before the excess water can be reabsorbed by the body.  The cause is usually an infection or irritation in the digestive tract.  It can also be caused by stress.<p>

Diarrhea can be a symptom of various disorders if it is long-lasting or accompanied by severe pain.  Most often, diarrhea lasts a short time.  It is one way the body can get rid of infection.<p>

<h3>TREATMENT:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Clear liquids only for the first 24 hours (i.e. water, bouillon, apple juice, ginger ale,      etc.)
<li>Avoid milk products for up to three days
<li>Bed rest if possible 
<li>Avoid spicy foods, fruit, alcohol and coffee for at least 48 hours after the symptoms have disappeared
<li>Because diarrhea usually helps to clear the body of infection, try not to use antidiarrheal medicines for the 	first six hours. Then use only if the diarrhea causes cramping and discomfort.

One of the best treatments for diarrhea is to let the bowel rest.  This can be done by avoiding solid foods for a day or two.  This gives the bowel time to heal itself.<p>

Oral rehydration therapy is helpful in preventing dehydration and promoting normal bowel functions.<p>

Some oral rehydration solutions such as <b>Pedialyte</b>, <b>Ricelyte</b>, and <b>Oralyte</b> can be purchased without a prescription in many drug stores.<p>

A child with diarrhea can also be treated with small amounts of clear liquids.  Follow these guidelines when feeding your child the clear liquids:<p>

<b>INFANTS (under 1 year):</b>  ounce every 20 minutes. Do not give the child more than the specified amount.<p>

<b>CHILDREN (over 1 year):</b> 1 ounce every 30 minutes. Do not give the child more than the specified amount.<p>
<hr width=400 align=left size=4>
<b><i>Clear Liquid Foods:</i></b>
<ul>
<li>16 oz. water plus  teaspoon salt and 1 tablespoon sugar 
<li>Sweetened tea
<li>Apple, grape or cranberry juice
<li>Sprite, 7-Up 
<li>Jell-O or Jell-O water
<li>1 bouillon cube in 1 quart water

<title>FHP Health & Wellness Library: Guidelines for Weight Gain (High Calorie)</title>
</head>

<center>
<font size=6 color="#4A5A94"><b>Guidelines for Weight Gain </b></font> <font size=4>(High Calorie)</font>
</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>

This diet is designed to promote good health through weight gain or high calorie weight maintenance.  A person who is well-nourished will experience better response to medical treatment, more rapid recovery from surgery, more resistance to infection, as well as feeling and looking better.<p>

A high calorie diet should include a balance of protein, carbohydrate and fat.  By choosing foods from each of the Basic Food Groups (milk, meat or protein, vegetable and fruit, and grain group) you can safely and steadily gain weight without jeopardizing your health.

<h3>WAYS TO INCREASE YOUR CALORIE INTAKE:</h3>
<ol>
<li>If you find that you cannot eat large portions at once, do not get discouraged.  You can effectively increase 	your intake by eating small meals frequently.<p>
<li>Avoid drinking low calorie beverages such as coffee, tea, water or diet soda with meals, as they create a "full 	feeling" and add few calories.  Try fruit juices or milkshakes (see recipes).<p>
<li>Having high calorie beverages between meals is often the easiest way to boost calorie intake.  Milkshakes can be 	prepared at home (see recipes) or purchased at fast food establishments.  Instant breakfast powder ready to 	mix with milk is available at grocery stores.  Nutritional supplements such as Ensure Plus, Sustacal, Isomil, 	Prosobee, and Resource are available at most drug stores.  Supplements should not be used as a substitute for 	regular meals, but should be taken with or without meals.<p>
<li>Add additional calories to your meals by increasing your use of fats, especially unsaturated fats*.<p>
	<dl><dt><b>Foods High in Fat Include:</b>  Vegetable oil*, margarine*, butter, mayonnaise*, cream, Mocha        Mix*, sour cream, cream cheese, whipped cream, seeds*, nuts*, peanut butter*, avocado*, cheese, salad            dressing*.<p>
	<dt><b>Ideas:</b>
	<dd>margarine or butter on bread or vegetables
	<dd>mayonnaise on sandwiches and salads
	<dd>cream or Mocha Mix on cereal
	<dd>sour cream dip with vegetables
	<dd>whipped cream on pies, fruit, pudding or hot chocolate
	<dd>peanut butter with apple, banana, pear or celery
	<dd>cheese toast for breakfast</dl><p>
<li>Dried fruits and fruit juices can also provide a concentrated source of calories.<p>
	<dl><dt><b>Ideas:</b>
	<dd>raisins and dates on hot or cold cereal
	<dd>grape, cranberry or apple juice between meals
	<dd>granola and fruit in yogurt</dl><p>
<li>Have ready to eat snacks available.<p>
	<dl><dt><b>Ideas:</b>
	<dd>nuts, dried fruit, fruit juice, candy, popcorn,	crackers and cheese, granola, ice cream, yogurt.</dl><p>
<li>Add nonfat dry milk to hot cereal, scrambled eggs, cream soups, casseroles, etc. Try concentrating one glass of liquid milk by adding two tablespoons of dry milk.<p>
<li>If you are intolerant to milk, you may want to try "Mocha Mix", "Lactaid" milk, "Mocha Mix" ice cream, fruit flavored yogurt, or a milk free nutritional supplement such as Ensure, Sustacal or Isomil.
</ol>

<h3>BREADS AND CEREALS</h3>

<i>High-fiber breads and cereals:</i> Whole wheat bread, whole meal bread, rye bread, Boston Brown bread, All-bran cereal, Grape Nuts, Shredded Wheat, Wheat Bran, Puffed Wheat, Bran Chex, Oatmeal.<p>

<i>Low-fiber breads and cereals:</i> French bread, white bread, donuts, pastries, cake, croissants, Farina, Cream of Wheat.

<h3>VEGETABLES</h3>

High-fiber vegetables: Fresh vegetables, i.e., broccoli, brussels sprouts, cabbage, carrots, celery, green beans, tomato, parsnips, turnips, rutabagas, onions, potato, peas, baked beans.<p>

Low-fiber vegetables: Strained vegetable juice, lettuce, cooked asparagus, winter squash, tomato sauce.

<h3>What is a Low-Purine Diet?</h3>

A low-purine diet is needed for the presence of a high blood uric acid level.  Uric acid crystals may form around the joints, causing the painful condition of gout.  Uric acid is made from dietary purine as well as simple compounds not of dietary origin.

<h3>Special Instructions</h3>
<ol>
<li>Drink plenty of fluids.  Fluids prevent the urine from being concentrated in solutes.  Between attacks, an 	intake of two quarts of water per day is recommended. 
<li>Obesity contributes to an increased level of uric acid.  A well-balanced diet with moderate caloric restriction 	is recommended.  Sudden weight reduction and fasting can make gout worse. 
<li>To minimize an increase of uric acid during a gout attack, restrict meat, fish or chicken to a 3 oz. per day.
</ol>

<ol>
<li>Avoid all salt, in cooking and at the table.
<li>Avoid medicines, laxatives, and salt substitutes unless prescribed by a physician.
<li>Limit use of processed and convenience foods.
<li>On food items with a nutrition label, the sodium content per serving may be indicated.  In general, all foods 	that have less than 250 mg. <i>per serving</i> are allowed.  
<li><i>Fresh</i> and <i>frozen</i> vegetables, meat, and fish are recommended. If using canned foods, rinse well 	under water for one minute.
<li>Use salt substitutes <i>only</i> on the advise of your physician.

<font size=4>(For Herpes Control)</font>
</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>

<h3>Purpose:</h3>

Herpes, a very contagious orally and sexually transmitted disease, has no cure; and outbreaks can be very painful.  The following meal plan may help control pain associated with herpes outbreaks.<p>

<b>Note:</b> If you think you may have herpes but are not sure, see your doctor immediately before attempting treatment at home.

<h3>Special Instructions:</h3>

The basis of the following meal plan is limiting foods high in the amino acid arginine, and increasing consumption of foods high in the amino acid lysine.  Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins, a part of the foods we eat.  Proteins are also found in viruses, like the herpes virus.  By limiting certain "building blocks" and increasing the amount of others, the proteins in the herpes virus may not be as strong, and the outbreaks should be less painful.  Listed below are foods high in both arginine and lysine:<p>
<pre>
<font size=5><b>High Lysine Foods</b></font> (Choose These)

The renal diet is a diet that helps lower the work done by the kidneys.  It is lower in sodium, potassium, and phosphorus than a regular diet.  Sodium, potassium, and phosphorus are all minerals that can hurt the kidneys if you already have something wrong with your kidneys.  This diet will help keep your body in the best condition possible.  Check with a member of your health care team to see if this diet is right for you.<p>

</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>

<h3>What is Diverticulosis?</h3>

Diverticulosis means the presence of several diverticula.  A diverticulum is a pouch-like area which balloons out from the large intestine, usually in the colon.

<h3>Who has Diverticulosis?</h3>

Obese people are more prone to diverticulosis than thin people.  The condition is not spread from person to person and is not a sign of cancer.  About 30 percent of all people over the age of 45 have diverticulosis.  Many people with diverticulosis have no symptoms due to the diverticula.  However, many have an irritable colon along with diverticulosis, and this requires treatment.

<h3>How is Diverticulosis treated?</h3>

<b>Activity.</b> Get into a state of good physical condition by daily exercise.<p>

<b>Diet.</b> A diet with high roughage is best for people with diverticulosis.  Increased roughage can be taken in the form of bran fibers or some medications which may be suggested.<p>

<b>General Measures.</b> Try to have a bowel movement at approximately the same time every day; spend at least 10 minutes in the attempt.  Do not strain.  The best time for most people to have a bowel movement is soon after breakfast.  Use a heating pad on the stomach, if needed for pain or spasms.<p>

<b>Medications.</b> Medicines, if required, must be fitted to your own particular needs.  Do not take any medicine (not even medicine you buy without a prescription) without telling your doctor.  If drugs are prescribed, carefully follow the instructions on the label.<p>

<h3>IMPORTANT</h3>
Notify your doctor if any of the following happens:
<ol>
<li>Severe pain in the abdomen not relieved by the measures already outlined.
<li>Temperature over 100 F.
<li>Bleeding is evidenced by black or tar-looking bowel movements or bright red blood appearing at the anus.
<li>Swelling or bloating of the abdomen.
</ol>

<b>Note:</b> Diverticulosis is dangerous only when diverticula become infected, rupture, or bleed.<p>

</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>
<ol>
<li>Avoid foods containing indigestible roughage such as celery and corn, and use bran to prevent constipation.  	Avoid straining while at stool.
<li>Add bulk to stools by eating fruits and vegetables with a high fiber content, i.e., seedless grapes, fresh 	peaches, carrots, and lettuce.
<li>Avoid extremely hot or cold foods and fluids, as they cause gas.
<li>Avoid alcohol; it irritates the bowel.
<li>If overweight, reduce your weight.  Excess weight aggravates the symptoms.
<li>Exercise moderately.
<li>Eat a high fiber diet, i.e., fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grain bread, and wheat or bran cereal.
<li>Use natural laxatives.
<li>Drink plenty of fluids.
<li>Don't smoke; it irritates the gastric mucosa.

<h3>What is Esophageal Reflux?</h3>

Esophageal reflux is usually associated with the presence of a hiatal hernia, in which stomach acid flows upward and irritates your lower esophagus.<p>

A hiatal hernia is a bulge of the stomach through the opening in the diaphragm (a muscular separation between the abdomen and the chest).  These hernias can range in size and may cause mild to severe symptoms.  A hiatal hernia may be the result of a weakness in the diaphragm or caused by an injury to the abdomen.<p>

<hr width=400 align=left size=4>
<font size=4><b>Symptoms</b></font><p>
The symptoms of a hiatal hernia are usually caused by a back flow of gastric acid into the esophagus.

<h3>Treatment</h3>
<ul>
<li>Surgery is required for a cure, but many times medical treatment can control symptoms indefinitely.
<li>Antacids do the most good if taken 1 hour before meals and at bedtime.
<li>Sleep with 4-inch blocks under the head of your bed.  This will help keep the acid in your stomach rather than flowing upward and irritating your lower esophagus.
<li>Avoid tight garments.
<li>Avoid alcoholic and caffeine containing beverages.
<li>Avoid rich and highly seasoned foods, although strict dietary restrictions are probably not necessary.
<li>Avoid foods which seem to increase your symptoms.
<li>Avoid eating anything for 3 hours before bedtime.
<li>Avoid cigarette smoking.
<li>Avoid completely: mood-altering, mind-altering, stimulant or sedative drugs.
<li>Make changes in your diet or activity level, if necessary, to reach your ideal weight.
</ul>
<hr width=400 align=left size=4><br>
<b>Contact the doctor if any of the following happens:</b><p>
<ul>
<li>A sensation of stoppage of food beneath the breastbone.
<li>Vomiting.
<li>Temperature over 1000 F.
<li>Symptoms failure to improve.
</ul>

<h3>What is Potassium?</h3>

Potassium is a mineral that is necessary for normal muscle functioning, especially in the heart.  It is found in many foods, especially fresh fruits and vegetables and some grains and cereals.  Too much potassium in the body can cause the heart to stop beating.  Too little potassium in the body can cause muscle weakness, dizziness, thirst and confusion; and can also cause the heart to stop beating.  Ask your doctor if you need to eat more foods high in potassium, or if you should be limiting the amount of high potassium foods that you eat.

<h3>Foods High in Potassium:</h3>  
<pre>
    Avocado            Mango             Parsnips

</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>

Iron is a mineral needed for good health and aids in carrying oxygen from the lungs to the body's tissue. The recommended daily dietary allowance ranges from 10 milligrams for men to 15 milligrams for women per day with additional requirements for pregnant and lactating women.<p>

Iron deficiency, or anemia, may result when the body's natural store of iron is used up and not enough iron is obtained through the diet.<p>

Infants, children, adolescents, women of child bearing age, strict vegetarians and frequent blood donors are more likely to have an iron deficiency. The need for an iron supplement is best determined by a doctor on the basis of a blood test, since an excessive iron intake can cause other health problems.<p>

The following foods are good sources of dietary iron.

Gout is a type of arthritis or swelling around a joint caused by excess uric acid in the blood.  Uric acid is a normal chemical found in the blood.

<h3>What Causes Gout?</h3>

Gout attacks are caused by deposits of uric acid crystals in the fluid of the joints.  Uric acid crystals are formed when a person cannot break down purines well.  Purines are chemicals found in large amounts of certain foods, such as; liver, kidney, sweetbreads, sardines and anchovies.<p>

The actual cause of gout is unknown, but it is thought to be a genetic flaw involved in the breakdown of purines. Gout can also be triggered by certain drugs, such as medicine used to control high blood pressure.

<h3>What are the Symptoms?</h3>

Attacks of gout happen quickly with extreme throbbing or crushing joint pain; and swelling and inflammation of the joint. The big toe is a common site, but gout can effect other parts of the body such as the foot, ankle, and instep of the foot.

<h3>What is the Treatment for Gout?</h3>

<b>Activity Guidelines</b> - During an acute attack, you will be more comfortable if you stay rested in bed. Bedrest may also help decrease the length of illness. Keep the weight of bedclothes off any painful joint by using a cradle or frame that raises the sheets off your body.<p>

<b>General Measures</b> - You may try either a warm or cold compress on painful joints. Use the one that lessens the pain best for you.<p>

<b>Medications</b> - Your doctor may prescribe medication. Follow the instructions on your prescription, and notify your doctor of any side effects. Do not take any other medicines without telling your doctor (especially over-the-counter medicine).<p>

<b>Diet</b> - Follow a low-purine diet and special food and drink instructions.<p>

<b>Call Your Doctor if the Following Happens:</b>
<ul>
<li>Continuous diarrhea or vomiting
<li>Temperature over 101F
</ul>

<hr size=1 noshade>
<h3>GOUT LOW-PURINE DIET</h3>

<h3>Purpose:</h3>

A low-purine diet is indicated in the presence of high blood uric acid levels. Uric acid crystals may form in and around the joints, causing the painful condition of gout. Uric acid is made from dietary purine as well as simple compounds not of a dietary origin.

<h3>Special Instructions</h3>
<ol>
<li>Drink plenty of fluids. Fluids prevent concentration of solutes in the urine. Between attacks, an minimum of three quarts of water per day is recommended.  
<li>Obesity contributes to an increased uric acid level. A well-balanced diet with moderate caloric restriction is recommended. Sudden weight reduction and fasting can trigger a gout attack and should be avoided.  
<li>To minimize an increase of uric acid during a gout attack, restrict meat, fish and poultry to 3 oz. per day.
</ol>

</head>
<body>

<center>
<font size=6 color="#4A5A94"><b>Plantar Fasciitis</b></font>
</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>

<h3>What is Plantar Fasciitis?</h3>

Plantar fasciitis, or heel-spur syndrome, is inflammation of the tendon that is attached to the front of the heel bone and runs forward along the bottom of the foot.  Plantar fasciitis commonly affects people such as runners and those who are active in sports.  Plantar fasciitis may start as a dull pain in the heel which may progress to a sharp persistent pain.  The pain can feel worse in certain situations such as after sitting, standing or walking, and during your first steps in the morning.<p>

The plantar fascia is a thick fibrous muscle on the bottom of your foot.  This muscle is attached to the heel bone and fans forward to the toes and acts like a bowstring to maintain the arch of the foot.<p>

<hr width=400 align=left size=4>
<font size=4><b>Symptoms:</b></font><p>
When the muscle is placed under constant tension, such as running, it can become inflamed at the point where the fascia attaches to the heel bone and results in pain.   Injury of the plantar fascia may also occur at midsole or near the toes.  This problem may progress rapidly and treatment must be started as soon as possible.

<h3>Contributing Factors of Plantar Fasciitis</h3>
<ul>
<li>Flat feet
<li>High arched, rigid feet
<li>Poor shoe support
<li>Toe running, hill running
<li>Soft terrain (i.e. running on sand)
<li>Increasing age
<li>Sudden weight increase
<li>Sudden increase in activity level
<li>Family tendency
</ul>
<hr width=400 align=left size=4>

<h3>Treatment:</h3>

If the condition has existed for a long time, improvement may take longer than expected.  During recovery, loss of excess weight, good shoes and sedentary activities will all help the injury to heal.

<h3>Treatment Includes:</h3>

<b>Rest</b> - Use pain as your guide; when you feel pain, rest it.<p>

<b>Ice</b> - Icing the sore area for 30 to 60 minutes several times a day can help reduce inflammation.  Also, ice the sore area for 15 minutes after activity.<p>

<b>Medication</b> - Your doctor may suggest an anti-inflammatory/analgesic medication coupled with heel pads to ease the pain.<p>

<b>Heel Pads</b> - A heel pad of felt, sponge or a newer synthetic material can help spread, equalize and absorb the shock to ease the pressure on the plantar fascia.  They are available at some medical supply and sporting goods stores.<p>

<b>Shoes</b> - The best type of shoe to wear is a good running shoe with excellent support.  Experiment with your athletic shoes to find a pair that is comfortable and gives you fewer symptoms.<p>

<b>Physical Therapy</b> - The initial objective of physical therapy (when needed) is to decrease the inflammation.  Later, the small muscles of the foot can be strengthened to support the weakened tendon.<p>

<b>Surgery</b> - Surgery is rarely required for plantar fasciitis.  It would be considered only if all forms of more conservative treatment failed and if the pain is still incapacitating after several months.

<h3>Recovery</h3>

Plantar fasciitis can be aggravated by all weight-bearing sports.  To maintain cardiovascular fitness, weight bearing sports can be temporarily replaced by non-weight-bearing sports (i.e. swimming, cycling).  Weight training can be used to maintain leg strength.  When recovering from plantar fasciitis, return to sport activities slowly.  If you have a lot of pain either during the activity or the following morning, you are doing too much.

<h3>Exercises</h3>

The following exercises are designed to strengthen the small muscles of the foot to help support the damaged area.  If done regularly, they will help prevent re-injury.  Do each prescribed exercise two times a day or as often as your doctor recommends.

<h3>Towel Curls</h3>

Place a towel on the floor and curl it toward you, using only the toes of your injured foot.  Resistance can be increased with a weight on the end of the towel.  Relax, then repeat the towel curl.

<h3>Shin Curls</h3>

Sitting down on a chair.  Run your injured foot slowly up and down the shin of your other leg as you try to grab the shin with your toes.  A similar exercise can be done curling your toes around a tin can.

<h3>Stretches</h3>

Stand at arm's length from a counter or table with your back knee locked and your front knee bent.  Slowly lean toward the table, pressing forward until a moderate stretch is felt in the calf muscle of your straight leg.  Hold 15 seconds, keeping both heels on the floor, bend the knee of your straight leg until a moderate stretch is felt in your achilles tendon.  Hold 15 seconds more.  You should feel a moderate pull in your muscle and tendon, but no pain.  Change legs and stretch the other leg.<p>

</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>

Hemorrhoids are swollen veins around the anus.  They can occur outside of the anus or form on the inside of the rectum.<p>

Hemorrhoids are caused by straining to have a bowel movement, constipation, heavy lifting, pregnancy or sitting for long periods of time.<p>

<hr width=400 align=left size=4>
<font size=4><b>SYMPTOMS:</b></font><p>
Pain, itching, swelling and sometimes bleeding of the rectum.

<h3>PREVENTION:</h3>
You can prevent hemorrhoids by increasing the fiber in your diet, by eating more fruits, vegetables and multigrain bread.  Also drink lots of liquids.  Avoid heavy lifting, straining during a bowel movement and sitting for long periods of time.  Daily exercise can also help by relieving pressure of hemorrhoids.
<hr width=400 align=left size=4>

<h3>TREATMENT:</h3>

In most cases you can treat hemorrhoids at home and the swelling will stop after a few days.  Try soaking in a hot bath for 10-15 minutes, two to three times a day, applying a compress soaked with witch hazel (or medicine advised by your doctor) and lying down until pain, itching or bleeding has stopped.<p>

Occasionally, it may be necessary to surgically remove the hemorrhoids if there is a blood clot, repeated bleeding or a severe infection.

<h3><i>CALL YOUR DOCTOR IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING HAPPEN:</i></h3>
<ul>
<li>Severe pain continues for more than 24 hours.
<li>Bleeding occurs.
</ul>

<font size=6 color="#4A5A94"><b>Hepatitis</b></font>
</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>

Hepatitis is the name given to a group of illnesses that cause infection of the liver.  It can be caused my many things, including viruses, bacteria, and certain chemicals.  There are three types of hepatitis that are common today.  Below is a description of each type:

<h3>Hepatitis A:</h3>

Hepatitis A is spread through person to person contact and fecal-oral contamination.  This means that unsanitary conditions can lead to contamination of foods with bacteria.  These foods are then eaten by humans, and the person becomes sick.  Symptoms of Hepatitis A include a low fever, loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting, muscle and joint pain, headache, sore throat, and a general sick feeling.  In fact, many people with Hepatitis A think they have the flu.  Hepatitis A is usually not life threatening.  To prevent Hepatitis A, wash your hands often, and avoid raw shellfish, untreated water, and food handled by people with Hepatitis A.

<h3>Hepatitis B:</h3>

Hepatitis B is spread through contact with blood, semen, and other body fluids.  All donated blood is now screened for Hepatitis B, however other precautions will help prevent the spread of Hepatitis B.  These include: not donating blood if you have been exposed the AIDS virus, have had Hepatitis A or C, have had a blood transfusion or tattoo within the last six months, or have a history of drug addiction; and practicing safe sex.  There is a vaccine available for Hepatitis B, and if you work in the health care industry or around bodily fluids, you should consider getting this vaccine.  The symptoms of Hepatitis B are the same as those for Hepatitis A, but Hepatitis B can cause the liver to fail and can cause death or chronic hepatitis.

<h3>Hepatitis C:</h3>

Hepatitis C is the newest form of Hepatitis.  It is spread through contact with blood, semen, and other body fluids just as Hepatitis B.  Prevention techniques include proper hygiene, such as washing your hands often, and avoiding contact with other persons with Hepatitis C.  Like Hepatitis A, there is not a vaccine available for Hepatitis C.  The symptoms are similar to those of Hepatitis A and B, and like Hepatitis A, Hepatitis C is usually mild and not life threatening.<p>

<i>If you think that you may have hepatitis of any kind, do not attempt to treat yourself at home.  Instead, see you doctor immediately to better treat your condition and help avoid any further spread of the disease.</i><p>

<font size=6 color="#4A5A94"><b>Infectious Hepatitis</b></font>
</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>

Infectious Hepatitis, or Hepatitis A, is an inflammation of the liver.  It is caused by a virus.  The virus is passed from an infected person to another or from food or water that has been contaminated by the feces of a person with the virus.  It usually lasts one to three weeks.<p>

<hr width=400 align=left size=4>
<font size=4><b>SYMPTOMS:</b></font><p>
Hepatitis begins with nonspecific symptoms such as; fever, headache, achiness, loss of appetite and feeling poorly.  After a few days, other symptoms begin, including; nausea (sometimes vomiting), abdominal pain, foul breath and jaundice, a yellowing on the whites of eyes and sometimes the skin.  The liver is swollen, aches and is tender to the touch.

<h3>PREVENTION:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Always wash hands thoroughly after going to the bathroom or changing a diaper
<li>Wash raw vegetables and fruit before eating
<li>Do not drink water that could be contaminated
</ul>
<hr width=400 align=left size=4>

<h3>TREATMENT:</h3>

Bed rest is advised until the fever is gone and jaundice lessens.  Keep eating as usual.<p>

Because it is caused by a virus, antibiotics can not help to get over Hepatitis.  Other medications may help to alleviate symptoms.  Do not take any medication (even over-the-counter medicines) without asking your doctor.

<h3>CALL YOUR DOCTOR IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING HAPPEN:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Increasing loss of appetite.
<li>Excessive drowsiness or mental confusion.
<li>Vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain.
<li>Jaundice worsens.
<li>Skin rash or itching of the skin.
</ul>

<center>
<font size=6 color="#4A5A94"><b>Hiatal Hernia</b></font>
</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>

<h3>What is a Hiatal Hernia?</h3>

A hiatal hernia is an abnormal weakness or opening in the diaphragm, a big thin muscle that separates the chest cavity from the abdominal cavity.  Hiatal hernia may be due to congenital weakness in the muscular ring of the diaphragm through which the esophagus passes and empties into the stomach or abdominal injury, causing tremendous pressure that tears a hole in some part of the diaphragm.  Either of these can cause stomach acid to flow backward from the stomach into the esophagus, irritating the esophagus.<p>

<hr width=400 align=left size=4>
<font size=4><b>Symptoms:</b></font><p>
The following symptoms usually develop one hour or more after eating:  heartburn (a burning sensation in the area of the heart behind the breast bone), belching, and swallowing difficult (rare).  Risk of problems increase with chronic constipation and straining during bowel movements, smoking, obesity, pregnancy and constant straining or lifting with tightening of the abdominal muscles.

<h3>Treatment:</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Activity</b> - avoid squatting or bending from the abdomen.
<li><b>Diet</b> - avoid alcoholic beverages, caffeine-containing beverages (coffee, tea, cocoa, cola drinks) and any other 	food, juice, or spice that aggravates symptoms.  Eat slowly.
</ul>

<h3>General Measures</h3>
<ul>
<li>Raise the head of your bed 4 to 6 inches and/or sleep on two or three pillows. This allows gravity to keep 	stomach acid away from hernia.
<li>Avoid large meals. Eat four or five small meals a day instead. Do not eat anything for at least 2 hours 	before bedtime.
<li>Lose weight if you are overweight.
<li>Do not smoke.
<li>Do not wear tight pantyhose, girdles, belts or pants.
<li>Do not strain during bowel movement, urination or lifting.
</ul>
  
<hr width=400 align=left size=4>

<h3>Medication</h3>

Your doctor may prescribe antacids and stool softeners.  Antacids are most effective for some person when they take them 1 hour before meals and at bedtime.  Others find them more helpful 1 to 2 hours after meals and at bedtime.  Try both way to find the best schedule for you.

<h3>Notify your doctor if any of the following happens:</h3>
<ul>
<li>You vomit blood or have recurrent vomiting.
<li>Temperature rises over 1000 F.
<li>Symptoms do not improve with treatment in one month.
<li>Symptoms of a hiatal hernia recur after treatment, especially the sensation that food stops beneath the breast bone, call immediately if pain is accompanied by shortness of breath, sweating or nausea.

</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>

A high blood glucose (sugar) level is called hyperglycemia.  It develops when there is not enough insulin.  If not treated, hyperglycemia can lead to complications known as ketoacidosis (coma) and hyperosmolar nonketotic coma.<p>

Ketoacidosis is most common in people with type I (insulin-dependent) diabetes.  This type usually develops over a few hours or days.  Urine tests show moderate to high levels of ketones.  Hyperosmolar coma occurs in people with type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes.  This type is more common in the elderly, especially during illness.  It may take days or even weeks to develop.  Urine tests do not show ketones.

<h3>PREVENTION:</h3>

Prevent hyperglycemic emergencies by following these rules:
<ol>
<li>Follow your diet, medication, activity, and blood or urine testing plan properly.
<li>Tell any new doctor or dentist that you have diabetes before you have any procedure or operation done.
<li>Sick-day guidelines:
<dl><dt>	a. Check with your doctor or nurse for specific directions.
<dt>	b. Treat all illness seriously.
<dt>	c. Take insulin or diabetes pills as directed.
<dt>	d. Test your urine or blood for sugar.  Test your urine for ketones. Record the
<dd>results. You may need to test for sugar and ketones every 4 hours.
<dt>	e. Drink fluids often. Drink about half a cup of water, tea, or broth every hour.
<dt>	f. Try to eat normally.</dl>
</ol>

<h3>CALL YOUR DOCTOR IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING HAPPEN:</h3>
<ul>
<li>You are sick more than 24 hours and are not getting better.
<li>Your blood sugar is over 240 milligrams/deciliter for two tests in a row.
<li>Your urine shows moderate to high levels of ketones.
<li>You have symptoms of very high sugar levels.
<li>You are not able to eat.

<h3>SPECIAL NOTE</h3>

If you have experienced low blood sugar levels within the past 24 hours, your body may release a hormone that may make your blood sugar levels high for several readings.  This is called rebounding.  The blood sugar level should return to normal after several readings.  If you call your doctor or nurse, inform him or her that you have experienced low blood sugar levels before having high blood glucose levels.<p>

<hr size=1 noshade>
<p>
Low blood glucose (sugar) is known by several names: hypoglycemia, insulin reaction, or insulin shock.  Hypoglycemia has many causes (see table below).  It can occur quickly, especially if you are taking insulin.
<p>
It is important to learn how your body feels with low blood sugar so that you can take action right away.
<p>
<h3><i>PREVENTION:</i></h3>
Follow your doctor's or nurse's instructions:
<ol>
<li>Eat your snack before vigorous exercise.
<li>Be alert for low blood sugar signs before meals, during and after exercise, and during your       medication's peak action (especially with insulin).
<li>Stay on your diabetic plan for food, medication and exercise.
	<ul>
	<li>Be alert for changes in your daily routine that can affect your blood sugar levels.
	<li>Do not skip or delay meals.
	</ul>
<li>Before taking any other medications, even nonprescription ones, check with your doctor or nurse.
<li>Always carry medical identification and some form of simple sugar with you.  Take the simple sugar as soon as symptoms are felt.
<li>Show family members and friends where you keep your emergency glucagon kit and how to give glucagon.
<li>When you have a low blood sugar reaction, write down the date and time of day as well as your diet, exercise, and mediation.  
<li>Follow your plan for monitoring your blood sugar level or testing your urine.
<li>Only blood sugar testing can show low sugar levels.  Ask your doctor or nurse before using       alcoholic beverages.  Alcoholic beverages would need to be made part of your diet plan.

<b><i>CALL YOUR DOCTOR IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING HAPPEN:</i></b>
<ul>
<li>The symptoms stay the same or become worse after treatments, 
<li>You have repeated hypoglycemic reactions,
<li>You have any reaction while you are taking pills for diabetes control.
</ul>
<i><b>SPECIAL NOTE:</b></i>
<p>
Once the symptoms are gone, if you must wait more than 30 minutes until your next meal, eat a snack (half a sandwich, cheese and crackers, or a banana and half a cup of skim milk).  Any food used to treat reactions is in addition to your regular meal plan; do not subtract this food from your next meal.  
<p>
<b>IF THE SYMPTOMS ARE NOT GONE WITHIN 30 MINUTES, CALL A FRIEND OR THE EMERGENCY NUMBER FOR HELP.</b>
<p>
After having hypoglycemia, the body sometimes tries to compensate by releasing a hormone that increases the blood sugar level.  This is called rebounding (Somogyi effect).  You may find your next few blood sugar readings may be high after you have had hypoglycemia.  The sugar levels usually return to normal within 24 hours.  If you have questions, call your doctor or nurse before adjusting your insulin levels.

</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>
Impetigo is a bacterial (usually staphylococcus) infection of the skin. It is caused by bacteria that invades damaged skin. The skin may be damaged by wounds or the scratching of insect bites. This disorder sometimes occurs after having a cold with a running nose.
<h3>Symptoms</h3>
Impetigo starts as blisters that ooze a yellowish fluid and form yellowish-brown crusts. It mostly occurs on exposed places of the body. With a cold, the sores can show up around the nose and on the upper lip.
<h3>Prevention</h3>
The sores may spread from place to place on the same person and can spread to other people. You should begin measures within the home in order to prevent the spreading of this contagious disorder.
<h3>General Measures</h3>
<ol>
<li>Each member of the family should use their own towels, or paper towels may be used.
<li>Keep nails short, hands clean and away from rash.
<li>If you can, cover the sores with gauze and first aid tape to keep hands away from the affected spot.
<li>Keep apart and boil bed linens, towels, clothes, etc. which have come into contact with the active sores.
<li>Treat any new lesions in the same manner, even if you are not sure they are impetigo.
</ol>
<h3>Treatment</h3>
<b>Medication -</b> Most of the time antibiotics will be prescribed to use for 10 days to prevent other problems. Also, an antibiotic ointment may be prescribed for the sores.  Be careful to follow the instructions on the label.
<h3>Important Points in Treatment</h3>
<ul>
<li>Stay indoors until the sores begin to heal, usually a day or two.
<li>Scrub lesions carefully and thoroughly with 2 x 2 gauze and a special antiseptic soap such as Phisohex or Betadyne. Remove all crusts or pus and expose and cleanse the base of all lesions. If it is hard to remove crusts, soak them in warm soapy water and then remove them with gentle scrubbing. 
<li>Rub antibiotic ointment into the lesions for 60 seconds.  Do this for at least 4 times a day.
</ul>
<hr width=400 align=left size=4>
<h3>CALL YOUR DOCTOR IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING OCCUR:</h3>
<ul>
<li>You develop a fever of 100F or higher	
<li>The sores do not stop spreading in 3 days
<li>The sores do not begin healing in 3 days
</ul>

<center>
<font size=6 color="#4A5A94"><b>Irritable Bowel Syndrome</b></font>
</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>
Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a disorder of the large intestines.  IBS is called by many different names including, spastic colitis, nervous bowel or mucous colitis.  Spasms of the large intestines cause the movement of food through the intestines to be either too fast (causing diarrhea) or too slow (causing constipation).
<p>
The exact cause of IBS has not been proven, but stress and anxiety seem to play a role.  IBS is very common.  It is probably the most common abdominal complaint seen by doctors.
<p>
<hr width=400 align=left size=4>
<p>
<h3>SYMPTOMS OF IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME</h3>
<ul>
<li>DIARRHEA
<li>CONSTIPATION
<li>ABDOMINAL PAIN
</ul>
Usually there are alternating bouts of diarrhea and constipation.
<p>
<hr width=400 align=left size=4>
<p>
<i>TREATMENT:</i><br>
Before diagnosing IBS, your doctor will need to rule out the possibility of other intestinal disorders.  If IBS is diagnosed, it is not medically serious, but it can be troublesome.  Lifestyle changes are necessary to prevent symptoms.  For patients who do not respond to lifestyle changes, drugs may be prescribed.
<p>
<hr width=400 align=left size=4>
<p>
<h3>	TREATMENT FOR	IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME</h3>
<b>Diet</b> 
<ul>
<li>Avoid triggering foods
<li>Increase fiber   
<li>Increase intake of fruits and vegetables
<li>Drink plenty of liquids
</ul>
<b>Exercise</b>
<ul>
<li>Engage in regular exercise
</ul>
<b>Reduce Stress</b>
<ul>
<li>Make changes to reduce stress
<li>Learn and practice stress management
</ul>
<b>Other</b>
<ul>
<li>Avoid alcohol, caffeine and heavy smoking
</ul>

</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>
<h3>What are Kegal Exercises?</h3>
Kegal exercises help strengthen the muscles around the vagina and help increase a women's ability to control and relax these muscles completely.
<p>
During pregnancy, kegal exercises are done to increase the strength of these muscles and provide increased support for the uterus and to develop the ability to relax and control the muscles in preparation for the actual birth of the baby.  Kegal exercise can also be done to heal and strengthen muscles damaged after childbirth and to increase urinary control.
<p>
<hr width=400 align=left size=4>
<h3>Tips for Kegal Exercises</h3>
<ul>
<li>Identify the pelvic muscles by tightening muscles around the anus while sitting or standing or starting and stopping urine flow while voiding.  Practice this tightening and releasing action while sitting, standing, walking, driving and watching television.	
<li>Try to tighten the muscles a small amount at a time, "like an elevator going up to the tenth floor." Then, release very slowly one "floor" at a time.	
<li>Try tightening the muscles from the front to back including the anus (rectum) as in the above exercise.  Do these exercises every morning, afternoon and evening (3 times a day).  Start with 5 times each and gradually work up to 20 to 30 each time.

<a name="top"></a>

<center>
<font size=6 color="#4A5A94"><b>Rehabilitation Exercises for the Knee</b></font>
</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>

An essential part of getting well after knee injury is exercise.  Work with your doctor to decide what are the best exercises to safely strengthen your knee.  Be sure to do only the exercises and the number of repetitions your doctor indicates.

<h3>Stretching Exercises</h3>
Before you begin any type of strength building exercises, start with stretching exercises as a warm-up and a cool-down phase of your program.
<dl>
<dd>
<b>Hamstring Stretch</b><br>
Lie on your back with your legs straight.  Raise your injured leg upward, clasping your hands at the back of your calf, just above the knee.  Push your straight leg backward, into your hands.  Relax, pull your leg slowly toward your body, stretching the muscles in the back of the thigh.  Hold the position for 5 seconds, keeping your knee straight.  Repeat this exercise, each time pulling your leg closer to your head.  Keep the other leg straight on the supporting surface.  <b>Do not pull suddenly, or fully force, as this can strain the muscles.</b>
<p>
<b>Quad Stretch</b><br>
Fasten a long belt (or towel) around the ankle of your injured leg.  Lie on your side, holding the free end of the belt and attempt to bend the knee further backward.  Push the hips forward.  Hold the position for a maximum stretch during each repetition for at least 5 seconds.
<p>
<b>Calf Stretch</b><br>
Stand facing a wall.  Place one leg behind the other, with both feet pointed toward the wall.  Both heels should be in contact with the floor.  Lean forward slowly until you feel a stretch in your calf.  Hold for a count of 5 seconds.  Relax and repeat.  Assume the same position as at the beginning of the calf stretch, but bend your knee slightly and lean forward, stretching the lower portion of your calf muscles.  Relax and repeat.
</dl>
<h3>Strength Building Exercises</h3>
After warming up with the stretching exercises you can continue the exercise session with the following isotonic/strengthening exercises.
<dl>
<dd>
<b>Straight Leg Raises</b><br>
Sit with your back straight, your injured leg straight and your good leg bent.  Flex the ankle of your injured leg and tighten your thigh muscle.  Lift your injured leg approximately 8 to 12 inches from the floor, keeping it straight.  Lower your leg slowly.  Rest.  You may use 1 lb to 5 lb weights if your leg is stronger.  Perform 3 sets of 8-12 repetitions, 2-3 times a day.
<p>
<b>Short Arc Quadriceps</b><br>
Sit with your back straight and place a rolled towel under the back of your injured knee, bend it slightly.  Straighten your leg slowly, raising your foot from the supporting surface.  Lower your leg.  Keep the back of the knee in contact with the towel at all times.  Add weight, as your leg gets stronger.  Perform 3 sets of 8-12 repetitions, 3 times a day.
<p>
<b>Hip Abduction</b><br>
Lie on your side - the side of your good leg.  Keep your leg straight.  Bend your other leg (the injured leg) behind you.  Raise your injured leg slowly, keeping the knee straight.  Lower it slowly.  Perform 3 sets of 8-12 repetitions, 3 times a day.
<p>
<b>Hip Adduction</b><br>
Lie on your side - the side of your injured leg.  Cross your good leg over your injured leg.  Place your foot flat on the floor.  Lift the lower leg, keeping the knee straight.  Lower it slowly.  Perform 3 sets of 8-12 repetitions, 3 times a day.
<p>
<b>Hip Extension</b><br>
Lie on your stomach with your head resting in your hands.  Turn your face away from the side of your injured leg.  Lift your injured leg 6 to 8 inches from the floor.  Be sure to keep your leg straight.  Perform 3 sets of 8-12 repetitions, 3 times a day.
<p>
<b>Knee Flexion</b><br>
Lie on your stomach and place a small rolled towel under the front of your injured knee for support.  Bend your knee as far as possible.  Slowly lower it back to a straight position.  Add weight.  With any knee pain, decrease frequency or repetition and/or amount of weight.  Perform 3 sets of 8-12 repetitions, 3 times a day.

</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>
<h3>What Are They?</h3>
Lice are the tiny grey bugs found crawling on the skin, scalp, or throughout the hair.  Lice are accompanied by nits. Nits are little white silvery colored eggs which come from the lice and attach to the hair shaft until they become lice. Lice suck blood and release fluids which causes intense itching.
<p>
Lice can spread from person to person by sharing personal items such as; combs, brushes, hair accessaries, clothing, towels, bed linen. Anyone can get lice, however, children usually get it and contract it from a brother, sister, or a friend. If one person has lice, check other people in close contact with your child - brothers, sisters, babysitters, day care center, or school.
<h3>Signs:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Intense itching of the scalp or other hairy parts of the body.
<li>Nits can be found near the scalp.
<li>Tiny blisters and/or a rash located near the neck line or behind the ears.
</ul>
<h3>Treatment:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Wash all clothing, towels, and bed linen in hot water and dry at high temperature, or dry clean.
<li>Disinfect all combs, brushes, and hair accessories by washing them with special medicated shampoos (Rid, Nix, A200 Pyrenate).
<li>Special medicated shampoos can be purchased in any drug store or pharmacy over the counter.
</ul>
<h3>Call Your Doctor if:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Any of the special shampoos do not work.
<li>Lice or nits remain in the hair.
<li>Blisters or rash on the body become infected.
</ul>

<h3>Benefits of Back Exercises</h3>
The purpose of back exercises is to prevent injury and pain.  The benefits of back exercises are to promote stretching, flexibility, and strengthening of muscles.  They also help decrease muscle spasms.
<h3>When to Use Back Exercises</h3>
Any exercise program should be started slowly and continued at a reasonable pace.  The following exercises are for you if you are experiencing back pain without leg pain.  Some mild discomfort is to be expected as you begin your exercise program.  Begin by trying the exercises slowly and carefully.
<h3>Pelvic Tilt</h3>
Lie on your back with your knees bent so your feet are flat on the floor.  Place your hand under your lower back and slowly press against your hand.  Remove your hand and press your back against the floor.  Count to five and relax for a moment before you repeat the exercise.
<h3>Modified Sit-Up</h3>
Start with the pelvic tilt and place your hands by your sides.  Lift your head so that your chin almost touches your chest.  Lift your shoulders off the floor as you reach for your knees.  Hold this position for five seconds and repeat several times.
<h3>Press Up</h3>
Lie on your stomach, with your arms and head positioned as shown below.  Push up with your arms, leaving your hips on the floor.   Do 10 - 12 press ups, 3 times a day.
<h3>Knee Raise</h3>
Lie on your back, with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor.  Begin with the pelvic tilt, then slowly raise your knees to your chest one at a time.  Hold for 30 seconds, lower your leg and repeat with other leg.

</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>
<p>
A migraine is a specific kind of headache with specific symptoms.  The pain of a migraine is caused by an increased dilation or widening of the blood vessels in the head.  Migraine headaches usually come on suddenly, range from moderate to severe, last from 3 hours to 3 days and re-occur every few weeks or months.  The average frequency is 1-3 attacks per month.
<p>
<hr width=400 align=left size=4>
<h3>UNDERSTANDING THE PAIN:</h3>
The throbbing, pulsating pain is usually located on one side of the head.  However, the pain can switch sides or can be felt on both sides.  In addition to the headache, migraine sufferers often have other symptoms including nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light and sound. 
<h3>ANTICIPATING A MIGRAINE:</h3>
Some people experience warning signals that a migraine headache is coming on.  The most common signal is an inability to see clearly followed by seeing bright spots and zig-zag patterns before the eyes. 
<p>
Attacks may be triggered by menstruation, other hormonal changes, emotional stress, alcohol, certain foods, or alterations in sleeping or eating habits.  People who suffer from migraines often have blood relatives who also have them.
<p>
<hr width=400 align=left size=4>
<h3>TREATMENT:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Lie down in a darkened room.
<li>Try to relax the entire body.
<li>If you suspect that your headaches are migraines - see your doctor.  You should get professional diagnosis and treatment.
<li>Your doctor may prescribe medications.  Take as directed.
<li>Learning and using relaxation and biofeedback techniques may help to prevent and      treat migraines.
</ul>

<title>FHP Health & Wellness Library: Infectious Mononucleosis</title>
</head><body>
<a name="top"></a>
<center>
<font size=6 color="#4A5A94"><b>Infectious Mononucleosis</b></font>
</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>
<p>
Infectious Mononucleosis, often called "mono", is caused by a virus called the Epstein-Barr virus.  This disease can occur at any age, but is more common in adolescents and in young adults, especially among those in close contact with schools and colleges.  Strangely, it is seldom seen in members of the same family at the same time.
<p>
<hr width=400 align=left size=4>
<p>
<b>Symptoms:</b><br>	
The symptoms of mononucleosis can vary from person to person but may include; chills, fever, aching of muscles, emotional depression, tiredness, sore throat, swollen lymph glands and skin rash.  Symptoms can vary from severe to mild.  The symptoms may last for several days to several weeks.
<p>
The diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis is done through a blood test.  Sometimes it may take several tests to confirm because tests that are negative in early stages can turn positive later.
<p>
<b>Treatment:</b><br>
Because mononucleosis is caused by a virus, no medications, including antibiotics, will affect the state of the disease.  Some medications such as pain medication and gargles can be used to make the patient more comfortable.  Bedrest during a fever and plenty of fluid are important.	
<p>
If your disease is severe or if there are special consideration a doctor may prescribe adrenal corticosteroid.  This hormone is safe in young people if there are no special reasons it should not be given and if it is given for only a short period of time (two weeks or less).  You can ask your doctor if adrenal corticosteroid is an appropriate treatment for you.
<p>
<hr width=400 align=left size=4>
<p>
<h3>Call the doctor if any of the following happen:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Temperature over 102 F.
<li>Severe constipation.
<li>Severe pain on the left side of the abdomen lasting for five minutes or more.
<li>Difficulty in swallowing or breathing.
</ul>

<h3>Stretching</h3>
Reach upward as high as possible with both hands.  Then spread your feet and reach up over your head with one straight arm while sliding the other down your opposite leg.  Put both arms behind you, hands clasped.  Pull down and stretch back strenuously, opening your chest and shoulders.  Then yawn if you feel like it, with both arms falling easily to your sides.
<h3>Brisk 5 Minute Walk</h3>
The next time you have already accumulated physical tension or are about to enter a potentially distressful situation, take a brisk five-minute walk.  This can release muscle tension, allow greater oxygenation in your brain and body, allow for mental diversion or positive affirmations.
<h3>Swimmer's Shake-out</h3>
Allow both arms to hang very loosely at your side.  Beginning with your hands, rotate each arm from fingertips to shoulder.  At the same time, let them swing gently from front to back.  This will be relaxing only if you let your arms hang loosely, rather than raise them outward to the side.
<h3>Face Loosener</h3>
Check whether your teeth are clenched.  If so, let them release so your jaw is more relaxed.  Next check out your forehead.  If you detect muscle tension there, lift your eyebrows gently and release lines of tension or fatigue.  Turn a frowning brow into a smooth, relaxed forehead.

<h3>Six Second Quieting Response</h3>
<ul>
<li>Draw a long, deep breath.
<li>Hold for two or three seconds.
<li>Exhale long, slowly and completely.
<li>As you exhale, let your jaw and shoulders drop.  Feel relaxation flow into your arms and hands.
</ul>
<h3>Focus Attention on Breathing</h3>
Without trying to change anything, simply allow your mind to be fully aware for several moments of your breathing.  Dwell on the rise and fall of your chest, the cooler air coming in, the warmer air passing out.  Be aware of whether your breaths are shallow or deep, quick or slow, comfortable or uncomfortable.  Dwell on the passage of air in and out of your right nostril for a few breaths, then you left.  Simply allow this attentiveness to settle you, to quiet distracting or racing thoughts.  It is important to accept what you observe, simply be with it.  Do not concern yourself with trying to change it.
<h3>Breathing Away Tension</h3>
<ul>
<li>Sit or lie in a comfortable position with hands open and legs uncrossed.
<li>Be aware of the weight of your entire body on the floor, bed, couch, or chair.  Your muscles need not help support your body at all.
<li>Softly close your eyes.
<li>Focus attention on your nostrils and "see" the air entering each side.  Follow its path down into your lungs, "watch" it swirling around, and "observe" it moving back up and out.
<li>As it leaves, tell yourself it is carrying away tension, pain, and disease if present.
<li>Continue for 1-5 minutes.
</ul>
<h3>THE D-A-R-E RESPONSE</h3>
<pre>
First, <b>EXHALE</b> think     <b>D E T A C H</b>
                        from stressor and imagine moving
                        it ("blowing it away") to a
                        comfortable distance where it
                        becomes small and indistinct
                                                           
Second, <b>INHALE</b> while    <b>A S S E S S I N G</b>
                        the situation and thinking
                        "courage," "strength," or the
                        like for handling it
 
Third, <b>EXHALE</b> thinking  <b>R E L A X</b>
                        and let go of any unnecessary
                        muscle tension

Last, <b>INHALE</b> thinking   <b>E N E R G I Z E</b>
                        for getting strength and courage
                        for handling the stressful
                        situation meaningfully.

</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>
<p>
Osteoporosis or "brittle bones" is a condition that affects 25 percent of women over 60 years old.  Osteoporosis is much less common and much less severe in men.  This condition is brought about by loss of bone mass and strength, and osteoporosis can lead to serious problems with broken bones.
<p>
High risk factors for osteoporosis include thin body frames, a sedentary lifestyle, and a family history for this disease.  Women who drink or smoke are at greater risk.  Osteoporosis is a "silent" disease; no symptoms exist for this condition...until a bone is broken and the condition is recognized after x-rays.  The first indication of osteoporosis may be hip or low back pain or painful swelling of a wrist after a minor fall.
<p>
X-rays which measure bone density are available.  These x-rays may be especially useful for women at high risk of osteoporosis, in determining who will benefit from estrogen replacement therapy.  Ask your doctor about your need for this test.

<h3>Home Treatment of Osteoporosis</h3>
<ul>
<li>Get regular weight-bearing exercise, such as walking; bones get bigger and stronger with exercise.
<li>Take about 1,500 mg of calcium a day; the average American diet contains 500 mg; the extra 1,000 mg can be obtained either by a large increase in dairy products (one quart of skim milk would add 1,100 mg of calcium) or by calcium supplements; five 500 mg calcium carbonate tablets, such as TUMS, will yield 1,000 mg of calcium...space the tablets over the day, and take them with meals or milk.
</ul>
<h3>When to Call a Health Professional</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you are considering estrogen replacement therapy, then call a health professional.
<li>If you experience sudden and sever back pain, then call a health professional.
</ul>

<center>
<font size=6 color="#4A5A94"><b>The Care Of Plaster Casts</b></font>
</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>

<h3>What is a Plaster Cast?</h3>
To aid in healing, a plaster cast is used to help immobilize an injured part of the body after fractures or other injuries.  Casts are applied by splinting the injured part and then wrapping it with material which hardens and gives rigid support to the injured area.
<h3>How Long Will I Wear a Plaster Cast?</h3>
The length of time that the cast remains in place depends on the amount of time needed for the injury to heal.  Some casts are needed for only 2 weeks; others have to remain in place for several months.
<h3>How Can I Take Care of the Cast?</h3>
Do not allow pressure to be placed on any part of the cast until it is completely dry.  The drying time varies depending upon thickness of the cast, temperature, humidity and so forth.  Twenty-four hours is not an unusual length of time for drying.
<p>
If the cast accidentally gets wet and a soft area appears, contact the doctor's office so that it may be repaired.
<p>
<hr width=400 align=left size=4>
<h3>Care of the Patient in a Cast</h3>
<ul>
<li>Whenever possible, raise the cast.  This decreases the possibility of swelling of the tissue underneath the cast.  For example, prop a leg cast on a pillow when in bed.
<li>Swelling may occur no matter how carefully the cast is applied.  If this happens, one or more of the following symptoms will appear:
   <ul>
   <li>Severe and persisting pain
   <li>Change in color of the flesh beyond the cast, such as a color change of blue or gray under the nails of the fingers and toes.
   <li>Numbness or complete loss of feeling in the skin beyond the cast.
   <li>Swelling of the flesh to a greater extent than before the cast was applied.
   </ul>
</ul>
If any of the above signs or symptoms occurs, contact the doctor as soon as possible.

</head><body>
<a name="top"></a>
<center>
<font size=6 color="#4A5A94"><b>Sinusitis</b></font>
</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>
<p>
Located in the front part of the skull are four pairs of bony air cavities called nasal sinuses.  The sinuses are lined with a delicate mucous membrane that continually produces mucus to flush out irritants and other invaders, including bacteria and viruses.
<p>
Mucus from the sinuses drain into the nasal cavity through tiny canals.  If the mucous membrane in the sinuses swells and impedes drainage because of irritation or infection, pressure can build up, squeeze sensitive nerves, and cause severe headaches and facial pain.  What little mucus manages to leak through the blocked openings creates an irritating  postnasal drip that results in a sore throat and cough.  The symptoms are similar to those of a cold but are more severe.  The condition is called sinusitis.
<h3>Symptoms of Sinusitis</h3>
<ul>
<li>feeling of weakness		
<li>fever		
<li>sore throat		
<li>cough		
<li>frequent and severe frontal headaches		
<li>tenderness about the face and eyes		
<li>postnasal drip		
<li>frequent episodes of heavy nasal congestion		
<li>frequent respiratory infection		
<li>symptoms of allergic nasal congestion "out of season"		
<li>thick greenish-yellow nasal excretion
</ul>
<h3>Causes of Sinusitis</h3>
The mucous membrane in the sinuses can become inflamed for a number or reasons.  The most common cause is due to an allergy.  Other causes that may lead to sinusitis are upper-respiratory infections from colds or flu, long term exposure to cigarette smoke, or development of a growth that blocks drainage.
<h3>Treatment</h3>

A mild case of sinusitis will usually clear up by itself; however, a more severe case demands attention because of the risk of infection spreading.  With treatment, nasal congestion and other symptoms (except cough) should gradually improve over the next 14 days.  Some possible treatments include:
<ul>
<li>antihistamine medication
<li>nose drops or sprays
<li>vaporizers
<li>humidifiers
<li>antibiotics 
<li>sinus irrigation
<li>surgery
</ul>
Try to avoid an environment with low humidity and excessive heat since those conditions tend to aggravate the mucous membranes.  Reduce symptoms further by applying heat to the face using an electric heating pad or a warm cloth soaked in hot water.
<p>
<hr width=400 align=left size=4>
<h3>Call Your Doctor If Any Of The Following Happen:</h3>
<ul>		
<li>Body temperature over 102 F.		
<li>Bleeding from the nose		
<li>Severe headache which does not go away after taking prescribed medication		
<li>Increased swelling over the face (forehead, eyes, side of nose, or cheek)		
<li>Blurred vision
</ul>

<p>
<h3>Why Is Smoking So Harmful?</h3>
More than 390,000 premature deaths result each year from smoking.  Studies show that smoking promotes heart disease, many types of cancer, and respiratory problems like emphysema.  Smoking can also cause other problems such as yellow teeth, bad breath, a smoker's cough, and financial expense.
<h3>What Are The Harmful Elements In Tobacco Smoke?</h3>
There are three ingredients in tobacco smoke that cause premature death: carbon monoxide, tar and nicotine.  Carbon monoxide is a poisonous gas that interferes with the body's ability to get oxygen to the cells.  Carbon monoxide can cause shortness of breath and may also affect vision, hearing, and judgment.  Tar is a sticky, black substance that contains cancer causing agents, which is deposited into the lungs and affects the lung's functioning each time a person smokes.  Nicotine is a powerful stimulant that is highly addictive.  Nicotine is the leading reason people continue to smoke.  Nicotine effects a smoker's blood pressure, heart rate, skin temperature, hormone production, muscle tension, and pain sensitivity.  
<h3>Is Smokeless Tobacco Harmful?</h3> 
Studies show that smokeless tobacco, also called chewing tobacco or snuff, can cause cancer - especially in the cheeks, gums and throat.  Smokeless tobacco can cause dental problems like tooth decay, bad breath, and leukoplakia (leathery white patches inside the mouth).  Using smokeless tobacco is as addictive as smoking cigarettes, and is just as bad for a person's health. 
<p>
<hr width=400 align=left size=4>
<h3>10 Tips to Help You Quit</h3>
<ul>
<li>Set a date for quitting.
<li>Remove cigarettes or smokeless tobacco, ashtrays, matches and lighters from your home, office, or anywhere else you use them.
<li>Keep a supply of low calorie snacks available, in addition to chewing gum, hard candy and straws to chew on.
<li>Tell everyone you are going to stop smoking.
<li>List 10 things you can do besides smoking.
<li>Decide on a reward to give yourself after going one week without smoking.
<li>Start a regular exercise program.
<li>Choose a friend, spouse or relative who will act as a support person or check into local support groups.
<li>Drink plenty of water throughout the day.
<li>Consult your doctor if you are interested in nicotine replacement therapy like the nicotine patch or gum.

</head><body>
<a name="top"></a>
<center>
<font size=6 color="#4A5A94"><b>Symptoms of Withdrawal and Recovery</b></font>
</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>
<h3>Coughing</h3>
Some people complain of the increased coughing that accompanies smoking cessation.  This coughing is a result of the stimulated cleaning mechanisms in your respiratory system.  The small hair-like structures that line the walls of the lungs begin to sweep the contaminants and phlegm out of the lungs.  Coughing is a sign that you are getting better.  Sucking on cough drops or sugarless hard candy or sipping warm herbal tea may help.
<h3>Lethargy or Tiredness</h3>
You may find yourself feeling tired as your body readjusts to functioning without the stimulation of nicotine.  Increasing your exercise level will help.  You may also try getting extra rest.  Try not to push yourself during this time; don't expect too much of your body until its had a chance to heal itself.  Divide your work into short tasks and take frequent breaks.  Change sitting positions, walk around the room, etc.
<h3>Restlessness or Concentration Difficulties</h3>
While some people become tired when they stop smoking, others become restless and fidgety and have trouble concentrating.  Stress relaxation techniques will help with this problem.  Avoid drinking alcohol which will only intensify your concentration problems.  Step up your level of physical exercise and schedule short breaks into your work day where you can stretch and/or walk around.  Divide your work into short, concise tasks when possible.  This may make your workload more manageable and promote a sense of accomplishment.
<h3>Tension, Nervousness, Irritability, Anxiety</h3>
This symptom often occurs in response to the changing level of nicotine in your system.  Be patient, your body will require a short amount of time to adjust to your new non-smoking lifestyle.  If you feel like you are short-tempered or irritable when you quit smoking, recognize that it is caused by withdrawal from nicotine.  Use stress relaxation techniques and ask your family and friends to be tolerant.  Take a walk or soak in a hot bath. Avoid caffeine intake as this may intensify the symptoms.  Drink extra water to help your body flush the nicotine through.
<h3>Constipation</h3>
Your body will need some time to adjust to its new environment without nicotine.  You need to remember to drink lots of water and fruit juices.  Add roughage to your diet, such as raw fruit and vegetables and whole grain cereals.
<h3>Sleeplessness</h3>
Don't drink coffee, tea or soda with caffeine after 6:00 p.m.  Do something which relaxes you before bedtime.  Try relaxation or meditation techniques.
<h3>Slight Sore Throat, Gums or Tongue; Dry Mouth</h3>
Tobacco use both irritates and numbs your throat.  When you stop smoking, you may feel some brief discomfort as your throat returns to its normal natural state.  Sip ice-cold water or fruit juice, or chew sugarless gum.

</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>

<h3>Cold Turkey</h3>
You probably are familiar with the phrase going cold turkey.  Going cold turkey means abruptly stopping smoking.
<p>
In particular, it refers to the addictive aspect of smoking:  cold turkey, thus, means abrupt cessation from one's addictive level of smoking.  In other words, if you usually smoke two packs of cigarettes a day, you are going cold turkey if you smoke your usual two packs today and then zero cigarettes tomorrow.  Any gradual method of stopping is not cold turkey.
<p>
Most successful ex-smokers quit cold turkey.  However, either approach--cold turkey or a gradual approach--is fine.  If you do decide to prepare for stopping with a gradual approach, you should spend less than two weeks with that approach.  Cutting down for a longer period of time can make the experience of quitting more difficult than it need be, or can become a form of procrastinating, rather than a way of stopping.
<p>
Smoke only those cigarettes you really want.  Don't empty your ashtrays.  This will remind you of how many cigarettes you have smoked each day and the sight and smell of stale butts will be very unpleasant.
<h3>Tapering</h3>
One gradual approach to quitting is "tapering."  Tapering means counting your cigarettes and smoking a predetermined fewer number of cigarettes each day.
<p>
You might, for instance, decide to reduce the number of cigarettes you smoke by five each day for six days--until the day you have chosen as your personal quit date.  On the first day of this period you would smoke your usual 30 cigarettes; on the second day, 25; on the third day, 20; fourth day, 15; fifth day, 10; and the sixth day, 5.  The next day, the seventh day, would be your quit date, and the first day that you will smoke zero cigarettes.
<p>
Other ways to taper the amount cigarettes you smoke is to smoke only 1/2 of each cigarette, smoke only during odd or even hours of the day.
<h3>Postponing</h3>
A second gradual approach to quitting is "postponing," which means that you postpone the time at which you start smoking by a predetermined number of hours each day.  Once you begin smoking each day, you do not need to count your cigarettes nor to focus on reducing the number that you smoke.  
<p>
Thus you might decide to postpone the time at which you start smoking by two hours each day for six days, until your personal quit day.  On the first day, you might begin smoking at 9 a.m.; on the second day, 11 a.m.; third day, 1 p.m.; fourth day, 3 p.m.; fifth day, 5 p.m.; and sixth day, 7 p.m. The next day, the seventh day is your quit date, and thus your first day with no cigarettes.
<p>
Keep in mind that it is not necessary to use a gradual approach to stopping.  The important step is to select a quit date and to stick to that date as your first day as an ex-smoker.  You can either go cold turkey on that day, or you can spend a few days preparing to stop by tapering or postponing.

<title>FHP Health & Wellness Library: Sodium</title>

<a name="top"></a>
<center>
<font size=6 color="#4A5A94"><b>Sodium</b></font>
</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>
<p>
Ordinary table salt is sodium chloride--40% sodium by weight.  When we talk about amounts of sodium, we talk in terms of grams and milligrams.  A gram is a unit of weight.  There are about 28 grams in 1 ounce.  There are 5.5 grams in a teaspoon.  If you divide 1 gram into 1000 parts, each part is a milligram (mg), or 1000 milligrams equal 1 gram.
<p>
Sodium is a mineral that is essential for good health.  You must have a certain balance of sodium and water in your body fluids and tissues at all times.  Sodium and water work together to maintain this balance.  Too much salt or too much water will upset the balance.  In healthy people, excess sodium is eliminated through the kidneys, and the correct balance of sodium and water is maintained.
<p>
The average American consumes about 6-18 grams of salt daily (roughly one to two teaspoonfuls).  Your body actually requires only about 0.5 grams of salt, or 0.2 grams of sodium each day.  Reducing the amount of sodium consumed may help some people avoid high blood pressure and help others normalize their blood pressure.  People with high blood pressure are more likely to develop heart disease and stroke.  Diseases of the heart and blood vessels are the number one cause of death in the United States.
<p>
Most foods in their natural state contain sodium.  However, most sodium in our diet is added to food during commercial processing and home preparation.  Therefore, in selecting foods for a controlled-sodium eating style, you must be aware of both natural sodium content and added sodium content.
<p>
When purchasing prepared and prepackaged foods, interpret the labels.  Many different sodium compounds are listed on food labels, it indicates the presence of added sodium.  Watch for the words soda and sodium and the symbol Na on labels--these identify products that contain sodium compounds.
<p>
<b>SODIUM COMPOUNDS: AVOID OR USE SPARINGLY</b>
<p>

<a name="top"></a>
<center>
<font size=6 color="#4A5A94"><b>Stress - How to Manage It</b></font>
</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>
<ol>
<li>Get enough sleep and rest.  If necessary, use an alarm clock to remind you to go to bed.

<li>Eat a balanced diet.

<li>Avoid alcohol and other drugs.

<li>Start a regular program of physical activity.

<li>Take time out from your work on a regular basis to relax and get away from it all.

<li>Avoid rushing.  Plan your time and set priorities.

<li>Take one thing at a time so you don't become overwhelmed by a problem or project.

<li>Avoid being a perfectionist.  Put your best effort into whatever you are doing, then relax and don't worry about the results.

<li>Escape for brief periods of time.  Go to a movie, listen to music, watch a sports game or take a short trip for a change of scenery.

<li>Work off anger and frustration.  Take a walk, clean the house or get involved in a hobby or project that captures your interest and demands your full attention.

<li>Develop outside interests and activities that you enjoy.  Total involvement in job or home responsibilities can make you feel isolated.

<li>Change what you can and accept what you cannot change.

<li>Don't relay on your memory.  Write down when to pick up the laundry, when library books are do, etc.  "The palest ink is better than the most retentive memory."  - Old Chinese Proverb

<li>Don't put up with things that don't work right.  If something is a constant aggravation, get it fixed or replace it.

<li>Plan ahead.  Don't let the gas tank get below one-quarter full, keep a well stocked "emergency shelf" of supplies at home and at work, etc.

<li>Make friends with non-worriers.

<li>Forget about counting to 10.  Count to 1000 before doing something or saying anything that could make matters worse.

<li>Take the scissors to your credit cards.

<li>Think of your next embarrassing situation as an episode on TV's Candid Camera.

<li>Every day, make sometime for solitude.  Allow yourself time for privacy, quiet and introspection.

<li>Schedule realistic days.  Allow ample time between appointments so you don't have to rush, worry, and apologize for being late.

<li>Talk it out.  Discussing your problems with a trusted friend can help clear your mind of confusion so you can concentrate on problem solving.

<li>Instead of doing something tomorrow, do it today; instead of doing it today, do it now.  Hard work is simply the accumulation of easy things you didn't do when you should have done them.

<li>Say "No, thank you" to extra projects, social activities, and invitations you don't have the time or energy for.

<li>Donate extra stuff to charity.  Getting rid of what you don't need makes what you do need easier to find.

<li>Do nothing which, after being done, leads you to tell a lie.

<li>Carry a duplicate car key in your wallet.

<li>Get up fifteen minutes earlier in the morning.  The inevitable morning mishaps will be less stressful.

<li>Prepare for the morning the evening before.  Set the breakfast table, make lunches, put out the clothes you plan to wear, etc.

<li>Practice preventive maintenance.  Your car, appliances, home, and relationships will be less likely to break down/fall apart "at the worst possible moment."

<li>Eliminate (or restrict) the amount of caffeine in your diet.

<li>Allow fifteen minutes of extra time to get to appointments.  Plan to arrive at the airport one hour before domestic departures.

<li>Be prepared to wait.  A paperback can make a wait in a post office line almost pleasant.

<li>Always set up contingency plans, "just in case."

<li>Pollyanna-Power!  For every one thing that goes wrong, there are probably 10, or 50 or 100 blessings.  Count 'em!

<li>Ask questions.  Taking a few moments to repeat back directions, what someone expects of you, etc. can save hours.

<li>Unplug your phone.

<li>Turn "needs" into preferences.  Our basic physical needs translate into food and water, and keeping warm.  Everything else is a preference.  Don't get attached to preferences.

<li>Take a hot bath or shower (or cool one, in summertime) to relieve tension.

<li>Wear earplugs.

<li>Create order out of chaos.  Organize your home and workspace so that you always know exactly where things are.  Put things away where they belong and you won't have to go through the stress of losing things.

<li>When feeling stressed, most people tend to breathe in short, shallow breaths.  When you breathe like this, stale air is not expelled.  Oxidation of the tissues is incomplete and muscle tension frequently results.

<li>Writing your thoughts and feelings down can help you clarify things and can give you renewed perspective.

<li>Inoculate yourself against a feared event.  Just as a vaccine containing a virus can protect you from illness, if you expose yourself to one or more of the dreaded aspects of an experience beforehand you often can mitigate your fears.  For example: before speaking in public, take time to go over every part of the experience in your mind.  Imagine what you'll wear, what the audience will look like, how you will present your talk, what the questions will be and how you will answer them, etc.  Visualize the experience the way you would have it be.

<li>Get up and stretch periodically if your job requires that you sit for extended periods.

<li>Learn to live one day at a time.

<li>Everyday, do something you really enjoy.

<li>Do something for somebody else.

<li>Focus on understanding rather than on being understood, on loving rather than being loved.

<li>Become flexible.  Some things are worth not doing perfectly and some issues are well to compromise upon.

<li>Eliminate destructive self-talk.

<li>Use your weekend for a change of pace.

<li>"Worry about the pennies, and the dollars will take care of themselves."  Take care of today the best you can and tomorrow will take care of itself.

<li>Do one thing at a time.  When you are with someone, be with that person and with no one or nothing else.  When you are busy with a project, concentrate on doing that project and forget about everything else you have to do.

<li>If an especially "unpleasant" task faces you, do it early in the day and get it over with.

<li>Learn to delegate responsibility to capable others.

<li>Don't forget to take a lunch break.  Try to get away from your desk or work area in body and mind even if it's just for 15 or 20 minutes.

<li>Have a forgiving view of events and people.  Accept the fact that we live in an imperfect world.

<li>Have an optimistic view of the world.  Believe that most people are doing the best they can.

<li>Add an ounce of love to everything you do.

</head><body>
<a name="top"></a>
<center>
<font size=6 color="#4A5A94"><b>Taking Care of Your Elderly Relatives</b></font>
</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>
<p>
Caring for an elderly relative means helping an older loved one deal with the natural changes brought about by aging.  Since people do not age at the same rate, the extent of care needed depends on the individual.  Support may range from giving comfort during tough moments to providing a place to live.

<h3>Family Involvement</h3>

Family members should be aware of what's involved because being involved helps to improve the family's skills in helping an elderly relative live as full and satisfying life as possible.  Also, by preparing families to make sound decisions, it can ease the strain of handling problems that may arise.

<h3>Aging</h3>

Aging is a slow and natural process that brings change.  In different ways, people are affected physically, socially, emotionally and financially.

<h3>Caregiving</h3>

Each family's situation is different, but you should always try to be open and honest with the elderly relatives and allow them to make decisions affecting their lives (if possible).  Also, other family members should be encouraged to express their feelings and views.  Care providers should be sure to seek help when it's needed.  It's not possible to do everything alone!

<h3>Lifestyle Guidelines</h3>

Family members should share responsibilities.  Here are some ways to help your elderly relative:
<ul>
<li>Maintain regular contact with mail, visiting and by telephone.
<li>Share special occasions such as holidays, birthdays and events involving grandchildren.
<li>Encourage elderly relatives to live in their own homes if it's possible and safe.  Provide encouragement of joining outside activities.
<li>	Offer sympathy and understanding when your relative experiences losses such as the death of a spouse or friends.
<li>Encourage good health practices by providing prompt medical care for problems.  You should also encourage a nutritious diet and exercise.
<li>Help with finances by providing financial assistance, budgeting money or help in finding your relative a part-time job.
<li>Ensure a safe living environment by taking precautions in the home.  For example, make sure rugs don't slip and install handrails for stairs or bathrooms.

<li>Plan free time for yourself.  Make relaxation a part of your daily life with something you enjoy.
<li>Seek help from other family members, friends, support groups, or adult-care professionals when you need a breather.
<li>Use laughter to help you cope.

<font size=6 color="#4A5A94"><b>Tennis Elbow And Golfer's Elbow</b></font>
</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>
<h3>What is Tennis Elbow?</h3>
Tennis elbow is an injury that involves the tendons attached to the muscles that extend the wrist and fingers.  After repetitive use of these extensor muscles, the tendon becomes overworked and inflamed.  This produces the pain on the outside of the elbow.
<h3>What is Golfer's Elbow?</h3>
A similar injury happens with the golfer's elbow except that it involves the tendons that attach to forearm muscles that flex the wrist and fingers.  The pain here is on the inside of the elbow.
<h3>What contributes to Tennis or Golfer's Elbows?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Weak muscles and/or muscle imbalances
<li>Overuse - playing excessively, repeated violent extension or twisting of the wrist
<li>Improper equipment - incorrect grip size, strings too tight, imbalance of string tension
<li>Poor playing technique - too much wrist action, jerky strokes or poor ball contact
</ul>
<hr width=400 align=left size=4>
<h3>Treatment For Tennis Elbow or Golfer's Elbow</h3>
<ul>
<li>Rest - Temporarily you may have to stop playing.  Don't aggravate the condition by continuing activity, especially if you are in pain.  Only rarely will a sling relieve the discomfort.
<li>Ice - Ice your elbow three times a day for 30 to 60 minutes in the early painful stage and for 15 minutes after active use of your arm.
<li>Stretching - Stretching will prevent stiffness by breaking down any scar tissue that may result from inflammation.
<li>Medication - Your doctor may prescribe anti-inflammatory/analgesic medication (in tablet form) or an injection of local anesthetic to help relieve inflammation and pain.  If necessary, a localized cortisone injection may also be used to relieve the pain and joint tenderness.
<li>Brace - Your doctor may recommend any of several braces, supports or molded casts designed for this problem.  A brace reduces the pressure on the inflamed tendon.  At first the brace may be worn at all times except when doing gentle exercises to avoid elbow stiffness.  Later, it will be necessary only for protection during activities using the injured arm.
</ul>
<hr width=400 align=left size=4>
<h3>Returning To Sports</h3>

Warm up -  Always warm up carefully before you play.  Put all your major joints through their completed range of motion.  Very slowly practice all of the motions you use in your sport.  Stretching and strengthening exercise help prevent injury.
<p>
The Racquet -  Use a lighter weight racquet and move your hand up a bit on the grip.  Change to a racquet that has greater spring.  Reduce your string tension.
<p>
The Stroke -   In tennis, the backhand, the serve or the overhead smash may be equally damaging to your elbow if they are not done well. The two-handed backhand tends to be easier on your elbow.  Avoid the shots that aggravate the problem.  Lessons may be necessary to alter your strokes.
<p>
The Game -  When you go back to your sport take it easy.  In tennis, at first only for short periods of  time, avoiding problem shots.  Play less time or play doubles.  In golf, start with only putting and pitch shots.  Slowly work up from a few holes to a complete game.

<h3>Exercises For Tennis Elbow or Golfer's Elbow</h3>

Weak muscles are a major contributor to the problem of tennis and golfer's elbow.  Exercise will strengthen the muscles associated with the damaged tendons.  Stretches and exercise should be avoided in the very painful stage.
<p>
<b>Elbow Stretch</b><br>

Hold your racquet arm at shoulder level in front of your body with the elbow straight.  With your hand clenched, flex the wrist as far as possible.  Return the wrist to neutral position and alternately turn the arm inward with a flexed wrist, and then outward with an extended wrist.
<p>
<b>Wrist Curl</b><br>

Sit with your injured arm resting on a table and supported by your fist, as shown.  Grasp a one-pound weight or unopened can of food and slowly raise your wrist as high as possible.  Do the exercise first with palm up, then with palm down.  As your strength improves, you can gradually increase the weight of the dumbbell.
<p>
<b>Squeezing</b><br>

Squeezing a rubber ball (racquet-ball size) will also strengthen the injured area.  If that is too difficult, start by squeezing a sponge or a wash cloth in water.
<p>
<b>Twisting</b><br>

With your arms stretched out, practice wringing out a dry terry cloth towel with both hands.
<p>

<title>FHP Health & Wellness Library: Triglycerides</title>
</head><body>
<a name="top"></a>
<center>
<font size=6 color="#4A5A94"><b>Triglycerides</b></font>
</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>
<p>
Triglycerides are one type of fat found in the bloodstream.  Triglycerides are obtained though the diet and produced in the body from carbohydrates.
<p>
High levels of triglycerides are usually caused by a diet high in calories, saturated fat, cholesterol, alcohol, and a lack of exercise.
<p>
Several studies have suggested that elevated triglycerides may increase the risk of developing cardiovascular disease.  However, the direct link with high triglycerides is hard to isolate since people with high triglycerides tend to have other risk factors such as, high blood cholesterol, low HDL cholesterol, obesity, and lack of exercise.
<p>
Fortunately, the recommendations for lowering triglycerides also help to lower other risks for cardiovascular disease.
<p>
<hr width=400 align=left size=4>
<h3>RECOMMENDATIONS FOR LOWERING TRIGLYCERIDES</h3>
<b><i>Make Healthy Food Choices:</i></b>
<ul>
<li>Decrease fat intake, especially saturated fats such as, butter, lard, coconut and palm         oils
<li>Avoid high cholesterol foods such as eggs, fatty meats, whole milk, cheese and other         foods of animal origin
<li>Avoid foods high in sugar and calories such as candy, cookies, cake, pie, etc.
<li>Eat more fish, chicken and lean meats
<li>Eat more fresh fruits, vegetables and whole grains
</ul>
<b>Increase Exercise:</b><br>
Gradually increase exercise.  Aim for continuous moderate exercise                            for 20 - 30 minutes, three days a week.
<p>
<b>Lose Weight:</b><br>
Lose weight sensibly by decreasing portion sizes and increasing exercise.                    Maintain your ideal body weight.
<p>
<b>Avoid Alcohol:</b><br>
Even moderate amounts of alcohol tend to increase triglycerides.
<p>
<h3>HOW HIGH IS HIGH?</h3>
American Heart Association standards for high triglycerides based on age and sex are as follows:
<pre>
     <b>Age</b>          <b>Males</b>      <b>Females</b>
    5 -  9          85         126
   10 - 14         111         120
   15 - 19         143         126
   20 - 24         165         168
   25 - 29         204         159
   30 - 34         253         163
   35 - 39         316         205
   40 - 44         318         191
   45 - 49         318         223
   50 - 54         313         223
   55 - 59         261         279
   60 - 64         240         256
   65 - 69         256         260
   70 +            239         289

<font size=6 color="#4A5A94"><b>Understanding Urinary Tract Infections</b></font>
</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>

<h3>What is a Urinary Tract Infection?</h3>

A urinary tract infection can occur anywhere in the urinary tract (the parts of the body that form and excrete urine).  The three most common types of urinary tract infection are:
<ol>
<li>Cystitis: Infection of the bladder.  The bladder stores urine until it can be eliminated.
<li>Urethritis: Infection of the urethra.  The urine leaves the bladder and is eliminated through the urethra.
<li>Pyelonephritis: Infection of the kidneys.  The kidneys produce the urine.
</ol>
<h3>What Causes a Urinary Tract Infection?</h3>

Cystitis and pyelonephritis are usually caused by bacteria that are normally found in the colon, stomach or feces.  These bacteria spread from the rectum or vagina to the urethra and then to the bladder or kidneys.  Urethritis is usually caused by sexually transmitted infections such as gonorrhea or chlamydia.  Females are more likely than males to get urinary tract infections.  Sexual intercourse, birth defects, urinary tract stones and bladder tumors are some causes of urinary tract infections.
<p>
<hr width=400 align=left size=4>
<h3>Symptoms of Urinary Tract Infection</h3>
The telltale symptom of urethritis is a burning sensation during urination.
<b>Cystitis may be responsible for:</b>
<ul>
<li>A frequent urge to urinate	
<li>Pain in the lower abdomen or pubic area	
<li>Blood in the urine	
<li>Not feeling well, often accompanied by a slight fever	
</ul>
Pyelonephritis can cause symptoms associated with cystitis, as well as pain in the back or side, high fever, chills, nausea and vomiting.
<p>
<hr width=400 align=left size=4>
<h3>How is a Urinary Tract Infection Treated?</h3>
Antibiotic medicines are given to treat urinary tract infections that are caused by bacteria.   Urethritis associated with sexually transmitted diseases or other vaginal infections may require more extensive treatment.  It is very important to follow exactly your doctor's instructions for taking and completing antibiotic therapy.
<h3>How Can I Lower my Risk of Getting a Urinary Tract Infection?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Urinate after sexual intercourse.
<li>Use plenty of lubrication during sexual intercourse, such as, water-soluble lubricant like KY Jelly.
<li>Drink plenty of fluids.
<li>Urinate regularly; do not suppress the urge.
<li>Wipe from front to back after a bowel movement.
</ul>

</head><body>
<a name="top"></a>
<center>
<font size=6 color="#4A5A94"><b>Varicose Veins</b></font>
</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>
<p>
Varicose veins are expanded and abnormally lengthened veins, usually in the legs and pelvic areas.
<p>
In healthy veins there are valves present to prevent blood from passing from deep veins to surface veins.  People may get varicose veins because their vein walls are weak or the valves aren't working properly or are absent, so the blood passes from deep veins to surface veins.  The surface veins are not made to withstand this added burden.
<p>
<hr width=400 align=left size=4>
<p>
<b>Symptoms</b>
<ul>
<li>Swollen legs						
<li>Muscle cramps	
<li>Tired leg muscles					
<li>Soreness behind the knee	
<li>Itchy skin over varicose veins
</ul>
<b>Complications</b>	
<ul>
<li>Ulcers and blood clotting
</ul>
<b>Risk Factors</b>
<ul>
<li>Prolonged standing on the feet			
<li>Pregnancy						
<li>Tight pantyhose, garters or corsets		
<li>Excessive weight				
</ul>
<hr width=400 align=left size=4>
<h3>Treatment:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Avoid prolonged standing or sitting in one position.
<li>Do not cross the legs while sitting.
<li>Elevate the legs whenever you can during the day.  Rest often.
<li>Put 2 inch blocks under the foot of your bed so that your legs will be gently inclined toward your heart while you sleep.
<li>Wear elastic stockings as they provide good support.
<li>Do not wear girdles, garters, pantyhose or stockings with tight elastic in the top.
<li>Exercise to keep circulation and leg muscles in good shape.
<li>If the skin over a varicose vein breaks and the vein bleeds, lie down and apply pressure until the bleeding stops.
<li>If the above treatment does not work, your doctor may advise surgery.
</ul>

<font size=6 color="#4A5A94"><b>Vegetarian Nutrition</b></font>
</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>

<h3>What is a Vegetarian?</h3>

A vegetarian is a person that relies on food of plant origin for nourishment. There are many types of vegetarians, but most eat any food from plant sources: fruits, grains, legumes (dried beans, peas, lentils, peanuts), nuts and seeds.
<ul>
<li>Vegans:  Strict vegetarians who only eat foods from plant sources.
<li>Lactovegetarian:  Eat plant foods plus dairy products.
<li>Ovovegetarians:  Eat plant foods plus eggs.
<li>Lacto-ovovegetarians:  Eat plant foods and both dairy products and eggs.
</ul>
<h3>Is a Vegetarian Diet Healthful?</h3>
	
To determine if your diet is healthy, it would depend upon the nutrients supplied by your daily food choices. The Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) claims that all vegetarians, even vegan, can be well nourished if they select their diets with care. A vegetarian diet should include protein with a good balance of amino acids; good sources of vitamin A, riboflavin, vitamin B12, vitamin D, calcium and iron; and enough calories to maintain body weight.

<h3>Important Nutrient Guidelines</h3>

If animal foods are absent from your diet, it is important to eat plant protein food combinations to "fill in" for the amino acids missing in each one. This improves the amount of amino acids and increases the use of protein by the body. Plant protein sources eaten together are called "complimentary" foods. An example would be corn and beans. Some other "complimentary" combinations are:

</pre>
<h3>Special Instructions</h3>
<ol>
<li>It is recommended for pregnant and lactating women and preschool children to include milk and eggs in their diet for good health.
<li>Protect your health by planning your meals around the food groups and their recommended daily servings.  Read the table on the back page.
</ol>
<h3>Guide To Good Eating</h3>
Anyone can eat for good health.  Just follow these two simple steps:
<ol>
<li>Eat foods from all five food groups every day. Each food group provides you with different nutrients.
<li>Eat different foods from each food group every day. Some foods in a food group are better sources of a nutrient than others. By eating several foods from each food group, you increase your chance of getting all the nutrients you need.

<font size=6 color="#4A5A94"><b>Vomiting - Help For Children Over Five Months Old</b></font>
</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>

<p>
Vomiting is the rejection of the stomach's contents.  Vomiting is a symptom of many diseases, but it is usually due to a variety of minor problems and can be treated at home. 
<p>
The major concern is the loss of body fluids from the vomiting.  Dehydration can occur if too much fluid is lost.
<h3>TIPS FOR CARING FOR A YOUNG CHILD (OVER 5 MONTHS)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Limit activities of child until illness is over or greatly improved.  Normal activities may be resumed after the vomiting has stopped for 24 hours.
<li>After vomiting, allow the child's stomach to "rest" for several hours before giving anything to drink.  Then begin to offer fluids.  At first, give sips every 10 to 15 minutes, then work up to teaspoons, tablespoons and then up to several ounces.
<li>Try ice chips or these fluids that are usually well-tolerated: 
<ul>
	   <li>Jello water
	   <li>Fruit flavored syrup drinks
	   <li>Carbonated beverages that have gone flat
	   <li>Popsicles
	   <li>Clear chicken or beef broth
	   <li>Bouillon
</ul>
<li>If the child will not take liquids, try lollipops or hard candy.  It might help to make the child thirsty and the sugar can provide some energy.
<li>Keep the child on clear liquids for at least 24 hours.  If the child insists on solid food, try saltine crackers.
<li>Don't give any medications (even over-the-counter) without telling your doctor.
</ul>
<h3>CALL YOUR DOCTOR IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING HAPPEN:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Excess drowsiness
<li>Confusion
<li>Headache
<li>Sharp or constant abdominal pain
<li>Painful or frequent urination
<li>Labored breathing
</ul>

<title>FHP Health & Wellness Library: Water - Getting Enough</title>
</head><body>
<a name="top"></a>
<center>
<font size=6 color="#4A5A94"><b>Water - Getting Enough</b></font>
</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>
<p>
Water is the most vital nutrient to our existence.  We can live a while without any food, but would die after 2 - 3 days without water.  Our bodies are made up of two thirds water.  Every living cell depends on water to carry out it's essential functions.
<p>
During hot weather the body loses a lot of fluid - usually 3 to 4 quarts and up to 3 gallons a day!  It is important to drink enough fluid to make up for this loss, otherwise dehydration could result.
<p>
Dehydration can be very damaging to the body.  It can lead to heat related illnesses such as heat stress, heat exhaustion and heat stroke.
<p>
Thirst is not a good indication of when you need to drink water.  If you wait until you're thirsty to drink, you could already be dangerously low on water.
<ul>
<li>Drink at least 8 to 10 8 oz. glasses of water daily.
<li>Do not count coffee, tea or sodas as your waters.  These beverages are diuretics.
<li>Drink cool water every 15-20 minutes even if not thirsty.
<li>Remember, when exercising, you need to drink more water.  Drink 1/2 to 1 cup of water every 20 minutes.
</ul>
<hr width=400 align=left size=4>
<h3>Try these tips to help increase your daily water intake:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Keep a cup of water with you at all times and sip it constantly.
<li>Try a straw.  This helps some people drink more.
<li>Put lemon or lime slices in the water.
<li>Keep a pitcher of water in the refrigerator.
</ul>

<a name="top"></a>
<center>
<font size=6 color="#4A5A94"><b>Whiplash</b></font>
</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>

<p>
Whiplash is an injury to the neck that is caused when the neck is whipped backward in a forceful manner - usually in a car crash or in a contact sport.  Muscles, tendons, discs, and nerves in the neck are involved.  Most of the time it is curable in one week to three months.

<h3>Symptoms:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Pain or stiffness in the front and back of the neck, either immediately following or up to 4 hours after injury.
<li>Dizziness
<li>Headache
<li>Nausea and vomiting (sometimes)
<li>Temporary numbness and weakness in one or both arms, if the spinal nerve roots are injured.
</ul>
<h3>Prevention:</h3>

To prevent whiplash, use padded headrests in your car.  Always wear a seatbelt; seatbelts have lowered the amount and severity of auto whiplash injuries. 

<h3>Treatment:</h3>

<b>Activity</b>
<br>
Your movement depends on the harshness of your symptoms.  During the acute or severe stage, rest as much as you can.  As symptoms improve, resume normal activity slowly.
<p>
<b>General Measures:</b>
<ul>
<li>Apply ice packs to the injured spot for 10 to 20 minutes each hour during the first 24 hours.

<li>After 24 hours, use ice packs or heat to relieve pain.  Heat may include hot showers twice a day in which the water beats on your neck and shoulders for 10 to 20 minutes.  Between showers, apply hot soaks to the neck, or use a heating pad a couple times a day for 10 to 15 minutes.

<li>Try to improve your posture.  Pull in your chin and stomach when sitting or standing.  Sit in a firm chair and force your buttocks to touch the back of the chair.

<li>If symptoms are severe, buy and wear a soft, padded, fabric collar (Thomas collar) until pain subsides.
	
<li>Sleep without a pillow.  Instead, roll a small towel 2 inches in diameter, or use a cervical pillow or a Thomas collar.  Poor sleeping positions delay healing.
</ul>
<b>Medication</b>
<br>
Sometimes your doctor may prescribe pain pills or muscle relaxants.  Talk to your doctor about using over-the-counter drugs such as aspirin for minor pain.

<h3>Call Your Doctor If The Following Happen:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Pain, numbness, tingling, or weakness occurs in the arm or face.

<li>New symptoms develop.

<li>Drugs produce side effects.
</ul>

<font size=6 color="#4A5A94"><b>Care of Wounds</b></font>
</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>

<p>
A wound is an injury caused by external physical forces.  An open wound is one where the skin or mucous membranes (such as of the mouth or inside the nose) have been broken.  A closed wound occurs when underlying tissues are involved and the skin and mucous membranes are intact.
<hr width=400 align=left size=4>
<pre>
<b>Type of Wound</b>     <b>Description</b>              <b>Treatment</b>

                | against a stationary   |

                | knives, broken glass,  |
                | and sharp metal        |
                | objects                |
<hr size=0><b>Laceration</b>      | A jagged, irregular    | Control bleeding; wash

</pre>
<hr width=400 align=left size=4>
<h3>Cleaning a Wound</h3>
<ol>
<li>When possible, wash hands with soap and water.
<li>Allow the wound to bleed slightly.  Apply direct pressure to the wound with a clean cloth.  Continue pressure for three minutes (clotting may take six to seven minutes).
<li>Using a clean cloth saturated with soap and water, gently wash dirt away from the wound edges.  Hydrogen peroxide may be used to bubble away old blood and clots--do not use to disinfect the wound.
<li>Flush the wound liberally with large amounts of water.
<li>First aid antiseptics should be avoided.  Instead, apply isopropyl (rubbing) alcohol on the skin around the wound, not in the wound.
<li>Cover the wound with a sterile gauze dressing and bandage.  Dressing should not be airtight.
<li>Small (less than one inch) lacerations heal faster and with less scarring if the wound edges are brought together by one or more pieces of tape (i.e., butterfly bandage).
<li>If a wound bleeds after a bandage is applied and the bandage becomes stuck, it is best to leave it on as long as the wound is healing normally.
<li>A dressing must be changed if it becomes wet.  To remove a dressing, soak it in warm water or hydrogen peroxide to soften the scab and make removal easier.
</ol>
<h3>Call Your Doctor If Any Of The Following Happen:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Constant and increasing pain at the site of wound
<li>Fever over 100
<li>Numbness at a point below the wound
<li>Blood soaks through the dressing
<li>Red streaks radiating away from injured sight
<li>Swelling at a point below the wound
<li>Skin rash
<li>Inability to move a joint below the wound
<li>Signs of infection
</ul>

Every year the American Council on Sports Medicine (ACSM) issues its exercise guidelines for developing and maintaining
fitness in healthy adults.  They form an excellent basis for an exercise program.  (Remember: check with your doctor
before starting any exercise program.)<p>
           
<h3>Recommended Exercise Guidelines</h3>

<ul>
<li>Aerobic Exercise: 3 to 5 days a week, 20 to 60 minutes of continuous activity at 60 to 90 percent of maximal heart
rate.<p>

Examples include walking, jogging, biking, swimming, dancing, rowing, skiing, skating, tennis, and racquetball.<p>

<li>Resistance Training: 2 non-consecutive days a week minimum, one set of 8 to 12 repetitions of 8 to 10 exercises that
condition the major muscle groups.  Examples include calisthenics and strength training.
</ul>

<h1>Meet Stuffee</h1>
</center>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>

<p>Stuffee is the honorary head of the FHP Fit Kids Club. Stuffee is soft and cute and cuddly.
Oh yes, and six feet tall.<p>

Designed by Jo Winger of the Pittsburgh Children's Museum, Stuffee is the center
of many FHP Fit Kids Club activities. When school groups tour FHP facilities, Stuffee can be
there to greet them. When they call the FHP Fit Kids Club hotline, they hear Stuffee give them important health tips. And when Health Awareness Lesson instructors come to their school,
Stuffee teaches kids some basic things about how their body works.<p>

That's because Stuffee has a heart. And a gall bladder, large and small intestines, liver,
lungs, pancreas, stomach, and esophagus too. All the vital organs kids need to know about --
in colorful, touchable cloth.<p>

For more information about Stuffee, please fill out the information below:<p>

<font size=6 color="#4A5A94"><b>Facts About AIDS</b></font>
</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>

<b>Q. What is AIDS?</b><br>
<b>A.</b> AIDS stands for Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome which is an illness that impairs the body's ability to fight infection.<p>

<b>Q. What causes AIDS?</b><br>
<b>A.</b> A virus called HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus).<p>

<hr width=400 align=left size=4>
<font size=4><b>HOW IS HIV SPREAD?</b></font>
<ul>
<li>Unprotected sexual intercourse with an infected person.
<li>Sharing an infected hypodermic needle or syringe.
<li>An infected mother to her baby before, during or after birth.
<li>Blood or blood products (this is very unlikely).
</ul>

HIV is <i>not</i> spread through the air, or through non-sexual everyday activities, such as:
<ul>
<li>Touching or shaking hands.
<li>Sharing food, plates, cups or utensils.
<li>Using rest rooms, water coolers or telephones.
<li>Donating blood.
<li>Swimming in a pool or using a hot tub.
<li>Being bitten by mosquitoes or any other insects.
</ul><hr width=400 align=left size=4><p>

<b>Q.	What steps can I take to reduce the chances of becoming HIV infected.</b><br>
<b>A.</b> Reduce your chances of becoming HIV infected:
<ul>
<li>Do not have sex.	
<li>Have sex with only one partner who is not infected and who doesn't use IV drugs.
<li>Don't shoot drugs of any kind. If you do use illegal drugs, never share a needle or syringe.
<li>Use a latex condom with nonoxynol-9 spermicide if you decide to have sex with anyone other than your 	partner.
<li>Only use a water-based product like K-Y Jelly if you use a lubricant with condoms. Petroleum or oil based products can break down the condoms latex.
<li>Don't mix alcohol or other drugs with sex. Alcohol and drugs can lower inhibitions and affect your 	judgment. This can put you in a high risk situation for HIV infection.
</ul>

<b>For more information about AIDS or HIV testing, consult your primary care physician.</b><p>

</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>

<h3>Prevention</h3>

The exposure to alcohol and drugs is widespread in today's society.  Even when parents teach their children not to use alcohol and drugs, other voices come along to encourage use of these harmful substances. Movies, television, music, and magazines glorify their use and mislead many into an unhealthful lifestyle.<p>

Prevention ensures that people do not develop problems in the first place.  Beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors must be directed toward a lifestyle that discourages alcohol and drug use.<p>

There are three major ways to become involved in prevention programs:<br>
1) as a parent; 2) as a citizen; and 3) as a friend.<p>

<h3>As a Parent</h3>

Our biggest hope of prevention lies with efforts directed at our young people.  Parents can raise their children to make sound decisions about alcohol and drug use. The following suggestions may help you as a parent:<p>
<hr width=400 align=left size=4>
<ul>
<li>Set an example in your own use of alcohol, prescription, and over-the-counter drugs-- avoid the use of 	illegal drugs.
<li>Supervise parties-- do not allow alcohol or drugs during social activities.
<li>Encourage other parents and those who supervise your children to provide a consistent message of no alcohol 	or other drug use.
<li>Teach your children that saying "NO" is O.K.
</ul><hr width=400 align=left size=4>

<h3>As a Citizen</h3>

Help your community stress the benefits of a life free of alcohol and other drugs.  Look to reduce the ability to get alcohol and other drugs in your community.  For example, support school, sports league, and law enforcement policies regarding the use of alcohol and other drugs by youth.  Endorse a prevention/education program for staff and students in grades K-12.<p>

<h3>As a Friend</h3>

If your friend has a substance abuse problem, do not look the other way.  Discuss with your friend the dangerous effects of alcohol or drug abuse.  Encourage your friend to seek professional help.<p>

<b>Resources</b><br>
<font size=2><i>Yellow Pages</i> -- Look under "Alcoholism", "Drug Abuse and Addiction", "Family Counselors", or "Mental Health Services" for the nearest drug treatment or mental health facility.<p>

<i>The National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence, Inc.</i> -- For referrals to treatment services in your area, write the national headquarters at 12 West 21st Street, New York, NY 10010; or call (800) NCA-CALL.<p>

<i>Alcoholics Anonymous</i> -- Write to the national office at P.O. Box 459, Grand Central Station, New York, NY 10163; or call a local chapter.<p>

<i>Student Assistance Program</i> -- Inquire through school district.<p>

<i>Employee Assistance Program</i> -- Inquire through employer.</font><p>

<title>FHP Health & Wellness Library: Ankle Sprains and Strains</title>
</head>
<body>

<a name="top"></a>
<center>
<font size=6 color="#4A5A94"><b>Ankle Sprains and Strains</b></font>
</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>

Ligaments help connect the bones to joints and provide stability during action. When the ankle is twisted severely, the ligament or the bone may give way. If the ligaments are injured, they may be stretched or "strained." If they are partially torn, this is called a "sprain." Most strains and sprains are caused by over use.<p>

<hr width=400 align=left size=4>
<font size=4><b>Symptoms:</b></font><br>
The typical ankle sprain swells either around the bony bump on the outside of the ankle or about two inches in front of and below it. This type of sprain does not need prolonged rest, casting or x-rays.  Pain and some bruising usually occur. Any standing on the ankle may be difficult during the first few days.
<hr width=400 align=left size=4>

<h3>Treatment:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Sprains and strains are best treated by keeping the injured area free of movement.  This can be done by using a elastic bandage, splint, gelatin boot or a plaster cast.  If a ligament or tendon is completely torn, you may need surgery.
<li>Rest the ankle and keep it elevated.  You may need crutches to help you walk.
<li>Wrap ice in a towel and apply it to the ankle for at least thirty minutes, preferably longer.
<li>Heat may be applied 24 hours after the injury.
<li>If medicine is prescribed, follow the directions exactly.
<li>Eat a healthy, well balanced diet.  Injuries heal best when the diet includes proteins such as meat, fish, 	low-fat dairy products and dried beans.
<li>Call your doctor if severe pain continues for more than 24 hours, or if bleeding occurs.

</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>

<h3>What Is Asthma?</h3>

Asthma is a lung disease that causes breathing problems.  The small airways in the lungs become narrow making it difficult to breathe.  This reaction in the lungs causes an asthma attack that may range from mild to life-threatening.  Although asthma cannot be cured, it can be controlled.<p>

<h3>Symptoms</h3>

Asthma symptoms include:
<ul>
<li>Coughing during or after exercise
<li>Shortness of breath
<li>Wheezing sound when breathing
<li>Tightness in the chest
</ul>

<h3>Triggers</h3>

Asthma symptoms get started or "triggered" by something that bothers the lungs.  Younger people are often affected by allergens, such as plant pollen, while older people are most affected by non-allergic types of irritants, such as smog.  You should identify and avoid as much as possible, those triggers that bring on an asthma attack.<p>

Common asthma triggers include:
<ul>
<li>Allergens (pollens, animals, some foods, house dust)
<li>Vigorous exercise
<li>Infections (flu, colds)
<li>Cold air, hot air, sudden temperature changes
<li>Household products (paints, cleaners, sprays)
<li>Emotional stress & excitement
<li>Occupational dusts & vapors (plastics, grains, metal, wood)
<li>Drugs (aspirin, heart medicines)
<li>Air pollution (cigarette smoke, auto exhaust)
</ul>

<h3>How To Control Your Asthma</h3>

Control your asthma by following three recommendations:
<ol>
<li><i>See A Doctor Regularly About Your Asthma</i> -- Your doctor can help monitor your progress and prescribe the proper treatment to control your asthma.<p>
	
<li><i>Find Out What Triggers Your Asthma And What To Do About Them</i> -- When you know what triggers your asthma, you are then in a position to take action.  For example:
<ul>
<li>Receive allergy shots to reduce your sensitivity to allergens or a yearly flu shots to minimize the risk of 	respiratory infection.
<li>Avoid sudden temperature changes (when you go in and out of air-conditioned stores in the summer).
<li>Don't smoke or stay in a room with people who do.
<li>Avoid exerting yourself, laughing too hard, or any emotionally upsetting situation.
<li>Keep dust in your home to a minimum.  Regularly clean furniture, draperies, and rugs (especially in the 	bedroom).
<li>Avoid any other known irritant (chemicals, medicines, perfumes, spray products, foods, pets, air 	pollution).<p>
</ul>

<li><i>Take Your Asthma Medicines As Your Doctor Has Prescribed</i> -- Two groups of asthma medicines can help control your asthma:<p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Bronchodilators</i> -- <b>Stops</b> asthma attacks after they have started.
<dd><i>Anti-inflammatories</i> -- <b>Prevents</b> asthma attacks from starting.
</dl></ol>
Drink plenty of fluids (6-8 glasses daily) and take all prescribed medications exactly as directed.<p>

</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>

Blood glucose monitoring can help you better control your blood sugar (glucose) level.<p>

<h3>EQUIPMENT:</h3>

The equipment needed depends on the way you test for blood glucose.  The equipment you need may include:
<ul>
<li>Lancet (finger sticker),
<li>Test (reagent) strips,
<li>Watch or clock that shows seconds,
<li>Cotton (optional for some brands),
<li>Alcohol (optional),
<li>Automatic lancet device (optional)
<li>Blood glucose (reflectance) meter (optional),
<li>Log book,
<li>Soap, water, and towel.
</ul>

<h3>STEPS:</h3>

Gather all of your equipment and read the directions carefully as each brand may have different directions. Be aware of the dates on the test strip container. Out-of-date or discolored strips should be thrown away.  You can protect the test strips from light, moisture and heat by keeping the container closed when not in use. You will need one test strip from the container. Do not cut strips in half unless your nurse or doctor has given you approval.<p>

<h3>OBTAINING A DROP OF BLOOD:</h3>
<ol>
<li>The ear lobes and sides of the finger tips (not the pads) are sites that can be used to obtain a drop of 	blood.  Change the sites regularly.
<li>Wash the site with soap and warm water.  Dry the site completely.
	<ul><li>Warm water increases blood flow.
	<li>Careful drying keeps the test accurate.
	<li>Wipe the site with alcohol only if you have been instructed to do so by your nurse or doctor.
	</ul>
<li>Twist off the cap on the lancet.  Do not touch the sterile point.
<li>If using an automatic lancet device, insert the lancet following your brand's directions.
	<ul><li>You can use alcohol to wipe the part of the device that touches the skin.
	<li>Firmly hold the device against the site.
	</ul>
<li>Puncture the skin.
<li>Gently massage the site to get a large drop of blood.
	<ul><li>The drop of blood should hang from the finger (or ear lobe).
	<li>The drop of blood must be big enough to cover all of the test pad. Note:  If you do not get a large 	enough drop of blood, repeat steps 2 to 6.  Hang your arm at your side for about 30 seconds to increase 	blood flow to a finger site.
	</ul>
</ol>

<h3>PERFORMING THE TEST:</h3>
Follow the directions on your brand for these steps.
<ol>
<li>Hold the test strip level and touch the blood drop to the pad.
	<ul><li>The blood must cover all of the pad.
	<li>Some brands do not allow you to smear blood on the pad.
	</ul>
<li>Start timing as soon as the blood touches the test pad.  The right timing is important.
<li>Wipe or blot off the test strip.
<li>Wait the amount of time prescribed in the directions to finish the test.
<li>CHOOSE VISUAL OR METER METHOD NEXT.
</ol>

<table border=1 cellpadding=5>
<tr><th width=50%>Visual Method</th><th>Meter Method</th></tr>

<tr><td>When timing is done, match the color of your test strip to the color scale on the container.</td>
<td>When timing is done, put the test strip into the meter.</td></tr>

<tr><td>1. The color that matches is your blood glucose (sugar) reading.</td>
<td>1. Follow your brand's directions.<br></td></tr>

<tr><td rowspan=2>2. If the color of your test strip falls between two colors, the blood glucose is read as the range between the two numbers (for example, between 80 and 120).<br></td>
<td>2. The number that is shown is the blood glucose (sugar) reading.</td></tr>

<tr><td>3. Some meters may need to be calibrated before use.</td></tr>
</table>

<h3>AFTER THE TEST:</h3>

Put the cap back on the lancet before throwing it out.  Use the lancet only one time.<p>

Write your blood glucose reading, date, and time in your log book.  Your nurse or doctor may tell you to write other things about your diet, exercise, and medication in your log book.  Then look at any directions your nurse or doctor has given you about adjusting your medication, diet, or exercise.  Discuss questions with your nurse or doctor.<p>

Your nurse or doctor may direct you to save your test strips.  They can be saved in a closed container for a few days.  Remember to write the date and time of the test on each strip.<p>

<h3>CARE OF EQUIPMENT:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Store all equipment in a clean, dry place.
<li>Wipe off any blood before storing the equipment.  Use a damp, clean cloth or an alcohol wipe.

<font size=6 color="#4A5A94"><b>Breathing Easier Using Your Diaphragm</b></font>
</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>

<b>What is diaphragmatic breathing?</b><p>

Diaphragmatic breathing is the most efficient way to breathe.  This is done by keeping your upper chest and shoulders still while you diaphragm and abdominal muscles do the work.<p>

<b>What are the benefits of diaphragmatic breathing?</b><p>

Daily diaphragmatic breathing can help your lungs work more efficiently and make breathing easier.  This also allows more air into your lungs.<p>

Incorrect or chest breathing takes more energy and can cause you to tire easily.<p>

<hr width=400 align=left size=4>
<font size=4><b>Tips for diaphragmatic breathing:</b></font>
<ul>
<li>Sit up in a chair or lying down with your head supported and knees bent.
<li>Put one hand on the center of your stomach and your other hand on your upper chest.
<li>Breathe in through your nose and gently push your stomach out.
<li>Slowly exhale air out through your mouth while gently pushing inward and upward with the hand on your 	stomach.  While exhaling, put your lips together as if playing a trumpet.  Try to prolong exhalation to 	twice the length of inhalation.
<li>Practice this as many times as you can throughout the day.  The best time is when you have a breathing 	treatment.
<li>With enough practice you can make diaphragmatic breathing your natural breathing pattern.

<title>FHP Health & Wellness Library: Caffeine Reduction</title>
</head>
<body>

<a name="top"></a>
<center>
<font size=6 color="#4A5A94"><b>Caffeine Reduction</b></font>
</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>

Caffeine is a stimulant that energizes your brain and body by triggering the release of chemicals into your bloodstream.<p>

More than 250-300mg of caffeine can over stimulate your nervous system and ill effects can occur that are called "coffee nerves".<p>

<h3>Symptoms of too much caffeine</h3>

Your reaction to caffeine depends on the amount that you are accustomed to and, also, on your body weight, physical condition and anxiety levels in general.  Some symptoms of "coffee nerves" include increased heart rate, nervousness, lack of sleep, irritability, muscle tension, headache, trembling, confusion, diarrhea and frequent urination.<p>

<h3>Treatment:</h3>

Abruptly cutting out caffeine may lead to a period of headache and fatigue or other withdrawal symptoms such as anxiety, depression, nausea, vomiting, muscle pain, or stiffness.  You can avoid this discomfort by tapering off caffeine gradually, by using the following guidelines.<p>

<h3>Caffeine Reduction Guidelines:</h3>

Start out on day 1 by mixing a little decaffeinated coffee with your regular coffee.  You can also do this with tea or soda.  Then every 4 to 5 days, use more decaffeinated and less regular, according to the chart below, until by the last day you've successfully switched to only decaffeinated.<p>
<pre>       <font size=4><b>Days     Decaffeinated       Regular</b>
      1-5       cup                cup
      6-9       cup                cup
      10-13     cup                cup
      14+      all decaffeinated</font></pre>

When cutting down your caffeine intake, increase the amount of water you drink.<p>

<center>
<font size=6 color="#4A5A94"><b>Cervical Syndrome</b></font> <font size=4>(Cervial Sprain)</font>
</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>

Cervical sprain is a state of abnormal bone structure in the neck.  This condition may be very painful.

<h3>What causes cervical sprain?</h3>

A sprain in the neck can be caused by faulty posture, poor sleeping positions, osteoarthritis in the neck, sport injuries and auto accidents. Irritation, injury, or pressing of the nerves in the neck may cause pain, numbness, tingling and weakness in the arm or hand.

<h3>How is cervical sprain treated?</h3>

<b>Activity:</b> The amount of activity you may engage in will vary a great deal according to the degree of your symptoms. During the severe stage, resting as much as you can will help.  Later you should be as active as your strength will allow.<p>

<b>Diet:</b> Eat a well-rounded diet with enough proteins (meat, fish, cheese) so that your body will have "building blocks" to repair injured tissues.<p>

<h3>Physicial Measures:</h3>

<b>Moist Heat:</b> Take hot showers and let the water beat on the neck and shoulders for 10 to 20 minutes twice a day. Between showers apply hot soaks to the neck (hot towels or cloths wrung out in hot water) or use a heat lamp for 10 to 15 minutes at a time, several times a day.<p>

<b>Posture:</b> Try to improve your posture. Make it a point to pull in your chin and stomach in both sitting and standing poses. When sitting, use a firm chair and force your buttocks to touch the back of the chair.<p>

<b>Sleeping:</b>  Sleep without a pillow, but use instead a cervical pillow or a small towel rolled to 2 inches in width and place it under your neck.<p>

If there are symptoms of nerve root pressure (symptoms extending in the hand or arm), your doctor will give specific instructions.<p>

<h3>Medications:</h3>

Your medications must be fitted to your own particular needs.  Do not take any medicine without telling your doctor.  If medicines are prescribed, be careful to follow the instructions on the label.<p>

<hr width=400 align=left size=4>
<i>Important!</i><br>
Call your doctor if any of the following happens:
<ul>
<li>Pain, numbness, tingling, or weakness develops in arm or face
<li>You develop side effects from prescribed medicine
</ul>

<center>
<font size=6 color="#4A5A94"><b>Exercises for Cervical Strain</b></font>
</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>

<h3>General Instructions:</h3>

Stretching exercises are an important part of treatment to relieve discomfort in your neck. They help restore motion and relieve pain from the stiffness. Follow the exercise routine prescribed by your doctor.<p>

The following exercises are more effective when performed in the shower, after a shower or following application of hot, moist towels.  Moist heat relieves pain by increasing blood flow to the muscles of your neck.<p>

Gradually increase the number of times you repeat each exercise as your condition improves, but stop when tired.  They may be done several times during the day, to help relax and relieve tension of the neck and shoulder muscles.<p>

<h3>Exercises:</h3>

Stand under a hot shower for five to ten minutes and perform the following exercises, twice daily if possible.
<ol>
<li>Stand erect. Turn head slowly as far as possible to the right. Return to normal center position and relax. Turn head slowly as far as possible to the left. Return to normal center position and relax.<p>
<li>Stand erect. Try to touch your chin to your chest, slowly. Raise head backwards, looking up at ceiling slowly.<p>
<li>Stand erect. Try to touch left ear to the left shoulder. Return to normal center position and relax. Try to touch right ear to	the right shoulder. Return to normal center position and relax.<p>
<li>Stand erect. Raise both shoulders as close to the ears as possible and hold as you count to five. Relax.	Stretch your shoulders backward as far as possible and hold, then relax.<p>
<li>Stand erect. With one hand grasp the thumb of the other hand behind the back, then  pull downward towards the floor. Take a deep breath, stand on toes, and look at the ceiling while exerting the downward pull. Hold momentarily, then exhale slowly and relax. Repeat ten times every 1-2 hours during the day.<p>
<b>Perform these exercises twice daily, preferably after a hot shower.</b><p>
<li>Lie on back, knees flexed, with a small pillow under your neck. Take a deep breath slowly, fully expanding 	chest, then exhale slowly. Repeat ten times.<p>

<h3>What is cholesterol?</h3>

Cholesterol is a fatty substance that your body makes and uses.  It can be found in your blood and is in all body cells.<p>

Cholesterol is also found in animals.  Foods from animals, like meats, milk, eggs, fish, and poultry give us dietary cholesterol.  Eating too much dietary cholesterol can be unhealthy.<p>

<h3>Why is too much cholesterol harmful?</h3>

Too much cholesterol in your blood is a major cause of fatty deposit build-up along the inside of the blood vessels.  This build-up (atherosclerosis) puts you at risk for heart disease and stroke.<p>

When a vessel to the heart is clogged, less blood can flow to the heart.  This damages your heart and you may feel pain in your chest (angina).  If part of your heart gets no blood supply, your heart is permanently damaged and you may have a HEART ATTACK.  When a vessel to the brain is clogged, less blood can flow to the brain and possibly cause a STROKE.<p>

<h3>What is HDL and LDL?</h3>

HDL and LDL are two kinds of cholesterol.  HDL (high-density-lipoprotein) removes the excess cholesterol from the walls of your blood vessels to the liver and then out of your body.  HDL is often called the "good" cholesterol.<p>

LDL (low-density-lipoprotein) carries and leaves cholesterol on the walls of your blood vessels.  LDL is often called the "bad" cholesterol.<p>

<h3>How is cholesterol measured?</h3>

Cholesterol is measured by a simple blood test.  The National Cholesterol Education Program recommends that all adults have their blood tested every few years and actively try to keep their cholesterol at normal levels.<p>

<h3>What does my cholesterol test result mean?</h3>

Having a high amount of cholesterol in your blood can indicate your risk for heart disease.  Your individual risk depends on many other factors like, heredity, age, other medical conditions, your diet, stress level, lack of exercise, being a smoker.<p>

Your cholesterol level is measured milligrams per deciliter (mg/dl).  Three general risk categories are:
<pre>     Normal                         200 mg/dl or less
     High normal/borderline risk    200 to 239 mg/dl
     Definite risk                  240 mg/dl and above</pre>

<h3>Should I lower my cholesterol level?</h3>

Your risk of getting heart and blood vessel disease depends not only on your cholesterol level but on your other risk factors.<p>

Your doctor can determine your overall "risk profile" and whether you should try to lower your cholesterol, and by how much.<p>

A low-fat, low-cholesterol diet can do the job for most people at moderate risk; those with high cholesterol levels may need medication and dietary changes in order to lower their cholesterol.<p>

It is estimated that lowering blood cholesterol 1% can reduce the risk of heart disease by 2%.<p>

<h3>What is a cholesterol-lowering diet?</h3>

Food choices that are low in fat, especially saturated fats and low in cholesterol.  It is a modification of what you normally may eat.

<h3>What is saturated fat?</h3>

Saturated fats are usually found in foods of animal origin (eggs, meat, lard, butter, cream, milk, etc.).  Some vegetable fats (palm, coconut oils), chocolate, most shortenings, some margarines and many dairy substitutes also contain saturated fats.  They're usually hard at room temperature.

<h3>What are polyunsaturated oils?</h3>

Vegetable oils (safflower, sunflower, and corn are best, followed by soybean and cottonseed).  Some margarines (liquid and tub varieties are best).

<h3>Which foods have cholesterol?</h3>

Only foods of animal origin contain cholesterol, like meats, fish, poultry, dairy products and egg yolks.

<h3>How do I change my diet?</h3>

See your physician for advice before making major changes in your diet.  Learn what foods are lower in saturated fats and/or cholesterol and chose to eat them at meals.  Be aware of hidden fats when buying foods.  Prepare foods the low-fat way and make wise choices when eating out.<p>

<h3>What are some examples of low-fat, low-cholesterol foods?</h3>
<ul>
<li>FISH, including "white-fish", haddock, swordfish, halibut, trout, tuna, salmon.
<li>LOW-FAT DAIRY PRODUCTS, including nonfat milk, uncreamed cottage cheese, skim-milk cheeses (ricotta, 	mozzarella, gouda), and skim-milk yogurt.
<li>LEAN POULTRY, such as chicken, turkey, or rock cornish hen.
<li>LEAN MEATS, like veal, extra lean cuts of beef, lamb or pork.
<li>All FRUITS, VEGETABLES, GRAINS, HERBS and SPICES.
</ul>

<h3>What are the diet recommendations for cholesterol, and fat?</h3>

The American Heart Association has developed a "heart-smart" diet which has been endorsed by the National Cholesterol Education Program.  They recommend the following for all adults:
<ul>
<li>Cholesterol: no more than 300 mg/dl per day
<li>Total fat: no more than 30% of day's total calories
<li>Saturated fat: no more than 10% of day's total calories
<li>Polyunsaturated: no more than 10% of day's total calories
</ul>

<h3>Are there other things I should do to protect my health?</h3>

Yes.  Maintain proper weight.  Exercise regularly to keep heart and lungs strong.  Don't smoke.  Limit alcohol use, no more than 2 drinks per day.  Have regular physical exams.  It is recommended that persons age 20 or older have their blood cholesterol level checked at least once every 5 years.<p>

<center>
<font size=6 color="#4A5A94"><b>HDL's and Your Heart</b></font>
</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>

HDL (high density lipoprotein) cholesterol is considered "good" cholesterol.  It is good because it helps to get rid of LDL (low density lipoprotein), or "bad" cholesterol that deposits on the inside walls of the arteries.  HDL carry the LDL away from the arteries to the liver where the body can eliminate it.<p>

Most people know that high levels of the bad cholesterol (LDL) increase the risk of having a heart attack.  Having too little HDL can also increase the risk.  If your HDL level is below 35 mg/dl, it could it be dangerous.<p>

<hr width=400 align=left size=4>
<font size=4><b>TO RAISE HDL</b></font><p>
Fortunately, you can raise HDL by making some lifestyle changes:
<ul>
<li><i>Diet</i> - Reduce fat intake.  Especially avoid foods high in saturated fat  (such as butter, coconut oil, 	lard, palm oil).
<li><i>Weight Control</i> - Maintain your ideal body weight through proper diet and exercise.
<li><i>Exercise</i> - Get regular exercise such as walking, biking or swimming.
<li><i>Stop Smoking</i> - Not only will it improve HDL levels but it also is an important factor in improving your 	health.
</ul>
<hr width=400 align=left size=4><br>

Some people may require medications in addition to these changes in medications. Talk to your doctor.<p>

<center>
<font size=6 color="#4A5A94"><b>Common Colds</b></font>
</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>

The common cold is caused by a virus.  Colds are not serious and usually pass after 7 to 14 days.  However, complications such as sinusitis, ear infection, bronchitis, and pneumonia can occur.  Children and older adults are at the highest risk for complications.<p>

Colds are spread by close contact with a person who is coughing or sneezing.  The most common way to catch a cold is by shaking hands or touching something the person has touched and then touching your mouth, nose, or eyes.<p>

<hr width=400 align=left size=4>
<font size=4><b>SYMPTOMS:</b></font><p>
Symptoms of a cold include:  coughing, chills, a runny nose, red and watery eyes, sore throat and an achy body.

<h3>PREVENTION:</h3>
Increase your resistance to colds by taking care of yourself:  eat right, exercise regularly and get enough sleep at night.  Decrease your exposure to cold viruses by keeping your distance from people that have colds and washing your hands often.

<h3>TREATMENT:</h3>
The best treatment for a cold is plenty of rest and drinking lots of fluids.  Over the counter medications such as acetaminophen, nose drops, cough medicines, and throat lozenges may help to relieve symptoms.  There is no medication that can cure a cold.  Antibiotics are sometimes given to cure secondary infections.
<hr width=400 align=left size=4>

<h3>CALL YOUR DOCTOR IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING HAPPEN:</h3>
<ul>
<li>A temperature over 101 for more than 24 hours
<li>Bloody discharge from nose or mouth
<li>Chest pain or shortness of breath
<li>Earache
<li>A severe, long lasting sore throat

</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>

Cold sores, or fever blisters, are blisters that appear around the mouth area caused by the herpes virus type I.  Cold sores are common and reoccur anytime.  Usually an outbreak may last 5 to 10 days and are very contagious when the blisters are present.<p>

Cold sores form into red blisters, clustered together and may include painful, itchy and tingling feelings. These blisters fill up with fluid during the infection which later dries up and then disappear. <p>

Presently, there is no cure, drug or vaccine to prevent the herpes virus.<p>

Recurrence of cold sores may be caused by:
<ul>
<li>Illness
<li>Trauma
<li>Stress
<li>Colds
<li>Fever
<li>Prolonged sun exposure
</ul>

<h3>Prevention:</h3>

Since cold sores are contagious, AVOID:
<ul>
<li>Sharing drinking glasses and eating utensils
<li>Kissing anyone
<li>Other physical contact
</ul>

<h3>Treatment:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Let the infection run its course - it will soon heal itself
<li>Reducing anxiety or stress during the outbreaks
<li>Washing your hands often to avoid further infection and spreading the virus
<li>Blistex&reg; or Campho-Phenique&reg; may soothe the pain 
<li>Antibiotic ointment
</ul>

<h3>Call You Doctor If:</h3>
<ul>
<li>You're unsure of the infection
<li>Cold sore lasts more than 2 weeks
<li>You have a fever, headache, and muscle aches
</ul>

<font size=6 color="#4A5A94"><b>Constipation</b></font>
</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>

Constipation is the passage of hard, dry stools. If you pass soft stools you are not constipated regardless of how irregular you might be. The need for a bowel movement every day is a misconception. Some people have bowel movements only once or twice a week. As long as the stools are soft, this is perfectly normal.<p>

The most common cause of constipation is not going to the bathroom when your body signals you to go. After "holding it" for awhile, the urge goes away. The large intestine then draws water from the stools and they become dry and hard to pass.<p>

<hr width=400 align=left size=4>
<font size=4><b>PREVENTION:</b></font><br>
Diet and regular exercise are important in preventing constipation. Increase fiber in your diet by eating more fresh fruits and vegetables and whole grain breads and cereals. Drink plenty of liquids, especially water and juices. Also increase your physicial activity. Take the time to go to the bathroom when you have the urge.<p>

<font size=4><b>TREATMENT:</b></font><br>
Increase fruits, fruit juices and water. Set aside unhurried time for bowel movements. Avoid laxatives if possible. Use a stool softener or very mild laxative if necessary or ask your doctor about taking an enema.
<hr width=400 align=left size=4><p>

<h3>CALL YOUR DOCTOR IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING HAPPEN:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Blood in the stools.
<li>If constipation and other changes in bowel movements occur and are persistent.

</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>

If you have diabetes, your body cannot use the food that you eat in the proper way.  Normally, when a person eats, the food is broken down into blood glucose (blood sugar).  This glucose (sugar) is carried to all the cells of the body for fuel.  Insulin, a hormone made in the pancreas, acts as a "key" to let the glucose into the cells.<p>

In people with diabetes, the body does not make enough insulin or does not use the insulin properly.  The result is that the digested food, or glucose, builds up in the blood.  The cells cannot get the energy that they need, because the insulin is not there to let the glucose into the cells.<p>

Treatment of diabetes involves three things:  food, exercise, and medication. Food raises the blood glucose levels, exercise and medication lower blood glucose. Medication may include insulin or oral medication, which helps make any existing insulin more effective. The diet given to people with diabetes is used to help manage blood sugar levels and body weight; it is based on the Food Guide Pyramid, and follows the same dietary recommendations as those people without diabetes. With some practice at meal planning, you can eat the same foods as the rest of your family, so special "dietetic" foods are not necessary.<p>

The Exchange System is the name given to the diet for people with diabetes. An exchange is another name for a serving of food. There are six exchange lists to help make your meal plan work. Each list contains foods that are similar in nutrient content. Using the exchange lists and following your meal plan will give you a variety of food choices, and will help control the amount of food that you eat each day. This balance of food, along with exercise and medication (if necessary) are what give you good blood glucose control.<p>

The food that you eat is made up of three components:  carbohydrates, proteins, and fat.  These are the components that are controlled in a diabetic diet.<p>

Carbohydrates are both simple sugars and starchy foods.  Simple sugars are foods like table sugar, jelly, honey, and sweets, and should be limited as they are most likely to raise blood glucose levels. Breads, cereals, vegetables, fruits, and milk products are called complex carbohydrates.  Complex carbohydrates will not raise blood glucose levels as quickly as simple sugars.  The amount of total carbohydrates that you eat during the day will depend on your specific meal plan.<p>

Proteins are foods that are necessary in the body for tissue repair, muscle building, and growth.  They are found primarily in meat, fish, poultry, eggs, and cheese.<p>

Fats are the most concentrated source of energy.  Fats contain twice as many calories as carbohydrates or proteins.  People with diabetes should limit their daily fat intake, and should try to choose fats from vegetable origins (such as corn oil) instead of fats from animal origin (such as lard or bacon).  The amount of fat that you eat in a day will also depend on your specific meal plan.<p>

Your meal plan will be given to you by your health care professional.<p>

The foods in the fat list have been divided into two groups, saturated fats and unsaturated fats.  Individuals who are controlling cholesterol intake should choose foods from the unsatured fat group.  Remember that, gram for gram, fat has twice as many calories as carbohydrate or protein. One serving of fat contains about 5 grams of fat and 45 calories.<p>

Moderate amounts of some "forbidden" foods can be incorporated into the diabetic meal plan.  When these foods are used, the exchanges must be counted, and they must be substituted for other foods.  The following list contains average exchange lists for many of these foods.  Because they are considered simple sugars and are likely to raise blood glucose levels, the portion sizes are very small.  Check with a registered dietitian for advice on when and how often these foods can be consumed.<p>

<font size=6 color="#4A5A94"><b>Diabetes Foot Care</b></font>
</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>

Foot care is important, especially if you have diabetes or poor circulation.<p>
<h3>SIGNS TO WATCH FOR:</h3>
<ul>
<li>cold or swollen feet
<li>lack of sensation (feeling) 
<li>painful, burning or tingling
<li>slow healing of sores on the feet
</ul>

<b>1.  Check Your Feet Daily</b><p>

Look for any infection (redness, swelling, pus, or pain), dry skin, cracks, blisters, cuts, and any changes in skin color or temperature.  Examine the tops and bottoms, between the toes, and around the toenails.  Use good light; a mirror or magnifying glass can be helpful.<p>

<b>2.  Wash Your Feet Daily With Warm Water and Mild Soap</b><p>

Test the water temperature with your wrist before putting your feet in the water.  It is not necessary to soak your feet, it could even be harmful.<p>

Dry your feet well, especially between the toes.  Use a mild lotion or skin cream daily for dry skin.  You may use lanolin, vegetable oil, Crisco, Vaseline, cold cream, Nivea, and Eucerin.  Do not use creams or lotions between your toes or on open cuts.<p>

Use a little powder for sweaty/perspiring feet.  You may use nonperfumed powder, talcum powder, or cornstarch to help keep your feet dry.  Do not let the powder cake, especially between toes.<p>

Use  a small piece of plain gauze, cotton, or lamb's wool between toes if your toes overlap or if you have trouble with wetness between your toes.<p>

<b>3.  Cut Your Toenails Straight Across With Nail Clippers</b><p>

It will be easier to cut your toenails after bathing, when they are softer.  Use a file (emery board) to remove sharp edges after you have cut the nails.<p>

Do not treat ingrown toenails or corns yourself or use any chemicals (like iodine) or corn and callus removers.  Razor blades, scissors, or other tools to cut toenails, corns, or callouses should not be used.  Call your doctor or nurse to get proper care.<p>

<b>4.  Wear Proper Shoes and Socks</b><p>

Your shoes should be wide and long enough to allow toes to wiggle without pressure.  Shoes should be comfortable, fit well and have good support.  Avoid shoes with seams or buckles that rub on your feet and open shoes and sandals should not be worn if you have foot problems.<p>

To protect your feet, do not go barefoot, especially on hot sand or concrete.  Shake out shoes (to remove small objects) before putting them on, and wear clean, dry socks or stockings every day.  Socks should be colorfast and fit well.  Tight socks, stockings, or garters with elastic tops should also be avoided.<p>

<b>5.  Exercise Your Feet</b><p>

Walking or doing other exercises your doctor or nurse has shown you can help your circulation.<p>

Remember to wear sturdy, comfortable shoes when walking or exercising and to check your feet afterward for blisters, cuts, or redness.  If you have pain or an open sore that rubs the shoe, avoid exercises that will further irritate the sore.<p>

<h3>General Reminders</h3>
<ol>
<li>If you need help in caring for your feet, ask family or friends for assistance.
<li>Do not put heat or cold packs directly on your feet (no heating pads, hot water bottles, or ice packs).  Your feet may not have enough feeling to warn you of injury.  Wear extra cotton socks or use a blanket to keep your feet warm at night.
<li>No smoking. It is bad for your circulation. Crossing your legs also cuts down the circulation to your feet.
<li>Eat a balanced diet.  Limit the amount of cholesterol, saturated fat, and caffeine in your diet.
<li>First aid for minor cuts and scratches:
	<dl><dd>a. Wash the area with warm water and mild soap.
	<dd>b. Dry your foot.
	<dd>c. Cover the area with a dry, sterile bandage.
	<dd>d. Use paper tape instead of adhesive tape.</dl>
<li>Call your doctor or nurse if you have a foot infection (pain, tenderness, swelling, redness, pus, or a warm/hot area), an ingrown toenail, a problem cutting your toenails, or any foot problems or questions.  Remember: early treatment can prevent major foot problems.

</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>

<b>What is Gestational Diabetes?</b><p>

Gestational diabetes is a kind of diabetes that happens only during pregnancy.  Diabetes means that your body does not make enough insulin.  Insulin helps your body use food, it acts as a key to let the sugar from food into your cells.  When there is not enough insulin, the sugar does not go into your cells, instead it stays in your blood as "blood sugar."  Having diabetes means that your blood sugar is too high.<p>

<b>How Do I Know if I Have Gestational Diabetes?</b><p>

Your doctor will do a blood sugar screening test during the sixth month of your pregnancy.  If the results of this test are high, your doctor will also do a glucose tolerance test.  The glucose tolerance test will tell your doctor if you have gestational diabetes.<p>

<b>Are There Any Signs or Symptoms of Gestational Diabetes?</b><p>

Some women with gestational diabetes have increased thirst and hunger, go to the bathroom more often, and feel weak.  You may have one, all, or none of these symptoms, therefore it is very important to have the screening blood sugar test during the sixth month of your pregnancy.<p>

<b>Will Gestational Diabetes Hurt My Baby?</b><p>

Your baby is not at greater risk for birth defects.  However, gestational diabetes can cause some problems to your baby.  If you have gestational diabetes, your baby may get too big, have low blood sugar at birth, have a hard time breathing, and may have slightly yellow skin (jaundice).  These problems can be treated, though.  Your baby will most likely NOT be born with diabetes.<p>

<b>Will Gestational Diabetes Hurt Me?</b><p>

Gestational diabetes might make your blood pressure go up, which can cause your feet and ankles to swell.  You may also have more urinary tract infections during your pregnancy.  Having gestational diabetes also increases your chances of getting diabetes later in life.  About half of the women who get gestational diabetes will develop type II (non-insulin-dependant) diabetes later in life.<p>

<b>How Do I Treat Gestational Diabetes?</b><p>

Some women will have to take oral medicine or insulin to help control gestational diabetes.  Your doctor will determine whether or not this will be necessary for you.  All women with gestational diabetes must have good eating habits.  A weight gain of 25-35 pounds over nine months is normal, and a good meal plan will help keep your weight gain within a normal range.  Some general guidelines include eating regularly, not skipping meals, and avoiding alcohol or tobacco while pregnant.  Ask your health care provider for more information on developing a meal plan that works for you.<p>

Diarrhea is the passage of watery stools, usually repeated several times a day.  Diarrhea is caused when the intestines become over-stimulated and empty themselves before the excess water can be reabsorbed by the body.  The cause is usually an infection or irritation in the digestive tract.  It can also be caused by stress.<p>

Diarrhea can be a symptom of various disorders if it is long-lasting or accompanied by severe pain.  Most often, diarrhea lasts a short time.  It is one way the body can get rid of infection.<p>

<h3>TREATMENT:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Clear liquids only for the first 24 hours (i.e. water, bouillon, apple juice, ginger ale,      etc.)
<li>Avoid milk products for up to three days
<li>Bed rest if possible 
<li>Avoid spicy foods, fruit, alcohol and coffee for at least 48 hours after the symptoms have disappeared
<li>Because diarrhea usually helps to clear the body of infection, try not to use antidiarrheal medicines for the 	first six hours. Then use only if the diarrhea causes cramping and discomfort.
</ul>

</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>

One of the best treatments for diarrhea is to let the bowel rest.  This can be done by avoiding solid foods for a day or two.  This gives the bowel time to heal itself.<p>

Oral rehydration therapy is helpful in preventing dehydration and promoting normal bowel functions.<p>

Some oral rehydration solutions such as <b>Pedialyte</b>, <b>Ricelyte</b>, and <b>Oralyte</b> can be purchased without a prescription in many drug stores.<p>

A child with diarrhea can also be treated with small amounts of clear liquids.  Follow these guidelines when feeding your child the clear liquids:<p>

<b>INFANTS (under 1 year):</b>  ounce every 20 minutes. Do not give the child more than the specified amount.<p>

<b>CHILDREN (over 1 year):</b> 1 ounce every 30 minutes. Do not give the child more than the specified amount.<p>
<hr width=400 align=left size=4>
<b><i>Clear Liquid Foods:</i></b>
<ul>
<li>16 oz. water plus  teaspoon salt and 1 tablespoon sugar 
<li>Sweetened tea
<li>Apple, grape or cranberry juice
<li>Sprite, 7-Up 
<li>Jell-O or Jell-O water
<li>1 bouillon cube in 1 quart water
</ul>

<center>
<font size=6 color="#4A5A94"><b>Guidelines for Weight Gain </b></font> <font size=4>(High Calorie)</font>
</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>

This diet is designed to promote good health through weight gain or high calorie weight maintenance.  A person who is well-nourished will experience better response to medical treatment, more rapid recovery from surgery, more resistance to infection, as well as feeling and looking better.<p>

A high calorie diet should include a balance of protein, carbohydrate and fat.  By choosing foods from each of the Basic Food Groups (milk, meat or protein, vegetable and fruit, and grain group) you can safely and steadily gain weight without jeopardizing your health.

<h3>WAYS TO INCREASE YOUR CALORIE INTAKE:</h3>
<ol>
<li>If you find that you cannot eat large portions at once, do not get discouraged.  You can effectively increase 	your intake by eating small meals frequently.<p>
<li>Avoid drinking low calorie beverages such as coffee, tea, water or diet soda with meals, as they create a "full 	feeling" and add few calories.  Try fruit juices or milkshakes (see recipes).<p>
<li>Having high calorie beverages between meals is often the easiest way to boost calorie intake.  Milkshakes can be 	prepared at home (see recipes) or purchased at fast food establishments.  Instant breakfast powder ready to 	mix with milk is available at grocery stores.  Nutritional supplements such as Ensure Plus, Sustacal, Isomil, 	Prosobee, and Resource are available at most drug stores.  Supplements should not be used as a substitute for 	regular meals, but should be taken with or without meals.<p>
<li>Add additional calories to your meals by increasing your use of fats, especially unsaturated fats*.<p>
	<dl><dt><b>Foods High in Fat Include:</b>  Vegetable oil*, margarine*, butter, mayonnaise*, cream, Mocha        Mix*, sour cream, cream cheese, whipped cream, seeds*, nuts*, peanut butter*, avocado*, cheese, salad            dressing*.<p>
	<dt><b>Ideas:</b>
	<dd>margarine or butter on bread or vegetables
	<dd>mayonnaise on sandwiches and salads
	<dd>cream or Mocha Mix on cereal
	<dd>sour cream dip with vegetables
	<dd>whipped cream on pies, fruit, pudding or hot chocolate
	<dd>peanut butter with apple, banana, pear or celery
	<dd>cheese toast for breakfast</dl><p>
<li>Dried fruits and fruit juices can also provide a concentrated source of calories.<p>
	<dl><dt><b>Ideas:</b>
	<dd>raisins and dates on hot or cold cereal
	<dd>grape, cranberry or apple juice between meals
	<dd>granola and fruit in yogurt</dl><p>
<li>Have ready to eat snacks available.<p>
	<dl><dt><b>Ideas:</b>
	<dd>nuts, dried fruit, fruit juice, candy, popcorn,	crackers and cheese, granola, ice cream, yogurt.</dl><p>
<li>Add nonfat dry milk to hot cereal, scrambled eggs, cream soups, casseroles, etc. Try concentrating one glass of liquid milk by adding two tablespoons of dry milk.<p>
<li>If you are intolerant to milk, you may want to try "Mocha Mix", "Lactaid" milk, "Mocha Mix" ice cream, fruit flavored yogurt, or a milk free nutritional supplement such as Ensure, Sustacal or Isomil.
</ol>

<h3>BREADS AND CEREALS</h3>

<i>High-fiber breads and cereals:</i> Whole wheat bread, whole meal bread, rye bread, Boston Brown bread, All-bran cereal, Grape Nuts, Shredded Wheat, Wheat Bran, Puffed Wheat, Bran Chex, Oatmeal.<p>

<i>Low-fiber breads and cereals:</i> French bread, white bread, donuts, pastries, cake, croissants, Farina, Cream of Wheat.

<h3>VEGETABLES</h3>

High-fiber vegetables: Fresh vegetables, i.e., broccoli, brussels sprouts, cabbage, carrots, celery, green beans, tomato, parsnips, turnips, rutabagas, onions, potato, peas, baked beans.<p>

Low-fiber vegetables: Strained vegetable juice, lettuce, cooked asparagus, winter squash, tomato sauce.

<h3>MISCELLANEOUS</h3>

<h3>What is a Low-Purine Diet?</h3>

A low-purine diet is needed for the presence of a high blood uric acid level.  Uric acid crystals may form around the joints, causing the painful condition of gout.  Uric acid is made from dietary purine as well as simple compounds not of dietary origin.

<h3>Special Instructions</h3>
<ol>
<li>Drink plenty of fluids.  Fluids prevent the urine from being concentrated in solutes.  Between attacks, an 	intake of two quarts of water per day is recommended. 
<li>Obesity contributes to an increased level of uric acid.  A well-balanced diet with moderate caloric restriction 	is recommended.  Sudden weight reduction and fasting can make gout worse. 
<li>To minimize an increase of uric acid during a gout attack, restrict meat, fish or chicken to a 3 oz. per day.
</ol>

<ol>
<li>Avoid all salt, in cooking and at the table.
<li>Avoid medicines, laxatives, and salt substitutes unless prescribed by a physician.
<li>Limit use of processed and convenience foods.
<li>On food items with a nutrition label, the sodium content per serving may be indicated.  In general, all foods 	that have less than 250 mg. <i>per serving</i> are allowed.  
<li><i>Fresh</i> and <i>frozen</i> vegetables, meat, and fish are recommended. If using canned foods, rinse well 	under water for one minute.
<li>Use salt substitutes <i>only</i> on the advise of your physician.

<font size=4>(For Herpes Control)</font>
</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>

<h3>Purpose:</h3>

Herpes, a very contagious orally and sexually transmitted disease, has no cure; and outbreaks can be very painful.  The following meal plan may help control pain associated with herpes outbreaks.<p>

<b>Note:</b> If you think you may have herpes but are not sure, see your doctor immediately before attempting treatment at home.

<h3>Special Instructions:</h3>

The basis of the following meal plan is limiting foods high in the amino acid arginine, and increasing consumption of foods high in the amino acid lysine.  Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins, a part of the foods we eat.  Proteins are also found in viruses, like the herpes virus.  By limiting certain "building blocks" and increasing the amount of others, the proteins in the herpes virus may not be as strong, and the outbreaks should be less painful.  Listed below are foods high in both arginine and lysine:<p>
<pre>
<font size=5><b>High Lysine Foods</b></font> (Choose These)                    

Fresh fish       Cow's milk            Mung bean sprouts
Shark            Mung beans, cooked    Cottage cheese, dry                 
Canned fish      Pork                  Brewer's yeast
Chicken          Cheese, all types     Crustaceans
Beef             Beans, cooked         Soybeans, cooked
Goat's milk      Lima beans            Eggs

<font size=5><b>High Arginine Foods</b></font> (Limit These)

Hazel nuts       Sesame seeds          Pecans
Brazil nuts      Cashews               Whole wheat bread
Peanuts          Carob powder          Oatmeal, cooked
Walnuts          Coconut               Raisins

<h3>What is Diverticulosis?</h3>

Diverticulosis means the presence of several diverticula.  A diverticulum is a pouch-like area which balloons out from the large intestine, usually in the colon.

<h3>Who has Diverticulosis?</h3>

Obese people are more prone to diverticulosis than thin people.  The condition is not spread from person to person and is not a sign of cancer.  About 30 percent of all people over the age of 45 have diverticulosis.  Many people with diverticulosis have no symptoms due to the diverticula.  However, many have an irritable colon along with diverticulosis, and this requires treatment.

<h3>How is Diverticulosis treated?</h3>

<b>Activity.</b> Get into a state of good physical condition by daily exercise.<p>

<b>Diet.</b> A diet with high roughage is best for people with diverticulosis.  Increased roughage can be taken in the form of bran fibers or some medications which may be suggested.<p>

<b>General Measures.</b> Try to have a bowel movement at approximately the same time every day; spend at least 10 minutes in the attempt.  Do not strain.  The best time for most people to have a bowel movement is soon after breakfast.  Use a heating pad on the stomach, if needed for pain or spasms.<p>

<b>Medications.</b> Medicines, if required, must be fitted to your own particular needs.  Do not take any medicine (not even medicine you buy without a prescription) without telling your doctor.  If drugs are prescribed, carefully follow the instructions on the label.<p>

<h3>IMPORTANT</h3>
Notify your doctor if any of the following happens:
<ol>
<li>Severe pain in the abdomen not relieved by the measures already outlined.
<li>Temperature over 100 F.
<li>Bleeding is evidenced by black or tar-looking bowel movements or bright red blood appearing at the anus.
<li>Swelling or bloating of the abdomen.
</ol>

<b>Note:</b> Diverticulosis is dangerous only when diverticula become infected, rupture, or bleed.<p>

<ol>
<li>Avoid foods containing indigestible roughage such as celery and corn, and use bran to prevent constipation.  	Avoid straining while at stool.
<li>Add bulk to stools by eating fruits and vegetables with a high fiber content, i.e., seedless grapes, fresh 	peaches, carrots, and lettuce.
<li>Avoid extremely hot or cold foods and fluids, as they cause gas.
<li>Avoid alcohol; it irritates the bowel.
<li>If overweight, reduce your weight.  Excess weight aggravates the symptoms.
<li>Exercise moderately.
<li>Eat a high fiber diet, i.e., fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grain bread, and wheat or bran cereal.
<li>Use natural laxatives.
<li>Drink plenty of fluids.
<li>Don't smoke; it irritates the gastric mucosa.

</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>

<h3>What is Esophageal Reflux?</h3>

Esophageal reflux is usually associated with the presence of a hiatal hernia, in which stomach acid flows upward and irritates your lower esophagus.<p>

A hiatal hernia is a bulge of the stomach through the opening in the diaphragm (a muscular separation between the abdomen and the chest).  These hernias can range in size and may cause mild to severe symptoms.  A hiatal hernia may be the result of a weakness in the diaphragm or caused by an injury to the abdomen.<p>

<hr width=400 align=left size=4>
<font size=4><b>Symptoms</b></font><p>
The symptoms of a hiatal hernia are usually caused by a back flow of gastric acid into the esophagus.

<h3>Treatment</h3>
<ul>
<li>Surgery is required for a cure, but many times medical treatment can control symptoms indefinitely.
<li>Antacids do the most good if taken 1 hour before meals and at bedtime.
<li>Sleep with 4-inch blocks under the head of your bed.  This will help keep the acid in your stomach rather than flowing upward and irritating your lower esophagus.
<li>Avoid tight garments.
<li>Avoid alcoholic and caffeine containing beverages.
<li>Avoid rich and highly seasoned foods, although strict dietary restrictions are probably not necessary.
<li>Avoid foods which seem to increase your symptoms.
<li>Avoid eating anything for 3 hours before bedtime.
<li>Avoid cigarette smoking.
<li>Avoid completely: mood-altering, mind-altering, stimulant or sedative drugs.
<li>Make changes in your diet or activity level, if necessary, to reach your ideal weight.
</ul>
<hr width=400 align=left size=4><br>
<b>Contact the doctor if any of the following happens:</b><p>
<ul>
<li>A sensation of stoppage of food beneath the breastbone.
<li>Vomiting.
<li>Temperature over 1000 F.
<li>Symptoms failure to improve.
</ul>

<h3>What is Potassium?</h3>

Potassium is a mineral that is necessary for normal muscle functioning, especially in the heart.  It is found in many foods, especially fresh fruits and vegetables and some grains and cereals.  Too much potassium in the body can cause the heart to stop beating.  Too little potassium in the body can cause muscle weakness, dizziness, thirst and confusion; and can also cause the heart to stop beating.  Ask your doctor if you need to eat more foods high in potassium, or if you should be limiting the amount of high potassium foods that you eat.

<h3>Foods High in Potassium:</h3>  
<pre>
    Avocado            Mango             Parsnips

</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>

Iron is a mineral needed for good health and aids in carrying oxygen from the lungs to the body's tissue. The recommended daily dietary allowance ranges from 10 milligrams for men to 15 milligrams for women per day with additional requirements for pregnant and lactating women.<p>

Iron deficiency, or anemia, may result when the body's natural store of iron is used up and not enough iron is obtained through the diet.<p>

Infants, children, adolescents, women of child bearing age, strict vegetarians and frequent blood donors are more likely to have an iron deficiency. The need for an iron supplement is best determined by a doctor on the basis of a blood test, since an excessive iron intake can cause other health problems.<p>

The following foods are good sources of dietary iron.

Gout is a type of arthritis or swelling around a joint caused by excess uric acid in the blood.  Uric acid is a normal chemical found in the blood.

<h3>What Causes Gout?</h3>

Gout attacks are caused by deposits of uric acid crystals in the fluid of the joints.  Uric acid crystals are formed when a person cannot break down purines well.  Purines are chemicals found in large amounts of certain foods, such as; liver, kidney, sweetbreads, sardines and anchovies.<p>

The actual cause of gout is unknown, but it is thought to be a genetic flaw involved in the breakdown of purines. Gout can also be triggered by certain drugs, such as medicine used to control high blood pressure.

<h3>What are the Symptoms?</h3>

Attacks of gout happen quickly with extreme throbbing or crushing joint pain; and swelling and inflammation of the joint. The big toe is a common site, but gout can effect other parts of the body such as the foot, ankle, and instep of the foot.

<h3>What is the Treatment for Gout?</h3>

<b>Activity Guidelines</b> - During an acute attack, you will be more comfortable if you stay rested in bed. Bedrest may also help decrease the length of illness. Keep the weight of bedclothes off any painful joint by using a cradle or frame that raises the sheets off your body.<p>

<b>General Measures</b> - You may try either a warm or cold compress on painful joints. Use the one that lessens the pain best for you.<p>

<b>Medications</b> - Your doctor may prescribe medication. Follow the instructions on your prescription, and notify your doctor of any side effects. Do not take any other medicines without telling your doctor (especially over-the-counter medicine).<p>

<b>Diet</b> - Follow a low-purine diet and special food and drink instructions.<p>

<b>Call Your Doctor if the Following Happens:</b>
<ul>
<li>Continuous diarrhea or vomiting
<li>Temperature over 101F
</ul>

<hr size=1 noshade>
<h3>GOUT LOW-PURINE DIET</h3>

<h3>Purpose:</h3>

A low-purine diet is indicated in the presence of high blood uric acid levels. Uric acid crystals may form in and around the joints, causing the painful condition of gout. Uric acid is made from dietary purine as well as simple compounds not of a dietary origin.

<h3>Special Instructions</h3>

</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>

<h3>What is Plantar Fasciitis?</h3>

Plantar fasciitis, or heel-spur syndrome, is inflammation of the tendon that is attached to the front of the heel bone and runs forward along the bottom of the foot.  Plantar fasciitis commonly affects people such as runners and those who are active in sports.  Plantar fasciitis may start as a dull pain in the heel which may progress to a sharp persistent pain.  The pain can feel worse in certain situations such as after sitting, standing or walking, and during your first steps in the morning.<p>

The plantar fascia is a thick fibrous muscle on the bottom of your foot.  This muscle is attached to the heel bone and fans forward to the toes and acts like a bowstring to maintain the arch of the foot.<p>

<hr width=400 align=left size=4>
<font size=4><b>Symptoms:</b></font><p>
When the muscle is placed under constant tension, such as running, it can become inflamed at the point where the fascia attaches to the heel bone and results in pain.   Injury of the plantar fascia may also occur at midsole or near the toes.  This problem may progress rapidly and treatment must be started as soon as possible.

<h3>Contributing Factors of Plantar Fasciitis</h3>
<ul>
<li>Flat feet
<li>High arched, rigid feet
<li>Poor shoe support
<li>Toe running, hill running
<li>Soft terrain (i.e. running on sand)
<li>Increasing age
<li>Sudden weight increase
<li>Sudden increase in activity level
<li>Family tendency
</ul>
<hr width=400 align=left size=4>

<h3>Treatment:</h3>

If the condition has existed for a long time, improvement may take longer than expected.  During recovery, loss of excess weight, good shoes and sedentary activities will all help the injury to heal.

<h3>Treatment Includes:</h3>

<b>Rest</b> - Use pain as your guide; when you feel pain, rest it.<p>

<b>Ice</b> - Icing the sore area for 30 to 60 minutes several times a day can help reduce inflammation.  Also, ice the sore area for 15 minutes after activity.<p>

<b>Medication</b> - Your doctor may suggest an anti-inflammatory/analgesic medication coupled with heel pads to ease the pain.<p>

<b>Heel Pads</b> - A heel pad of felt, sponge or a newer synthetic material can help spread, equalize and absorb the shock to ease the pressure on the plantar fascia.  They are available at some medical supply and sporting goods stores.<p>

<b>Shoes</b> - The best type of shoe to wear is a good running shoe with excellent support.  Experiment with your athletic shoes to find a pair that is comfortable and gives you fewer symptoms.<p>

<b>Physical Therapy</b> - The initial objective of physical therapy (when needed) is to decrease the inflammation.  Later, the small muscles of the foot can be strengthened to support the weakened tendon.<p>

<b>Surgery</b> - Surgery is rarely required for plantar fasciitis.  It would be considered only if all forms of more conservative treatment failed and if the pain is still incapacitating after several months.

<h3>Recovery</h3>

Plantar fasciitis can be aggravated by all weight-bearing sports.  To maintain cardiovascular fitness, weight bearing sports can be temporarily replaced by non-weight-bearing sports (i.e. swimming, cycling).  Weight training can be used to maintain leg strength.  When recovering from plantar fasciitis, return to sport activities slowly.  If you have a lot of pain either during the activity or the following morning, you are doing too much.

<h3>Exercises</h3>

The following exercises are designed to strengthen the small muscles of the foot to help support the damaged area.  If done regularly, they will help prevent re-injury.  Do each prescribed exercise two times a day or as often as your doctor recommends.

<h3>Towel Curls</h3>

Place a towel on the floor and curl it toward you, using only the toes of your injured foot.  Resistance can be increased with a weight on the end of the towel.  Relax, then repeat the towel curl.

<h3>Shin Curls</h3>

Sitting down on a chair.  Run your injured foot slowly up and down the shin of your other leg as you try to grab the shin with your toes.  A similar exercise can be done curling your toes around a tin can.

<h3>Stretches</h3>

Stand at arm's length from a counter or table with your back knee locked and your front knee bent.  Slowly lean toward the table, pressing forward until a moderate stretch is felt in the calf muscle of your straight leg.  Hold 15 seconds, keeping both heels on the floor, bend the knee of your straight leg until a moderate stretch is felt in your achilles tendon.  Hold 15 seconds more.  You should feel a moderate pull in your muscle and tendon, but no pain.  Change legs and stretch the other leg.<p>

<hr size=1 noshade>

Hemorrhoids are swollen veins around the anus.  They can occur outside of the anus or form on the inside of the rectum.<p>

Hemorrhoids are caused by straining to have a bowel movement, constipation, heavy lifting, pregnancy or sitting for long periods of time.<p>

<hr width=400 align=left size=4>
<font size=4><b>SYMPTOMS:</b></font><p>
Pain, itching, swelling and sometimes bleeding of the rectum.

<h3>PREVENTION:</h3>
You can prevent hemorrhoids by increasing the fiber in your diet, by eating more fruits, vegetables and multigrain bread.  Also drink lots of liquids.  Avoid heavy lifting, straining during a bowel movement and sitting for long periods of time.  Daily exercise can also help by relieving pressure of hemorrhoids.
<hr width=400 align=left size=4>

<h3>TREATMENT:</h3>

In most cases you can treat hemorrhoids at home and the swelling will stop after a few days.  Try soaking in a hot bath for 10-15 minutes, two to three times a day, applying a compress soaked with witch hazel (or medicine advised by your doctor) and lying down until pain, itching or bleeding has stopped.<p>

Occasionally, it may be necessary to surgically remove the hemorrhoids if there is a blood clot, repeated bleeding or a severe infection.

<h3><i>CALL YOUR DOCTOR IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING HAPPEN:</i></h3>
<ul>
<li>Severe pain continues for more than 24 hours.
<li>Bleeding occurs.
</ul>

<font size=6 color="#4A5A94"><b>Hepatitis</b></font>
</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>

Hepatitis is the name given to a group of illnesses that cause infection of the liver.  It can be caused my many things, including viruses, bacteria, and certain chemicals.  There are three types of hepatitis that are common today.  Below is a description of each type:

<h3>Hepatitis A:</h3>

Hepatitis A is spread through person to person contact and fecal-oral contamination.  This means that unsanitary conditions can lead to contamination of foods with bacteria.  These foods are then eaten by humans, and the person becomes sick.  Symptoms of Hepatitis A include a low fever, loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting, muscle and joint pain, headache, sore throat, and a general sick feeling.  In fact, many people with Hepatitis A think they have the flu.  Hepatitis A is usually not life threatening.  To prevent Hepatitis A, wash your hands often, and avoid raw shellfish, untreated water, and food handled by people with Hepatitis A.

<h3>Hepatitis B:</h3>

Hepatitis B is spread through contact with blood, semen, and other body fluids.  All donated blood is now screened for Hepatitis B, however other precautions will help prevent the spread of Hepatitis B.  These include: not donating blood if you have been exposed the AIDS virus, have had Hepatitis A or C, have had a blood transfusion or tattoo within the last six months, or have a history of drug addiction; and practicing safe sex.  There is a vaccine available for Hepatitis B, and if you work in the health care industry or around bodily fluids, you should consider getting this vaccine.  The symptoms of Hepatitis B are the same as those for Hepatitis A, but Hepatitis B can cause the liver to fail and can cause death or chronic hepatitis.

<h3>Hepatitis C:</h3>

Hepatitis C is the newest form of Hepatitis.  It is spread through contact with blood, semen, and other body fluids just as Hepatitis B.  Prevention techniques include proper hygiene, such as washing your hands often, and avoiding contact with other persons with Hepatitis C.  Like Hepatitis A, there is not a vaccine available for Hepatitis C.  The symptoms are similar to those of Hepatitis A and B, and like Hepatitis A, Hepatitis C is usually mild and not life threatening.<p>

<i>If you think that you may have hepatitis of any kind, do not attempt to treat yourself at home.  Instead, see you doctor immediately to better treat your condition and help avoid any further spread of the disease.</i><p>

<font size=6 color="#4A5A94"><b>Infectious Hepatitis</b></font>
</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>

Infectious Hepatitis, or Hepatitis A, is an inflammation of the liver.  It is caused by a virus.  The virus is passed from an infected person to another or from food or water that has been contaminated by the feces of a person with the virus.  It usually lasts one to three weeks.<p>

<hr width=400 align=left size=4>
<font size=4><b>SYMPTOMS:</b></font><p>
Hepatitis begins with nonspecific symptoms such as; fever, headache, achiness, loss of appetite and feeling poorly.  After a few days, other symptoms begin, including; nausea (sometimes vomiting), abdominal pain, foul breath and jaundice, a yellowing on the whites of eyes and sometimes the skin.  The liver is swollen, aches and is tender to the touch.

<h3>PREVENTION:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Always wash hands thoroughly after going to the bathroom or changing a diaper
<li>Wash raw vegetables and fruit before eating
<li>Do not drink water that could be contaminated
</ul>
<hr width=400 align=left size=4>

<h3>TREATMENT:</h3>

Bed rest is advised until the fever is gone and jaundice lessens.  Keep eating as usual.<p>

Because it is caused by a virus, antibiotics can not help to get over Hepatitis.  Other medications may help to alleviate symptoms.  Do not take any medication (even over-the-counter medicines) without asking your doctor.

<h3>CALL YOUR DOCTOR IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING HAPPEN:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Increasing loss of appetite.
<li>Excessive drowsiness or mental confusion.
<li>Vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain.
<li>Jaundice worsens.
<li>Skin rash or itching of the skin.
</ul>

<center>
<font size=6 color="#4A5A94"><b>Hiatal Hernia</b></font>
</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>

<h3>What is a Hiatal Hernia?</h3>

A hiatal hernia is an abnormal weakness or opening in the diaphragm, a big thin muscle that separates the chest cavity from the abdominal cavity.  Hiatal hernia may be due to congenital weakness in the muscular ring of the diaphragm through which the esophagus passes and empties into the stomach or abdominal injury, causing tremendous pressure that tears a hole in some part of the diaphragm.  Either of these can cause stomach acid to flow backward from the stomach into the esophagus, irritating the esophagus.<p>

<hr width=400 align=left size=4>
<font size=4><b>Symptoms:</b></font><p>
The following symptoms usually develop one hour or more after eating:  heartburn (a burning sensation in the area of the heart behind the breast bone), belching, and swallowing difficult (rare).  Risk of problems increase with chronic constipation and straining during bowel movements, smoking, obesity, pregnancy and constant straining or lifting with tightening of the abdominal muscles.

<h3>Treatment:</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Activity</b> - avoid squatting or bending from the abdomen.
<li><b>Diet</b> - avoid alcoholic beverages, caffeine-containing beverages (coffee, tea, cocoa, cola drinks) and any other 	food, juice, or spice that aggravates symptoms.  Eat slowly.
</ul>

<h3>General Measures</h3>
<ul>
<li>Raise the head of your bed 4 to 6 inches and/or sleep on two or three pillows. This allows gravity to keep 	stomach acid away from hernia.
<li>Avoid large meals. Eat four or five small meals a day instead. Do not eat anything for at least 2 hours 	before bedtime.
<li>Lose weight if you are overweight.
<li>Do not smoke.
<li>Do not wear tight pantyhose, girdles, belts or pants.
<li>Do not strain during bowel movement, urination or lifting.
</ul>
  
<hr width=400 align=left size=4>

<h3>Medication</h3>

Your doctor may prescribe antacids and stool softeners.  Antacids are most effective for some person when they take them 1 hour before meals and at bedtime.  Others find them more helpful 1 to 2 hours after meals and at bedtime.  Try both way to find the best schedule for you.

<h3>Notify your doctor if any of the following happens:</h3>
<ul>
<li>You vomit blood or have recurrent vomiting.
<li>Temperature rises over 1000 F.
<li>Symptoms do not improve with treatment in one month.
<li>Symptoms of a hiatal hernia recur after treatment, especially the sensation that food stops beneath the breast bone, call immediately if pain is accompanied by shortness of breath, sweating or nausea.
</ul>

<font size=6 color="#4A5A94"><b>Hyperglycemia</b></font>
</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>

A high blood glucose (sugar) level is called hyperglycemia.  It develops when there is not enough insulin.  If not treated, hyperglycemia can lead to complications known as ketoacidosis (coma) and hyperosmolar nonketotic coma.<p>

Ketoacidosis is most common in people with type I (insulin-dependent) diabetes.  This type usually develops over a few hours or days.  Urine tests show moderate to high levels of ketones.  Hyperosmolar coma occurs in people with type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes.  This type is more common in the elderly, especially during illness.  It may take days or even weeks to develop.  Urine tests do not show ketones.

<h3>PREVENTION:</h3>

Prevent hyperglycemic emergencies by following these rules:
<ol>
<li>Follow your diet, medication, activity, and blood or urine testing plan properly.
<li>Tell any new doctor or dentist that you have diabetes before you have any procedure or operation done.
<li>Sick-day guidelines:
<dl><dt>	a. Check with your doctor or nurse for specific directions.
<dt>	b. Treat all illness seriously.
<dt>	c. Take insulin or diabetes pills as directed.
<dt>	d. Test your urine or blood for sugar.  Test your urine for ketones. Record the
<dd>results. You may need to test for sugar and ketones every 4 hours.
<dt>	e. Drink fluids often. Drink about half a cup of water, tea, or broth every hour.
<dt>	f. Try to eat normally.</dl>
</ol>

<h3>CALL YOUR DOCTOR IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING HAPPEN:</h3>
<ul>
<li>You are sick more than 24 hours and are not getting better.
<li>Your blood sugar is over 240 milligrams/deciliter for two tests in a row.
<li>Your urine shows moderate to high levels of ketones.
<li>You have symptoms of very high sugar levels.
<li>You are not able to eat.

<h3>SPECIAL NOTE</h3>

If you have experienced low blood sugar levels within the past 24 hours, your body may release a hormone that may make your blood sugar levels high for several readings.  This is called rebounding.  The blood sugar level should return to normal after several readings.  If you call your doctor or nurse, inform him or her that you have experienced low blood sugar levels before having high blood glucose levels.<p>

<hr size=1 noshade>
<p>
Low blood glucose (sugar) is known by several names: hypoglycemia, insulin reaction, or insulin shock.  Hypoglycemia has many causes (see table below).  It can occur quickly, especially if you are taking insulin.
<p>
It is important to learn how your body feels with low blood sugar so that you can take action right away.
<p>
<h3><i>PREVENTION:</i></h3>
Follow your doctor's or nurse's instructions:
<ol>
<li>Eat your snack before vigorous exercise.
<li>Be alert for low blood sugar signs before meals, during and after exercise, and during your       medication's peak action (especially with insulin).
<li>Stay on your diabetic plan for food, medication and exercise.
	<ul>
	<li>Be alert for changes in your daily routine that can affect your blood sugar levels.
	<li>Do not skip or delay meals.
	</ul>
<li>Before taking any other medications, even nonprescription ones, check with your doctor or nurse.
<li>Always carry medical identification and some form of simple sugar with you.  Take the simple sugar as soon as symptoms are felt.
<li>Show family members and friends where you keep your emergency glucagon kit and how to give glucagon.
<li>When you have a low blood sugar reaction, write down the date and time of day as well as your diet, exercise, and mediation.  
<li>Follow your plan for monitoring your blood sugar level or testing your urine.
<li>Only blood sugar testing can show low sugar levels.  Ask your doctor or nurse before using       alcoholic beverages.  Alcoholic beverages would need to be made part of your diet plan.

<b><i>CALL YOUR DOCTOR IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING HAPPEN:</i></b>

<li>The symptoms stay the same or become worse after treatments, 
<li>You have repeated hypoglycemic reactions,
<li>You have any reaction while you are taking pills for diabetes control.
</ul>
<i><b>SPECIAL NOTE:</b></i>
<p>
Once the symptoms are gone, if you must wait more than 30 minutes until your next meal, eat a snack (half a sandwich, cheese and crackers, or a banana and half a cup of skim milk).  Any food used to treat reactions is in addition to your regular meal plan; do not subtract this food from your next meal.  
<p>
<b>IF THE SYMPTOMS ARE NOT GONE WITHIN 30 MINUTES, CALL A FRIEND OR THE EMERGENCY NUMBER FOR HELP.</b>
<p>
After having hypoglycemia, the body sometimes tries to compensate by releasing a hormone that increases the blood sugar level.  This is called rebounding (Somogyi effect).  You may find your next few blood sugar readings may be high after you have had hypoglycemia.  The sugar levels usually return to normal within 24 hours.  If you have questions, call your doctor or nurse before adjusting your insulin levels.

</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>
Impetigo is a bacterial (usually staphylococcus) infection of the skin. It is caused by bacteria that invades damaged skin. The skin may be damaged by wounds or the scratching of insect bites. This disorder sometimes occurs after having a cold with a running nose.
<h3>Symptoms</h3>
Impetigo starts as blisters that ooze a yellowish fluid and form yellowish-brown crusts. It mostly occurs on exposed places of the body. With a cold, the sores can show up around the nose and on the upper lip.
<h3>Prevention</h3>
The sores may spread from place to place on the same person and can spread to other people. You should begin measures within the home in order to prevent the spreading of this contagious disorder.
<h3>General Measures</h3>
<ol>
<li>Each member of the family should use their own towels, or paper towels may be used.
<li>Keep nails short, hands clean and away from rash.
<li>If you can, cover the sores with gauze and first aid tape to keep hands away from the affected spot.
<li>Keep apart and boil bed linens, towels, clothes, etc. which have come into contact with the active sores.
<li>Treat any new lesions in the same manner, even if you are not sure they are impetigo.
</ol>
<h3>Treatment</h3>
<b>Medication -</b> Most of the time antibiotics will be prescribed to use for 10 days to prevent other problems. Also, an antibiotic ointment may be prescribed for the sores.  Be careful to follow the instructions on the label.
<h3>Important Points in Treatment</h3>
<ul>
<li>Stay indoors until the sores begin to heal, usually a day or two.
<li>Scrub lesions carefully and thoroughly with 2 x 2 gauze and a special antiseptic soap such as Phisohex or Betadyne. Remove all crusts or pus and expose and cleanse the base of all lesions. If it is hard to remove crusts, soak them in warm soapy water and then remove them with gentle scrubbing. 
<li>Rub antibiotic ointment into the lesions for 60 seconds.  Do this for at least 4 times a day.
</ul>
<hr width=400 align=left size=4>
<h3>CALL YOUR DOCTOR IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING OCCUR:</h3>
<ul>
<li>You develop a fever of 100F or higher	
<li>The sores do not stop spreading in 3 days
<li>The sores do not begin healing in 3 days
</ul>

<font size=6 color="#4A5A94"><b>Irritable Bowel Syndrome</b></font>
</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>
Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a disorder of the large intestines.  IBS is called by many different names including, spastic colitis, nervous bowel or mucous colitis.  Spasms of the large intestines cause the movement of food through the intestines to be either too fast (causing diarrhea) or too slow (causing constipation).
<p>
The exact cause of IBS has not been proven, but stress and anxiety seem to play a role.  IBS is very common.  It is probably the most common abdominal complaint seen by doctors.
<p>
<hr width=400 align=left size=4>
<p>
<h3>SYMPTOMS OF IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME</h3>
<ul>
<li>DIARRHEA
<li>CONSTIPATION
<li>ABDOMINAL PAIN
</ul>
Usually there are alternating bouts of diarrhea and constipation.
<p>
<hr width=400 align=left size=4>
<p>
<i>TREATMENT:</i><br>
Before diagnosing IBS, your doctor will need to rule out the possibility of other intestinal disorders.  If IBS is diagnosed, it is not medically serious, but it can be troublesome.  Lifestyle changes are necessary to prevent symptoms.  For patients who do not respond to lifestyle changes, drugs may be prescribed.
<p>
<hr width=400 align=left size=4>
<p>
<h3>	TREATMENT FOR	IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME</h3>
<b>Diet</b> 
<ul>
<li>Avoid triggering foods
<li>Increase fiber   
<li>Increase intake of fruits and vegetables
<li>Drink plenty of liquids
</ul>
<b>Exercise</b>
<ul>
<li>Engage in regular exercise
</ul>
<b>Reduce Stress</b>
<ul>
<li>Make changes to reduce stress
<li>Learn and practice stress management
</ul>
<b>Other</b>
<ul>
<li>Avoid alcohol, caffeine and heavy smoking

<font size=6 color="#4A5A94"><b>Kegal Exercises</b></font>
</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>
<h3>What are Kegal Exercises?</h3>
Kegal exercises help strengthen the muscles around the vagina and help increase a women's ability to control and relax these muscles completely.
<p>
During pregnancy, kegal exercises are done to increase the strength of these muscles and provide increased support for the uterus and to develop the ability to relax and control the muscles in preparation for the actual birth of the baby.  Kegal exercise can also be done to heal and strengthen muscles damaged after childbirth and to increase urinary control.
<p>
<hr width=400 align=left size=4>
<h3>Tips for Kegal Exercises</h3>
<ul>
<li>Identify the pelvic muscles by tightening muscles around the anus while sitting or standing or starting and stopping urine flow while voiding.  Practice this tightening and releasing action while sitting, standing, walking, driving and watching television.	
<li>Try to tighten the muscles a small amount at a time, "like an elevator going up to the tenth floor." Then, release very slowly one "floor" at a time.	
<li>Try tightening the muscles from the front to back including the anus (rectum) as in the above exercise.  Do these exercises every morning, afternoon and evening (3 times a day).  Start with 5 times each and gradually work up to 20 to 30 each time.

</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>

An essential part of getting well after knee injury is exercise.  Work with your doctor to decide what are the best exercises to safely strengthen your knee.  Be sure to do only the exercises and the number of repetitions your doctor indicates.

<h3>Stretching Exercises</h3>
Before you begin any type of strength building exercises, start with stretching exercises as a warm-up and a cool-down phase of your program.
<dl>
<dd>
<b>Hamstring Stretch</b><br>
Lie on your back with your legs straight.  Raise your injured leg upward, clasping your hands at the back of your calf, just above the knee.  Push your straight leg backward, into your hands.  Relax, pull your leg slowly toward your body, stretching the muscles in the back of the thigh.  Hold the position for 5 seconds, keeping your knee straight.  Repeat this exercise, each time pulling your leg closer to your head.  Keep the other leg straight on the supporting surface.  <b>Do not pull suddenly, or fully force, as this can strain the muscles.</b>
<p>
<b>Quad Stretch</b><br>
Fasten a long belt (or towel) around the ankle of your injured leg.  Lie on your side, holding the free end of the belt and attempt to bend the knee further backward.  Push the hips forward.  Hold the position for a maximum stretch during each repetition for at least 5 seconds.
<p>
<b>Calf Stretch</b><br>
Stand facing a wall.  Place one leg behind the other, with both feet pointed toward the wall.  Both heels should be in contact with the floor.  Lean forward slowly until you feel a stretch in your calf.  Hold for a count of 5 seconds.  Relax and repeat.  Assume the same position as at the beginning of the calf stretch, but bend your knee slightly and lean forward, stretching the lower portion of your calf muscles.  Relax and repeat.
</dl>
<h3>Strength Building Exercises</h3>
After warming up with the stretching exercises you can continue the exercise session with the following isotonic/strengthening exercises.
<dl>
<dd>
<b>Straight Leg Raises</b><br>
Sit with your back straight, your injured leg straight and your good leg bent.  Flex the ankle of your injured leg and tighten your thigh muscle.  Lift your injured leg approximately 8 to 12 inches from the floor, keeping it straight.  Lower your leg slowly.  Rest.  You may use 1 lb to 5 lb weights if your leg is stronger.  Perform 3 sets of 8-12 repetitions, 2-3 times a day.
<p>
<b>Short Arc Quadriceps</b><br>
Sit with your back straight and place a rolled towel under the back of your injured knee, bend it slightly.  Straighten your leg slowly, raising your foot from the supporting surface.  Lower your leg.  Keep the back of the knee in contact with the towel at all times.  Add weight, as your leg gets stronger.  Perform 3 sets of 8-12 repetitions, 3 times a day.
<p>
<b>Hip Abduction</b><br>
Lie on your side - the side of your good leg.  Keep your leg straight.  Bend your other leg (the injured leg) behind you.  Raise your injured leg slowly, keeping the knee straight.  Lower it slowly.  Perform 3 sets of 8-12 repetitions, 3 times a day.
<p>
<b>Hip Adduction</b><br>
Lie on your side - the side of your injured leg.  Cross your good leg over your injured leg.  Place your foot flat on the floor.  Lift the lower leg, keeping the knee straight.  Lower it slowly.  Perform 3 sets of 8-12 repetitions, 3 times a day.
<p>
<b>Hip Extension</b><br>
Lie on your stomach with your head resting in your hands.  Turn your face away from the side of your injured leg.  Lift your injured leg 6 to 8 inches from the floor.  Be sure to keep your leg straight.  Perform 3 sets of 8-12 repetitions, 3 times a day.
<p>
<b>Knee Flexion</b><br>
Lie on your stomach and place a small rolled towel under the front of your injured knee for support.  Bend your knee as far as possible.  Slowly lower it back to a straight position.  Add weight.  With any knee pain, decrease frequency or repetition and/or amount of weight.  Perform 3 sets of 8-12 repetitions, 3 times a day.

<font size=6 color="#4A5A94"><b>Lice</b></font>
</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>
<h3>What Are They?</h3>
Lice are the tiny grey bugs found crawling on the skin, scalp, or throughout the hair.  Lice are accompanied by nits. Nits are little white silvery colored eggs which come from the lice and attach to the hair shaft until they become lice. Lice suck blood and release fluids which causes intense itching.
<p>
Lice can spread from person to person by sharing personal items such as; combs, brushes, hair accessaries, clothing, towels, bed linen. Anyone can get lice, however, children usually get it and contract it from a brother, sister, or a friend. If one person has lice, check other people in close contact with your child - brothers, sisters, babysitters, day care center, or school.
<h3>Signs:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Intense itching of the scalp or other hairy parts of the body.
<li>Nits can be found near the scalp.
<li>Tiny blisters and/or a rash located near the neck line or behind the ears.
</ul>
<h3>Treatment:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Wash all clothing, towels, and bed linen in hot water and dry at high temperature, or dry clean.
<li>Disinfect all combs, brushes, and hair accessories by washing them with special medicated shampoos (Rid, Nix, A200 Pyrenate).
<li>Special medicated shampoos can be purchased in any drug store or pharmacy over the counter.
</ul>
<h3>Call Your Doctor if:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Any of the special shampoos do not work.
<li>Lice or nits remain in the hair.
<li>Blisters or rash on the body become infected.
</ul>

<h3>Benefits of Back Exercises</h3>
The purpose of back exercises is to prevent injury and pain.  The benefits of back exercises are to promote stretching, flexibility, and strengthening of muscles.  They also help decrease muscle spasms.
<h3>When to Use Back Exercises</h3>
Any exercise program should be started slowly and continued at a reasonable pace.  The following exercises are for you if you are experiencing back pain without leg pain.  Some mild discomfort is to be expected as you begin your exercise program.  Begin by trying the exercises slowly and carefully.
<h3>Pelvic Tilt</h3>
Lie on your back with your knees bent so your feet are flat on the floor.  Place your hand under your lower back and slowly press against your hand.  Remove your hand and press your back against the floor.  Count to five and relax for a moment before you repeat the exercise.
<h3>Modified Sit-Up</h3>
Start with the pelvic tilt and place your hands by your sides.  Lift your head so that your chin almost touches your chest.  Lift your shoulders off the floor as you reach for your knees.  Hold this position for five seconds and repeat several times.
<h3>Press Up</h3>
Lie on your stomach, with your arms and head positioned as shown below.  Push up with your arms, leaving your hips on the floor.   Do 10 - 12 press ups, 3 times a day.
<h3>Knee Raise</h3>

<center>
<font size=6 color="#4A5A94"><b>Migrane Headaches</b></font>
</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>
<p>
A migraine is a specific kind of headache with specific symptoms.  The pain of a migraine is caused by an increased dilation or widening of the blood vessels in the head.  Migraine headaches usually come on suddenly, range from moderate to severe, last from 3 hours to 3 days and re-occur every few weeks or months.  The average frequency is 1-3 attacks per month.
<p>
<hr width=400 align=left size=4>
<h3>UNDERSTANDING THE PAIN:</h3>
The throbbing, pulsating pain is usually located on one side of the head.  However, the pain can switch sides or can be felt on both sides.  In addition to the headache, migraine sufferers often have other symptoms including nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light and sound. 
<h3>ANTICIPATING A MIGRAINE:</h3>
Some people experience warning signals that a migraine headache is coming on.  The most common signal is an inability to see clearly followed by seeing bright spots and zig-zag patterns before the eyes. 
<p>
Attacks may be triggered by menstruation, other hormonal changes, emotional stress, alcohol, certain foods, or alterations in sleeping or eating habits.  People who suffer from migraines often have blood relatives who also have them.
<p>
<hr width=400 align=left size=4>
<h3>TREATMENT:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Lie down in a darkened room.
<li>Try to relax the entire body.
<li>If you suspect that your headaches are migraines - see your doctor.  You should get professional diagnosis and treatment.
<li>Your doctor may prescribe medications.  Take as directed.
<li>Learning and using relaxation and biofeedback techniques may help to prevent and      treat migraines.
</ul>

<title>FHP Health & Wellness Library: Infectious Mononucleosis</title>
</head><body>
<a name="top"></a>
<center>
<font size=6 color="#4A5A94"><b>Infectious Mononucleosis</b></font>
</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>
<p>
Infectious Mononucleosis, often called "mono", is caused by a virus called the Epstein-Barr virus.  This disease can occur at any age, but is more common in adolescents and in young adults, especially among those in close contact with schools and colleges.  Strangely, it is seldom seen in members of the same family at the same time.
<p>
<hr width=400 align=left size=4>
<p>
<b>Symptoms:</b><br>	
The symptoms of mononucleosis can vary from person to person but may include; chills, fever, aching of muscles, emotional depression, tiredness, sore throat, swollen lymph glands and skin rash.  Symptoms can vary from severe to mild.  The symptoms may last for several days to several weeks.
<p>
The diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis is done through a blood test.  Sometimes it may take several tests to confirm because tests that are negative in early stages can turn positive later.
<p>
<b>Treatment:</b><br>
Because mononucleosis is caused by a virus, no medications, including antibiotics, will affect the state of the disease.  Some medications such as pain medication and gargles can be used to make the patient more comfortable.  Bedrest during a fever and plenty of fluid are important.	
<p>
If your disease is severe or if there are special consideration a doctor may prescribe adrenal corticosteroid.  This hormone is safe in young people if there are no special reasons it should not be given and if it is given for only a short period of time (two weeks or less).  You can ask your doctor if adrenal corticosteroid is an appropriate treatment for you.
<p>
<hr width=400 align=left size=4>
<p>
<h3>Call the doctor if any of the following happen:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Temperature over 102 F.
<li>Severe constipation.
<li>Severe pain on the left side of the abdomen lasting for five minutes or more.
<li>Difficulty in swallowing or breathing.
</ul>

<h3>Stretching</h3>
Reach upward as high as possible with both hands.  Then spread your feet and reach up over your head with one straight arm while sliding the other down your opposite leg.  Put both arms behind you, hands clasped.  Pull down and stretch back strenuously, opening your chest and shoulders.  Then yawn if you feel like it, with both arms falling easily to your sides.
<h3>Brisk 5 Minute Walk</h3>
The next time you have already accumulated physical tension or are about to enter a potentially distressful situation, take a brisk five-minute walk.  This can release muscle tension, allow greater oxygenation in your brain and body, allow for mental diversion or positive affirmations.
<h3>Swimmer's Shake-out</h3>
Allow both arms to hang very loosely at your side.  Beginning with your hands, rotate each arm from fingertips to shoulder.  At the same time, let them swing gently from front to back.  This will be relaxing only if you let your arms hang loosely, rather than raise them outward to the side.
<h3>Face Loosener</h3>
Check whether your teeth are clenched.  If so, let them release so your jaw is more relaxed.  Next check out your forehead.  If you detect muscle tension there, lift your eyebrows gently and release lines of tension or fatigue.  Turn a frowning brow into a smooth, relaxed forehead.

<h3>Six Second Quieting Response</h3>
<ul>
<li>Draw a long, deep breath.
<li>Hold for two or three seconds.
<li>Exhale long, slowly and completely.
<li>As you exhale, let your jaw and shoulders drop.  Feel relaxation flow into your arms and hands.
</ul>
<h3>Focus Attention on Breathing</h3>
Without trying to change anything, simply allow your mind to be fully aware for several moments of your breathing.  Dwell on the rise and fall of your chest, the cooler air coming in, the warmer air passing out.  Be aware of whether your breaths are shallow or deep, quick or slow, comfortable or uncomfortable.  Dwell on the passage of air in and out of your right nostril for a few breaths, then you left.  Simply allow this attentiveness to settle you, to quiet distracting or racing thoughts.  It is important to accept what you observe, simply be with it.  Do not concern yourself with trying to change it.
<h3>Breathing Away Tension</h3>
<ul>
<li>Sit or lie in a comfortable position with hands open and legs uncrossed.
<li>Be aware of the weight of your entire body on the floor, bed, couch, or chair.  Your muscles need not help support your body at all.
<li>Softly close your eyes.
<li>Focus attention on your nostrils and "see" the air entering each side.  Follow its path down into your lungs, "watch" it swirling around, and "observe" it moving back up and out.
<li>As it leaves, tell yourself it is carrying away tension, pain, and disease if present.
<li>Continue for 1-5 minutes.
</ul>
<h3>THE D-A-R-E RESPONSE</h3>
<pre>
First, <b>EXHALE</b> think     <b>D E T A C H</b>
                        from stressor and imagine moving
                        it ("blowing it away") to a
                        comfortable distance where it
                        becomes small and indistinct
                                                           
Second, <b>INHALE</b> while    <b>A S S E S S I N G</b>
                        the situation and thinking
                        "courage," "strength," or the
                        like for handling it
 
Third, <b>EXHALE</b> thinking  <b>R E L A X</b>
                        and let go of any unnecessary
                        muscle tension

Last, <b>INHALE</b> thinking   <b>E N E R G I Z E</b>
                        for getting strength and courage
                        for handling the stressful
                        situation meaningfully.

<font size=6 color="#4A5A94"><b>Osteoporosis</b></font>
</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>
<p>
Osteoporosis or "brittle bones" is a condition that affects 25 percent of women over 60 years old.  Osteoporosis is much less common and much less severe in men.  This condition is brought about by loss of bone mass and strength, and osteoporosis can lead to serious problems with broken bones.
<p>
High risk factors for osteoporosis include thin body frames, a sedentary lifestyle, and a family history for this disease.  Women who drink or smoke are at greater risk.  Osteoporosis is a "silent" disease; no symptoms exist for this condition...until a bone is broken and the condition is recognized after x-rays.  The first indication of osteoporosis may be hip or low back pain or painful swelling of a wrist after a minor fall.
<p>
X-rays which measure bone density are available.  These x-rays may be especially useful for women at high risk of osteoporosis, in determining who will benefit from estrogen replacement therapy.  Ask your doctor about your need for this test.

<h3>Home Treatment of Osteoporosis</h3>
<ul>
<li>Get regular weight-bearing exercise, such as walking; bones get bigger and stronger with exercise.
<li>Take about 1,500 mg of calcium a day; the average American diet contains 500 mg; the extra 1,000 mg can be obtained either by a large increase in dairy products (one quart of skim milk would add 1,100 mg of calcium) or by calcium supplements; five 500 mg calcium carbonate tablets, such as TUMS, will yield 1,000 mg of calcium...space the tablets over the day, and take them with meals or milk.
</ul>
<h3>When to Call a Health Professional</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you are considering estrogen replacement therapy, then call a health professional.
<li>If you experience sudden and sever back pain, then call a health professional.
</ul>

<title>FHP Health & Wellness Library: The Care Of Plaster Casts</title>
</head><body>
<a name="top"></a>
<center>
<font size=6 color="#4A5A94"><b>The Care Of Plaster Casts</b></font>
</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>

<h3>What is a Plaster Cast?</h3>
To aid in healing, a plaster cast is used to help immobilize an injured part of the body after fractures or other injuries.  Casts are applied by splinting the injured part and then wrapping it with material which hardens and gives rigid support to the injured area.
<h3>How Long Will I Wear a Plaster Cast?</h3>
The length of time that the cast remains in place depends on the amount of time needed for the injury to heal.  Some casts are needed for only 2 weeks; others have to remain in place for several months.
<h3>How Can I Take Care of the Cast?</h3>
Do not allow pressure to be placed on any part of the cast until it is completely dry.  The drying time varies depending upon thickness of the cast, temperature, humidity and so forth.  Twenty-four hours is not an unusual length of time for drying.
<p>
If the cast accidentally gets wet and a soft area appears, contact the doctor's office so that it may be repaired.
<p>
<hr width=400 align=left size=4>
<h3>Care of the Patient in a Cast</h3>
<ul>
<li>Whenever possible, raise the cast.  This decreases the possibility of swelling of the tissue underneath the cast.  For example, prop a leg cast on a pillow when in bed.
<li>Swelling may occur no matter how carefully the cast is applied.  If this happens, one or more of the following symptoms will appear:
   <ul>
   <li>Severe and persisting pain
   <li>Change in color of the flesh beyond the cast, such as a color change of blue or gray under the nails of the fingers and toes.
   <li>Numbness or complete loss of feeling in the skin beyond the cast.
   <li>Swelling of the flesh to a greater extent than before the cast was applied.
   </ul>
</ul>
If any of the above signs or symptoms occurs, contact the doctor as soon as possible.

</head><body>
<a name="top"></a>
<center>
<font size=6 color="#4A5A94"><b>Sinusitis</b></font>
</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>
<p>
Located in the front part of the skull are four pairs of bony air cavities called nasal sinuses.  The sinuses are lined with a delicate mucous membrane that continually produces mucus to flush out irritants and other invaders, including bacteria and viruses.
<p>
Mucus from the sinuses drain into the nasal cavity through tiny canals.  If the mucous membrane in the sinuses swells and impedes drainage because of irritation or infection, pressure can build up, squeeze sensitive nerves, and cause severe headaches and facial pain.  What little mucus manages to leak through the blocked openings creates an irritating  postnasal drip that results in a sore throat and cough.  The symptoms are similar to those of a cold but are more severe.  The condition is called sinusitis.
<h3>Symptoms of Sinusitis</h3>
<ul>
<li>feeling of weakness		
<li>fever		
<li>sore throat		
<li>cough		
<li>frequent and severe frontal headaches		
<li>tenderness about the face and eyes		
<li>postnasal drip		
<li>frequent episodes of heavy nasal congestion		
<li>frequent respiratory infection		
<li>symptoms of allergic nasal congestion "out of season"		
<li>thick greenish-yellow nasal excretion
</ul>
<h3>Causes of Sinusitis</h3>
The mucous membrane in the sinuses can become inflamed for a number or reasons.  The most common cause is due to an allergy.  Other causes that may lead to sinusitis are upper-respiratory infections from colds or flu, long term exposure to cigarette smoke, or development of a growth that blocks drainage.
<h3>Treatment</h3>

A mild case of sinusitis will usually clear up by itself; however, a more severe case demands attention because of the risk of infection spreading.  With treatment, nasal congestion and other symptoms (except cough) should gradually improve over the next 14 days.  Some possible treatments include:
<ul>
<li>antihistamine medication
<li>nose drops or sprays
<li>vaporizers
<li>humidifiers
<li>antibiotics 
<li>sinus irrigation
<li>surgery
</ul>
Try to avoid an environment with low humidity and excessive heat since those conditions tend to aggravate the mucous membranes.  Reduce symptoms further by applying heat to the face using an electric heating pad or a warm cloth soaked in hot water.
<p>
<hr width=400 align=left size=4>
<h3>Call Your Doctor If Any Of The Following Happen:</h3>
<ul>		
<li>Body temperature over 102 F.		
<li>Bleeding from the nose		
<li>Severe headache which does not go away after taking prescribed medication		
<li>Increased swelling over the face (forehead, eyes, side of nose, or cheek)		
<li>Blurred vision
</ul>

<hr size=1 noshade>
<p>
<h3>Why Is Smoking So Harmful?</h3>
More than 390,000 premature deaths result each year from smoking.  Studies show that smoking promotes heart disease, many types of cancer, and respiratory problems like emphysema.  Smoking can also cause other problems such as yellow teeth, bad breath, a smoker's cough, and financial expense.
<h3>What Are The Harmful Elements In Tobacco Smoke?</h3>
There are three ingredients in tobacco smoke that cause premature death: carbon monoxide, tar and nicotine.  Carbon monoxide is a poisonous gas that interferes with the body's ability to get oxygen to the cells.  Carbon monoxide can cause shortness of breath and may also affect vision, hearing, and judgment.  Tar is a sticky, black substance that contains cancer causing agents, which is deposited into the lungs and affects the lung's functioning each time a person smokes.  Nicotine is a powerful stimulant that is highly addictive.  Nicotine is the leading reason people continue to smoke.  Nicotine effects a smoker's blood pressure, heart rate, skin temperature, hormone production, muscle tension, and pain sensitivity.  
<h3>Is Smokeless Tobacco Harmful?</h3> 
Studies show that smokeless tobacco, also called chewing tobacco or snuff, can cause cancer - especially in the cheeks, gums and throat.  Smokeless tobacco can cause dental problems like tooth decay, bad breath, and leukoplakia (leathery white patches inside the mouth).  Using smokeless tobacco is as addictive as smoking cigarettes, and is just as bad for a person's health. 
<p>
<hr width=400 align=left size=4>
<h3>10 Tips to Help You Quit</h3>
<ul>
<li>Set a date for quitting.
<li>Remove cigarettes or smokeless tobacco, ashtrays, matches and lighters from your home, office, or anywhere else you use them.
<li>Keep a supply of low calorie snacks available, in addition to chewing gum, hard candy and straws to chew on.
<li>Tell everyone you are going to stop smoking.
<li>List 10 things you can do besides smoking.
<li>Decide on a reward to give yourself after going one week without smoking.
<li>Start a regular exercise program.
<li>Choose a friend, spouse or relative who will act as a support person or check into local support groups.
<li>Drink plenty of water throughout the day.
<li>Consult your doctor if you are interested in nicotine replacement therapy like the nicotine patch or gum.

<center>
<font size=6 color="#4A5A94"><b>Symptoms of Withdrawal and Recovery</b></font>
</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>
<h3>Coughing</h3>
Some people complain of the increased coughing that accompanies smoking cessation.  This coughing is a result of the stimulated cleaning mechanisms in your respiratory system.  The small hair-like structures that line the walls of the lungs begin to sweep the contaminants and phlegm out of the lungs.  Coughing is a sign that you are getting better.  Sucking on cough drops or sugarless hard candy or sipping warm herbal tea may help.
<h3>Lethargy or Tiredness</h3>
You may find yourself feeling tired as your body readjusts to functioning without the stimulation of nicotine.  Increasing your exercise level will help.  You may also try getting extra rest.  Try not to push yourself during this time; don't expect too much of your body until its had a chance to heal itself.  Divide your work into short tasks and take frequent breaks.  Change sitting positions, walk around the room, etc.
<h3>Restlessness or Concentration Difficulties</h3>
While some people become tired when they stop smoking, others become restless and fidgety and have trouble concentrating.  Stress relaxation techniques will help with this problem.  Avoid drinking alcohol which will only intensify your concentration problems.  Step up your level of physical exercise and schedule short breaks into your work day where you can stretch and/or walk around.  Divide your work into short, concise tasks when possible.  This may make your workload more manageable and promote a sense of accomplishment.
<h3>Tension, Nervousness, Irritability, Anxiety</h3>
This symptom often occurs in response to the changing level of nicotine in your system.  Be patient, your body will require a short amount of time to adjust to your new non-smoking lifestyle.  If you feel like you are short-tempered or irritable when you quit smoking, recognize that it is caused by withdrawal from nicotine.  Use stress relaxation techniques and ask your family and friends to be tolerant.  Take a walk or soak in a hot bath. Avoid caffeine intake as this may intensify the symptoms.  Drink extra water to help your body flush the nicotine through.
<h3>Constipation</h3>
Your body will need some time to adjust to its new environment without nicotine.  You need to remember to drink lots of water and fruit juices.  Add roughage to your diet, such as raw fruit and vegetables and whole grain cereals.
<h3>Sleeplessness</h3>
Don't drink coffee, tea or soda with caffeine after 6:00 p.m.  Do something which relaxes you before bedtime.  Try relaxation or meditation techniques.
<h3>Slight Sore Throat, Gums or Tongue; Dry Mouth</h3>
Tobacco use both irritates and numbs your throat.  When you stop smoking, you may feel some brief discomfort as your throat returns to its normal natural state.  Sip ice-cold water or fruit juice, or chew sugarless gum.

<font size=6 color="#4A5A94"><b>Approaches to Stopping</b></font>
</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>

<h3>Cold Turkey</h3>
You probably are familiar with the phrase going cold turkey.  Going cold turkey means abruptly stopping smoking.
<p>
In particular, it refers to the addictive aspect of smoking:  cold turkey, thus, means abrupt cessation from one's addictive level of smoking.  In other words, if you usually smoke two packs of cigarettes a day, you are going cold turkey if you smoke your usual two packs today and then zero cigarettes tomorrow.  Any gradual method of stopping is not cold turkey.
<p>
Most successful ex-smokers quit cold turkey.  However, either approach--cold turkey or a gradual approach--is fine.  If you do decide to prepare for stopping with a gradual approach, you should spend less than two weeks with that approach.  Cutting down for a longer period of time can make the experience of quitting more difficult than it need be, or can become a form of procrastinating, rather than a way of stopping.
<p>
Smoke only those cigarettes you really want.  Don't empty your ashtrays.  This will remind you of how many cigarettes you have smoked each day and the sight and smell of stale butts will be very unpleasant.
<h3>Tapering</h3>
One gradual approach to quitting is "tapering."  Tapering means counting your cigarettes and smoking a predetermined fewer number of cigarettes each day.
<p>
You might, for instance, decide to reduce the number of cigarettes you smoke by five each day for six days--until the day you have chosen as your personal quit date.  On the first day of this period you would smoke your usual 30 cigarettes; on the second day, 25; on the third day, 20; fourth day, 15; fifth day, 10; and the sixth day, 5.  The next day, the seventh day, would be your quit date, and the first day that you will smoke zero cigarettes.
<p>
Other ways to taper the amount cigarettes you smoke is to smoke only 1/2 of each cigarette, smoke only during odd or even hours of the day.
<h3>Postponing</h3>
A second gradual approach to quitting is "postponing," which means that you postpone the time at which you start smoking by a predetermined number of hours each day.  Once you begin smoking each day, you do not need to count your cigarettes nor to focus on reducing the number that you smoke.  
<p>
Thus you might decide to postpone the time at which you start smoking by two hours each day for six days, until your personal quit day.  On the first day, you might begin smoking at 9 a.m.; on the second day, 11 a.m.; third day, 1 p.m.; fourth day, 3 p.m.; fifth day, 5 p.m.; and sixth day, 7 p.m. The next day, the seventh day is your quit date, and thus your first day with no cigarettes.
<p>
Keep in mind that it is not necessary to use a gradual approach to stopping.  The important step is to select a quit date and to stick to that date as your first day as an ex-smoker.  You can either go cold turkey on that day, or you can spend a few days preparing to stop by tapering or postponing.

<title>FHP Health & Wellness Library: Sodium</title>
</head><body>
<a name="top"></a>
<center>
<font size=6 color="#4A5A94"><b>Sodium</b></font>
</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>
<p>
Ordinary table salt is sodium chloride--40% sodium by weight.  When we talk about amounts of sodium, we talk in terms of grams and milligrams.  A gram is a unit of weight.  There are about 28 grams in 1 ounce.  There are 5.5 grams in a teaspoon.  If you divide 1 gram into 1000 parts, each part is a milligram (mg), or 1000 milligrams equal 1 gram.
<p>
Sodium is a mineral that is essential for good health.  You must have a certain balance of sodium and water in your body fluids and tissues at all times.  Sodium and water work together to maintain this balance.  Too much salt or too much water will upset the balance.  In healthy people, excess sodium is eliminated through the kidneys, and the correct balance of sodium and water is maintained.
<p>
The average American consumes about 6-18 grams of salt daily (roughly one to two teaspoonfuls).  Your body actually requires only about 0.5 grams of salt, or 0.2 grams of sodium each day.  Reducing the amount of sodium consumed may help some people avoid high blood pressure and help others normalize their blood pressure.  People with high blood pressure are more likely to develop heart disease and stroke.  Diseases of the heart and blood vessels are the number one cause of death in the United States.
<p>
Most foods in their natural state contain sodium.  However, most sodium in our diet is added to food during commercial processing and home preparation.  Therefore, in selecting foods for a controlled-sodium eating style, you must be aware of both natural sodium content and added sodium content.
<p>
When purchasing prepared and prepackaged foods, interpret the labels.  Many different sodium compounds are listed on food labels, it indicates the presence of added sodium.  Watch for the words soda and sodium and the symbol Na on labels--these identify products that contain sodium compounds.
<p>
<b>SODIUM COMPOUNDS: AVOID OR USE SPARINGLY</b>
<p>
Be careful to limit your intake of the first four items.

<a name="top"></a>
<center>
<font size=6 color="#4A5A94"><b>Stress - How to Manage It</b></font>
</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>
<ol>
<li>Get enough sleep and rest.  If necessary, use an alarm clock to remind you to go to bed.

<li>Eat a balanced diet.

<li>Avoid alcohol and other drugs.

<li>Start a regular program of physical activity.

<li>Take time out from your work on a regular basis to relax and get away from it all.

<li>Avoid rushing.  Plan your time and set priorities.

<li>Take one thing at a time so you don't become overwhelmed by a problem or project.

<li>Avoid being a perfectionist.  Put your best effort into whatever you are doing, then relax and don't worry about the results.

<li>Escape for brief periods of time.  Go to a movie, listen to music, watch a sports game or take a short trip for a change of scenery.

<li>Work off anger and frustration.  Take a walk, clean the house or get involved in a hobby or project that captures your interest and demands your full attention.

<li>Develop outside interests and activities that you enjoy.  Total involvement in job or home responsibilities can make you feel isolated.

<li>Change what you can and accept what you cannot change.

<li>Don't relay on your memory.  Write down when to pick up the laundry, when library books are do, etc.  "The palest ink is better than the most retentive memory."  - Old Chinese Proverb

<li>Don't put up with things that don't work right.  If something is a constant aggravation, get it fixed or replace it.

<li>Plan ahead.  Don't let the gas tank get below one-quarter full, keep a well stocked "emergency shelf" of supplies at home and at work, etc.

<li>Make friends with non-worriers.

<li>Forget about counting to 10.  Count to 1000 before doing something or saying anything that could make matters worse.

<li>Take the scissors to your credit cards.

<li>Think of your next embarrassing situation as an episode on TV's Candid Camera.

<li>Every day, make sometime for solitude.  Allow yourself time for privacy, quiet and introspection.

<li>Schedule realistic days.  Allow ample time between appointments so you don't have to rush, worry, and apologize for being late.

<li>Talk it out.  Discussing your problems with a trusted friend can help clear your mind of confusion so you can concentrate on problem solving.

<li>Instead of doing something tomorrow, do it today; instead of doing it today, do it now.  Hard work is simply the accumulation of easy things you didn't do when you should have done them.

<li>Say "No, thank you" to extra projects, social activities, and invitations you don't have the time or energy for.

<li>Donate extra stuff to charity.  Getting rid of what you don't need makes what you do need easier to find.

<li>Do nothing which, after being done, leads you to tell a lie.

<li>Carry a duplicate car key in your wallet.

<li>Get up fifteen minutes earlier in the morning.  The inevitable morning mishaps will be less stressful.

<li>Prepare for the morning the evening before.  Set the breakfast table, make lunches, put out the clothes you plan to wear, etc.

<li>Practice preventive maintenance.  Your car, appliances, home, and relationships will be less likely to break down/fall apart "at the worst possible moment."

<li>Eliminate (or restrict) the amount of caffeine in your diet.

<li>Allow fifteen minutes of extra time to get to appointments.  Plan to arrive at the airport one hour before domestic departures.

<li>Be prepared to wait.  A paperback can make a wait in a post office line almost pleasant.

<li>Always set up contingency plans, "just in case."

<li>Pollyanna-Power!  For every one thing that goes wrong, there are probably 10, or 50 or 100 blessings.  Count 'em!

<li>Ask questions.  Taking a few moments to repeat back directions, what someone expects of you, etc. can save hours.

<li>Unplug your phone.

<li>Turn "needs" into preferences.  Our basic physical needs translate into food and water, and keeping warm.  Everything else is a preference.  Don't get attached to preferences.

<li>Take a hot bath or shower (or cool one, in summertime) to relieve tension.

<li>Wear earplugs.

<li>Create order out of chaos.  Organize your home and workspace so that you always know exactly where things are.  Put things away where they belong and you won't have to go through the stress of losing things.

<li>When feeling stressed, most people tend to breathe in short, shallow breaths.  When you breathe like this, stale air is not expelled.  Oxidation of the tissues is incomplete and muscle tension frequently results.

<li>Writing your thoughts and feelings down can help you clarify things and can give you renewed perspective.

<li>Inoculate yourself against a feared event.  Just as a vaccine containing a virus can protect you from illness, if you expose yourself to one or more of the dreaded aspects of an experience beforehand you often can mitigate your fears.  For example: before speaking in public, take time to go over every part of the experience in your mind.  Imagine what you'll wear, what the audience will look like, how you will present your talk, what the questions will be and how you will answer them, etc.  Visualize the experience the way you would have it be.

<li>Get up and stretch periodically if your job requires that you sit for extended periods.

<li>Learn to live one day at a time.

<li>Everyday, do something you really enjoy.

<li>Do something for somebody else.

<li>Focus on understanding rather than on being understood, on loving rather than being loved.

<li>Become flexible.  Some things are worth not doing perfectly and some issues are well to compromise upon.

<li>Eliminate destructive self-talk.

<li>Use your weekend for a change of pace.

<li>"Worry about the pennies, and the dollars will take care of themselves."  Take care of today the best you can and tomorrow will take care of itself.

<li>Do one thing at a time.  When you are with someone, be with that person and with no one or nothing else.  When you are busy with a project, concentrate on doing that project and forget about everything else you have to do.

<li>If an especially "unpleasant" task faces you, do it early in the day and get it over with.

<li>Learn to delegate responsibility to capable others.

<li>Don't forget to take a lunch break.  Try to get away from your desk or work area in body and mind even if it's just for 15 or 20 minutes.

<li>Have a forgiving view of events and people.  Accept the fact that we live in an imperfect world.

<li>Have an optimistic view of the world.  Believe that most people are doing the best they can.

<li>Add an ounce of love to everything you do.

<font size=6 color="#4A5A94"><b>Taking Care of Your Elderly Relatives</b></font>
</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>
<p>
Caring for an elderly relative means helping an older loved one deal with the natural changes brought about by aging.  Since people do not age at the same rate, the extent of care needed depends on the individual.  Support may range from giving comfort during tough moments to providing a place to live.

<h3>Family Involvement</h3>

Family members should be aware of what's involved because being involved helps to improve the family's skills in helping an elderly relative live as full and satisfying life as possible.  Also, by preparing families to make sound decisions, it can ease the strain of handling problems that may arise.

<h3>Aging</h3>

Aging is a slow and natural process that brings change.  In different ways, people are affected physically, socially, emotionally and financially.

<h3>Caregiving</h3>

Each family's situation is different, but you should always try to be open and honest with the elderly relatives and allow them to make decisions affecting their lives (if possible).  Also, other family members should be encouraged to express their feelings and views.  Care providers should be sure to seek help when it's needed.  It's not possible to do everything alone!

<h3>Lifestyle Guidelines</h3>

Family members should share responsibilities.  Here are some ways to help your elderly relative:
<ul>
<li>Maintain regular contact with mail, visiting and by telephone.
<li>Share special occasions such as holidays, birthdays and events involving grandchildren.
<li>Encourage elderly relatives to live in their own homes if it's possible and safe.  Provide encouragement of joining outside activities.
<li>	Offer sympathy and understanding when your relative experiences losses such as the death of a spouse or friends.
<li>Encourage good health practices by providing prompt medical care for problems.  You should also encourage a nutritious diet and exercise.
<li>Help with finances by providing financial assistance, budgeting money or help in finding your relative a part-time job.
<li>Ensure a safe living environment by taking precautions in the home.  For example, make sure rugs don't slip and install handrails for stairs or bathrooms.
</ul>
<h3>Taking Care Of Yourself</h3>

Taking care of another person leaves less time and energy for other family activities--and yourself.  To provide good care, you must pay attention to your own physical and emotional health.
<ul>
<li>Eat well-balanced meals
<li>Exercise regularly
<li>See your doctor for routine check-ups
<li>Discuss your feelings.  When conflicts arise, talk about them with those involved.
<li>Plan free time for yourself.  Make relaxation a part of your daily life with something you enjoy.
<li>Seek help from other family members, friends, support groups, or adult-care professionals when you need a breather.
<li>Use laughter to help you cope.
<li>Try journal writing, it is a safe way to release feelings and clear your mind.
</ul>

</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>
<h3>What is Tennis Elbow?</h3>
Tennis elbow is an injury that involves the tendons attached to the muscles that extend the wrist and fingers.  After repetitive use of these extensor muscles, the tendon becomes overworked and inflamed.  This produces the pain on the outside of the elbow.
<h3>What is Golfer's Elbow?</h3>
A similar injury happens with the golfer's elbow except that it involves the tendons that attach to forearm muscles that flex the wrist and fingers.  The pain here is on the inside of the elbow.
<h3>What contributes to Tennis or Golfer's Elbows?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Weak muscles and/or muscle imbalances
<li>Overuse - playing excessively, repeated violent extension or twisting of the wrist
<li>Improper equipment - incorrect grip size, strings too tight, imbalance of string tension
<li>Poor playing technique - too much wrist action, jerky strokes or poor ball contact
</ul>
<hr width=400 align=left size=4>
<h3>Treatment For Tennis Elbow or Golfer's Elbow</h3>
<ul>
<li>Rest - Temporarily you may have to stop playing.  Don't aggravate the condition by continuing activity, especially if you are in pain.  Only rarely will a sling relieve the discomfort.
<li>Ice - Ice your elbow three times a day for 30 to 60 minutes in the early painful stage and for 15 minutes after active use of your arm.
<li>Stretching - Stretching will prevent stiffness by breaking down any scar tissue that may result from inflammation.
<li>Medication - Your doctor may prescribe anti-inflammatory/analgesic medication (in tablet form) or an injection of local anesthetic to help relieve inflammation and pain.  If necessary, a localized cortisone injection may also be used to relieve the pain and joint tenderness.
<li>Brace - Your doctor may recommend any of several braces, supports or molded casts designed for this problem.  A brace reduces the pressure on the inflamed tendon.  At first the brace may be worn at all times except when doing gentle exercises to avoid elbow stiffness.  Later, it will be necessary only for protection during activities using the injured arm.
</ul>
<hr width=400 align=left size=4>
<h3>Returning To Sports</h3>

Warm up -  Always warm up carefully before you play.  Put all your major joints through their completed range of motion.  Very slowly practice all of the motions you use in your sport.  Stretching and strengthening exercise help prevent injury.
<p>
The Racquet -  Use a lighter weight racquet and move your hand up a bit on the grip.  Change to a racquet that has greater spring.  Reduce your string tension.
<p>
The Stroke -   In tennis, the backhand, the serve or the overhead smash may be equally damaging to your elbow if they are not done well. The two-handed backhand tends to be easier on your elbow.  Avoid the shots that aggravate the problem.  Lessons may be necessary to alter your strokes.
<p>
The Game -  When you go back to your sport take it easy.  In tennis, at first only for short periods of  time, avoiding problem shots.  Play less time or play doubles.  In golf, start with only putting and pitch shots.  Slowly work up from a few holes to a complete game.

<h3>Exercises For Tennis Elbow or Golfer's Elbow</h3>

Weak muscles are a major contributor to the problem of tennis and golfer's elbow.  Exercise will strengthen the muscles associated with the damaged tendons.  Stretches and exercise should be avoided in the very painful stage.
<p>
<b>Elbow Stretch</b><br>

Hold your racquet arm at shoulder level in front of your body with the elbow straight.  With your hand clenched, flex the wrist as far as possible.  Return the wrist to neutral position and alternately turn the arm inward with a flexed wrist, and then outward with an extended wrist.
<p>
<b>Wrist Curl</b><br>

Sit with your injured arm resting on a table and supported by your fist, as shown.  Grasp a one-pound weight or unopened can of food and slowly raise your wrist as high as possible.  Do the exercise first with palm up, then with palm down.  As your strength improves, you can gradually increase the weight of the dumbbell.
<p>
<b>Squeezing</b><br>

Squeezing a rubber ball (racquet-ball size) will also strengthen the injured area.  If that is too difficult, start by squeezing a sponge or a wash cloth in water.
<p>
<b>Twisting</b><br>

With your arms stretched out, practice wringing out a dry terry cloth towel with both hands.
<p>

<title>FHP Health & Wellness Library: Triglycerides</title>
</head><body>
<a name="top"></a>
<center>
<font size=6 color="#4A5A94"><b>Triglycerides</b></font>
</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>
<p>
Triglycerides are one type of fat found in the bloodstream.  Triglycerides are obtained though the diet and produced in the body from carbohydrates.
<p>
High levels of triglycerides are usually caused by a diet high in calories, saturated fat, cholesterol, alcohol, and a lack of exercise.
<p>
Several studies have suggested that elevated triglycerides may increase the risk of developing cardiovascular disease.  However, the direct link with high triglycerides is hard to isolate since people with high triglycerides tend to have other risk factors such as, high blood cholesterol, low HDL cholesterol, obesity, and lack of exercise.
<p>
Fortunately, the recommendations for lowering triglycerides also help to lower other risks for cardiovascular disease.
<p>
<hr width=400 align=left size=4>
<h3>RECOMMENDATIONS FOR LOWERING TRIGLYCERIDES</h3>
<b><i>Make Healthy Food Choices:</i></b>
<ul>
<li>Decrease fat intake, especially saturated fats such as, butter, lard, coconut and palm         oils
<li>Avoid high cholesterol foods such as eggs, fatty meats, whole milk, cheese and other         foods of animal origin
<li>Avoid foods high in sugar and calories such as candy, cookies, cake, pie, etc.
<li>Eat more fish, chicken and lean meats
<li>Eat more fresh fruits, vegetables and whole grains
</ul>
<b>Increase Exercise:</b><br>
Gradually increase exercise.  Aim for continuous moderate exercise                            for 20 - 30 minutes, three days a week.
<p>
<b>Lose Weight:</b><br>
Lose weight sensibly by decreasing portion sizes and increasing exercise.                    Maintain your ideal body weight.
<p>
<b>Avoid Alcohol:</b><br>
Even moderate amounts of alcohol tend to increase triglycerides.
<p>
<h3>HOW HIGH IS HIGH?</h3>
American Heart Association standards for high triglycerides based on age and sex are as follows:
<pre>
     <b>Age</b>          <b>Males</b>      <b>Females</b>
    5 -  9          85         126
   10 - 14         111         120
   15 - 19         143         126
   20 - 24         165         168
   25 - 29         204         159
   30 - 34         253         163
   35 - 39         316         205
   40 - 44         318         191
   45 - 49         318         223
   50 - 54         313         223
   55 - 59         261         279
   60 - 64         240         256
   65 - 69         256         260
   70 +            239         289

<center>
<font size=6 color="#4A5A94"><b>Understanding Urinary Tract Infections</b></font>
</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>

<h3>What is a Urinary Tract Infection?</h3>

A urinary tract infection can occur anywhere in the urinary tract (the parts of the body that form and excrete urine).  The three most common types of urinary tract infection are:
<ol>
<li>Cystitis: Infection of the bladder.  The bladder stores urine until it can be eliminated.
<li>Urethritis: Infection of the urethra.  The urine leaves the bladder and is eliminated through the urethra.
<li>Pyelonephritis: Infection of the kidneys.  The kidneys produce the urine.
</ol>
<h3>What Causes a Urinary Tract Infection?</h3>

Cystitis and pyelonephritis are usually caused by bacteria that are normally found in the colon, stomach or feces.  These bacteria spread from the rectum or vagina to the urethra and then to the bladder or kidneys.  Urethritis is usually caused by sexually transmitted infections such as gonorrhea or chlamydia.  Females are more likely than males to get urinary tract infections.  Sexual intercourse, birth defects, urinary tract stones and bladder tumors are some causes of urinary tract infections.
<p>
<hr width=400 align=left size=4>
<h3>Symptoms of Urinary Tract Infection</h3>
The telltale symptom of urethritis is a burning sensation during urination.
<b>Cystitis may be responsible for:</b>
<ul>
<li>A frequent urge to urinate	
<li>Pain in the lower abdomen or pubic area	
<li>Blood in the urine	
<li>Not feeling well, often accompanied by a slight fever	
</ul>
Pyelonephritis can cause symptoms associated with cystitis, as well as pain in the back or side, high fever, chills, nausea and vomiting.
<p>
<hr width=400 align=left size=4>
<h3>How is a Urinary Tract Infection Treated?</h3>
Antibiotic medicines are given to treat urinary tract infections that are caused by bacteria.   Urethritis associated with sexually transmitted diseases or other vaginal infections may require more extensive treatment.  It is very important to follow exactly your doctor's instructions for taking and completing antibiotic therapy.
<h3>How Can I Lower my Risk of Getting a Urinary Tract Infection?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Urinate after sexual intercourse.
<li>Use plenty of lubrication during sexual intercourse, such as, water-soluble lubricant like KY Jelly.
<li>Drink plenty of fluids.
<li>Urinate regularly; do not suppress the urge.
<li>Wipe from front to back after a bowel movement.
</ul>

</head><body>
<a name="top"></a>
<center>
<font size=6 color="#4A5A94"><b>Varicose Veins</b></font>
</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>
<p>
Varicose veins are expanded and abnormally lengthened veins, usually in the legs and pelvic areas.
<p>
In healthy veins there are valves present to prevent blood from passing from deep veins to surface veins.  People may get varicose veins because their vein walls are weak or the valves aren't working properly or are absent, so the blood passes from deep veins to surface veins.  The surface veins are not made to withstand this added burden.
<p>
<hr width=400 align=left size=4>
<p>
<b>Symptoms</b>
<ul>
<li>Swollen legs						
<li>Muscle cramps	
<li>Tired leg muscles					
<li>Soreness behind the knee	
<li>Itchy skin over varicose veins
</ul>
<b>Complications</b>	
<ul>
<li>Ulcers and blood clotting
</ul>
<b>Risk Factors</b>
<ul>
<li>Prolonged standing on the feet			
<li>Pregnancy						
<li>Tight pantyhose, garters or corsets		
<li>Excessive weight				
</ul>
<hr width=400 align=left size=4>
<h3>Treatment:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Avoid prolonged standing or sitting in one position.
<li>Do not cross the legs while sitting.
<li>Elevate the legs whenever you can during the day.  Rest often.
<li>Put 2 inch blocks under the foot of your bed so that your legs will be gently inclined toward your heart while you sleep.
<li>Wear elastic stockings as they provide good support.
<li>Do not wear girdles, garters, pantyhose or stockings with tight elastic in the top.
<li>Exercise to keep circulation and leg muscles in good shape.
<li>If the skin over a varicose vein breaks and the vein bleeds, lie down and apply pressure until the bleeding stops.
<li>If the above treatment does not work, your doctor may advise surgery.
</ul>

</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>

<h3>What is a Vegetarian?</h3>

A vegetarian is a person that relies on food of plant origin for nourishment. There are many types of vegetarians, but most eat any food from plant sources: fruits, grains, legumes (dried beans, peas, lentils, peanuts), nuts and seeds.
<ul>
<li>Vegans:  Strict vegetarians who only eat foods from plant sources.
<li>Lactovegetarian:  Eat plant foods plus dairy products.
<li>Ovovegetarians:  Eat plant foods plus eggs.
<li>Lacto-ovovegetarians:  Eat plant foods and both dairy products and eggs.
</ul>
<h3>Is a Vegetarian Diet Healthful?</h3>
	
To determine if your diet is healthy, it would depend upon the nutrients supplied by your daily food choices. The Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) claims that all vegetarians, even vegan, can be well nourished if they select their diets with care. A vegetarian diet should include protein with a good balance of amino acids; good sources of vitamin A, riboflavin, vitamin B12, vitamin D, calcium and iron; and enough calories to maintain body weight.

<h3>Important Nutrient Guidelines</h3>

If animal foods are absent from your diet, it is important to eat plant protein food combinations to "fill in" for the amino acids missing in each one. This improves the amount of amino acids and increases the use of protein by the body. Plant protein sources eaten together are called "complimentary" foods. An example would be corn and beans. Some other "complimentary" combinations are:
<p>
<hr width=400 align=left size=4>
<pre>
<font  size=+1><b>Plant Sources</b></font>
   <b>Sources:</b>             <b>Examples:</b>
   beans/wheat          baked beans and brown bread
   lentils/rice         soup
   beans/rice           refried beans and spanish rice

<font size=6 color="#4A5A94"><b>Vomiting - Help For Children Over Five Months Old</b></font>
</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>

<p>
Vomiting is the rejection of the stomach's contents.  Vomiting is a symptom of many diseases, but it is usually due to a variety of minor problems and can be treated at home. 
<p>
The major concern is the loss of body fluids from the vomiting.  Dehydration can occur if too much fluid is lost.
<h3>TIPS FOR CARING FOR A YOUNG CHILD (OVER 5 MONTHS)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Limit activities of child until illness is over or greatly improved.  Normal activities may be resumed after the vomiting has stopped for 24 hours.
<li>After vomiting, allow the child's stomach to "rest" for several hours before giving anything to drink.  Then begin to offer fluids.  At first, give sips every 10 to 15 minutes, then work up to teaspoons, tablespoons and then up to several ounces.
<li>Try ice chips or these fluids that are usually well-tolerated: 
<ul>
	   <li>Jello water
	   <li>Fruit flavored syrup drinks
	   <li>Carbonated beverages that have gone flat
	   <li>Popsicles
	   <li>Clear chicken or beef broth
	   <li>Bouillon
</ul>
<li>If the child will not take liquids, try lollipops or hard candy.  It might help to make the child thirsty and the sugar can provide some energy.
<li>Keep the child on clear liquids for at least 24 hours.  If the child insists on solid food, try saltine crackers.
<li>Don't give any medications (even over-the-counter) without telling your doctor.
</ul>
<h3>CALL YOUR DOCTOR IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING HAPPEN:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Excess drowsiness
<li>Confusion
<li>Headache
<li>Sharp or constant abdominal pain
<li>Painful or frequent urination
<li>Labored breathing
</ul>

<title>FHP Health & Wellness Library: Water - Getting Enough</title>
</head><body>
<a name="top"></a>
<center>
<font size=6 color="#4A5A94"><b>Water - Getting Enough</b></font>
</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>
<p>
Water is the most vital nutrient to our existence.  We can live a while without any food, but would die after 2 - 3 days without water.  Our bodies are made up of two thirds water.  Every living cell depends on water to carry out it's essential functions.
<p>
During hot weather the body loses a lot of fluid - usually 3 to 4 quarts and up to 3 gallons a day!  It is important to drink enough fluid to make up for this loss, otherwise dehydration could result.
<p>
Dehydration can be very damaging to the body.  It can lead to heat related illnesses such as heat stress, heat exhaustion and heat stroke.
<p>
Thirst is not a good indication of when you need to drink water.  If you wait until you're thirsty to drink, you could already be dangerously low on water.
<ul>
<li>Drink at least 8 to 10 8 oz. glasses of water daily.
<li>Do not count coffee, tea or sodas as your waters.  These beverages are diuretics.
<li>Drink cool water every 15-20 minutes even if not thirsty.
<li>Remember, when exercising, you need to drink more water.  Drink 1/2 to 1 cup of water every 20 minutes.
</ul>
<hr width=400 align=left size=4>
<h3>Try these tips to help increase your daily water intake:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Keep a cup of water with you at all times and sip it constantly.
<li>Try a straw.  This helps some people drink more.
<li>Put lemon or lime slices in the water.
<li>Keep a pitcher of water in the refrigerator.
</ul>

<title>FHP Health & Wellness Library: Whiplash</title>
</head><body>
<a name="top"></a>
<center>
<font size=6 color="#4A5A94"><b>Whiplash</b></font>
</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>

<p>
Whiplash is an injury to the neck that is caused when the neck is whipped backward in a forceful manner - usually in a car crash or in a contact sport.  Muscles, tendons, discs, and nerves in the neck are involved.  Most of the time it is curable in one week to three months.

<h3>Symptoms:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Pain or stiffness in the front and back of the neck, either immediately following or up to 4 hours after injury.
<li>Dizziness
<li>Headache
<li>Nausea and vomiting (sometimes)
<li>Temporary numbness and weakness in one or both arms, if the spinal nerve roots are injured.
</ul>
<h3>Prevention:</h3>

To prevent whiplash, use padded headrests in your car.  Always wear a seatbelt; seatbelts have lowered the amount and severity of auto whiplash injuries. 

<h3>Treatment:</h3>

<b>Activity</b>
<br>
Your movement depends on the harshness of your symptoms.  During the acute or severe stage, rest as much as you can.  As symptoms improve, resume normal activity slowly.
<p>
<b>General Measures:</b>
<ul>
<li>Apply ice packs to the injured spot for 10 to 20 minutes each hour during the first 24 hours.

<li>After 24 hours, use ice packs or heat to relieve pain.  Heat may include hot showers twice a day in which the water beats on your neck and shoulders for 10 to 20 minutes.  Between showers, apply hot soaks to the neck, or use a heating pad a couple times a day for 10 to 15 minutes.

<li>Try to improve your posture.  Pull in your chin and stomach when sitting or standing.  Sit in a firm chair and force your buttocks to touch the back of the chair.

<li>If symptoms are severe, buy and wear a soft, padded, fabric collar (Thomas collar) until pain subsides.
	
<li>Sleep without a pillow.  Instead, roll a small towel 2 inches in diameter, or use a cervical pillow or a Thomas collar.  Poor sleeping positions delay healing.
</ul>
<b>Medication</b>
<br>
Sometimes your doctor may prescribe pain pills or muscle relaxants.  Talk to your doctor about using over-the-counter drugs such as aspirin for minor pain.

<h3>Call Your Doctor If The Following Happen:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Pain, numbness, tingling, or weakness occurs in the arm or face.

<li>New symptoms develop.

<li>Drugs produce side effects.
</ul>

<center>
<font size=6 color="#4A5A94"><b>Care of Wounds</b></font>
</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>

<p>
A wound is an injury caused by external physical forces.  An open wound is one where the skin or mucous membranes (such as of the mouth or inside the nose) have been broken.  A closed wound occurs when underlying tissues are involved and the skin and mucous membranes are intact.
<hr width=400 align=left size=4>
<pre>
<b>Type of Wound</b>     <b>Description</b>              <b>Treatment</b>
<hr size=0><b>Abrasion</b>        | An open wound caused   | Clean with soap and	        
(scrape)        | by rubbing or          | water;apply dressings 
                | the skin or mucous     | and protectagainst 
                | scraping membranes     | infections
<hr size=0><b>Contusions</b>      | A closed, superficial  | Support, compress, apply
(bruises)       | wound caused by a      | ice;	massage and heat 
                | blow by a blunt        | after 48 hours
                | object, a bump         |
                | against a stationary   |
                | object, or a crush     |
<hr size=0><b>Incision</b>        | A clean, open wound    | Control bleeding; wash
(cut)           | caused by sharp        | wound; do not attempt
                | objects such as        | to wash deep parts
                | knives, broken glass,  |
                | and sharp metal        |
                | objects                |
<hr size=0><b>Laceration</b>      | A jagged, irregular    | Control bleeding; wash
(tearing)       | open wound caused by   | wound; use "butterfly"
                | objects such as dull   | bandages to pull edges

                | moving parts of        |
                | machinery              |
<hr size=0><b>Puncture </b>       | An open wound caused   | Wash wound; protection
(piercing)      | by objects such as     | against infection very
                | wooden or metal        | important
                | splinters, needles,    |
                | nails, fishhooks,      |
                | and ice picks          |
<hr size=0><b>Avulsion</b>        | An open wound caused   | Control bleeding; take
(torn off)      | by gunshot,            | avulsed part to 
                | machinery accident,    | hospital

                | skin is torn off or    |
                | left hanging           |
</pre>
<hr width=400 align=left size=4>
<h3>Cleaning a Wound</h3>
<ol>
<li>When possible, wash hands with soap and water.
<li>Allow the wound to bleed slightly.  Apply direct pressure to the wound with a clean cloth.  Continue pressure for three minutes (clotting may take six to seven minutes).
<li>Using a clean cloth saturated with soap and water, gently wash dirt away from the wound edges.  Hydrogen peroxide may be used to bubble away old blood and clots--do not use to disinfect the wound.
<li>Flush the wound liberally with large amounts of water.
<li>First aid antiseptics should be avoided.  Instead, apply isopropyl (rubbing) alcohol on the skin around the wound, not in the wound.
<li>Cover the wound with a sterile gauze dressing and bandage.  Dressing should not be airtight.
<li>Small (less than one inch) lacerations heal faster and with less scarring if the wound edges are brought together by one or more pieces of tape (i.e., butterfly bandage).
<li>If a wound bleeds after a bandage is applied and the bandage becomes stuck, it is best to leave it on as long as the wound is healing normally.
<li>A dressing must be changed if it becomes wet.  To remove a dressing, soak it in warm water or hydrogen peroxide to soften the scab and make removal easier.
</ol>
<h3>Call Your Doctor If Any Of The Following Happen:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Constant and increasing pain at the site of wound
<li>Fever over 100
<li>Numbness at a point below the wound
<li>Blood soaks through the dressing
<li>Red streaks radiating away from injured sight
<li>Swelling at a point below the wound
<li>Skin rash
<li>Inability to move a joint below the wound
<li>Signs of infection
</ul>

<h1>Exercise Log</h1>
</center>
<hr size=1 noshade>

Every year the American Council on Sports Medicine (ACSM) issues its exercise guidelines for developing and maintaining
fitness in healthy adults.  They form an excellent basis for an exercise program.  (Remember: check with your doctor
before starting any exercise program.)<p>
           
<h3>Recommended Exercise Guidelines</h3>

<ul>
<li>Aerobic Exercise: 3 to 5 days a week, 20 to 60 minutes of continuous activity at 60 to 90 percent of maximal heart
rate.<p>

Examples include walking, jogging, biking, swimming, dancing, rowing, skiing, skating, tennis, and racquetball.<p>

<li>Resistance Training: 2 non-consecutive days a week minimum, one set of 8 to 12 repetitions of 8 to 10 exercises that
condition the major muscle groups.  Examples include calisthenics and strength training.
</ul>

The 1994 recipient of the FHP Outstanding School Health Educator Award is Jeanette Varela,
R.N., B.S.N., school nurse at Santa Clara Elementary in Tucson, Arizona. The winning entry,
"Shifting from an Illness Orientation to a Wellness Perspective," outlined how Mrs. Varela successfully enlisted the support of students, teachers, administrators, and parents in planning and implementing a comprehensive health education program for her school of over 600 students.<p>

During the 1993-94 school year, she gave over 130 health-related classroom presentations as well as in-service training to teachers and staff. Subjects covered included: alcohol and drug prevention, dental care, gang awareness, HIV/AIDS, human growth and development, hygiene, nutrition, and safety. Mrs. Varela also shared her experiences in developing the program and effectively creating change to other school nurses in her district. The result: several of the nurses began similar programs in their own schools. Best of all says Mrs. Varela, "I finally 'got my hand out of the band-aid jar' and believe I have truly made a positive impact on the lives of my students. They are learning how to make intelligent and informed decisions which will keep them happy, healthy, and, most importantly, alive."<p>

The winner of the 1995 FHP Outstanding School Health Educator Award is Clair Touchstone, Health Educator at Kingman Junior High School in Kingman, AZ. Over the last three years, about 1,300 children were taught directly by Ms. Touchstone. As Kingman Junior High School has an enrollment of about 905 students per year, 2,850 students have received comprehensive health education in that same time due to the use of diversified classes to meet the needs of the students.<p>

Many parents have met Ms. Touchstone in the grocery store or at school and thanked her for being open and honest with their children. Some students who are already sexually active have come to Ms. Touchstone to tell her they are going to start practice abstinence.<p>

Many students who are usually failures in regular course work experience repeated success in her class; self-esteem rises. You can't imagine what a CPR card means to many of her eighth graders. Touchstone's students go home and share what they learn with their families.<p>

While she has no statistics to show that she has contributed to the prevention of teen pregnancy or the lessening of sexual intercourse among adolescents, Ms. Touchstone knows her students leave her class with enough knowledge to make informed decisions about their behavior and its consequences.<p>

In March 1995, a boy who had just finished his coursework told Ms. Touchstone that he had saved his mother's life. His mother was driving the car and began to experience chest pains. He told his teacher that he didn't panic, but instead helped his mother pull the car off the road, calmed her, checked her breathing and pulse, got help, and then remained with her until the help arrived. According to Ms. Touchstone, "He said he remembered what I told him to do. He didn't panic. The doctor said if he 
had panicked, Mom might not have not made it. Then, he hugged me. What more could a teacher ever want?"<p>

<p>Stuffee is the honorary head of the FHP Fit Kids Club. Stuffee is soft and cute and cuddly. Oh yes, and six feet tall.<p>

Designed by Jo Winger of the Pittsburgh Children's Museum, Stuffee is the center of many FHP Fit Kids Club activities. When school groups tour FHP facilities, Stuffee can be there to greet them. When they call the FHP Fit Kids Club hotline, they hear Stuffee give them important health tips. And when Health Awareness Lesson instructors come to their school, Stuffee teaches kids some basic things about how their body works.<p>

That's because Stuffee has a heart. And a gall bladder, large and small intestines, liver, lungs, pancreas, stomach, and esophagus too. All the vital organs kids need to know about -- in colorful, touchable cloth.<p>

<h1>Meet Stuffee</h1>
<hr size=1 noshade>
</center>

<p>Stuffee is the honorary head of the FHP Fit Kids Club. Stuffee is soft and cute and cuddly. Oh yes, and six feet tall.<p>

Designed by Jo Winger of the Pittsburgh Children's Museum, Stuffee is the center of many FHP Fit Kids Club activities. When school groups tour FHP facilities, Stuffee can be there to greet them. When they call the FHP Fit Kids Club hotline, they hear Stuffee give them important health tips. And when Health Awareness Lesson instructors come to their school, Stuffee teaches kids some basic things about how their body works.<p>

That's because Stuffee has a heart. And a gall bladder, large and small intestines, liver, lungs, pancreas, stomach, and esophagus too. All the vital organs kids need to know about -- in colorful, touchable cloth.<p>

The 1994 recipient of the FHP Outstanding School Health Educator Award is Jeanette Varela,
R.N., B.S.N., school nurse at Santa Clara Elementary in Tucson, Arizona. The winning entry,
"Shifting from an Illness Orientation to a Wellness Perspective," outlined how Mrs. Varela successfully enlisted the support of students, teachers, administrators, and parents in planning and implementing a comprehensive health education program for her school of over 600 students.<p>

During the 1993-94 school year, she gave over 130 health-related classroom presentations as well as in-service training to teachers and staff. Subjects covered included: alcohol and drug prevention, dental care, gang awareness, HIV/AIDS, human growth and development, hygiene, nutrition, and safety. Mrs. Varela also shared her experiences in developing the program and effectively creating change to other school nurses in her district. The result: several of the nurses began similar programs in their own schools. Best of all says Mrs. Varela, "I finally 'got my hand out of the band-aid jar' and believe I have truly made a positive impact on the lives of my students. They are learning how to make intelligent and informed decisions which will keep them happy, healthy, and, most importantly, alive."<p>

The winner of the 1995 FHP Outstanding School Health Educator Award is Clair Touchstone, Health Educator at Kingman Junior High School in Kingman, AZ. Over the last three years, about 1,300 children were taught directly by Ms. Touchstone. As Kingman Junior High School has an enrollment of about 905 students per year, 2,850 students have received comprehensive health education in that same time due to the use of diversified classes to meet the needs of the students.<p>

Many parents have met Ms. Touchstone in the grocery store or at school and thanked her for being open and honest with their children. Some students who are already sexually active have come to Ms. Touchstone to tell her they are going to start practice abstinence.<p>

Many students who are usually failures in regular course work experience repeated success in her class; self-esteem rises. You can't imagine what a CPR card means to many of her eighth graders. Touchstone's students go home and share what they learn with their families.<p>

While she has no statistics to show that she has contributed to the prevention of teen pregnancy or the lessening of sexual intercourse among adolescents, Ms. Touchstone knows her students leave her class with enough knowledge to make informed decisions about their behavior and its consequences.<p>

In March 1995, a boy who had just finished his coursework told Ms. Touchstone that he had saved his mother's life. His mother was driving the car and began to experience chest pains. He told his teacher that he didn't panic, but instead helped his mother pull the car off the road, calmed her, checked her breathing and pulse, got help, and then remained with her until the help arrived. According to Ms. Touchstone, "He said he remembered what I told him to do. He didn't panic. The doctor said if he 
had panicked, Mom might not have not made it. Then, he hugged me. What more could a teacher ever want?"<p>

<h1>Meet the 1995 Award Recipient</h1>
</center>
<hr size=1 noshade><br>

The winner of the 1995 FHP Outstanding School Health Educator Award is Clair Touchstone, Health Educator at Kingman Junior High School in Kingman, AZ. Over the last three years, about 1,300 children were taught directly by Ms. Touchstone. As Kingman Junior High School has an enrollment of about 905 students per year, 2,850 students have received comprehensive health education in that same time due to the use of diversified classes to meet the needs of the students.<p>

Many parents have met Ms. Touchstone in the grocery store or at school and thanked her for being open and honest with their children. Some students who are already sexually active have come to Ms. Touchstone to tell her they are going to start practice abstinence.<p>

Many students who are usually failures in regular course work experience repeated success in her class; self-esteem rises. You can't imagine what a CPR card means to many of her eighth graders. Touchstone's students go home and share what they learn with their families.<p>

While she has no statistics to show that she has contributed to the prevention of teen pregnancy or the lessening of sexual intercourse among adolescents, Ms. Touchstone knows her students leave her class with enough knowledge to make informed decisions about their behavior and its consequences.<p>

In March 1995, a boy who had just finished his coursework told Ms. Touchstone that he had saved his mother's life. His mother was driving the car and began to experience chest pains. He told his teacher that he didn't panic, but instead helped his mother pull the car off the road, calmed her, checked her breathing and pulse, got help, and then remained with her until the help arrived. According to Ms. Touchstone, "He said he remembered what I told him to do. He didn't panic. The doctor said if he 
had panicked, Mom might not have not made it. Then, he hugged me. What more could a teacher ever want?"<p>

NATURALSIZEFLAG=
"3"><B>Automotive Body Repair News</B> is a monthly trade publication serving
the collision repair industry. The editorial content is aimed primarily
at the collision repair shop owner and his or her technicians. This market
is represented mainly by independent or franchise collision repair shops
and new or used car dealers with body shops. In addition, ABRN reaches ancillary
collision repair establishments such as fleet facilities performing collision
repair, specialists in frame or structural repairs and wholesalers or
warehouse/distributors
specializing in paint, body repair and equipment lines. <P>
<IMG SRC="IMAGES/REDBALL.GIF" WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN=bottom
NATURALSIZEFLAG=
"3">ABRN primarily provides news, product and technical service information
on a variety of collision repair topics. This technical information takes
several forms within the magazine, including features and technical departments
such as Tech Corner and Paint Shop. In addition, ABRN offers the reader
industry news, environmental news and business management information in
either a feature or shop profile format. The management information presented
stresses practical examples and real-world situations the reader can use
to improve his or her business management skills. <P>
<IMG SRC="IMAGES/REDBALL.GIF" WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN=bottom
NATURALSIZEFLAG=
"3">ABRN has unique features which set it apart from other trade magazines.
One example is our monthly technical training program with a training quiz
which is computerized for scoring by the magazine. ABRN offers more complete
collision repair industry coverage than any other national publication.
In editorial direction, ABRN prefers to lead rather than follow by offering
the most innovative and focused technical editorial tailored carefully to
the needs of the reader. <P>
<IMG SRC="IMAGES/REDBALL.GIF" WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN=bottom
NATURALSIZEFLAG=
"3">The strong technical training commitment identified with Chilton and
ABRN is further reinforced by our relationship with the established industry
technician certification organization known as ASE and our <A
HREF="techtrai.htm">ASE
Self-Study Guides.</A> These guides are designed to help collision repair
technicians achieve ASE certification and increase industry professionalism.
<P>
<IMG SRC="IMAGES/REDBALL.GIF" WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN=bottom
NATURALSIZEFLAG=
"3">By carefully tracking reader needs, ABRN remains on the cutting edge
of providing the kind of need-to-know, hands-on technical information our
readers demand. This is balanced by both news and product information, along
with management features. <P>

NATURALSIZEFLAG=
"3"><B>There are several trends in the collision repair industry generating
a great deal of controversy. The most visible of these include Direct Repair,
legislation to remove insurance company anti-trust exemptions, direct parts
purchasing and the need for training. The most important collision industry
trends being tracked and reported in the pages of ABRN include: </B><P>
<IMG SRC="IMAGES/REDBALL.GIF" WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN=bottom
NATURALSIZEFLAG=
"3"><B>Direct Repair Programs (DRPs).</B> These programs are an attempt
by the insurance industry to control costs and are the greatest source of
friction between shops and insurers. The debate continues, but DRP's are
well-established within the industry and many feel the concept represents
the wave of the future. <P>
<IMG SRC="IMAGES/REDBALL.GIF" WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN=bottom
NATURALSIZEFLAG=
"3"><B>Preferred Provider Options (PPO).</B> These programs are an attempt
by the insurance industry to control costs by offering policyholders discounts
in exchange for limiting their choices when it comes to collision repair.
Those limits include the use of specific repair shops and the use of aftermarket
or non-OEM parts and sheetmetal. While not yet in effect, the concept has
met with vocal resistance from collision repairers, OEM vehicle makers and
trade associations. <P>
<IMG SRC="IMAGES/REDBALL.GIF" WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN=bottom
NATURALSIZEFLAG=
"3"><B>Environmental Legislation.</B> The 1990 Clean Air Act restricts the
emission of volatile organic compounds (VOC's) and is impacting the collision
repair industry in a big way. This and other provisions of the CAA will
continue to impact the industry in the years ahead. <P>
<IMG SRC="IMAGES/REDBALL.GIF" WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN=bottom
NATURALSIZEFLAG=
"3"><B>Safety.</B> With rising insurance costs, safety is of primary concern
in the industry. Topics include OSHA regulations and shop's safety in general.
<P>
<IMG SRC="IMAGES/REDBALL.GIF" WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN=bottom
NATURALSIZEFLAG=
"3"><B>Hazardous waste</B> and waste disposal is another growing concern
due to CAA regulations. <P>
<IMG SRC="IMAGES/REDBALL.GIF" WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN=bottom
NATURALSIZEFLAG=
"3"><B>Business Management.</B> The actual number of collision repair jobs
are declining for several reasons. Modern vehicles are complex and easily
totaled; advances like anti-lock brakes and traction control have increased
driver control, and drunk driving legislation and enforcement have increased
consumer awareness and improved safe driving practices. This translates
in fewer repair jobs and collision shops must establish good management
practices to remain profitable. The renewed interest in business management
topics is growing. <P>
<IMG SRC="IMAGES/REDBALL.GIF" WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN=bottom
NATURALSIZEFLAG=
"3"><B>Industry Image. </B>There are several organizations working to improve
the image of the collision repair industry in the minds of consumers and
potential employees. <P>
<IMG SRC="IMAGES/REDBALL.GIF" WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN=bottom
NATURALSIZEFLAG=
"3"><B>Entry-level Technicians.</B> Aside from the focus on training and
education for existing collision technicians, there is great industry concern
over their replacements in the years ahead. Several programs have been initiated
to attract young people into the industry. <P>
<IMG SRC="IMAGES/REDBALL.GIF" WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN=bottom
NATURALSIZEFLAG=
"3"><B>Aftermarket Parts.</B> The ongoing debate over aftermarket vs. OEM
repair parts. <P>
<IMG SRC="IMAGES/REDBALL.GIF" WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN=bottom
NATURALSIZEFLAG=
"3"><B>Licensing and/or Industry Standards</B>. The debate over repair standards
and shop licensing has just begun. <P>
<IMG SRC="IMAGES/REDBALL.GIF" WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN=bottom
NATURALSIZEFLAG=
"3"><B>Direct parts purchasing</B> would remove parts profits from the shop
balance sheet. The technology is here. The implications are legion. <P>
<IMG SRC="IMAGES/REDBALL.GIF" WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN=bottom
NATURALSIZEFLAG=
"3"><B>Connectivity.</B> The technology available for EDI (Electronic Data
Interchange) is only just beginning to impact the collision repair industry.
Given the heavy use of electronic estimating systems by the major players,
the advantages of electronic connectivity are still being defined. <P>
<IMG SRC="IMAGES/REDBALL.GIF" WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN=bottom
NATURALSIZEFLAG=
"3"><B>Compensation.</B> Hampered by anti-trust regulations, the industry
is still searching for meaningful dialog on compensation to counter insurance
industry pressure to cut costs at the expense of the collision repair industry.
