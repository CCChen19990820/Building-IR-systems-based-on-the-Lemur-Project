8th January 1997
<P>
The boss of the new North of Scotland Water Authority (NoSWA) last  night [TUES] denied 'short-changing' Shetland and said some  councillors were 'not very fair' when they complained about delays to  rural sewerage schemes.
<P>
Alasdair Findlay, NoSWA's chief executive, was speaking on the eve of  a visit to Shetland to meet residents in Whalsay, South Whiteness and  Hillswick, where drainage projects have been put on hold. 
<P>
Speaking on local radio, Mr Findlay said: 'We haven't actually  dropped anything. There are questions of timing when schemes go  ahead.' The board would decide its priorities shortly and he wanted  to hear local people's views before it did.
<P>
NoSWA had reduced charges since it took over from Shetland Islands  Council in April and, unlike the council, no longer charged  householders for sewers if they were not connected to main drainage.
<P>
Mr Findlay said they were committed to a two million pounds Lerwick  sewerage scheme over the next couple of years, cleaning up the town's harbour.
<P>
'I don't think I'd accept any kind of charge that we're  short-changing people in Shetland,' he said.
<P>
Commenting on suggestions that the council had deliberately brought  forward sewerage schemes in its own programme, shortly before NoSWA  began work, he said: 'It would be quite understandable if the council  wanted to get as much work done, or as much work in the pipeline,  before they had to take their hands off the tiller and leave the job to us...' 
<P>
The chief executive said the board served 1.2 million of Scotland's  total population and had to meet European obligations on water  quality as one of its priorities. But they were 'acutely aware' of  their responsibilities to outlying areas.

8th January 1997
<P>
Two Shetland fish farmers and their passenger had a narrow escape  yesterday [TUES] when their boat almost capsized at the mouth of  Scalloway Harbour.
<P>
Brothers Angus and Calum Grains sent out a Mayday call when the  42-foot tender 'Celerity' took a severe list after tanks full of  salmon smolts shifted on deck.
<P>
Coastguards said the situation was so serious that the crew and a  salmon firm representative on board launched their liferaft.
<P>
The Coastguard rescue helicopter was scrambled from Sumburgh Airport  but a local fishing boat, the 'Challenge', was on the scene first and  towed the 'Celerity' and her crew safely into dock at Scalloway.

8th January 1997
<P>
Lerwick Lifeboat went to the aid of a scallop fishing boat early  yesterday [TUES] morning after a fire on board.
<P>
The two-man crew of the 30-foot 'Annie Francis' radioed for help  around 5am when their heating stove caught fire two miles east of the  uninhabited island of Noss.
<P>
The crew managed to contain the blaze with a fire extinguisher. The  lifeboat escorted them the six miles to Lerwick, where the local fire  brigade put the fire out.
<P>
No-one was hurt in the incident, which was co-ordinated by Shetland  Coastguard. The 'Annie Francis' is registered in Aberdeen but owned locally.
<P>
A few hours earlier, an ill fisherman from the Fraserburgh boat  'King's Cross' was flown to hospital in Lerwick by a Shell helicopter  from the Brent oilfield.

<HR>

<P>


<H4>&quot;But what's the weather like, so far north?&quot;</H4>

</center>
<P>

It's a question often asked of Shetland Tourist Centre staff in Lerwick, by intending visitors who've looked at the map and found that the islands are on latitude 60 degrees north - the same as Anchorage in Alaska, St Petersburg or southern Greenland. 
<P><A HREF="biglow.jpg"><img src="biglows.jpg" align=right></A>
The answer is surprising. Shetland has lots and lots of weather. Sometimes we get four seasons in a day. It's rarely the same two days running. That's because the islands lie 200 miles off the continent of Europe, in a corner of the North-east Atlantic where different air masses fight an endless war. Each day's weather is a battle in this atmospheric conflict. From the north, polar winds blow down over a thousand miles of ocean from Spitzbergen. Not very often, fortunately, or Shetland would have winters like Labrador. From the east, cold winter air from the continent spills out into the Atlantic, bringing clear, frosty weather which can settle for days at a time.

<P>
In summer, this Scandinavian air is much warmer than the North Sea and gives days of sunshine on the sheltered western shores of the islands - while the exposed east coast is swathed in sea fog. Most of Shetland's weather comes from the open Atlantic, however, as depressions - each about 500 miles across - swirl in one after the other, disrupting the stable air from the north and east. 
<P>
The depressions bring startling and rapid changes. When the barometer is falling, you can set out for a sail on a glorious sunny morning with a light, south-easterly breeze. The air will be so clear that you can see islands 50 miles away. Idyllic! But by lunchtime it'll have clouded over and the wind will be veering southerly. Evening may find your boat seeking shelter in one of Shetland's many welcoming small harbours, as a gale from the south-west sets in with heavy rain. Next morning the wind will be a north-westerly breeze with heavy showers sweeping over the islands. You'll see them coming miles away. Touring by car, you can choose a route to dodge them. 
<P>
These magically clear days of a Shetland summer are known in dialect as &quot;days atween wadders&quot; (&quot;days between weathers&quot;) and more than make up for the occasional summer fogs and gales. Days Atween Wadders happen in winter too, although between October and March the gales are much more frequent and rain can be torrential and prolonged. Rain rarely falls vertically in Shetland. It moves sideways at varying speed before hitting something and dripping to earth. It rains often but the annual total (1,198mm) is only half that of the Isle of Skye. 
<P>
The driest months are May, June and July, with only about 63mm (2.5 ins) each. At 60 degrees North, we ought to get a lot of snow. Valdez in Alaska, for example, gets over 30 feet of it a year, on the same latitude. We don't. Not that it doesn't snow; it does, frequently. And most of all in early spring. But it's usually in the form of showers and it rarely lies for more than a day or two. Big snowstorms are very unusual but when they do come they come with a vengeance. The high winds build up huge drifts, blocking roads and almost burying houses. Prolonged freezing is also rare. There's no sea ice but, after a calm and frosty spell, you may find a thin layer of ice on the tide-line in sheltered voes, or inlets. 
<P>
Shetland's mild but wild winters are one reason why the growing season is surprisingly long, even though it doesn't really start until mid-May. Garden roses in bloom at Christmas are not uncommon. The cause of the mild winters and cool summers is simple - Shetland has 900 miles of coastline and nowhere is more than three miles from the ocean. The islands are bathed by the North Atlantic Drift, an offshoot of the Gulf Stream, which warms the air in winter and cools it in summer. The sea temperature only varies from about seven degrees C. in February and March to 13 degrees in July and August, although it can be warmer in the voes around the coast. The annual range of air temperatures is also quite small. The monthly average maximum peaks at around 14 degrees C. (57F) in August, dropping to six degrees C. in March. 
<P>
The prevailing wind is south- westerly. But rapid and frequent changes in direction are the norm, particularly when those Atlantic depressions are passing through. They bring the worst gales between October and March, when the average wind speed is a stiff Force Five breeze. Gales of Force Eight (39 mph) and more blow on average for about 36 days in autumn and winter. Shetland gales are spectacular. Winds of Force 10 can be expected several times each winter, sometimes reaching Hurricane Force 12 or 13. Gusts of 200 mph have been recorded. Huge seas build up, particularly on the west coast, and salt spray carries far inland.
<P>
The big winds are awe-inspiring but also useful. They bring driftwood for the fires and seaweed for fields and gardens - compensation for the coastal erosion and occasional structural damage they cause. Summer gales are less frequent - seven &quot;gale days&quot; on average between April and September - but it's still breezy, with the average wind speed around Force Three to Four. Constant changes in wind speed and direction make pleasure sailing on the Shetland coast a fascinating challenge. Whatever the wind, the convoluted coastline means that there's always a sheltered beach to be found for the bucket-and-spade brigade. 
<P>
Artists and photographers rejoice in the quality of light in the islands. For half of the year, Shetland has more of it than anywhere else in Britain. June sunshine averages 154 hours. On Midsummer Day, the sun's above the horizon for almost 19 hours. The remaining five hours and eight minutes are officially termed &quot;civil twilight&quot;. Shetlanders call it the &quot;Simmer Dim&quot;. From mid-May until mid-July the Simmer Dim gives the midnight hours a magical quality. On clear nights it's light enough to read by. Sunsets and sunrises are often sensational and prolonged. All this extra light means more time for visitors to enjoy outdoor activities. Don't worry if it's too windy and wet for that outing in the morning. By teatime the weather will probably be better, and you still have plenty of daylight and &quot;Simmer Dim&quot; ahead of you. 
<P>
The mysterious twilight is enhanced by veils of mist swirling up the valleys from the sea, vanishing as the morning sun warms the air. Thick fog is rare - only 19 &quot;fog days&quot; on average each year - and mainly confined to the summer months. Long hours when the sun is low in the sky produce a glowing, golden light which brings out the artist in locals and visitors alike. More inspiration comes from the magnificent cloudscapes. Somehow the sky seems bigger when you're on an island in the ocean. 
<P>
Superb skies are common in winter, too. And a clear night brings a good chance of seeing the Aurora Borealis, or Northern Lights. Shetlanders have a name for them - the &quot;Merrie Dancers&quot;. They're around on at least a hundred nights a year, although it's often too cloudy to see them. Usually the lights appear as shimmering veils of pale green and white over the northern horizon. In good conditions, when the Sun's &quot;solar wind&quot; is battering the Earth's magnetic field, the display of charged particles can cover the whole sky. Then amazing, fiery, pinkish-red aurora may appear, often radiating from directly overhead. In summer it's too light for the &quot;Merrie Dancers&quot; but from mid-August onwards there's the &quot;Mareel&quot;. That's the Shetland name for phosphorescence. Returning late from a sea fishing trip, the wake of a boat will glow with millions of tiny silver lights, given off by agitated plankton.
<P>
Whenever you come to Shetland, we guarantee that the weather won't be boring!

The number of <b>SNOW BUNTINGS</b> seems to be decreasing. The first-winter <b>ICELAND GULL</b> is still the only white-winged gull at the Gremista Fish Factory.

<p>
<hr>
<p>

<h2>25/11/96</h2>

Extraordinary news of the day was the finding of Shetland's latest ever <b>PIED FLYCATCHER</b> at Sumburgh by Alan McCall.  Most autumn Shetland records are in September with dwindling numbers through October and only one previous November record - at Sullom Voe on the 5-11th in 1987. Unfortunately it did not hang around - probably thought it was perhaps a bit chilly!!

<p>
<hr>
<p>

<h2>22/11/96</h2>

A <b>WOODLARK</b> was at Sandwick today. The small numbers of <b>WAXWINGS</b> are still present as are the large numbers of <b>SNOW BUNTINGS</b>. The first-winter <b>ICELAND GULL</b> is still the only white-winged gull at the Gremista Fish Factory - which is very unusual for this time of year as there are usually a lot more around by now, especially as the winds have been predominantly from the north.

<p>
<hr>
<p>

<h2>20/11/96</h2>

The adult <b>KING EIDER</b> is still in Mousa Sound, the small numbers of <b>WAXWINGS</b> are still present, as are the large number of <b>SNOW BUNTINGS</b>. The first-winter <b>ICELAND GULL</b> is still at the Gremista Fish Factory, Lerwick.

<p>
<hr>
<p>

<h2>17/11/96</h2>

An adult <b>KING EIDER</b> is in Mousa Sound - probably the same one as was there and around Sumburgh in the early part of the year. <b>WAXWINGS</b> are appearing throughout the isles, although only in one's and two's, and the large number of <b>SNOW BUNTINGS</b> are still present with flocks of 20-30 almost everywhere.

<p>
<hr>
<p>

<h2>16/11/96</h2>

The <b>WAXWINGS</b> are still feeding in the large tree just north of the Queens Hotel in Lerwick although there are now only 4. The large numbers of <b>SNOW BUNTINGS</b> are still evident - at least 500 are in the Sumburgh area. The first-winter <b>ICELAND GULL</b> is still at the Gremista Fish Factory.

<p>
<hr>
<p>

<h2>14/11/96</h2>

The 14 or so <b>WAXWINGS</b> are still feeding in the large tree just north of the Queens Hotel in Lerwick and the large numbers of <b>SNOW BUNTINGS</b> are still evident. The first-winter <b>ICELAND GULL</b> is still at the Gremista Fish Factory.

<p>
<HR>
<p>

<h2>13/11/96</h2>

It's <b>SNOW BUNTINGS R US</b> - there are at least 1000 in the isles at the moment, mostly in small flocks of up to 50 although there are at least 200 in one flock at Skaw, Unst. Small numbers of <b>WAXWINGS</b> are also evident at the moment - up to 14 are feeding in the large tree just north of the Queens Hotel in Lerwick, at least 5 are at Walls and 3 are at Baltasound, Unst.

<p>
<hr>
<p>

<h2>12/11/96</h2>

<b>SNOW BUNTINGS</b> have arrived in the isles in significant numbers - at least 500 are on Unst with at least a further 250 in the south Mainland. Three <b>WAXWINGS</b> were at the Flower Park in Lerwick this morning - feeding on the berries on the bushes there - which are rapidly disappearing.

<p>
<hr>
<p>

<h2>11/11/96</h2>

A single <b>WAXWING</b> was at Baltasound today, as was a <b>BLUE TIT</b> at Norwick (both Unst).

<p>
<hr>
<p>

<h2>9/11/96</h2>

A female/immature <b>VELVET SCOTER</b> was off Uyeasound, Unst today. The first-winter <b>ICELAND GULL</b> is still at the Gremista Fish Factory.

<h2>6/11/96</h2>

At least <b>100 SNOW BUNTINGS</b> are on Unst with at least 30 in the Sumburgh area. he first-winter <b>ICELAND GULL</b> is still at Lerwick Harbour - around the Gremista Fish Factory.

<p>
<hr>
<p>

<h2>3/11/96</h2>

The first <b>WAXWINGS (2)</b> of the autumn were at the Walls School today. A first-winter <b>ICELAND GULL</b> is in Lerwick Harbour.

<h2>30/10/96</h2>

The <b>2 PALLAS'S WARBLER's</b> and the <b>YELLOW-BROWED WARBLER</b> are still at Voe.

<p>
<hr>
<p>

<h2>29/10/96</h2>

There are now <b>2 PALLAS'S WARBLER's</b> and a <b>YELLOW-BROWED WARBLER</b> at Voe.

<p>
<hr>
<p>

<h2>28/10/96</h2>

The <b>PALLAS'S WARBLER</b> is still at Voe.

<p>
<HR>
<p>

<h2>27/10/96</h2>

The <b>PALLAS'S WARBLER'S</b> are still at Voe and Bressay.

<p>
<hr>
<p>

<h2>26/10/96</h2>

There are still a lot of <b>REDWING'S</b> and <b>CHAFFINCHES</b> around at the moment although the arrivals of the day were <b>PALLAS'S WARBLER'S</b> at Voe and Bressay, with 2 on Whalsay. A <b>DOTTEREL</b> was also on Skerries.

<p>
<hr>
<p>

<h2>25/10/96</h2>

The only news today was a <b>POMARINE SKUA</b> and <b>GLAUCOUS GULL</b> off Sumburgh Head around mid-day.

<p>
<hr>
<p>

<h2>20/10/96</h2>

Yesterdays <b>RADDE'S WARBLERS</b> at Sandwick and Geosetter were still present today although there was no sign of the Voe individual. The <b>WOODLARK</b> at Mid-Dale is also still present.

<p>

New birds today were a <b>YELLOW-BROWED WARBLER</b> at Eswick, an <b>OLIVE-BACKED PIPIT</b> at Kergord, and a <b>LITTLE BUNTING</b> on Skerries.

<p>
<hr>
<p>

<h2>19/10/96</h2>

Its <b>RADDE'S WARBLERS</b> R US. There were <b>THREE</b> found today; at Voe, Sandwick and Geosetter. One in an autumn is good for Shetland but three in a day is exceptional. These Siberian warblers are superficially similar to a brownish Chiffchaff but are much 'stronger' looking and have a slightly thicker bill and stronger looking legs.

<p>

In addition there was a <b>WOODLARK</b> at Mid-Dale, Walls, and a <b>GREAT GREY SHRIKE</b> at Boddam.

<p>
<hr>
<p>

<h2>18/10/96</h2>

After their safe arrival at Aberdeen University the two bats were positively identified as a <b>NATHUSIUS' PIPISTRELLE</b> and a <b>LEISLER'S BAT</b>, thay will be studied, fed and released in a weeks time.

<p>

There are still lots of <b>THRUSHES, ROBIN'S</b> and <b>GOLDCREST'S</b> around, with <b>2 BLUE TIT'S</b> at Voe and a late <b>RED-BREASTED FLYCATCHER</b> at Voxter.

<p>
<hr>
<p>

<h2>17/10/96</h2>

Migrants were still in evidence today with hundreds of <b>REDWINGS</b> evident, along with <b>GOLDCRESTS, BRAMBLINGS</b> and at least 12 <b>BULLFINCHES</b> throughout the isles. A <b>YELLOW-BROWED WARBLER</b> and <b>BLUE TIT</b> were also at Norwick, Unst.

<p>

Having at last got to see yesterday's two <b>NATHUSIUS' PIPISTRELLE</b> bats, it was time for some re-identification! Although the one from from Norwick, Unst remains most likely a <b>PIPISTRELLE</b>, the one from East Burrafirth is almost certainly a <b>LEISLER'S BAT</b>.

<p>

Although there is one previous record of this species in Shetland - from Ollaberry in 1968 (no date given - Berry & Johnston 1980), its arrival here is extremely unusual as the nearest breeding colonies of this predominantly eastern European species are in Northern Ireland and Yorkshire.

<p>

Both bats have now been transported to Aberdeen University for identification and study before being released back into the wild. Confirmation of their identification is by no means straightforward as factors such as webbing between toes, dentition, ear shape and measurements all have to be carried out - and on a mammal the size of a mouse this is not easy. As soon as their species status has been confirmed by the University I'll let you know.

<p>
<hr>
<p>

<h2>16/10/96</h2>

There were quite a few migrants around today as the wind has moved to the south. Thrushes (especially <b>REDWINGS</b>) are abundant along with <b>GOLDCRESTS, BRAMBLINGS</b> and a few <b>BULLFINCHES</b> - a sure sign winter is upon us! In addition a <b>YELLOW-BROWED WARBLER</b> was at south Yell.

<p>

The most unusual migrants of the day were two <b>NATHUSIUS' PIPISTRELLE</b> bats - no doubt also blown in by the strong winds of the last few days - one at East Burrafirth and the other at Norwick, Unst. 

<p>

<A HREF="com_pip.jpg"><img align=right src="com_pipa.jpg"></a>

The majority of the bats found or seen in flight in Shetland are believed to belong to this species or the closely related <b>COMMON PIPISTRELLE</b>. Separation of the two species requires detailed 'in the hand' examination, so few records have been assigned to a particular species, although there are about 14 known records of either one or the other of these two species during recent years. In addition Venables & Venables (1955) give a record of a pipistrelle found at North Roe in 1904 and mention occasional sight records of small bats during their residence in Shetland, unfortunately without any further details. One was also picked up on Whalsay on the 2nd November 1940 (Shetland Times), but most sightings have undoubtedly gone unrecorded. Let me know if you come across any!

Please remember that as all bats found in Shetland are migrants and are likely to have arrived from Europe, they should be treated with caution as some species are known to be <i>potential</i> carriers of rabies. If you find a bat in Shetland do-not handle it without protective gloves and please contact the Scottish Natural Heritage Office in Lerwick (01595) 693345, who will be able to advise on the best way to deal with it safely, which may involve them air-freighting it south to be rehabilitated in Scotland!

<h2>14/10/96</h2>

Most of yesterdays <b>GEESE</b> were still present in the South Mainland as were the 'eastern' race <b>JACKDAWS</b> at Strand.

<p>
<hr>
<p>

<h2>13/10/96</h2>

<b>GREYLAG GEESE</b> were very much in evidence today in the South Mainland. Numbers were building up throughout the day at Spiggie and Brow with eventual totals of at least 900 at Spiggie and 1500 around Brow. These are exceptional numbers and far in excess of the usual 2-300 normally present at this time of year. Along with them were single <b>BRENT</B> and <B>BARNACLE GEESE</b> and a few <b>PINK-FOOTED GEESE</b>.

<p>

In addition, at least one 'eastern' race <b>JACKDAW</b> is at Strand. This subspecies differs from the usual grey-headed birds by having obvious white patches on each side of its neck, like that of a Wood Pigeon. Two others showed similar markings but the patches were not as obvious.

<p>
<hr>
<p>

<h2>3-12/10/96</h2>

Not a lot by all accounts - just as well - as I was touring Scotland watching Golden Eagles and White-tailed Eagles!

<p>
<hr>
<p>

<h2>2/10/96</h2>

Yesterday's <b>AMERICAN WIGEON</b> was back on Pullars Loch at Scatness today and the <b>OLIVE-BACKED PIPIT</b> is still at Falddabister.

<p>
<hr>
<p>

<h2>1/10/96</h2>

News of the day was the discovery of a <b>PADDYFIELD WARBLER</b> along the Feal Burn on Fetlar, and an eclipse plumage <b>AMERICAN WIGEON</b> on Pullars Loch at Scatness this afternoon. Unfortunately the Wigeon flew off towards Horse Island not long after its discovery and was not seen again during the rest of the day. The <b>OLIVE-BACKED PIPIT</b> is still at Falddabister.

<p>

Birds are arriving from both the east and west! the Paddyfield warbler hails from eastern Europe - Bulgaria/Rumania  - and the American Wigeon, not surprisingly, from North America.

<p>

On Fair Isle an American <b>BAIRD'S SANDPIPER</b> was reported late this afternoon but could not be relocated.

<p>
<hr>
<p>

<h2>30/9/96</h2>

Few birds around today, the only sightings of note were the <b>SHORT-TOED LARK</b> at the tattie rig next to the Sumburgh Hotel, the <b>OLIVE-BACKED PIPIT</b> at Falddabister, and <b>YELLOW-BROWED WARBLERS</b> at Scalloway, Vidlin, and Ollaberry. The White-throated Sparrow was apparently not seen today.

<p>
<hr>
<p>

<h2>29/9/96</h2>

News of the day was the discovery of an American <b>SEMIPALMATED SANDPIPER</b> at the Pool of Virkie, this afternoon. This is an exceptionally rare wader and is only the third to be recorded in Scotland. Superficially it resembles a Little Stint  and is not easy to pick out among the many Dunlin, Sanderling and Ringed Plover frequenting the exposed mud at Virkie at the moment. If you are going to look for it make sure you go at low tide as almost all the waders move off when the mud is covered.

<h2>9/9/96</h2>

A pod of 6 <b>RISSO'S DOLPHINS</b> were off Sumburgh Head today.

Although not Shetland News it transpires that a Beluga (almost certainly the same individual that was here on the 4th) was around Orkney on the 7th and has now moved further south to the coast of Thurso where it beached and had to be un-beached by the local SSPCA.

<p>
<hr>
<p>

<h2>5/9/96</h2>

Unfortunately there was no further sign of yesterday's <b>BELUGA WHALE</b> today, despite extensive searching.

<p>

<p>

<h2>4/9/96</h2>

Top news of the day was the discovery of Shetlands' first and only about Britains fith <b>BELUGA WHALE</b> swimming in Hoswick Bay (near Sandwick) late this afternoon. The species is very distinctive being almost entirely white in colour and lacking any dorsal (back) fin. It also has a bulbous forehead and frequently lifts its head from the sea - apparently 'looking around', although this individual was not performing in this way. 

<p>

Its normal range is the northern polar regions where it occurrs in the sea around the ice pack, although it is known to migrate south as the polar ice cap expands during the autumn. It is one of the 'toothed' whales, feeding primarily on fish and crustaceans and is usually found in large groups of several individuals together, which makes this one even more unusual.

<p>

About 200-300 folk turned up at Hoswick to see the whale as news of its discovery spread rapidly throughout the isles, aided by a news broadcast on Radio Shetland. It was last seen about 6.45pm heading south towards Sumburgh Head, hopefully it will be relocated again tommorrow.

2005BST : Four (possiby more) <b>KILLER WHALES</b> again passing within a few yards of 
the Score Point, Bressay. Seen at a distance of 500 yards, from on 
land (we'd moored up the boat and gone ashore). My third 
sighting at this location this year and the fourth (counting the 
Bruntland one last month) in this vicinity.
<BR>
As on previous occasions, the whales swam off southwards, at about 
10mph, towards Noss - this time apparently feeding on fish, not seals.
<BR>
They appear to be attracted by the upwelling of water over the 70' 
high underwater cliff which stetches NE of the Score. Every sighting 
has been with the flood tide.

<h2>14/8/96</h2>

There were fewer moths around last night although there was still another new species for Shetland, a <b>LIME-SPECK PUG</b> at Eswick where there was also another <b>DEWICK'S PLUSIA</b>.

<p>

On Fetlar, the <b>BLACK-HEADED BUNTING</b> was relocated along with <b>2 BARRED WARBLERS</b>, a <b>RED-BACKED SHRIKE</b>, and an <b>ICTERINE WARBLER</b>.

<p>

Yesterdays <b>GREENISH WARBLER</b> was still at the Sumburgh Hotel Garden, along with an <b>ICTERINE WARBLER</b> at Sumburgh Head, a <b>BARRED WARBLER</b> on Whalsay, and the first-summer <b>GLAUCOUS GULL</b> was still in Lerwick Harbour - around the Shetland Catch Fish Factory.

<h2>13/8/96</h2>

Its <b>MOTH'S R US and WORLD OF MOTH'S</b> in Shetland at the moment, with at least another <b>FOUR</b> new species for the isles discovered again last night. These were - <b>DEWICK'S PLUSIA</b> at Eswick, a <b>SCARCE BRINDLE</b> on Unst (also only about the 4th ever recorded in Britain), an amazing 4 specimens of the <b>DOGS TOOTH</b> (an equally amazing name for a moth), singles at Sandwick and Unst and 2 at Eswick, but an incredible 14 specimens of <b>THE SUSPECTED</b>, all at Eswick. 
There were also 2 or 3 other specimens which may also be firsts for Shetland but they are currently awaiting confirmation of identification.

<p>

Other unusual records included 150 <B>GREAT BROCADES</b> - 20 in a year in the whole of Britain is exceptional for this species, 12 <b>SCARCE SILVER Y's</b> - 14 in a year in the whole of Britain would be a record number, a <b>BEDSTRAW HAWK MOTH</b> at Norwick, Unst, another <b>GARDEN TIGER</b> at Veensgarth, <b>4 ANGLE STRIPED SALLOWS</b>, a <b>CLOAKED MINOR</b>, and a <b>BLOOD VEIN</b> all at Eswick, and a further <b>3 DOUBLE LOBED</b> - 2 at Norwick and 1 at Eswick.

<p>

Moving on to birds, a <b>GREENISH WARBLER</b> was in the Sumburgh Hotel Garden today, an <b>ICTERINE WARBLER</b> was at Sumburgh Head, at least 2 <b>BARRED WARBLERS</b> were on Whalsay, and a first-summer <b>GLAUCOUS GULL</b> was in Lerwick Harbour.

<p>

On Fetlar, yesterday's Black-headed Bunting could not be relocated but <b>4 BARRED WARBLERS</b>, and a <b>RED-BACKED SHRIKE, ICTERINE WARBLER, and REED WARBLER</b> were seen there.

<p>
<hr>
<p>

<h2>12/8/96</h2>

The moth invasion continues with lots of <b>SILVER Y's</b> still evident everywhere. In addition, no less than <b>SIX</b> new species for Shetland were discovered last night - a <b>RED UNDERWING</b> at Eswick, a <b>CLOAKED MINOR</b> and <b>BLOOD VEIN</b> at Fladdabister, <b>2 <i>margarita stiticalis</i></b> (no common name for this one) on Unst, a <b>COMMON CARPET</b> at Eswick, and an <b>ANGLE-STRIPED SALLOW</b> at Skaw, Unst. 

<p>

Butterflies are also still numerous with at least 20 <b>PAINTED LADY's</b> at Sumburgh along with lots of <b>LARGE WHITE's</b>, which were also evident around the town.

<p>

On the birdy front, Fetlar continues to be the place to go at the moment with a female-type <b>BLACK-HEADED BUNTING</b> at Upper Toft today, along with a <b>ROSEFINCH, BARRED WARBLER</b> and <b>2 ICTERINE WARBLERS</b>. Elsewhere there were 2 <b>ICTERINE WARBLERS</b> at Sumburgh along with several <b>PIED FLYCATCHERS</b>, a <b>CURLEW SANDPIPER</b> and <B>RUFF</b> on Unst and <b>4 BARRED WARBLERS</b> on Whalsay.

<p>

Last but by no means least, the regular Sumburgh pod of <b>5 KILLER WHALES</b> were showing well again today.

<p>

What a place!!

<p>
<hr>
<p>

<h2>11/8/96</h2>

Fetlar continues to be the migrant hot-spot of the moment with a <b>ROSEFINCH, BARRED WARBLER, ICTERINE WARBLER, 5 WOOD SANDPIPERS</b> and <b>SPOTTED REDSHANK</b> today. Elsewhere there was a <b>BLACK-TAILED GODWIT, 2 WOOD SANDPIPERS</b> and a <b>WOOD WARBLER</b> at Sumburgh along with a scattering of common migrants.

<p>

<b>SILVER Y</b> moths continued to arrive in smaller numbers again today - it is the largest influx by far of this species.

<p>
<hr>
<p>

<h2>10/8/96</h2>

A few autumn migrants were evident today between the rain showers, on Fetlar there was a <b>RED-BACKED SHRIKE, WRYNECK</b> and the <b>ICTERINE WARBLER</b> reported previously is still there.

<p>

The moth invasion has now reduced although there are still a lot of <b>SILVER Y's</b> around.

<p>
<hr>
<p>

<h2>9/8/96</h2>

The Fetlar <b>ICTERINE WARBLER</b> is still around the bushes at the RSPB hide at Funzie.

<p>
<hr>
<p>

<h2>8/8/96</h2>

The <b>SILVER Y</b> moth invasion has slowed down today although there are still large numbers flying around, especially when the sun comes out! Notable moths discovered during last night included a <b>BEDSTRAW HAWKMOTH</b> at Norwick, Unst (10th recent record) and a <b>DOUBLE LOBED</b> at Baltasound (the first for Shetland).
<p>
Several other migrants moths were evident, mostly of obvious Scandinavian origin, but these were mainly micromoths (less than a centimetre in size), including the second record of <b><i>Agriphila tristella</b></i>, the 3rd-5th records of <b><i>Dioryctria abietella</b></i> and the 7th-8th records of <b><i>Yponomeuta yvonymella</b></i>. Unfortunately most of these micro moths do-not have common names!

<p>

On the bird front several waders are beginning to appear in the isles with single <b>RUFF</b> at north Yell and Tingwall, 210 <b>KNOT</b> at the Pool of Virkie, and 200+ <b>GOLDEN PLOVER</b> at Tingwall. 

<p>

An unseasonal <b>HAWFINCH</b> was also at Sandwick.

<p>
<hr>
<p>

<h2>7/8/96</h2>
<a href="silvery.jpg"><img align=right src="silvera.jpg"></a>
The moth invasion continues with the vast majority the <b>SILVER Y</b> <i>Autographa gamma</i> moth. They are usually fairly common migrants to Shetland but not usually in the unprecedented numbers currently being seen. It has been estimated that they were arriving at the staggering figure of around 1,000,000 per hour yesterday (one million!). 
<p>
In addition, more were arriving today! A few scarce species have arrived along with them, most notably a <b>GARDEN TIGER</b> at Fladdabister (the second Shetland record), a <b>GREAT BROCADE</b> at Baltasound (the 7th Shetland record), a <b>BIRD CHERRY ERMINE</b> at Walls (the 5th Shetland record), and a <b>HUMMINGBIRD HAWK-MOTH</b> at Gutcher, Yell (the 13th Shetland record). 
<p>
The isles entomologists are trapping in earnest again tonight as the Silver Y is generally regarded as a strong flying moth and tends to be one of the first species to arrive in an area during a moth invasion, preceeding the invariably much rarer species. This moth influx has not been confined to Shetland, an entomologist on the south coast of England discovered he had at least 3,000 Silver Y moths in his traps last night!

Other interesting news was the hatching of Shetland's first <b>PEACOCK</b> (or peahen) from a clutch of 8 eggs laid by a pair brought to isles by Gilbert Gray at Norwick, Unst. Peacocks are widely kept in captivity, primarily for the stunning display of the males tail feathers as they strut around, they will make an interesting addition to the bird-life of Unst, though how their tail feathers will fare in force 10 remains to be seen!

<h2>6/8/96</h2>

An <b>ICTERINE WARBLER</b> was near the RSPB hide at Funzie, Fetlar today, and a <b>WRYNECK</b> was on Bressay.

<p>

Many of you will have noticed the plethora of migrant <b>MOTHS</b> and <b>BUTTERFLIES</b> around today. Large numbers have apparently been seen on the continent and with the strong southerly winds quite a few of them have made it to Shetland. Several folk have commented on large 'clouds' of moths and several <b>LARGE WHITE, RED ADMIRAL,</b> and a few <b>PAINTED LADY</b> butterflies around the town. Moth trapping sessions are underway even as I write - I'll let you know the reults tommorrow!

<h2>4/8/96</h2>

Four Killer Whales were seen from the m.v. Dunter at Score Point, Bressay at 1230. They comprised a large adult female with a calf and two other medium-sized whales (no large bull present). They were watched for 15 minutes patrolling very close 
inshore - within four feet of the rocks and in water less than 9 feet deep - apparently hunting seals.<BR>
The Large female was seen displaying a skinned seal to the calf as the group swam away quickly towards Voe of Culbinsbrough.
All three adult whales had a notch about half way up the dorsal fin. Apparently the same whales as some seen at the same spot in May (see earlier report).

<p>

<p>

<h2>2/8/96</h2>

A few migrants are returning to Shetland, <b>WILLOW WARBLERS</b> were at Lerwick and Scalloway today.

<p>

The <b>FOX</b> found freshly dead at Olna and reported in todays Shetland Times was a female (vixen) and not a male as stated. Its origins remain uncertain, a summary of this and other Shetland mammals of dubious origin will appear shortly in the Wildlife pages.

<p>

<h2>25/7/96</h2>

A <b>MINKE WHALE</b> was off Sumburgh this morning along with <b>5 PORPOISE</b>.

<p>

Jonathan Will reported the following from the 'Dunter' today between 10.00 and 1245. <b>2 HARBUR PORPOISES</b> at the Holm of Gunnista, Bressay, with 4 more 1m south of Noss Sound, and 2 at Breiwick, Lerwick.
<br>
<b>KITTIWAKE</b> chicks are now fledging at Noss. <b>30+ COMMON</a> and <b>GREY SEALS</b> at the Holm of Beosetter, and 
<b>10 COMMON SEALS</b> at Stoura Clett, East Bressay.

<p>

No sign of yesterdays <b>LAUGHING GULL</b> on Fetlar but the <b>ROSEATE TERN</b> on Fair Isle reappeared at the airstrip again at 17.00.

<p>
<hr>
<p>

<h2>24/7/96</h2>

An American <b>LAUGHING GULL</b> was found by Dave Suddaby at Brough, Fetlar today. It appeared at around 11.00am but was unfortunately not relocated again today. The bird is moulting from first-summer to second-winter plumage and is only the third record for Shetland, the previous two were an adult on Fetlar on the 15th June 1983 and a second-summer plumage bird at Gremista, Lerwick from the 31st August-8th September 1989.

<p>

Another good find, an adult <b>ROSEATE TERN</b> was discovered among the Arctic Tern colony at the airstrip on Fair Isle this evening. Roseate Terns differ from our breeding Arctic Terns <i>(Tirricks)</i> in having a faint warm pinkish hue around the belly/chest area (hence the name) and an obviously longer pair of central tail feathers, making the bird appear much longer and slimmer. It is the sixth record of the species in Shetland, the previous records are listed below.

<ul>
<li>	1974	Whalsay, immature, 24-28th June 
<li>	1978	Jarlshof, adult, 12th May 
<li>	1983	Bressay, adult, 19th May, possibly the same bird at Whalsay, 16th June 
<li>	1984	Burra, adult paired with Arctic Tern and incubating single egg, from 14th June, nest failed

<h2>6/7/96</h2>

News of the day was an immature (probably second-summer) <b>FRANKLIN'S GULL</b> found by Tony Mainwood around the main 
pier on Foula. The species hails from north America and is a rare migrant to Britain. It is superficially similar to a 
Black-headed Gull but slightly smaller with a more obvious black hood (although this individual hasn't got a complete 
hood as its an immature), and black around the wing tips more like that of a Common Gull. This is only the third record 
of this species in Shetland the others were on the 10-11th May 1990 at the Lochs of Hillwell and Spiggie, and on the 27th 
May 1991 at Skellister, Nesting.

Mike Pennington of the <a href="http://www.zetnet.co.uk/sigs/insects/">Shetland Entomological Group</a> has just passed 
on the news of a new moth for Shetland - a <b>FLAME SHOULDER</b> <i>Ochropleura plecta</i>. It was found by Frances 
Ratter on Foula on the 25th June. The species breeds as close as Orkney so it probably wandered up from there.

<h2>25/6/96</h2>

Interesting news of the day was the location by the Seabirds at Sea Team of a <b>'SOFT-PLUMAGED PETREL'</b> 130 km WNW of 
Shetland. The Seabirds at Sea project (funded by the Scottish Natural Heritage, English Nature and other Conservation 
Organisations), systematically records the occurrence of seabirds in the North Sea to build up a picture of their 
distribution at sea, away from breeding colonies. The 'Soft-plumage Petrel' is currently regarded as a generic name relating 
to a group of three different, but superficially very similar species. Only two of these are thought to occur in the 
eastern North Atlantic, and this record is only the 6th of this species group in British and Irish waters.

The <b>BLACK/RED - HEADED BUNTING</b> is still at Skaw, Unst and 3 <b>ROSEFINCHES</b> are still at Baltasound, Unst. Other 
<b>ROSEFINCHES</b> are at Scalloway and the Sumburgh Hotel garden. A third-summer <b>KUMLIEN'S GULL</b> the rare (in Britain) north-east Canadian counterpart of 
our Iceland Gull was briefly at Loch of Tingwall this afternoon before flying off towards Lerwick Harbour. Unfortunately it 
could not be relocated. A 'third - summer' plumage is one almost at adult plumage, but not quite. A <b>HOBBY</b> flew over 
north Unst in the afternoon.

Those of you who remember him may be interested to know that Laughton Johnston, co-author of the New Naturalist Book 'The 
Natural History of Shetland' is back in the isles at the moment researching for an update to the book. It will not be one of 
the New Naturalist series this time but one of the Poyser series. The main theme of this book will be to show how the natural 
history of the isles has changed over the years and he hopes to have the book finished by 1997/98. Co-incidently R.J. Berry, his 
co-author on the original book is also updating the Natural History of Orkney at the same time.

<h2>11/6/96</h2>

The <b>BLACK/RED - HEADED BUNTING</b> is still at Skaw, Unst and a <b>ROSEFINCH</b> is still at Baltasound, Unst. 
A female <b>RED-BACKED SHRIKE</b> is still at Geosetter (south Mainland), and an immature <b>ICELAND GULL</b> was at the 
Shetland Catch factory, Gremista, Lerwick.

<p>

Up to five large Grey Seal bulls are also frequenting the quay of the Shetland Catch Fish Factory, feeding on fish thrown 
to them by factory workers and fishermen, they are 'Lerwicks friendly seals' and come very close to the quay.

<p>

Jonathan Wills recorded a <b>PORPOISE</b> (Neesick) west of Holm of Beosetter, Bresay during his seabird tour around Noss
today. Noss Sound is an excellent place to see this species as they are regular there during the summer.

<h2>10/6/96</h2>
The <b>BLACK/RED - HEADED BUNTING</b> is still at Skaw, Unst and 3 <b>ROSEFINCHES</b> are at Baltasoundand. Also on Unst 
are a <b>RED-BACKED SHRIKE, ICTERINE WARBLER</b>, and <b>GREY-HEADED WAGTAIL.</b> The male <b>KING EIDER</b> is still at 
Tresta and female <b>RED-BACKED SHRIKES</b> are at Geosetter (south Mainland) and Sumburgh. 

<p>

On Fair isle there was a <b>MARSH WARBLER</b> and <b>QUAIL</b>.

<p>
<hr>
<p>

<h2>9/6/96</h2>

Yesterday's <b>BLACK/RED - HEADED BUNTING</b> at Skaw, Unst is probably a Black-headed as it was seen well today, although 
it is still not 100% confirmed. Elsewhere on Unst there was an <b>ICTERINE WARBLER</b> at Veely, and 2 <b>ROSEFINCHES</b> and 
2 <b>LINNETS</b> at Baltasound. The male <b>KING EIDER</b> is still at Tresta and a <b>RED-BACKED SHRIKE</b> is at 
Sumburgh. The <b>GOLDEN ORIOLE</b> is still at Helendale, Lerwick. 

<p>
<hr>
<p>

<h2>8/6/96</h2>

A female <b>BLACK</b> or <b>RED-HEADED BUNTING</b> was at Skaw, Unst today. The two species are very difficult to separate in this 
and juvenile plumages. Most of the plumage features on this bird favour Black-headed Bunting but further careful 
observation is required to confirm this. Apart from this there were 2 <b>ROSEFINCHES</b> at Baltasound, Unst and another 
at Scalloway, and a <b>QUAIL</b> was at Baltasound, Unst.

<p>

A pod of 10 <b>KILLER WHALES</b> are frequenting the Sumburgh Head/Scatness area - chasing seals!

<p>

There are plenty of migrant insects around at the moment - <b>PAINTED LADY</b> butterflies are especially obvious with 
at least 10 on Unst and 4 at Eswick. There are also small numbers of <b>RED ADMIRAL</b> and <b>LARGE WHITE</b> butterflies.  
Large numbers of the migrant <b>DIAMONDBACK MOTH</b>, have been arriving since yesterday afternoon, and there have also 
been plenty of <b>SILVER Y MOTHS</b>, and one or two <b>ANGLE SHADE</b> and <b>DARK SWORD GRASS MOTHS</b> which are also 
migrants. Even some migrant <b>HOVERFLIES</b> have appeared over the last few days.

<p>
<hr>
<p>

<h2>7/6/96</h2>

Little news today, the only birds of note were the <b>GOLDEN ORIOLE</b> still at Helendale, Lerwick, the long-staying male 
<b>KING EIDER</b> at Tresta Voe, amd 2 <b>ROSEFINCHES</b> and 7 <b>RED-NECKED PHALAROPES</b> on Fetlar.

<p>

An <b>OSPREY</b> found exhausted on one of the North Sea Oil Rigs was rehabliltated at the SSPCA Oiled Bird Unit at Tingwall 
and released at Sand Water today. It was ringed and is easily recognisable as it has damaged tail feathers.

<p>

On Fair Isle today there were 2 <b>ROSEFINCHES</b>.

<p>
<hr>
<p>

<h2>6/6/96</h2>

Some very sad and dejected birdwatchers left Shetland this afternoon after failing to see the <b>CASPIAN PLOVER</b> as it has 
now apparently disappeared.<br>
Elsewhere there were 2 <b>RED-BACKED SHRIKES</b> at Kergord, a <b>ROSEFINCH</b> and <b>GREEN SANDPIPER</b> on Fetlar, and the 
<b>GOLEN ORIOLE</b> is still at Helendale, Lerwick, along with a <b>TURTLE DOVE</b>.

<p>

A pod of 9 <b>KILLER WHALES</b> was seen north of Bressay this evening.<br>

The whales, including two large bulls, a calf and several juveniles, appeared among sea angling boats about half a mile 
north of the Score Point at 8.40pm and swam slowly south-east towards Noss before disappearing into the fog off Rules 
Ness at 9.10pm.<br>

For Katy Wills (8) and Vaila Robertson (10), on board the Noss tour boat 'Dunter', it was their first ever sighting of 
Orcas - something special to talk about at school.<br>

Weather permitting, the 'Dunter' will sail from Victoria Pier, Lerwick, at 10am Friday, in hopes of seeing the whales again.

<p>

On Fair Isle the <b>BLYTH'S REED WARBLER</b> is still present along with a <b>ROSEFINCH</b>, and the pod of 7 <b>KILLER WHALES</b> 
seen there yesterday were still present today.

<p>
<hr>
<p>

<h2>5/6/96</h2>

Well, 15 birdwatchers from 'sooth' made the journey to Shetland today, but the <b>CASPIAN PLOVER</b> that they all hoped to 
see could not be relocated and there are some rather unhappy people in the south Mainland. In addition a few more are currently loitering 
at Aberdeen Airport in the hope that it will reappear and they can get here, see the bird and get back quickly!!!!!

<p>

Elsewhere the <b>GREY PHALAROPE</b> was briefly seen again today at Scatness, the <b>GOLDEN ORIOLE</b> is still at Helendale, 
Lerwick, a <b>WRYNECK</b> and <b>RED-BACKED SHRIKE</b> are at Seafield, Lerwick, 2 <b>ROSEFINCHES</b> are on Unst, and the 2 
<b>CRANES</b> are still in the Tingwall area (mainly near the hall), athough they are not there all the time.

<p>

A pod of 5 <b>KILLER WHALES</b> were off Noss today.

<p>

On Fair Isle the <b>BLYTH'S REED WARBLER</b> is still present and a pod of 7 <b>KILLER WHALES</b> were giving good views close 
inshore.

<p>
<hr>
<p>

<h2>4/6/96</h2>

The <b>CASPIAN PLOVER</b> reappeared at Martin Heubecks house at 06.30 this morning and stayed for about 30 minutes before 
flying off south, so far it has not been relocated. Some of yesyerdays 'sooth' birders stayed overnight in Aberdeen and on 
hearing the news got up here as quickly as they could, others who had gone back south are 'rather unhappy!!'. However, it 
remains to be seen whether or not it will be relocated today.
<p>
It reappeared at Martin Heubeck's house at 4pm and was subsequently seen until late evening by all those who wanted to!! If it 
remains in the area it will attract lots of people from 'sooth'.

The only other news was a <b>BLYTH'S REED WARBLER</b> on Fair Isle, yesterdays <b>GREY PHALAROPE</b> was at Scatness 
for about 2 hours this afternoon, and the <b>GOLDEN ORIOLE</b> is still at Helendale, Lerwick.

<p>
<hr>
<p>

<h2>3/6/96</h2>

<b>Bird of the Year (so far)</b> was discovered by Martin Heubeck at Skellberry (Dunrossness) this morning when he noticed a 
female <b>CASPIAN PLOVER</b> in the field outside his kitchen window. This extremely rare vagrant breeds from central Asia 
eastwards to the Caspian Sea, with most wintering in eastern and southern Africa. It is only the 4th record for Britain and 
is likely to draw several birdwatchers from 'sooth' if it remains in the area (which none of the previous individuals have 
done!).<br>
Unfortunately the plover flew off around 11.00am and was not seen again. A few 'sooth' birdwatchers made it to Aberdeen Airport but 
didn't come to Shetland as soon as they heard the news it had gone; and waited most of the day there in frustration!!

<p>

Elsewhere there was a <b>GREY PHALAROPE</b> seen briefly at Dalsetter around mid-day by Howard Towll, and an immature male 
<b>ROSEFINCH</b> and male <b>RED-BACKED SHRIKE</b> at Baltasound, Unst. 

<p>
<hr>
<p>

<h2>2/6/96</h2>

A <b>QUAIL</b> was giving excellent views at Sumburgh Head this morning, as was a 'female-type' <b>GOLDEN ORIOLE</b> at 
Helendale, Lerwick. On Fetlar there were 2 <b>ROSEFINCHES</b>, a <b>GRASSHOPPER WARBLER</b> and a <b>SHORT-TOED LARK</b>, while 
on Unst there were 2 <b>SEDGE WARBLERS</b>, a <b>REED WARBLER</b> and a <b>RED-BACKED SHRIKE</b>. The 2 <b>CRANES</b> which 
have been around the isles over the last few days were at Loch of Tingwall today.<br>
Apart from these there were a few more migrants evident today, especially <b>GARDEN WARBLERS</b> and <b>SPOTTED 
FLYCATCHERS</b>, although as usual the majority were in the south Mainland.

<p>

Migrant insects are now also being noted with 2 <b>LARGE WHITE</b> butterflies and 2 <b>SILVER Y</b> moths, all on Unst.

<p>
<hr>
<p>

<h2>1/6/96</h2>

Two 'female-type' <b>RUDDY DUCKS</b> are on Loch of Asta (adjoining Loch of Tingwall), and single <b>ROSEFINCHES</b> are 
at Virkie and Boddam.<br>
Two of the three pairs of <b>MUTE SWANS</b> nesting at Loch of Tingwall have hatched chicks, with broods of five and six, 
the third pair are still incubating.

<p>
<hr>
<p>

<h2>31/5/96</h2>

The rather strong winds today put paid to finding anything unusual, the only bird of note was a <b>RED-BACKED SHRIKE</b> at 
Geosetter (south Mainland).

<p>
<hr>
<p>

<h2>30/5/96</h2>

Yesterdays <b>CRANES</b> were at Laxfirth this morning, but had gone by early afternoon, apparently heading west. Elsewhere 
a <b>RED-BACKED SHRIKE</b> and <b>REED WARBLER</b> were at Kergord. 

<p>
<hr>
<p>

<h2>29/5/96</h2>

A pair of <b>COMMON CRANES</b> flew north over Lerwick at 10.30a.m. and were later seen on Fetlar. The only 
other birds of note were single <b>RED-BACKED SHRIKES</b> at the Sumburgh Hotel Garden and Geosetter (south Mainland).

<p>
<hr>
<p>

<h2>28/5/96</h2>

Few birds were around today primarily as a result of the poor weather although the <b>CRANE</b> is still at Loch of Brow, the 
<b>TEMMINCK'S STINT</b> at Loch of Hillwell along with 3 <b>GARGANEY</b>, the <b>ARCTIC REDPOLL</b> has been at the 
Sumburgh Hotel Garden and Scatness, an <b>ORTOLAN BUNTING</b> is at Toab and the <b>JAPANESE WAXWING</b> is still at Lerwick.

<p>
<hr>
<p>

<h2>27/5/96</h2>

News of the day was an unidentified <b>SMALL BAT</b> which was reported seen at Baltasound, Unst on Saturday (25th), 
presumably one of the <b>PIPISTRELLE</b> species (see the <a href="http://www.zetnet.co.uk/sigs/bats/bats.html"> archive of 
Shetland Bat records</a> for more information on this species).

<p>

Elsewhere, the <b>JAPANESE WAXWING</b> is still at Lerwick and Saturday's <b>CRANE</b> is now at Loch of Brow (south Mainland), 
a late <b>ARCTIC REDPOLL</b> was at Scatness (south Mainland) this morning, a <b>GOLDEN ORIOLE</b> is at Scalloway, 3 
<b>RED-BACKED SHRIKES</b> are in the Sumburgh Hotel/Virkie area, an <b>ORTOLAN BUNTING</b> is at Quendale (south Mainland), 
a <b>BEAN GOOSE</b> and 7 <b>PINK-FOOTED GEESE</b> are at Spiggie, 2 <b>GARGANEY</b> are at Loch of Hillwell, and yesterday's 
<b>TEMMINCK'S STINT</b> has reappeared, also at Loch of Hillwell.

<p>
<hr>
<p>

<h2>26/5/96</h2>

Even fewer migrants were around today with the only notables a <b>CRANE</b> at Exnaboe (south Mainland near the Meadowvale 
Hotel), a <b>GRASSHOPPER WARBLER</b> at Scalloway, a <b>TEMMINCK'S STINT</b> at Spiggie, a <b>KING EIDER</b> and <b>ICELAND 
GULL</b> at Bixter Voe, an <b>ORTOLAN BUNTING</b> and <b>RED-BACKED SHRIKE</b> on Fetlar, with another <b>RED-BACKED 
SHRIKE</b> at Kergord, and a <b>GOLDEN ORIOLE</b> at Clousta (Bixter).

<p>
<hr>
<p>

<h2>25/5/96</h2>

There were fewer migrants around today, and with the wind moving around to the south-west its a situation likely to continue. 
On a more positive note the <b>JAPANESE WAXWING</b> was still at Lerwick, a single <b>BLUETHROAT, RED-BACKES SHRIKE</b>, 
<b>ORTOLAN BUNTING</b> and <b>SHORT-TOED LARK</b> were at Sumburgh, a <b>WRYNECK</b> is still at Helendale, Lerwick, and 2 
<b>RED-BACKED SHRIKES</b> were on Unst.

<p>
<hr>
<p>

is on Fetlar along with a <b>GRASSHOPPER WARBLER</b> and a <b>GREY-HEADED WAGTAIL</b>. Two <b>RED-NECKED PHALAROPES</b> were 
also giving good views from the RSPB hide at the Mires of Finnie, Fetlar. A <b>WRYNECK</b> is also at Helendale, Lerwick, 3 
<b>ROSEFINCHES</b> are at Norwick, Unst (including a red male), and a <b>KING EIDER</b> is off Gutcher, Yell.

<p>
<hr>
<p>

<h2>23/5/96</h2>

Top news of the day was the identification of a <b>JAPANESE WAXWING</b> in Lerwick that has been coming to feed at a bird 
table for the last few days. As the name implies the species hails from Japan and is unlikely to have reached Shetland 
under its own steam, it has probably escaped from captivity. If anyone has lost one recently, please let me know!

<p>

Elsewhere there was a <b>WRYNECK</b> still at Skaw, Unst today, an <b>ORTOLAN BUNTING</b> at Scatness, a <b>REED WARBLER</b>

<p>
<hr>
<p>

<h2>22/5/96</h2>

<H1>The Dan Lawn case - Alaska's shame
</H1>
<P>

<P>
<P>
17th December l996
<P>
Governments the world over are always pleading poverty. The State of  Alaska is now so hard up that it has to fire its world-renowned  environmental regulator, Dan Lawn. That hard up, really. Or so it  says. This is highly convenient for the oil industry, who once  described Dan Lawn as 'a jerk and a hard-ass'.
<P><A HREF="dan_lawn.jpg"><IMG SRC="dan_lawns.jpg" ALIGN=right WIDTH=198 HEIGHT=284 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=5></A>
Now, why ever would they think that? Well, Dan Lawn was once the  State's environmental watchman at the Valdez Marine Terminal - the  port that ships oil from the southern end of the Trans-Alaska  Pipeline System, run by the Alyeska Pipeline Service Company (50% owned by BP).
<P>
He was the first Alaska State representative to board the tanker  'Exxon Valdez' in the early hours of Good Friday 1989, a short time  after the ship grounded on Bligh Reef, 25 miles outside the port of  Valdez. The rest is history.
<P>
Dan Lawn is an important part of that history. He had warned the  State that a disaster was imminent. They did not listen. He then  exposed the underlying causes of the disaster. That did not please  some very important people. Under pressure from the oil industry, his  bosses in the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation demoted  him on a spurious charge. One of the world experts on oil spill  prevention was relegated to inspecting garbage dumps and septic  tanks. His union fought for and won re-instatement. The state refused  to obey the court decision. 
<P>
It's not just Dan Lawn who's under attack. The Alaska Department of  Environmental Conservation (ADEC) is indeed short of money and, if  the Alaska State Legislature had their way, there wouldn't be an  ADEC. The department's officials are widely respected in Alaska and  far beyond. There is now serious concern that these committed,  professional people can no longer do their jobs properly, because  they don't have the political backing and the cash that comes with it.
<P>
Dan Lawn had been involved with the regulation, or 'oversight', of  the Valdez Marine Terminal almost from its beginning, nearly 20 years  ago. Before he joined ADEC, he had worked on the construction of the  oil terminal. He carried this knowledge and experience with him as he  began oversight work for the State of Alaska. He started to see  problems developing and promises not being kept in the early eighties.  
<P>
He tried to do oversight but received no backing from his  supervisors. There are letters and non-compliance reports on record  and available for review today. Of course, politics being what they  are, people always protect the hand that feeds them. With industry's  ability and skill to influence everyone through well-designed public  relations, people like Dan Lawn do not have a ghost of a chance to do  a job. In spite of this he continued to try to do oversight, without  any support from the department he worked for or the elected  representatives supposed to be in charge of it.  
<P>
The oil industry attacked Dan instead of solving the problems. In the  late eighties, people who worked for Alyeska, and others in the town  of Valdez, would tear down Dan Lawn as an over-zealous inspector,  trying to get attention by bringing forth problems that they said  weren't really problems.  
<P>
<CENTER><B>Don't fix the problem: attack the messenger </B></CENTER>
<P>
The oil industry has a history, in Alaska as in the North Sea, of  attacking the messenger instead of fixing the problem. Dan Lawn is a  perfect example. They made him the villain, and no one came to his  defence for, once again, they didn't want to disturb the hand that fed them.
<P>
When the 'Exxon Valdez' went aground on Bligh Reef, Dan Lawn blamed  himself for not pushing harder. When he tried to push during the  clean-up efforts, the State removed him from his job and downgraded  his position. The petty incident that led to his firing was a set-up.
<P>
Now Dan Lawn is being laid off from even his downgraded position.  Many in the ADEC-Juneau office have been trying to find a way to get  rid of Dan Lawn for a long time. They finally found a way.
<P>
Today there is no ADEC oversight of the Valdez Marine Oil Terminal  from the Valdez ADEC office.  It is all done by a few visits from  personnel from Juneau or Anchorage, who lack expertise of the history  of the terminal. It is ironic that 85% of the State's income comes  from oil, yet there is very little oversight. In fact the State is  depending on industry to regulate themselves. Dan Lawn was a tough  but fair inspector who was let go because he did his job. Today he  inspects garbage dumps and sewer projects. He is about to be removed  even from that and his position is being eliminated because of lack  of funding.  
<P>
It is unbelievable that a State that has over 20 billion dollars in  reserves cannot supply oversight for the basic needs of its people.   Not only is this an oil run state, but the legislature does not  appear to believe in oversight.
<P>
<CENTER><B>Dumping the problem child</B></CENTER>
<P>
Although the shortages in the ADEC budget are real enough, there are  numerous ways to handle those shortages. It looks like ADEC's  political masters have found a way, with this shortage, to dump their  problem child once and for all.
<P>
When Dan Lawn was removed from his previous job in Valdez and given  his present position, it was challenged and brought before an  arbitrator. The arbitrator ruled in favor of Dan, and the State was  told to give him his old job back.  The Alaska Public Employees  Association (APEA) said in a letter to the State: 'The department  (ADEC), by refusing to honor the arbitrators' decision and award in  Dan Lawn's arbitration, and by reorganizing the department in such a  manner has placed Mr. Dan Lawn in a position of not being able to  ''bump'' horizontally or downward, therefore, laying him off, while  there are numerous employees, ''junior'' to Dan Lawn in DEC service.   We both know the history of the department's treatment of Mr. Dan  Lawn since l987.  I believe this is a continued attempt by the  department to constructively discharge Dan Lawn from his state  service with the DEC.'
<P>
To many people, not just in Alaska this appears almost criminal.  Because politics in the State are what they are, the citizens of  Alaska and Dan will be the losers, and some longtime employees in  Juneau, who work for ADEC and have been looking for a way to get rid  of Dan, will be the winners.  
<P>
When Dan Lawn was removed from his position in Valdez, one in which  he was in charge of the office and oversight of the oil terminal, he  also was denied his ability to use his strong personal belief that  oversight was important both for the health of the industry and  necessary for the protection of the citizens.  
<P>
<CENTER><B>Sidelined AND spied upon </B></CENTER>
<P>
He not only suffered from being chastised by the State of Alaska, but  went through a covert investigation by the oil industry, called the  Wackenhut Investigation.  This was an illegal investigation by a  private security company (who also happen to run security at Sumburgh  Airport in Shetland). It was later examined and deplored by a  Congressional committee. Only the oil industry could get away with it  and they basically did. The State wasn't a bit concerned that this  happened to one of its own employees.
<P>
Since then Dan has formed the Alaska Forum for Environmental  Responsibility, to protect workers from being destroyed, (like the  State is destroying him), to urge State and Federal authorities to do  a better job, and also to do oversight of the industry which the  State was not doing.  
<P>
Dan Lawn's story is very similar to that of many concerned Alyeska  workers who have been mentally and financially destroyed by the  industry they were trying to protect.  
<P>
It is easy to understand the industry's bottom line and arrogant  attitude. It is less easy to understand or excuse the State of  Alaska, which is supposed to represent the citizens and protect them.   When citizens become secondary to the wishes of industry, which  appears to have happened in Alaska, then government has taken a step  backwards. It is obvious the democratic process has backfired and now  represents the few and the rich.  
<P>
<CENTER><B>Bottom-line politics </B></CENTER>
<P>
This kind of outrage is happening everywhere, not just in Alaska.  This world is operating on bottom-line politics. Industry directs  politics through big money and constant lobbying. The citizen and  little guy hasn't a chance.
<P>
Abe Lincoln once said that God must have loved the common man,  because he made so many of us. He also went on to say that those with  special talents are so endowed to help their fellow man - doctors,  lawyers, politicians, etc.  It is obvious now, as it was then, that  most with special talents line their own pockets. Big industry cares  little about human factors. Politicians should, but don't. Dan Lawn  does. In spite of this, Alaska's political leadership has done  everything to harm him.  
<P>
Dan Lawn has been a good friend to Shetland. He came here first in  late 1989, to learn from the people of Shetland how to make a better  job of overseeing the oil industry and carry that message back to  Alaska. He met community leaders, discussed the issues and shared  knowledge on spill prevention with our local authority, Shetland  Islands Council. 
<P>
When the tanker 'Braer' grounded and spilled 85,000 tonnes of oil on  Shetland in January 1993, Dan grabbed a bag and headed for the  airport. Again in his own time and as a private citizen, he acted as  an unpaid adviser to our council during the worst days of that crisis.
<P>
Now he needs our support. He's earned it.

<P>
Christmas 1968 was magical for a 10 year old lad. Apollo 8 had been  around the Moon. The newspapers had colour pictures of the blue Earth  with its wispy white clouds rising over the grey, pockmarked Moon. 
<P><IMG SRC="/pics/earthrise.jpg" ALIGN=left WIDTH=197 HEIGHT=485 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=5>
For most people it was when we realised that we all lived on spacecraft  Earth. Just like Apollo 8 on its journey, all we had was what we  carried with us. There was no cosmic grocery store to stop off at to  buy some more oil and a new atmosphere. We either looked after our  environment or our children's children would reap the consequences.  It was about then that the environmental groups started to appear.
<P>
I think of Shetland as some sort of spacecraft, especially when the  weather cuts us off from the rest of the planet. Just like Apollo 8,  we are able to get radio and television messages back and forth but  if we need something from outwith Shetland in an emergency then we  just have to wait until our journey with the weather is over.
<P>
To be honest, this article should not be being written. Back in 1990  the Environmental Act laid down measures that meant the Rova Head  refuse incinerator had to close last weekend. Hindsight will point the finger but in  those five or so years Rova Head's replacement is not sitting ready to  take over. Planning permission still has to be granted and even, if it  is granted this month, a new incinerator is at least two years away.
<P>
This is not so much an 11th hour appeal as an 11:55 call for Shetland  to stop and consider how it wants its waste managed. What do we want  to leave for the future generations that will live on these islands?
<P>
Back in the days of money to burn (pun intended) and less government  support for recycling the Waste to Energy plant with its district  heating system for Lerwick were a good idea; a waste removal scheme  to rank along side the high quality care centres and leisure centres.  But it did not get built and things have changed. The decisions and  reasons of 1990 do not apply anymore.
<P>
Besides money being less available, the government has decided to pay  slightly more than lip service to waste management. Let's be honest  with ourselves: we all create waste and while we pay  the council and water authority to manage it for us we cannot  abdicate the responsibility that we create it in the first place.
<P>
Unlike the Apollo spacecraft, the ones that go to Mars with man on  board will not be able to throw away the waste but will have to mange  and recycle it. This is the position Shetland is in now. In the  recent past we have just thrown away our rubbish and let Rova Head  burn it. Out of sight out of mind. To go down the road of continuing  to do that is to abdicate the difficult decisions of managing our waste. There is such a thing as a waste management hierarchy promoted by  Royal Commissions, the government and the European Union, as well as  environmental groups.
<P>
One of the first things we should be considering is how to reduce our  waste - how not to create it in the first place. Everything we burn   at Rova Head or dump in the ground we buy into Shetland. We pay  freight on all the packaging that comes in.
<P>
We can't stop imports into Shetland so let's reuse as much of the  waste as possible. In the old days bottles used to be refilled. If it is here and we cannot re-use it then let's recycle it into its  original components. Did you know that there is an American company  that produces a material which is used in outdoor clothing which is  made from plastic bottles? 
<P>
Shetland is not so big that community  composting wouldn't work well and there is plenty of land which would benefit. If you cannot do any of the above then this is the time to burn it  and reclaim the energy. But with less waste we do not need such a  large incinerator.
<P>
As you see, the waste management hierarchy in Shetland is upside  down: Let's burn it, let's bring in Orkney's rubbish to burn (are we buying  the rubbish from them or are they paying us to take their rubbish);  let's burn rubbish for the oil companies.
<P>
This last  point is a bit of a touchy one that we in Shetland should  decide with our eyes wide open. Do we wish to become to oil company  waste what Dounreay is to nuclear waste?
<P>
The incinerator as proposed will stifle any true recycling or waste  management in Shetland and it is certainly not a high volume employer  in itself.
<P>
The government has decided that by the year 2000 25% of waste will be  recycled and that 40% of homes with a garden will be involved in  composting. It has also decided that a tax will be put on landfill -   two pounds per tonne for inert waste to seven pounds per tonne for  other waste. This is  to encourage recycling. Incineration reduces the volume you need to  landfill. But this tax wasn't to promote incineration.
<P>
The burning of waste produces waste. That waste still needs to be  dumped and will still incur a landfill tax. Some of that waste is  very toxic and has to be dumped in special landfill. The problem is  that special landfill is not going to remain impregnable. Some  experts say that within 25 years toxins are likely to leak out. So  the more waste we burn the more of this poison we have. So it makes  sense for Shetland's future environmental wellbeing to follow the  waste hierarchy and burn as little as possible, as well as landfill as  little as possible.
<P>
There is a saying from one side of the Pennines or other that  'Where's muck there's brass' and so it is with the oil company waste. Duty  of care is what it is all about. If something is landfilled and later  proves to be a nasty substance that shouldn't be in that landfill  then the duty of care to sort the problem out still lies with the  original owner of the rubbish. 
<P>
On the other hand, if you put the  rubbish through an incinerator the duty of care transfers to owners  of the incinerator. So, yes, there are jobs and money for Shetland in  servicing oil vessels and putting their waste through an incinerator.
<P>
The environmental effects of this though will be here long after the  oil companies have gone and we can see how fickle oil companies are.  Oil companies guarantee nothing in the long term. I assume Shetland  is a long term proposition! The decisions on waste management are not  easy and personally I have difficulty in deciding what  is best. I have a job and would prefer an environmentally sustainable  Shetland. On the other hand I know what it is to not have a job and  realise that if the economy of Shetland is not kept buoyant then the  quality of life for all of us will drop.
<P>
But if I have to fall on one side of the fence or the other then I  think it is against the incinerator as the central plank of our waste  management. Things have changed. Recycling is labour intensive and  markets are opening up for recycled products. Recycling is a long  term option. The government is trying to persuade councils to pay  recycling credits to companies that keep waste from the incinerator  and landfill. Does our SIC have a policy on this yet?. It appears not  but then only 20% of local authorities in the UK have taken up this  pro-recycling option.
<P>
There is money to be made and saved by those with an entrepreneurial  bent. Certain types of paper can fetch up to  80 per tonne, so why  burn it or landfill it?
<P>
My conclusion is that Shetland needs to  plan a sustainable future, not a short term one. We have a small  window of opportunity to decide to do that.
<P>
There is another thing about Apollo 8 that I don't want to see  happening to Shetland. The capsule had splashed down and the US Navy  diver opened the door - and nearly fell off the capsule. The powerful  stench of three men and a week's waste in a small space was a bit  much. Needless to say, the astronauts couldn't smell a thing.
<P>
And why haven't I mentioned the district heating of Lerwick? Well at   400 pounds per metre to install over 11.5 kilometres it was just another  expensive pipe dream. Good for its time. But then that time has gone.
<P>

We have lived for so long - over two years - with the Government's  proposal to put out to commercial tender the Aberdeen/Orkney/Shetland  shipping services, currently run by <A HREF="http://www.shetland-news.co.uk/websites/pno/">P&O Scottish Ferries</A>, that the  innate absurdity of the idea has become unremarkable. 
<P>
The original list of 19 firms interested in tendering for the  Government-subsidised ferry routes has been whittled down to just  three - P&O, Sea Containers and a putative consortium of Orcargo Ltd  and the publicly-owned Orkney Ferries Ltd, which only appears  interested in running services across the Pentland Firth to Orkney.
<P>
We have no feelings for or against Sea Containers as a company but it  must be evident to the most casual observer that they cannot possibly  have the experience, detailed local knowledge, specialist ships and  friendly, local crews to run our lifeline ferry service.
<P>
It is a very good idea to ensure that the service is run as  efficiently and economically as possible. That is a reasonable and  necessary condition of public subsidy for an operation which can  never be profitable in a purely commercial sense but which is  essential for the profitability of many other enterprises, both in  the islands and on the mainland of Scotland. We hate to sound  unfashionably 'socialist', but that's the way things are.
<P>
The question is whether the Scottish Office has gone about it in the  right way. The indications are that a slavish devotion to the  ideology of the 'free' market has prevented ministers taking a more  sensible and practical approach to the problem of getting value for  the public pound.
<P>
Meanwhile, P&O Ferries are preparing their 1997 brochures for next  year's tourist season, not knowing whether they will still be in the  trade after the Scottish Office finally makes up its mind in February.
<P>
More importantly, they cannot start detailed planning of the three  new ships which must be found if the services to the Northern Isles  are to meet new safety rules which come into effect in the year 2001.
<P>
That is just four years away. This time around, buying an old boat  from somewhere else is not an option, as it was when P&O bought their  existing 'North Boats'. The St Clair, St Sunniva and St Ola are  refurbished 'remoulds' built in the 1970s. Such vessels cannot meet  the new safety standards, however much you spend on them, even if  second-hand ships of the right size were available on the world  market, which they are probably not.
<P>
It will cost around 40 million pounds to build one new ship for the  Aberdeen-Lerwick run alone. To replace all three pasenger/cargo boats  could well cost more than 100 million pounds. This is the single  biggest investment decision for the economy of the Northern Isles in  the next few years. The Government, by its ludicrous insistence on a  time-consuming and ultimately futile tendering exercise, has  knowingly delayed the planning process, which should already have  started if the new boats are to be sailing after 2001.
<P>
It is clear that no commercial firm could possibly consider such a  huge investment, even assuming that a new roll-on/roll-off ferry  built to the new standards would last some 30 to 40 years. The  traffic simply does not warrant it, even if Shetland enters a second  oil boom, as appears increasingly likely. It will have to be mainly a  public investment, just as trunk roads are a public investment. 
<P>
The pressure from Edinburgh (whether or not we are granted a sham of  Home Rule for Scotland) will be for Shetland and Orkney to invest  some of their oil revenues in the project. 
<P>
That pressure should be resisted, for two reasons: essential public  transport networks are and should be a central government  responsibility; and many other communities, not least Aberdeen and  Scrabster, receive substantial economic benefits from the Northern  Isles ferry services. 
<P>
If Shetland Islands Council is to be asked for an investment, so  should councils in Aberdeen, Caithness and, indeed, every part of the  country which trades with the islands. There is no point in asking  Orkney Islands Council for their oil money. They poured much of it  into the Pentland Firth some years ago in a madcap scheme to promote  a 'short-sea crossing' from South Ronaldsay to John o'Groats, as if  the existing 2.5 hour crossing from Scrabster to Stromness were a  problem! Some of the Orkney councillors who voted for that folly are  still, unaccountably, in office.
<P>
There is a deafening silence from the Labour Party on who should pay  for the new boats. As our supposed government-in-waiting, they should  tell us now, and certainly before the General Election, exactly how  they propose to finance the service.
<P>
If we are not very careful (and vocal), we will end up with only two  new 'North Boats', both operating out of Scrabster and one running a  Shetland shuttle service at highly inconvenient and irregular times.  The damage to our export industries, including tourism, will be severe.
<P>
Our air service is already being wrecked by the dictates of the  private market. It is time for a public campaign, led by our MP and  councillors, to stop the shipping lifeline foundering on the same rocks.
<P>
Meanwhile, we look forward to the Prime Minister's no-doubt-imminent  launch of a 'Missiles In Need' appeal, to solicit private charity for  a wholly unnecessary state industry - the Trident nuclear missile  submarine programme.

<H1> Dounreay's latest radioactive leak <BR>is no surprise

 2nd October 1996
<P>
 The radioactive leak from the Dounreay D1206 nuclear reprocessing   plant in Caithness at the weekend, and the subsequent indefinite   shutdown of the installation, is the latest in a catalogue of   accidents and leaks at the site.   
<P>
 Of particular concern is not so much this latest leak - although when   the full details are known it potentially could be serious and  seven gigabecquerals of lethal alpha activity released into the  environment is bad news, however big Dounreay's discharge  authorisations are - but the   state of this plant, which is now about 40 years old with one major   refurbishment.  
<P>
 Environmentalists have long expressed concern that the plant is not   capable of handling the work it is now doing. This is the   reprocessing of over 30 tonnes of core fuel from the now   closed prototype fast reactor (PFR), plus some fuel from the even   older DFR reactor. The plant owners, the UK Department of Trade and   Industry (DTi), are reprocessing this fuel as fast as possible, to   earn money to offset other decommissioning and contamination  clean-up costs.  
<P>
 The DTi have specifically said they want the work done as quickly as   possible, within safety limits etc, etc.  This means the plant is   undertaking the highest workload in its history - 30 tonnes of  spent fuel in five years compared with 30 tonnes over the past three  decades - and it is this which is worrying.       In addition, the reprocessing plant is now managed by a private firm,   W. S Atkins - the folk who managed the building of the Channel Tunnel   - who are also in overall, day-to-day management of the whole site.
<P>
 The cooling system should be completely separate from the 'active'   system in the plant. This could well involve a lengthy shutdown for   the plant, so 'costing' the DTi money. The DTi are known to be    co0ncerned about the maintenance and integrity of the plant and have   told Dounreay not to plan for any more work for the plant when the   PFR and DFR work finishes around 1998/99.  
<P>
 Dounreay wants to fit commercial work in between PFR/DFR work and,   after that work is finished, but DTi has said 'no', they'll have to  wait until they see how things are going because they are concerned  the plant may be too old and suffer a major (expensive) accident.

20th September 1996
<p>



<i>(A version of this article also appeared in The Herald newspaper, published in Glasgow)
<P>
'A poser for Paul Merton: which is the odd one out - Margaret Thatcher, Ted Heath, Salman Rushdie or Tony Blair?'
<P>
'...Yes, Paul, we can see Salman Rushdie's the one with a beard, but that's the wrong answer, unfortunately.'</i>
<P>
Tony Blair is the only one who hasn't visited Shetland yet. Maggie bulldozed her way north just before she became PM in 1979 (she wanted to see where the money came from), Sailor Ted came up in the idle eighties for a chat at the boating club bar, and Salman spent a few days hillwalking here, with a false beard and four minders, during the worst of the Fatwah scare. 
<P>
There is a rumour that even Dr James Gordon Brown MP was once sent to Lerwick by STV, during his previous incarnation as a film director, although there is some doubt about whether he knew where he was. 
<P>
Gordon's chum Tony really should go on a fact-finding mission, and soon, to Scotland's most successful colony. 
<P>
In these islands on the same latitude as Cape Farewell, he'd discover that the stakeholder society he goes on about isn't just a jolly good vision thing dreamed up by Will Hutton, that nice, wise man The Establishment cruelly silenced, by lumbering him with a loopy TV director for his well-meaning but technically unwatchable documentary, 'The State We're In', from the impeccable book of the same name.
<P>
Will Hutton hasn't been here yet either (the air fare from London costs more than a flight to the States for a 20 second film clip) but, if he had, he'd know that Shetland's stakeholder society actually works fine. It has done so for the past 20 years, while everyone else was being mugged by mindless monetarists and no-one north of Gray's Inn Road had heard of Wir Will.
<P>
Tony and Will would find a happy landing after their flight from Aberdeen: unemployment is consistently between 2.5 and 4 per cent; poverty and want rare; social workers are paid to seek out old folk and help them claim their benefits, including an annual Christmas cash bonus from the council; and almost every frail, elderly person has access to sheltered housing, respite care centres and home helps.
<P>
There's more: all children have places in comprehensive state schools which are so good that the idea of private education is laughable; rural primary schools are still open, well-funded and thriving; most pre-school children have access to a playgroup; the health service spends 1,000 pounds a year on every man, woman and bairn; fast, frequent and cheap ferries link the remotest islands at the public expense; the number of Range Rover Discoveries increases in proportion to the mileage of superb roads which, paradoxically, make off-road driving unnecessary (the middle classes will like that one, Tone).
<P>
Sport and the arts are generously subsidised; islands with only a thousand people enjoy leisure centres and heated swimming pools which would make the citizens of Sedgefield puce with envy; community councils receive 11 times the average Scottish funding; voluntary organisations are lavishly supported by mainland standards - at the last count there were over 700 of them for just 23,000 people, including over a dozen religious denominations in a society where sectarianism is unknown; best of all, there's an impressive programme of long-term public investment in local industry.
<P>
Oh, and the council has assets of over 200 million quid, not counting the staff pension fund. It's debt-free (apart from 60 million owed to City loan sharks for building homes for oil workers), and boasts one of the lowest council taxes in the country. Needless to say, the punters never stop moaning about 'da cooncil', particularly since monetarism and 'cuts' have made a belated appearance in the far north.
<P>
In short, every islander has a stake in Shetland, and senses it from before they start school. It isn't a perfect society but it's better than most. Such a pity about the weather, though.
<P>
<i>'Golly, it's windy, Will! Are you sure we didn't catch the flight to Bergen by mistake?'
<P>
'Could be, Tone. The natives certainly speak funny.'
<P>
'It sounds a bit like Norwegian. Ask that taxi driver if he understands English.'</i>
<P>
The parallels with Norway are philosophical as well as linguistic. For, while the rest of Britain watched impotently as the welfare state and public services withered in the lean, mean 80s and 90s, Shetland quietly went about building a small but perfectly formed Scandinavian social democracy. The now disunited Kingdom could have done the same but the Tories preferred to spend their much larger share of the oil revenues on social demolition.
<P>
Shetland's healthy economy and society are not solely the results of the oil money and certainly not because the 26 councillors are a bunch of lefties. The achievements in education, for example, where Shetland knocks spots off mainland toff schools in the exam league tables, have come about because of dogged insistence on the high standards of staffing and funding which, in theory, the state system lays down but no-one seriously expects any more.
<P>
Only a handful of Labour councillors have been elected in Shetland since the oil boom began in the early 70s. Most members of Shetland Islands Council sit as independents. There are a couple of Libdems, a few lapsed, closet Tories and several Shetland Movement Party members who think more home rule would be nice but aren't going to the barricades about it. 
<P>
They all think Tony's Scottish devolution will be a fine thing, if only they can work out a way to stop the Central Belters being even more metropolitan chauvinist than Whitehall.
<P>
This disparate, shifting and sometime bizarre coalition, for all its legendary bureaucracy, personal animosities and procedural bickering, has held together for 25 years during which life for almost everyone in the islands was getting better all the time. 
<P>
There is an underlying ideology, of course, and it is very simple: the greatest good for the greatest number. It is communitarian rather than socialist and embodies a tradition of social solidarity dating back to the late 19th century, when Gladstone's crofting legislation libbed the great lairds and liberated the present generation's ancestors from something very like serfdom. In Shetland they still do not like you getting above yourself. Flaunting personal wealth is bad form. 
<P>
Similar traditions of togetherness and community spirit still thrive in Scandinavia, Alaska and northern Canada. They survive, without Shetland's access to funds, in many parts of Scotland.
<P>
Tony Blair's task is to revive this ancient, civilised instinct with his not terribly new ideas on the 'social' market. He is supposed to be enthusing us with the attractive and fairly obvious idea that governments exist (were, indeed, invented) for the purpose of controlling the excesses of the unregulated market, for the benefit of all.
<P>
The view from Shetland, or at least my view from Shetland, is that he and my former untidy flatmate Gordon Broon are making a hash of it. They may win the election but they are not winning the hearts and minds. Their utterances are dull, mechanical, timid and repetitive - particularly sad in the case of young Broon, once one of Scotland's wittiest men.
<P>
The Labour leader is a frightened man, when he ought to be a bold and inspiring one. Like the reviled Stalinist barons of prehistoric Strathclyde Region, he appears not to trust himself to persuade the punters. Instead of debate, we are given public relations.
<P>
Maybe he doesn't trust them to be persuaded and thinks it safer to pander to their imagined prejudices. But are the voters really so thick that they can't and won't understand reasoned political argument, attractively presented? I doubt it. 
<P>
Take the leader-writers' big issue, income tax, for example: even the dimmest of wits can understand that PAYE and Schedule D are not just some mindless impost visited by vengeful authority on the hapless worker by hand and brain, even though it may feel like that sometimes. 
<P>
Much of our inland revenues are actually spent on useful things which benefit us all, like education, social security, roads and, once upon a time, railways. It isn't all money down the drain, rather an investment in all our futures - and a way of redistributing wealth. Oh my God, what have I said? Redistribute wealth! Perish the thought!
<P>
Just as important as the level of our income tax (which is actually rather low by Scandinavian standards) is whether we get value for money. That seems a legitimate subject for political debate but it takes second place to endless media speculation about possible tax levels to be set in Gordon's broon study at the Treasury.
<P>
If this debate did take place, I'd hazard a guess that some ideas labelled 'extremist', 'leftist' and even 'revolutionary' over the past two decades would prove to have a surprising amount of popular support, when folk saw how much money could be diverted to better ends.
<P>
We obviously don't get value for money from Trident, because it's useless as a defensive and unthinkable as an offensive weapon. It soaks up cash which could and should be used to create a sensible, cheaper defence system for an archipelago lying off the coast of Europe. This would include an effective navy, first-rate air defences (minus the Euro-fighter), better surveillance of terrorist suspects, and a properly funded and trained TA, to make the country untenable by an invader. What do we hear from Tony on these interesting and expensive topics? Not a dicky bird.
<P>
Nor is the cost of a military force in Northern Ireland value for money. The prods and provos obviously hate each others' guts and will continue to do so until sectarian education is eradicated. So the sensible answer could well be partition, with a United Nations force to separate the murderous swine on both sides and help the peaceable majority in the middle get on with business as normal. But anyone who suggests such a sensible and potentially popular solution is ridiculed and disowned as a loony Bennite.
<P>
Harriet Harman and her Great Leader and Teacher might not agree with me, but I suspect there's a lot of political mileage in serious education reform. Not just in cutting off state subsidies to private schools and using the cash to make the state system the best in Britain, but also in telling parents there's no way the state can continue paying for sectarian (sorry, single-denomination) education.
<P>
I rather fancy rather a lot of voters would agree that Britain (and especially the north of Ireland and the west of Scotland) would be a less intolerant, fairer society if taxes for education went only to secular, state schools. If people are daft enough to pay more for the privileges from so-called 'public' schools, or for Protestant, Catholic or Moslem education, that's up to them. 
<P>
If asked (and I won't be) I'd say any private school hiring a young teacher should repay the Treasury the cost of their teacher training, but that's probably an 'extremist' line and I may have to wait a decade or two to hear it discussed at the hustings (let alone hear a Labour leader proposing the abolition of the Monarchy).
<P>
Even within the present miserly education budget, we'd see some changes if we spent the money in a different way, let alone shifted some loot from subsidies for absentee lairds to graze too many sheep on Scotland's overgrazed hills, and even more subsidies for them to plant trees. But on education, to say nothing of rural policy, I'm becoming an embarrassment to the remains of the party I've supported through thick and (mostly) thin these 30 years past, so let's change the subject before I decide to give the Scottish National Party my little pencilled cross at last.
<P>
What about health? Well, yes, indeed. What the public really wants is more people on the dole - the thousands of functionally  illiterate, overpaid, underworked bureaucrats who've infiltrated the National Health Service since 1979 and now clog it up with their highly inappropriate market ideology. Let them sweep, or beg in, the streets, says I. They even refer to the NHS as 'the healthcare industry'. The NHS isn't an industry. It's a service. Nurses, doctors and patients are sick to death (sometimes literally) of what's going on. Oh dear, I'm being embarrassing again...
<P>
Housing? Dare we ask our Labour candidates about the popular idea of giving councils money and power to start building again, or to subsidise young folk to build their own homes? Probably not. It would use income tax sensibly, provide jobs, bring in more income tax and help the economy. Instead, the market will provide. Will it, hell! (Will it , Hutton)
<P>
As for Europe, I still hope to hear Tony Blair explaining that talk of 'restoring national sovereignty' is a charade. For more than 20 years true sovereignty has been exercised globally by financial markets run as casinos. There can be no accommodation with the sharks who operate solely for their own, short-term benefit at other people's expense. The only hope of bringing the collapsing world banking and financial system under democratic control is through organisations like the European Union, acting in concert with other major power blocs. Those who argue otherwise are sad, mistaken and, arguably, unpatriotic.
<P>
Alas, Tony is not about to get into water this deep. He surfs on to victory, on a wafer-thin manifesto with no tax commitments, no hostages to fortune, no consultation and negative intellectual equity.
<P>
Rather than bravely arguing the case for reform, he goes around reassuring the better off that they will be even better off under Labour, and shamelessly courting the Stock Market gamblers who helped Thatcher to privatise and ruin Britain.
<P>
This sticks in the craw of the small but imperfectly formed Shetland Labour Party. Like the rank and file everywhere, they will canvass with heavy hearts and a certain amount of embarrassment, albeit for an excellent candidate, a local man who knows the Labour machine inside out - he used to work for This Great Party Of Ours in Strasbourg - and is no mean country singer forebye.
<P>
We want a crusade, with country music if possible. We have a public relations campaign with jingles. That is why Labour, nationally, may only just scrape home in constituencies where the Libdems, Gladstone's heirs, can pose as the real radicals.
<P>
In Shetland and Orkney (that's the other archipelago, where all the Tories used to be until the BSE crisis ruined the beef farmers) Labour's aim will be to take second place to the amiable, careful Jim Wallace, and to stuff into third or preferably fourth place Mr Hope Vere Anderson (chief of the Clan Anderson, indeed!) - the hapless parachutist whom Conservative Central Office has just dropped on the constituency.
<P>
Shetland has already made one sacrifice which should help Chancellor Broon to balance the books of a minority administration. The council has given the oil industry a deal worth at least 50 millions over the next 25 years, by agreeing a deal to cut operating costs at the Sullom Voe oil terminal. There will be no more royalties for Shetland's public coffers. The nest-egg we have already will have to see us through my dotage and beyond.
<P>
Young Broon's nest egg will be correspondingly a little larger, assuming he doesn't intend yet another giveaway for the oil companies, now busily developing the vast new oil and gas fields in the Atlantic, west of Shetland.
<P>
Our sacrifice will have been worth it if he spends the money on social reconstruction nationwide, rather than the lengthening dole queues which may be expected if Labour's milk-and-water prospectus is voted through on the payroll vote of identikit MPs in suits.
<P>
Why do they all wear ties, by the way? From this distance, they look as if they are for tethering the tribunes of the people in their stalls.

<H1>MP asks Government to <BR>suspend ferry franchising </H1>

<P>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=+1>This is the full text of Jim Wallace MP's letter and detailed  comments to Lord James Douglas-Hamilton MP, Minister of State at the  Scottish Office</FONT></I>
<P>
 Dear James,
<P>
May I take this opportunity to acknowledge the letter which I received  from Mr. W.R.J. McQueen, Head of Transport and Local Roads Division of  the Scottish Office Development Department, inviting me to comment on the  draft service specification for ferry passenger services to Orkney &  Shetland. As well as replying directly to Mr. McQueen, I thought I should  send you a copy of my response, as well as some additional comments and  observations.
<P>
Firstly, in replying in what I hope is a constructive manner, I am in no  way conceding that the Government has done the right thing in abandoning  the general freight subsidy. I have rehearsed the arguments with you, the  Secretary of State and officials often enough without repeating them  here. Suffice to say, for the present, that I believe the freight service  is as much a lifeline service as the passenger service, and both should  be treated as such. And accordingly, insufficient consideration has been  given to the possibility of  an extension of the franchising mechanism,  for example to include the service between Kirkwall and Invergordon. 
<P>
Nor is there anything in the specification which addresses, in a  meaningful way, the case for new replacement vessels. There is a  reference to how bidders would propose to fill the gap until newly built  ships are commissioned for service, but that only seems to make new  vessels less likely. Given that this whole review was sparked off by P &  O s concerns over the cost of replacement vessels, it is astonishing that  the government has been so vague on this issue. Indeed, when I, together  with council representatives from Orkney and Shetland,  met Michael  Forsyth in September last year, he indicated that whilst replacement  vessels couldn't necessarily be stipulated in a contract, bidders could  be asked to indicate what thought was being given to replacement vessels  if they were to win a further tender period. 
<P>
Obviously, if the winning bid involves new ships, that question may be  more readily answered. However, with the current and projected profile of  the shipping market, I don t think it is unreasonable to think ahead. I  must stress that my constituents have accepted refurbished second hand  vessels for years. Many of them have performed well, but it has not  escaped our notice how often the Hebrides are served with new purpose  built ships. It is disappointing, therefore, that so little attention  appears to have been given to this issue.
<P>
These are important issues, and ones which I shall continue to press.  Obviously I want to see the return of a government, after the forthcoming  election, which will be sympathetic to these matters. Whatever one s  political standpoint, the possibility remains that the outcome of the  election could have an effect on policy in this area. (In addition to  addressing the foregoing points, a different government might wish to  permit CalMac to participate in the tendering process). I am therefore  asking you to consider whether or not it would be fairer to suspend the  tendering process to allow potential bidders an opportunity to take into  account any possible change in government and government policy which  might arise. 
<P>
There are further points which I wish to raise in connection with the  introduction of the passenger service franchise. 
<P>
Because the figure of  7.6 million has been negotiated with P & O as a  provisional subsidy for 1996/97, there has been an assumption that the  arrangement will terminate on 31st. March. Indeed I note in the draft  service specification, there is a reference to the existing arrangement  expiring in April 1997. However, even on your provisional timetable, the  new contract is not expected to be awarded until the end of April. 
<P>
Can you confirm when exactly the present agreement expires, and whether  arrangements have been made (and if so, on what terms) to extend the  existing  arrangement beyond the expiry date? This has particular  relevance if a company other than P & O wins the contract. Surely you  cannot be suggesting that they could be awarded the contract on 30th.  April and be expected to start sailings on 1st. May. Where will that  leave passenger bookings? Clarification of the position in what might be  described as the transitional period is required at an early date.
<P>
The government has also promised a consultation paper on bulk freight.  When will this be available? Given that its contents may also have some  bearing on the calculations of potential tenderers, does this not add a  further ground for deferring the final stages of the tendering process?
<P>
I look forward to hearing from you

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Draft Service Specification <BR>for Passenger Ferry services to the Northern  Isles</B>
<BR>Response from Jim Wallace MP</FONT></CENTER>
<P>
I am grateful for the opportunity to respond to this draft specification.  In my covering letter to the Minister of State, Lord James Douglas -  Hamilton MP, I have expressed a number of reservations about the  government s overall policy, and have suggested that consideration should  be given to suspending the tendering process pending the outcome of the  general election and better particulars being made available regarding  the consultation process on the carriage of bulk freight.
<P>
<CENTER><B>General</B></CENTER>
<P>
In common with some others who have responded, I am concerned that there  is a bias towards the present operator. This is not intended as a  criticism of  P & O Scottish Ferries, but an important observation on  what is meant to be an open tendering process.
<P>
In <B>paragraph 6</B> the Scottish Office makes it the responsibility of  prospective operators to forecast likely future traffic volumes and  revenue for all traffic. The information on current up to date figures  can only be available to the existing operator, thereby giving them a  distinct advantage.
<P>
In <B>paragraph 18</B> reference is made both to the size of vessels employed by  the current operators and  the speeds obtained by the current operator of  the service . This information is self evidently known to the current  operators, but it is surely invidious for other tenderers to have to  approach a competitor bidder for detailed information.
<P>
In <B>paragraph 24</B>, a prospective operator who wishes to use newly built  ships is expected to fill the gap. If, all other things being equal, such  a bid is the most attractive option, the Government should make provision  for the interim period to be filled. In this way there can be no  discrimination against an operator wishing to use new build, as opposed  to the existing operator who, otherwise would presumably enjoy the  advantage of continuity of service. 
<P>
These are important points which must be addressed if the tendering  process is to enjoy public confidence. Consultees should be advised of  steps taken to create even-handedness among bidders before final service  specifications are issued.
<P>
<B>Paragraph 2</B> Is it intended to exclude unaccompanied cars from the ambit of the  subsidy?
<P>
<B>Paragraph 5</B> As already indicated, the timetable should allow for some consideration  by potential operators of the content of the consultation document on  bulk freight, including definitions of what may be covered under these  specific arrangements.
<P>
<B>Paragraph 7</B> - Frequency of Service As efforts are being made to extend the tourist season in Orkney, three  daily sailings should apply from April/May to October. During the winter  months, it may not be necessary for two daily sailings on a Sunday.
<P>
In the case of Shetland, the requirements of the salmon and fishing  industries almost certainly require 6 daily sailings around the calendar.  Ideally these should be night sailings to allow for the day's produce of  white fish and salmon to be transported as fresh as possible, as well as  for passenger convenience.
<P>
If  consideration is being given to an Orkney only bid, the absence of  any provision of an Aberdeen/Stromness/Lerwick service should not  disqualify it.
<P>
<B>Paragraph 9</B> - Orkney/Shetland only service I welcome the fact that consideration is being given to proposals which  may be directed towards serving the specific needs of each island group.  However, tenderers wishing to serve Orkney or Shetland only should not be  required to identify savings resulting from operating an integrated  network, when such a proposal would not be part of their bid.
<P>
<B>Paragraphs 10 - 12</B>: Carriage of Livestock I welcome the requirement that potential operators must make provision  for ensuring sufficient capacity during the main livestock shipment  period, and that the operator will be responsible for ensuring a  satisfactory standard of service.
<P>
Passengers travelling between Stromness and Scrabster have had to put up  with a decreasing amount of livestock on board, which has been to their  comfort and advantage. It would be a retrograde step if the new  arrangements did not ensure continuation of this trend.
<P>
<B>Paragraph 13</B> - Hazardous cargoes There is little indication of the frequency or volume of such cargoes.  This should be made available to those tendering. Is it necessary for  hazardous freight to be carried with passengers or can some goods be  carried on non - passenger schedules?
<P>
<B>Paragraphs 14 - 18</B>:Vessel specification Operators should be asked to state the age of the vessel. Option 1 in paragraph 16 envisages a one or two ship configuration for  the Lerwick/Aberdeen service. Paragraph 14 -rightly in my view -suggests  that there would be difficulties in maintaining a one boat service to  Shetland. I support a two boat option. Overall option 2 has attractions  provided that there was adequate guarantee of meeting required freight  capacity for farmed salmon and fish at the height of the tourist season.
<P>
Whilst the specification refers to a percentage of  passenger berths,  nothing is said about the berths. The standard of berth accommodation  should be specified, with adequate provision of  quality accommodation to  attract tourists and to provide tolerable conditions in rough winter  crossings. A significant and specified percentage should have en suite  toilets and showers. There should also be a requirement for a proportion  of double berths and four berth cabins for families.
<P>
There should also be a certain proportion of berths equipped for disabled  people.
<P>
There should be provision of reclining seats for those not taking berths.
<P>
<B>Paragraph 19</B> - Business plans In terms of passenger pricing, it should be made clear whether journeys  originating in the Northern Isles will have lower rates for cars and  passengers than northbound journeys. Specific reference should also be  made to the availability or otherwise for reduced fares for children, and  concessionary fares for pensioners, students and other categories of  travellers.
<P>
In fixing maximum rates for all categories of traffic, the government  must have regard to the actual prevailing rates, rather than advertised  rates. It would be advantageous if the government could establish   maximum rates at the outset, so that all potential bidders have notice of  these. It is acceptable to increase these rates in line with the retail  price index.
<P>
The government should reserve to itself the power to fix minimum rates if  examples of predatory pricing are established.
<P>
The quality of the service should also include the operator s on-shore  operation, including local booking facilities, lairage, storage etc.
<P>
The Consultation process should include a reasonable cross section of the  islands  population as well as the local authority. Consultative meetings  should take place at least twice per annum, and may be convened ad hoc by  either the operator or the islands council.
<P>
The quality targets set are too low. After making allowances for weather,  the  failure  rate proposed in the specification, both in terms of  cancelled sailings and delays would permit a poorer service than at  present on the Stromness/Scrabster run.
<P>
The target for both operation and punctuality should be at least 98%  (excluding delays etc. attributable to severe weather).
<P>
Complaints should be acknowledged within three working days and responded  to within three weeks.
<P>
As this is a franchised service, the Scottish Office should also set out  its proposals for monitoring the franchise operation and for dealing with  complaints from service users or community representatives.
<P>
<B>Paragraph 20</B> - Contingency costs On balance, I should favour a further agreement between the parties to  take account of additional marine safety requirements during the contract  period.
<P>
<B> Paragraphs 23 -24</B> : Commencement I believe the proposed arrangements are disadvantageous to a potential  operator offering new build capacity. Equally, it is unrealistic to  expect a bidder other than the current operator to be awarded the  contract on 30th. April and start sailings on 1st. May. The Scottish  Office must provide more details of how it intends to cover a  transitional period, including transfer of bookings in the event of a new  operator taking over, and, in any event, it should the arrangements with  the present operator for any continuing interim operation after 1st.  April 1997.
<P>
<B>Paragraphs 28 - 29</B> Comprehension of and fluency in the English language should be a  pre-requisite of crews used.
<P>
<CENTER><B>Other matters</B></CENTER>
<P>
It is recommended that the specification, particularly with regard to  quality requirements, should ask potential operators to indicate what  standards of catering they intend to provide; what provision they intend  to make for the provision of cots and changing facilities for infants;  what medical/first aid facilities will be available on board and whether  it will continue the current small parcel service.
<P>
In addition the specification should stipulate adequate service  requirements for disabled people. Indeed, in a letter to me dated 18th.  April 1996, Lord James Douglas-Hamilton stated that  ...we will wish to  include in the final specification an explicit requirement that  prospective service bidders should take full account of the needs of  disabled people when they submit their tender proposals. It is a matter  of profound regret that there is no reference to this in the draft  specification. I expect confirmation that this will be remedied before  the final specification is sent out and that there will be proper  reference to serving the needs of disabled people (including access to  ferries) over and above statutory requirements.
<P>
I should also wish to draw your attention to  a draft Ferry Customers'  Charter which Shetland Liberal Democrats submitted in May 1995. It  contains a number of points regarding customer service which I would  ask to be considered.

<H1>Hurried Euro-note design missed islands

<P>
17th December 1996

<P>
The Austrian designer who left Orkney, Shetland and many other  islands off the map on the new Euro banknote has apologised for  ruffling insular feathers.
<P>
A spokesman for Robert Kalina, chief designer at the Austrian Central  Bank in Vienna, said it was all a mistake. He had been 'in a hurry'  to complete his winning designs in less than six months: 
<P>
'It's not a deliberate insult. Mr Kalina just took a clip-art map off  his personal computer. It's only a draft. You can rest assured the  islands will be on the note when it goes to the printers,' he said.
<P>
The European Monetary Institute in Frankfurt confirmed that plates  for the 14 Euro-notes could and would be changed before they are  engraved late next year.
<P>
Islanders have long been accustomed to the place-ism of metropolitan  chauvinist mapmakers - who customarily put Orkney and Shetland in  little boxes in the Moray Firth and make them look smaller than they are.
<P>
Some years ago staff at BBC Radio Shetland retaliated with a T-shirt  showing a huge map of Shetland. The rest of the UK was in a tiny box  in the bottom left-hand corner.
<P>
Last night (MON) Mr Kalina (44) was on holiday at a secret location,  before starting work in the New Year on what could be the last  Austrian Schilling notes to be issued before the single currency. 
<P>
His office could not say if he might be visiting one of the Greek or  Spanish islands which he had also left out: 'He's delighted that his  design won the competition but time was short and he  concentrated on  the detail of his theme of bridges across Europe.'
<P>
The unintended slight to Scotland's Northern Isles could easily be  righted, Mr Kalina's spokesman said, but to include every last island  in the Euro-archipelago would create practical problems. The Euro  notes would have to be a foot (30cm) across to show the French  Caribbean island of Reunion or Spain's Canary Islands in the right  position and to scale, unless the European Monetary Institute planned  to issue a free magnifying glass to everyone in the Continent.
<P>
'I suppose we could print Reunion on a separate small piece of  paper,' he giggled, nervously.
<P>
Mr Kalina's oversight pushed predictable buttons in the north. Not  all were amused. Highlands and Islands Euro-MP was first off the mark  yesterday: 'Rest assured that all the islands will be firmly on the  Euro-map if Winnie has anything to do with it,' a spokesman in her  office said. 'It's likely that she and Dr Allan McArtney MEP will be  raising this in the European Parliament and standing shoulder to  shoulder with fellow islanders.'
<P>
Shetland councillor Alastair Goodlad, on a business trip to Norway  yesterday, said: 'If the British can leave us off their weather maps,  it's not surprising if Europe leaves us off the banknotes. But they  should remember Shetland is where the oil comes from, and the fish.'
<P>
Dr Goodlad, who has salmon farming and fish processing interests,  mused that there could be advantages if Europe did forget Shetland  was there: 'We could avoid all those Euro-regulations but still get  the money. Maybe we should get some extra cash for being left out?'
<P>
Charlie Simpson of the Shetland Fiddlers Society echoed Dr Goodlad's  comments: 'The weather forecast maps often show us 60 miles too far  south. Even if most of Lapland is now in the European Union, it makes  you wonder if Santa will be able to find his way here.'
<P>
Shetland may have been left off the Euro-map but it is still in the  money. Europe has played Santa Claus to Shetland over 23 years,  pouring a total of 200 million pounds into hundreds of projects. From  being one of the few places to vote against Common Market membership  in 1975, Shetland has become enthusiastic about the European Union.  Councillors regularly visit Brussels and have taken a lead in the  clumsily-named Conference of Peripheral Maritime Regions (CPMR),  which meets in various exotic locations, usually with good beaches. 
<P>
Once the butt of local taunts about Euro-jaunts to Reunion and  Teneriffe, the CPMR is now seen as an important lever for promoting  the islands' concerns about fishing policy and marine conservation.  Councillor Drew Ratter, chairman of Shetland Islands Council's  development committee, is a noted supporter of a 'Europe of the  regions' and only last week contrasted the helpful attitude of  Brussels with the British Government's obstruction. Brussels, he  says, is more understanding and easier to deal with than  Tory-dominated Edinburgh and London.
<P>
Beneath the hilarity over the fudged banknote design lie more serious  issues. The furore came at a bad time for Euro-enthusiasts, adding  useful ammunition to Euro-sceptics looking for a stick to beat  Brussels (and John Major) in last night's Commons vote on European  fishing policy. 
<P>
There is a big following in Shetland for the Save Britain's Fish  campaign, which wants the UK to pull out of the Common Fisheries  Policy, although the majority in the Shetland Fishermen's Association  still backs reform rather than revolution. Critics like Skipper  Magnus Stewart of the trawler 'Defiant' say fish catch quotas and  other Euro-regulations are bureaucratic, unworkable, cause enormous  waste of edible fish, and oblige fishermen to lie to fishery  inspectors in order to make a living.
<P>
The 'realists', like Councillor Ratter and fishermen's association  secretary John Goodlad, say many other islands around Europe have  similar problems with the policy, whether landlocked Austrians have  mapped them or not. Mr Ratter now chairs the CPMR's fisheries  committee, which hopes to influence the Council of Ministers.  Shetland's most urgent demands are for an end to 'flagships' -  foreign boats which register under the Red Ensign to gain access to  British fish; for local control of fishing effort; and restoration of  subsidies to modernise the fleet. 
<P>
More island jobs depend, directly or indirectly, on catching,  processing and farming fish than on oil. As oil declines, fish  becomes even more vital to the Shetland economy. But while fishermen  rail against Europe's profligacy, ignorance and inefficiency, the  companies who process and market the seafood want very much to be  friends with Europe. Europe means customers for smoked salmon and  herring fillets. It also means grants for the new factories to meet  those European hygiene rules. 
<P>
Whether Shetland appears as a microdot on European banknotes or not  is irrelevant to factory owners; and to Lerwick Harbour Trust which  has just won a big Euro-subsidy for an eight million pounds port  development scheme; and to Shetland Islands Council, with its smaller  than expected but still welcome grant from Brussels for a new waste  incinerator. As long as the Euro-honey continues to flow, the money  can look as funny as you like.
<P>
Some time in the early 21st century, there will be a grant  application for a Euro-bridge or tunnel linking Lerwick to the island  of Bressay - allowing further expansion of the port of Lerwick. That  project, and all the other prospects of bundles of Euros, is why the  Save Britain's Fish campaign is doomed.
<P>
Never noted for following their leaders, Shetlanders also voted  against Scottish devolution in 1979. As with Europe, the position has  softened since, although there is a residual fear that a Scottish  Parliament will be dominated by Central Belters even more patronising  and place-ist than Whitehall <B><I>('Ye're frae the Shetlands, eh, son? Dae  youse aw still speak Gaelic up there in Stornoway?'). </I></B>
<P>
Whether Scotland stays in the UK or not is a topic of conversation,  certainly, but hardly a burning issue outside the small local circles  who fully understand the Scottish Office Revenue Support Grant and  Special Island Needs Allowance formulae. Of much greater concern is  that Shetland stays in Europe, whatever those people on the big  island in the little box in the bottom left-hand corner decide to do. 
<P>
This is not solely because the islands have been trading with  Holland, Germany, France and Spain for hundreds of years. We all have  our price. Shetland's is that 200 million pounds (or 266 million  Euros) in grants since we joined against our will, all those years ago.
<P>
We don't care if there's a single currency, as long as we get our share of it.
<P>

<H1>BP come clean on Foinaven pollution risk
</H1>
<P>

<HR>
</center>
<P><CENTER>(a version of this article also appears in the Aberdeen newspaper <I>The Press & Journal</I>)</CENTER>
<P>
16th December 1996

<P>
BP's fast-track, frontier philosophy has given Foinaven, Britain's first Atlantic oilfield, a very high media profile. The find lies in the deepest, roughest water ever tackled by oil producers on the UK Continental Shelf.
<P>
If something goes wrong out there, the offshore loading operation 200 km west of Shetland has the potential to drop BP and partners Shell in some very deep public relations water. For on the best of days there is no way to contain or recover more than about 10 per cent of any spillage in the wild, open ocean. Sensitive shorelines and fishing grounds are two or three days downwind in average winter weather.
<P>
If Foinaven oil ever hits the coast of Caithness, Sutherland, Orkney, Shetland - or even the Western Isles and Faroe - the airwaves will be loud with the noise of fishermen, fish farmers and nature lovers saying 'We told you so'.
<P>
BP value their clean, Green image and have gone to unprecedented lengths to reassure the public that they have a handle on the environmental problems. In 20 years reporting on the North Sea oil industry I have never seen an oil company publish anything quite like BP's 83-page 'Environmental Assessment' and five-volume oilspill contingency plan for Foinaven and the other 'Atlantic Frontier' developments.
<P>
BP project managers' tactics for dealing with the environmentalists' concerns over Foinaven are interesting. At first they made the usual assurances but failed to back them all up with facts and argument. When that failed to satisfy organisations like the RSPB, Shetland Islands Council and the Shetland Salmon Farmers' Association, BP stopped hiding behind PR waffle and sent their environmental team back to do some serious science. This showed that many of the concerns were well-founded. A 'peer review group' of university and industry experts told the company they should have paid more attention to the criticisms and been more open to start with.
<P>
Throughout the two-year process of negotiation and consultation with Orkney and Shetland, BP have deliberately avoided holding traditional public meetings where their critics might have put them on the spot. Instead, they hosted 'roadshow' exhibitions where several hundred members of the public came along for 'one-to-one' chats with senior managers.
<P>
The antagonisms of debate were thus avoided in the bid to build a consensus. The result is that Orkney and Shetland are now giving BP the benefit of the remaining doubts, but the islands councils can be expected to go ballistic, under public pressure, if the environmental promises are not kept. Protest has been muted because islanders want the jobs. Some of them have already been hired. But all are conscious that hundreds more jobs in other local industries are at risk if the oil hits the beaches and/or the TV screens.
<P>
BP and Shell have set up and funded an environmental 'forum' where fishermen, fish farmers, birdwatchers, university scientists, councillors and civil servants can discuss the issues. The forum has fewer powers and a smaller budget than the long-established Shetland Oil Terminal Environmental Advisory Group (SOTEAG) and does not plan to commission its own research. But, unlike SOTEAG, it will publish the minutes of its meetings and may even hold public sessions in the future.
<P>
Following the lead of BP's 50-per-cent-owned Alyeska Pipeline Service Co in Alaska after the 'Exxon Valdez' catharsis, the company has teamed up with Shetland's North Atlantic Fisheries College to run a training programme for fishermen and fish farmers, who will help to deploy booms and skimmers if the worst does happen. 
<P>
The heavily revised 'Environmental Assessment' and spill plans are more impressive documents than the much-criticised first drafts. They are better researched and referenced, contain serious scientific argument backed by facts, and are a far cry from the anodyne, unsubstantiated assurances sadly so common in the oil industry's past dealings with the environmental lobby. 
<P>
The most hardened critic now has to admit that BP and their 28-per-cent partners Shell really have listened to criticism and tried to do something about it. And the documents are astonishingly frank about the unsolved problems.
<P>
<CENTER><B>Serious problems reman</B></CENTER>
<P>
The trouble is that there may not be a lot they can do about some of the concerns raised in their own documents: accidental oil spills; clean-up capability; pollution by waste water and chemicals; air pollution; and the potential smothering of seabed life by drilling muds and rock cuttings.
<P>
Although Foinaven is a fairly heavy crude, it does respond to chemical dispersants - at least in laboratory tests. That is the good news. The bad news is that dispersants will only work between six and 14 hours after a spillage, depending on sea conditions and temperature, and in winter all of that 'dispersion window' could be night-time.
<P>
Dispersants are the preferred first defence, with the balance of scientific opinion consulted by BP saying the adverse effects on marine life are likely to be minor and short-lived. It is noticeable that, following concerns in Shetland, the developers have considerably beefed up the spraying capabilities based at the oilfield, to ensure a swift response to spills of up to 50 tonnes. 
<P>
A slick of spilt Foinaven oil will be fairly persistent after the chance of using dispersants has passed. Some will evaporate but in calm weather it could be weeks before the sea disperses most of it - ample time for slicks to reach seabird colonies, fishing grounds and fish farms up to 300km away. BP's environmental managers are uncomfortably aware that the 'Exxon Valdez' slicks did some of their worst damage three weeks and 500km from the site of the disaster. In that incident, dispersant spraying was too late, because of organisational foul-ups and a fierce row about its effects on fish and other wildlife.
<P>
Here the notorious weather of the West Shetland Continental Slope comes to the company's aid. Computer calculations in the Environmental Assessment show that the natural dispersion rate of a slick will vastly increase as the wind rises. The worse the weather, the faster a spill will reach land - but the more likely it is to be broken up.
<P>
If pollution reaches Orkney or Shetland, the 'Atlantic Frontier Oilspill Contingency Plan' comes into play. It is a massive document, detailing every bay and beach where oil containment, recovery and clean-up could be attempted and listing all the booms, skimmers, absorbent matting, boats, storage tanks and paraphernalia - including buckets and spades - that would be needed. There is a lot of emphasis on chains of command and information.
<P>
A key tactic will be to try to divert the oil away from sensitive areas, although most of the 2,000 mile coastline of the two archipelagos could be described as such and it is clear that Mother Nature would have to clean up most of the shoreline. Maps of each location show where booms could be deployed in fair weather, hopefully steering slicks towards recovery equipment and 'sacrificial' beaches. 
<P>
Experience elsewhere strongly suggests that multiple layers of boom would be more effective than the single booms shown on the maps, but the plan says stocks of response equipment kept in the islands could rapidly be augmented by extra kit flown and shipped north from mainland bases, within 48 hours. It is only fair to say there is residual scepticism in Shetland about the feasibility of this strategy in severe weather, when boats and planes are often held up. 
<P>
There remain strong arguments for holding much larger stocks at fish farms and wildlife refuges, as is now done in Prince William Sound, Alaska, but BP are confident they have the gear, the expert staff and the maintenance capability to respond quickly while back-up support is brought in. And they point out that a slick is unlikely to hit Shetland on a wide front. Computer predictions of 'slick trajectories' suggest that relatively small areas of coastline would be impacted, at first.
<P>
<CENTER><B>Unprecedented detail</B></CENTER>
<P>
What has impressed Shetland's conservation bodies and seafood industries in the consultations over the past two years is the unprecedented detail of the spill plan. If the worst came to the worst - a very large spill coinciding with winds and waves too high to use booms and skimmers - everyone knows very little could be done. But at least BP have been seen to prepare for what might be done under optimal conditions. 
<P>
So what are the risks of spillage? 'Not as high as you might think', sums up the answer from BP's 'Loss of Containment Risk Tables': spills of more than 50 tonnes are likely to be very rare events, perhaps only once in the lifetime of the field. Between one and two spills a year are anticipated, mostly less than one tonne and mostly the result of human error in operating topsides and loading equipment. 
<P>
'Total risk' during the drilling phase is estimated at one spill in 33 years. For the production phase the spill risk is stated as one in 34 years. The maximum field life is half that.
<P>
The biggest risk is seen as the cargo export system - pumping oil into shuttle tankers. Here the figure is a spill every 1.7 years. The data have been re-worked after initial criticisms but one problem has been the lack of historical data for offshore loading risks. 
<P>
Cynics may relish Figure 5.1 in the Environmental Assessment, which reveals a tenfold increase in oilspill reports from offshore loading installations on the UK Continental Shelf between 1986 and 1990. 1986 was the year the Department of Trade and Industry started using a spotter plane to identify oil slicks. As the Environmental Assessment puts it: 'The advent of this programme coincided with an increase in spill reports to DTI.'
<P>
Since 1990, it appears surveillance has encouraged better housekeeping to keep the problem under control, with the average spill rate per installation dropping from eight to one per year.
<P>
Some critics reason that, even with the impressive offshore-loading technology being installed at Foinaven, it just has to be riskier than conventional production platforms, exporting oil via rigid subsea pipelines to a land terminal like Sullom Voe. But BP say the water 200km west of Shetland is too deep for conventional production technology.
<P>
<CENTER><B>Increased tanker risks</B></CENTER>
<P><A HREF="petrojarl.jpg"><IMG SRC="petrojarls.jpg" ALIGN=right WIDTH=234 HEIGHT=150 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=5></A>
So Foinaven uses a 'floater', a Floating Production, Storage and Offloading (FPSO) ship which will receive oil from remotely-controlled, seabed manifolds through flexible flowlines. The oil is processed on board and then loaded through another flexible flowline to a shuttle tanker moored astern. The tanker ships its load to the Flotta terminal in Orkney, braving the Pentland Firth on the way and, incidentally, increasing the statistical risk of tanker accidents.
<P>
'Petrojarl Foinaven' sits in water 500m deep. There have been serious problems installing the flowlines, even before the FPSO ship arrived on site last month. The current varies in direction and speed at different depths. This has caused snaking and snagging of the lines. There are also sudden and unpredictable current surges as ocean water, which has been moving steadily north-eastwards since it left Florida, meets a gigantic, underwater ramp with roly-poly contours - the Continental Slope between Shetland and Faroe. 
<P>
BP believe their FPSO, hooked up to the flowlines and 10 huge (35-tonne) anchors, will withstand the currents - and the 'freak' waves they can cause when they conflict with storm waves on the surface. Satellite radar and anecdotal evidence from fishermen suggest these waves can be spectacular, terrifying and of Cape Horn proportions. A couple of years ago a giant wave in this area was blamed for massive damage to the big tanker 'Mimosa', punching a hole right through her bows.
<P>
When Foinaven was first proposed it quickly became clear there was fairly sparse information about the wild things living in these wild seas. There was a lot of data about seabird and seal colonies along the coastline but no-one knew much about the offshore populations, particularly in winter, when sensible folk avoided the area. 
<P>
<CENTER><B>Coral reefs discovered</B></CENTER>
<P>
A major scientific effort has gone into 'counting critters' and has come up with some ecological surprises. One of the biggest was that a cold water coral lives on the deep ocean floor and, in Faroese waters not far from Foinaven, builds reefs tens of metres high, with a fauna almost as rich and varied as tropical corals.
<P>
The oilfield lies on an important migration and wintering area for mackerel. Thousands of whales pass by twice a year, on their journeys between Arctic feeding grounds and southern breeding grounds. Millions of birds feed out there in the summer months. Even in winter there are flocks of seabirds, particularly fulmars, kittiwakes and gannets. The 'Atlantic Frontier' has been the spur to give us a much better picture of the extraordinary diversity - and vulnerability - of a corner of the planet once thought to be a watery desert.
<P>
The research is still going on and the Environmental Assessment makes no bones about the fact that we still do not fully understand the ecology of an place where oil production is bound to have side effects. For example, data on seabird distribution are complete for only seven months of the year.
<P>
<CENTER><B>An ornithological howler</B></CENTER>
<P>
The authors have edited out most of the howlers which inevitably drew adverse comment during consultation on their first draft. But one remains on page 15: fulmars, kittiwakes and gannets, it says, are 'mostly aerial in habit and are therefore at only moderate risk from oil pollution'. You do not need a Ph.D. in ornithology to realise there is nothing for the birds to eat in the air and they like to eat at least once a day. To feed, they must settle on the sea or, in the case of the gannet, dive into it. If there is oil on the water, they are at very considerable risk. 
<P>
To be fair, the revised document does admit that seabirds on the vast expanse of sea within 100km of Foinaven are 'highly vulnerable' for at least half of the year.
<P>
One of BP's biggest concerns is what happens when thousands of tonnes of drill cuttings, contaminated with synthetic drilling muds, are discharged above the ocean floor. The evidence so far is that the currents should disperse this plume of artificial, toxic sediment and restrict smothering of those rare corals and other life-forms. But no-one really knows.
<P>
The research has revived an interesting argument about the relative merits of 'synthetic' drilling muds (based on emulsions) versus traditional oil-based muds. It strongly suggests that the claims for synthetic muds being more environmentally friendly may have been overstated.
<P>
<CENTER><B>The dirty water problem</B></CENTER>
<P>
The BP scientists have also drawn attention to a continuing problem with all oil production involving offshore loading - an FPSO does not have room  on board for settlement tanks where oil can be skimmed off the surface of contaminated water from the wells, 'produced water', as it is called. 'Petrojarl Foinaven' will used hydrocyclones and electrostatic precipitators to clean the oily water as thoroughly as possible but in rough weather the system may be 'upset' and not work properly. 
<P>
Chronic, low level pollution from oily water discharged over the side will therefore be a continuing problem and there may not be enough equipment on board to deal with peak throughput. At best there will be 40 parts of oil per million parts of water (ppm) when it goes into the sea. A sheen can form at 25ppm in calm conditions. Re-injecting millions of tonnes of this dirty water into the oil reservoir is not an option, we are told, because it would be complicated and too expensive. Instead, fresh seawater will be pumped down to replace the extracted oil, along with all gas not used to power the FPSO.
<P>
Like all oilfields, Foinaven will pollute the atmosphere, adding its burnt gases and vented tank vapours to the global total and contributing to global warming which, it seems, is partly responsible for those ever-increasing wave heights which make this part of the north-east Atlantic such a challenging place to drill for oil.
<P>
At least BP do not have to contend with ice on their new Atlantic Frontier. But their research shows that, not so long ago in the geological timescale, icebergs of Antarctic proportions grounded west of Shetland. Seabed surveys have turned up hundreds of grooves in the ooze on the ocean floor, some of them hundreds of metres long. It was a mystery until geologists realised they were looking at fossilised plough marks, made by icebergs perhaps 12,000-20,000 years ago, when the sea level was at least 100m lower than it is now. This may be further evidence that Big Freezes and Big Thaws can happen more quickly than previously thought.
<P>
The next glaciation will remove all trace of Foinaven and bring environmental changes far more dramatic than anything the oil industry has wrought to date. The question is whether extracting and burning up all this oil and gas will help to trigger the return of the ice and/or flood the world's coastal cities.  So far, no-one in authority is taking very seriously Greenpeace's recent demand that the Prime Minister should call a halt to the West Shetland oil project and go for solar power instead.

<P>
<P>
21st November 1996
<P>
It's a hundred years since a ne'er-do-well called 'Lying George'  Carmack panned a gold nugget from Rabbit Creek on the Thron-diuck  River in Alaska and started the Yukon Gold Rush. Miners struggling to  pronounce 'Thron-diuck' re-named it 'Klondike'. 
<P>
The weather in the island of Unst this week resembled the Yukon, with  fresh snow covering the otherwise unremarkable drainage ditch on the  croft of Hannigarth where Professor Dennis Buchanan of the Royal  School of Mines and his team have panned out, if not nuggets, some  'highly promising' grains of the yellow stuff. 
<P>
The 900 people of Unst took the news calmly. Over the years they have  learned not too get too excited about new things. Typical reaction to  the discovery of (possibly) commercial gold deposits on the island at  the northern tip of Shetland was: 'That's interesting. We'll wait and see.'
<P>
They've seen booms and slumps before: the kelp industry came and went  during the Napoleonic wars; iron chromate mining was the big thing in  the 1820s; herring was king in the years before the First World War;  the RAF radar station on Saxa Vord hill brought jobs in the Cold War;  and for the past 18 years the Unst airstrip was a bustling offshore  helicopter base - until Chevron Oil pulled out in March this year and  left more than 30 folk without work.
<P>
Unst is more than ready for another boom, as long as it's not too  big. But every island bairn has always known they were sitting on a  gold mine. Why, an RAF man had panned enough of the stuff to make  himself a signet ring, back in the 1960s.
<P>
So there was no gold rush fever in the Uyeasound Public Hall on  Monday evening when Professor Dennis Buchanan of the Royal School of  Mines explained his recent discoveries to an invited audience of  crofters and salmon farmers.
<P>
The geology of Shetland is horribly complicated. The 'Old Rock' has  been squashed, stretched, crumpled, melted and eroded for millions of  years, with the result that in these 567 square miles you may find  every rock type occurring in Scotland, from volcanic lavas to  limestones. The Geological Survey of Unst looks like a child's new  plasticine kit on Boxing Day.
<P>
At Ramnageo ('Raven's Cove') on the south-eastern corner of Unst,  between the village of Uyeasound and the hamlet of Muness, there is  an outcrop of very ancient rock whose name sounds like an  embarrassing personal complaint - phyllitic schist. It started life  as sand, muds and shale in which, under intense heat and pressure,  gold has flowed and congealed. 
<P>
At about one part of gold per million parts of phyllitic schist, it  is not the sort of strike that would have interested 'Lying George'  Carmack. But it is good enough for modern mining techniques and, if a  commercial firm is willing to pay for more detailed exploration,  there could one day be an open-cast mine employing perhaps 15 people  - some say 50.
<P>
If, that is, anyone can decide who has the right to stake a claim.  For the land-ownership of south Unst is almost as complicated as its  geology. For this, many blame an English entrepreneur called  Christopher Wood. Mr Wood was last heard of some years ago in a  village near Bognor Regis, soon after he bought the Muness Estate and  its crofts from the Freed family, absentee lairds.
<P>
Mr Wood caused some controversy when he split the estate into lots  and put it up for auction in London, sight unseen. Among the buyers  was a South African businesman, Ferdie Erasmus, who arrived in Muness  expecting to move in. He found 'his' croft house firmly occupied by a  local family who politely pointed out that, under crofting law, they  had absolute security of tenure and, while they were perfectly happy  to be friends with their new laird, had no intention of moving house. 
<P>
Mr Erasmus took the alleged 'con' in good spirit, stayed on in  Shetland to help build the new Lerwick swimming pool, met and married  the love of his life and is now working for a construction company in Glasgow. 
<P>
What no-one in Unst seems to know is whether Mr Wood is still around  and whether he sold the mineral rights. If he did not, his investment  may yet pay off.
<P>
What is known is that the mineral rights to Hannigarth, one of the  hottest 'hot spots' on Professor Buchanan's map, are still owned by  the Garth Estate, run by John Scott and his family from the island of  Bressay.  In the early 1960s the Garth Estate, unaware that oil was  about to be discovered off Shetland, sold a crofter the land on which  the Sullom Voe Oil Terminal now sits.
<P>
Mr Scott, who is also Shetland's Lord Lieutenant, does not regret  missing the chance of becoming a millionaire out of oil and has no  hopes of getting rich quick through Unst gold:  'I think it's very  unlikely that any mine will ever be called for,' he said yesterday.  'I don't think there are sufficient minerals there. 
<P>
'This gold mine talk is a nonsense and I can't imagine why the  council spent all this money on a glossy report telling us what local  people already knew, - that there are a few spots of gold along the  Hannigarth Burn. I actually think it's worse than that because it may  raise people's hopes falsely.'
<P>
Back at Unst's saloon, the Baltasound Hotel, barman Ronnie Smith said some  of the boys were talking of loading up Shetland ponies and headin'  for the hills, but most were content to whoop it up in the snug bar.  'No-one's tried to pay for a pint with a poke yet,' he said. But at  least it would make a good comic sketch for this winter's Uyeasound  Up Helly A' fire festival.
<P>
If the gold rush comes, it couldn't happen to a nicer island. But  John Scott believes that, for most visitors, the real treasure of  Unst lies in the sensational bird cliffs on the north-west coast of  the 12-mile-long island, at the Hermaness National Nature Reserve.
<P>
Other places have gold. Few have anything like the Muckle Flugga  gannetry. Eco-tourism seems more promising pay dirt for Unst than  shifting a million tonnes of phyllitic schist.
<P>

<P>
5th November 1996
<P>
September 2nd marked the first day of autumn and, here in the Rockies, the brief brilliance of the changing of the colours of the leaves makes this for me the most spectacular of seasons. The boulevard that runs past my house to the University is a kaleidoscope of copper, gold and deep russet, and on the hillsides, the gold of the  tamaracks glows against the dark green pines. The Indian Summer is past and a chill invades the air. High overhead, there is the urgent honk of Canada Geese on their way south.  All the memories of summers past are in that poignant call.
<P>
It is the sign every year for some of my contemporaries  to load the wagons and head for winter homes in Arizona and Mexico. They call themselves 'snowbirds', and I look forward to their postcards telling of balmy days while I am complaining of  bitter winter;  but I have decided  that  the seasons are a necessary part of my life. Perhaps I would wish for something less extreme than the climate of Montana,  where in summer we 'die of the heat' and in winter we 'die of the cold', but perpetual summer? I think not. Autumn is a time of reflection. 
<P>
Missoula, Montana lies at the hub of five valleys, and consequently experiences an air inversion problem. The burning of autumn leaves ceased long ago. Now, the leaves are gathered in bio-degradable plastic bags and hauled to the dump. The air is cleaner, but as I fill my Shetland docken kishie with crisp leaves to spill on the Thanksgiving table, I remember the acrid smell of the burning leaves at Chalfont St Peter, Rupert Brooke's 'sad, sweet smell of the rotten leaves', and  for  a necessary time, 'my heart is sick with memories'. I need to remember in the autumn ---- to remember the year, and the years, past; to sum up perhaps. 
<P>
My autumn sadness is as brief as the brilliance of the changing leaves, because by September's end, the shops are filled with Hallowe'en necessities ---costumes, candies, and pumpkins to be carved into goblin faces and set on the porch with a lighted candle inside. And yet, as the little ghosts and goblins appeared at my door on the 31st October, and I fill plastic pumpkins ---and pillowcases---- in response to 'Trick or Treat!'  I am remembering dark 'guizing' nights in Shetland. Was this Hallowe'en?  I do not recall  Hallowe'en from my London years. Was the practice of 'heaving neeps' at someone's door on a dark night the equivalent of the American 'trick' if the householder did not produce a 'treat'? Only once have I failed to be at home with a lighted porch and a supply of treats on Hallowe'en night.  I came home to find my windows soaped: 'Where were YOU?' was the message. I would have preferred the neeps at the door.  
<P>
The Shetland 'guizing' I remember was a simpler affair---an old sheet covered the whole body, and the head part had eyes and mouth cut out---the better to see and eat the curny cake and ginger cordial offered at each household (except for the ones where we threw the neeps). There was a ritual required of the householder: 'Noo wha is dis peerie lass ... I don't tink I keen wha dis is', and the natural response of the guizer was repressed giggles through the curny cake and cordial. Of course, no cars accompanied the little guizers on dark nights, so 'simpler' meant stumbling through the dark of a Shetland winter from house to house, but who would want it otherwise on Hallowe'en?    
<P>
I miss the bonfires of November the 5th, and the little boys calling out 'Penny for the guy' on street corners in London. The only huge bonfire I can recall in Shetland was the one built at the Clump in Braewick when the end of the war was announced. What a bonfire it was, although I am sure there were no fireworks. There were fireworks and bonfires aplenty last time I spent Guy Fawkes Day in London. And I am intrigued by the choice of this date for our Tuesday Presidential Election, after  a very long campaign notable for its lack of either fire or fireworks.
<P>
With Thanksgiving still to come, Good King Wenceslas is already booming his message through the Malls. We like to get an early start on things in the US, and the thrifty among us have already done their shopping at early sales and are prepared for Christmas. I shall wait until the snow falls  to visit the funny little import toy shop, where the smell from boxes packed in foreign countries will transport me to Stove and Smith's in Lerwick on a winter day. Past the pots and pans and nuts and bolts, and straight up the stairs there is a magical place of dolls with non-plastic faces  and toys without elaborate instructions for putting together. And perhaps I will buy a doll there.
<P>
Meanwhile, back at the ranch, old-timers have been observing wildlife behaviour out in the valley of the Bitterroot Mountains, where Native Americans once dug the bitterroot plant for medicine. I am told that muskrats are building their houses 4 feet high beside the ponds, and that this behaviour heralds the worst winter in 100 years. Nobody remembers, but all Montanans are familiar with Charlie Russell's  painting of a single starving steer in a blizzard. 'Waiting for a Chinook' was the title of that 1886 painting. The warm winds came too late to save most of the herds that year, and though the cattle industry recovered from the disaster, when ranching continued, it was on a much smaller scale. 
<P>
Montana is currently enjoying (some would say enduring) an influx of very important and famous persons because it has been touted as Big Sky Country, Land of Shining Mountains and lately The Last Best Place. And inexpensive real estate. Nevertheless, despite our growing sophistication, it is  'not a good thing' in Montana to ignore the warnings of old-timers---no sir.  So I mean to get a copy of the Old Farmers Almanack to check the truth of this; and if I am advised to lay in a supply of aetmell and batten doon da taek---- I will.

<H1>The use and abuse of a small country</H1>
<P>

<HR>

<P>
<P>
	 Remember this; every time you top your glass up with `Highland Spring' mineral water you are doing a good turn for Mohammed Al-Tajir one of the richest men on earth. Because Al-Tajir is the owner of the Blackford Estate near Auchterarder, and for years he has been pumping up the water that runs under that estate, `adding value' and selling it back to the natives (i.e. us). Which is classic economic colonialism. But there are jobs in it for the locals - as drawers of water.  	 <P>And having bought the land Al-Tajir is free to do with it as he will. His will is that the farms on the slopes of the Ochils should be untenanted, that much of the farmland should be left fallow, and that the farm houses and buildings should be abandoned to the wind and rain. The Perthshire locals are now in a state of confusion; grateful for the jobs at Highland Spring; bitter at the way the land has been allowed to decay.  	
<P>
Conjuring up metaphors can be a dangerous game. But the plight of the Blackford estate does say a lot about Scotland; a conjunction of desirable natural resources, industrial weakness and political impotence. But, as things stand, there is nothing to be done. Not without land reform. And land reform is not on Britain's political agenda. So the people of Scotland have no way of insisting that Al-Tajir cleans up or clears out. Al-Tajir is the laird, and the laird rules, OK. 	 In this respect, Scotland is unique in the western world. It offers a totally free market in enormous chunks of land. Anybody from anywhere can buy as much of Scotland as they choose to afford. And what is true for respectable individuals is true for less respectable companies. Any dodgy, drug-funded dummy corporation registered on some Caribbean sand-bank or Pacific atoll can buy its slice of Scotland, no questions asked.  	 <P>This daft and dangerous situation dates back to the free trade days of the late 19th century when Parliament passed an act allowing foreigners - any foreigners - to buy property in Britain. As Britain was the biggest, richest rooster on the midden the idea of that any foreigner would actually be able to afford to buy into Britain was risible. Since then things have changed. There are millions of rich foreigners out there. And Britain - and in particular  Scotland - is ripe for the plucking. 	 <P>And plucked we have been. By millions of acres. For decades now affluent Danes, Germans, Frenchmen, Belgians, Americans and (especially) Dutchmen have been buying their own corners of Western Europe's `last great wilderness'. Huge swathes of the Highlands - such as the 50,000 acres of the Knoydart peninsula - were sold to developers, broken up and flogged off to anglers and shooters from all over the world.  	 <P>And having stumped up their thousands (millions in some cases) they are determined to make the most of their property. Foreign (and English) notions of ownership do not sit well in Scotland. As a result `keep out' and `trespassers will be prosecuted' signs have been sprouting all over the uplands of the north and south. One proprietor (whose estate runs down to Loch Cluny) took to decorating roadside stock fences with notices declaring that `This mountain is closed.' 	 <P>There is a sour irony in the fact that most of the countries from which these new lairds hail make buying land very difficult. The Danes long ago passed measures to stop their rural hamlets being snapped up by Germans on the hunt for holiday homes. The Irish Land Commission insist on knowing who is behind any land purchase. The Swedes and Norwegians are very careful about who buys their valuable farmland. It is virtually impossible for foreigners to buy up large lumps of Switzerland. But Scotland is anybodys. 	 <P>In recent years the lairds have been flexing their proprietorial muscle. Tensions have been growing. Mountaineers and hillwalkers grumble about efforts to restrict their freedom to roam. Local people complain of being barred from much-loved woods, footpaths, beauty spots and beaches. The relaxed attitude of the Forestry Commission to access has been replaced by nervous private owners determined to guard their valuable timber with dire warnings and barbed wire fences.  	 <P>All of this is, of course, an old lament. In 1847 Hugh Miller was complaining bitterly in the pages of The Witness about the effects of `sporting' estates on the Highlands. `The ancient inhabitants were cleared off... to make way for the sheep; and now the people of Scotland generally are to be shut out from these vast tracts, lest they should disturb the game.' Miller warned that if the sporting lairds went unchallenged they would end up `shutting the Scotch out of Scotland'. 	 <P>Nor was Miller alone. A few years earlier one John Robertson wrote a fierce piece in the Glasgow-based National magazine about the effect of landlordism on the people of Glencalvie in Easter Ross. `They dare not now hunt the deer' he wrote `or shoot the grouse or blackcock: they no longer have the range of the hills for their cattle and their sheep; they must not catch a salmon in a stream: in earth, air and water, the rights of the lairds are greater and the rights of the people are smaller...' 	 <P>The enthusiasm of some Arabs for Scotland is well known. The huge estates of Inverinate and Killilan and Wester Ross are owned by those racehorse owners extraordinary, the Al-Mahtoum family of Dubai. The Mahtoums are not universally popular. A few years ago their launch on Loch Duich went up in smoke. The Egyptian-born Fayed brothers who own Harrods of Knightsbridge also own sizeable chunks of Easter Ross around their lavishly-restored Balnagown Castle. (They used to own a lot more but sold off much of it in the 1980s). 	 <P>None of these Arab lairds hold their Scottish properties in their own names. The ownership of all these estates can be traced back to companies in Liechtenstein or Switzerland. The invisible corporate owner is now a familiar syndrome. Some of the most beautiful parts of Scotland are now owned in such tax bolt-holes as Gibraltar, Curacao, Jersey, the Dutch Antilles and the British Virgin Islands. 	 And just as property rights have elbowed Scots off the land, so they have been elbowed off the rivers. The `riparian owners' of our salmon rivers guard their property fiercely, with force if necessary. Water bailiffs and police launches abound. And the advent of the `time share' fishery companies like Salar Properties (owned in Vancouver by the one-time property tycoon Jim Slater) has exacerbated the situation. 	 As the Campaign for Public Angling has been telling us for years (although no one seems to listen) time-share fishing has had the result of excluding local people from the rivers in favour of well-off anglers from the rest of the world.  	 <P>A classic case was the River Conon in Easter Ross whose salmon rights were sold in a secret deal by the North of Scotland Hydroelectric Board to London financier Peter Whitfield (for £1.8 million). Whitfield then sliced the beats up and sold them off on a time-share basis. And the Conon - which was known as a `locals' river - became the exclusive province of the well heeled, mainly from the south of England. But what gives landlordism a uniquely nasty twist in Scotland is the remarkable survival of mediaeval feudalism. Whoever owns the title to an estate usually (although not always) becomes the `feudal superior'. If you own a house in Scotland the chances are you are someone's `vassal' - be it the local builder, the Sheik of Dubai, the Church of Scotland, or some shadowy company registered in Liechtenstein. 	
<P>
As such, your superior can load your property with all kinds of `burdens'. Or charge you, say, £1,000 for a `minute of waiver' to extend your kitchen. Or, in many cases, exercise his or her `right of pre-emption' to step in and buy your house - even if you want to sell it to your favourite niece or nephew. So long as the laird can match the price, the property is his (or hers).  	 <P>Feudalism is an unjust and archaic shambles. Almost everyone agrees on that. The English dumped it in 1290 - more than 700 years ago. But it is one that our politicians and lawyers have failed miserably to address. Promises of reform have come to nothing. Somehow, there is never enough parliamentary time. Westminster always has more pressing business. So Feudalism persists - to the huge advantage of the land-owning classes, some of whom exploit it mercilessly.  	 <P>The last Green Paper on the subject (`Land Tenure Reform in Scotland') was more than 20 years ago. After it was published - nothing. In 1991 the Scottish Law Commission (SLC) published a `discussion paper' entitled (encouragingly) `Abolition of the Feudal System'. Since then - nothing.   	 <P>Meanwhile landowners like Michael Nightingale of Cromarty (a Kentish commodity dealer and one-time Tory politician) continue to use their feudal powers to boost their property portfolios. Highland MPs and local councillors may gnash their teeth but the law is the law. Feudalism is feudalism. When it comes to tampering with the rights and privileges of the landowning classes, reform is, somehow impossible.   	 <P>John Robertson summed up the problem in the pages of the Glasgow National magazine: `Some Legistlatures have made the right of the people superior to the right of the chief' he wrote `British law-makers have made the rights of the chief everything, and those of their followers nothing.' 
<P>
Robertson wrote that in 1844. Since then little has changed.

<H1> Islands for Sale
</H1>
<P>
<H2>by Rob Edwards</H2>

<P>
<I>
'I will arise and go now, and go to Innisfree,
And a small cabin build there, of clay and wattles made:
Nine bean-rows will I have there, a hive for the honey-bee,
And live alone in the bee-loud glade...
<P>
The Lake Isle of Innisfree, W. B. Yeats
</I>

<P>
Fancy an island? What would you like? For 16 million pounds there's a 
nice three square
kilometre Caribbean island called Guana which includes a holiday resort and a
golf course. Or for 13 million you could pick up the lovely Panama 
island of San
Jose, 45 square kilometres with 50 beaches. Or does the small Mediterranean
island of Isola Marinella - villa and jetty thrown in for nearly 6 million -
grab you?
<P>
Perhaps a property with a little more class? How about a private atoll paradise
in the Seychelles for 13 million, with its own handy airstrip? Or Esk Island in
the middle of a river in Australia, which for a mere 350,000 pounds 
comes with a small
kangaroo herd? Or, for 200,000, a central American island called Taborcillo,
which used to be owned by John Wayne?
<P>
Maybe something cheaper? For just 3,700 pounds, Lake Charlotte Island 
2 in Nova Scotia
could be yours, all 1,500 square metres of it complete with camping site. Or,
what's this? Clett Island in Scotland, asking price 16,500 pounds, 
'undeveloped'. Hey,
Scotland looks good - the 'treeless beauty' of Mingay for 59,000, the 'historic
ruins' of Hildasay for 110,000, or the 'beautiful wildlife' of the Treshnish
Isles for 1 million.
<P>
Now, this looks very interesting: another Scottish island, 34 square 
kilometres,
with estate, manor house and cottages. Doesn't say whether people live in them
or not. Offers over 2 million pounds. What's it called? Eigg. Rings a 
bell, doesn't it?
<P>
The Germany company that describes itself as the world's only island broker,
Vladi Private Islands, lists nearly 200 islands for sale in every part of the
world in its current blurb. They range from undistinguished lumps of rock that
you could own for a few thousand pounds, to tropical nirvanas that 
would set you
back several million. Some are small, some are large, some come with luxury
facilities, some without any. Oh, and some also happen to be people's homes.
<P>
The blurb lists eight islands in Scotland. As well as Eigg, Clett Island,
Mingay, Hildasay in Shetland and the Treshnish Isles, there is Eilean 
Righ ('farmhouse,
meadow and forest' for 500,000), Rudha'Chruidh ('house, boat house' 
for 195,000)
and the Isle of Pabay ('renovated house, stamp licence' for 395,000). There are
another four islands for sale off the English and Irish coasts (Burgh Island,
Fort Perch Rock, Blue Islands, Cruagh Island).
<P>
Vladi Private Islands, which is run by a staff of three from an office in
Hamburg, accompanies the island descriptions with warnings about the pros and
cons of particular regions. About the English and Scottish coasts, for example,
the company comments: 'Their infrastructure is very good and mass tourism is
non-existent. The beaches are clean and nature has been able to preserve her
equilibrium.'
<P>
The same is true for Scandinavia, it says, but 'some Scandinavian countries
enforce restrictive regulations regarding foreign ownership.' In the
Mediterranean, islands are very hard to come by, and if they do come on the
market, very expensive. Greek islands are the best bet, although, warns the
blurb, 'building permits are often very difficult to obtain.'
<P>
Canada is described as the most popular area for island-buyers, particularly
Nova Scotia where 40 islands are currently for sale. 'Nature's lush vegetation
has remained practically untouched. In addition, the political conditions are
stable and questions of ownership can be clearly regulated on a legal basis,'
says the blurb.
<P>
Vladi Private Islands is less polite about the Caribbean. 'Few 
Caribbean islands
are 100% private with unrestricted ownership,' the company says. 'In many cases
foreigners must apply for a special permit to purchase land. This region's best
point is the magic of its landscapes; its weakest point is its social
structure.'
<P>
New Zealand is portrayed as an island-hunter's dream. 'This country 
has one very
special advantage - foreign ownership has been permitted in New 
Zealand for only
three years. Therefore the prices are still at what we would consider the level
of the 1930s.' 
<P>
Foreign acquisitions in the Pacific, however, are 'complicated by numerous
hindrances', with foreigners allowed to buy islands only in Hawaii, the Fijis
and French Polynesia. Foreign ownership has also been banned in large parts of
the India Ocean.
<P>
In South America the demand for islands has dropped dramatically 'due to
political, economic or social insecurity', the blurb informs us. But this has
the advantage of driving down prices. 'With a little daring, especially in
Brazil and less so in Argentina or Chile, favourable acquisitions can be made.'
<P>
Vladi Private Islands is run by Farhad Vladi, a Canadian by birth. He claims to
have sold over 500 islands over the last 25 years, and to now be 
selling between
30 and 40 islands a year.  He originally sold Eigg to the controversial German
artist, Maruma, for 1.5 million last year, and is now trying to sell 
it again on
the international market.
<P>
Vladi is reluctant to categorise his clients, other than saying that 
90% of them
are from North America and Western Europe, and all of them have at 
least 100,000
pounds 'surplus cash'. They tend to be people looking for somewhere quiet to
which they can escape, he says.
<P>
Scotland offers several advantages to the potential island purchaser, he points
out. It is not a 'banana republic' where you have to worry about being nice to
the right officials. Nor is it the kind of place were he would recommend buyers
to take out insurance against the property being expropriated by government or
enemy authorities, as might be necessary in Cuba, Grenada, the Falklands or the
Seychelles.
<P>
But on the other hand, there is the climate and the midges. There is also,
according to Vladi, the risk that local authorities will restrict developments,
and the Scots' traditional wariness of foreign landowners. 'No 
foreigner is able
to put his island in a box and take it home. The ultimate sovereignty remains
with Scotland. All the buyer has is a piece of paper,' he maintains.
<P>
Islands have long been a source of fascination, fantasies and nightmares. From
Treasure Island and Robinson Crusoe, through Gulliver's Travels and Lord of the
Flies,  to Desert Island Discs and Lucy Irvine's Castaway. They have also been
uniquely private places of business. When Rupert Murdoch wanted to discuss the
future of his News Corporation last year, he invited executives to Hayman
Island, near the Great Barrier Reef, and owned by one of his companies.
<P>
The Virgin boss, Richard Branson, owns Neckar Island, one of the British Virgin
Islands in the Caribbean. He hires it and its 22 staff out to 
visitors for up to
10,000 pounds a day, and does brisk business. The reclusive Barclay brothers,
property millionaires who own Scotsman publications and The European, are
reportedly investing 90 million in building a Gothic castle, swimming pool and
shooting range on Brecqhou, an island in the English Channel which they bought
for 2.3 million two years ago.
<P>
Old Etonian, Andrew Martin, bought Percy Island off the Australian coast for
15,000 and has lived alone there for the last 32 years. He originally intended
to sell it for a profit, but now refuses the multi-million pound offers he gets
from property developers. He explained why recently when he was paid a visit by
the TV crew making Angus Deayton's programme, In Search of Happiness.
<P>
'It's too good to sell to some developer or rich man who's just going to treat
it like a vanity plaything,' he said. 'It's invaluable, like the most precious
jewel in the world. The views, everything running free, knowing that I can walk
around, muster the sheep, shoot the goats, it's what makes my heart beat.'

<P>
<H1> The last Jacobite - Executing Archie
</H1>
<P>
<H2>by George Rosie</H2>
<HR>
</center>
<P>
They hanged the last Jacobite martyr at Tyburn in London on  Thursday, June 7th 1753 at 12.30 in the afternoon. He was Doctor  Archie Cameron and he went out in some style; light-coloured coat,  red waistcoat, red breeches and a new, well-powdered `bag' (wig). His  `dying declaration' was an address to Sir Richard Glyn, the Sheriff  of London, who was in charge of the hanging (and who couldn't wait to  get it over and done).  
<P>
`Sir, you see a fellow subject going to pay his last debt' Archie  told the fretful Sir Richard. `I the more cheerfully resign my life  as it is taken from me for doing my duty according to my conscience.  I freely forgive all my enemies and those who are instrumental in  taking away my life. I thank God I die in charity with all mankind.'
<P>
After proclaiming to the crowd that he died, as he had lived,  a  faithful Anglican, he announced himself `done with this world', joined  in a few prayers, embraced the clergyman and was duly `turned off'.  His body danced on the hangman's rope for 20 minutes before being cut  down, stripped, sliced open and the heart removed and burned. After  which, Archie's remains were carted off to be buried.
<P>
On the face of it, the hanging of Archie was a piece of wanton  cruelty. The Jacobite uprising had been over for nearly eight years.  The chances of a Stuart comeback were next to nil. Many Jacobites had  been pardoned. Archie's influential brother Lochiel, the chief of  Clan Cameron, was five years dead. Archie himself was no military  man, but a physician who had tended the wounded of both sides in the  `45. His wife was a Campbell and a relative of the Duke of Argyll. 
<P>
Archie's `crime' was to have slipped into Scotland from France to  spread the news that Charles Edward Stuart had abandoned Catholicism  to become an Anglican and to invite the Jacobite clans to steel  themselves for yet another rebellion once George II had been  assassinated. Archie's message went down like a lead balloon. He was  hardly in Scotland a month before he was betrayed (by a Cameron)  picked up and bundled off to London for interrogation, trial and execution.
<P>
But Archie's mission and Archie's fate say much about Jacobitism.  Despite everything that had happened, Charles Stuart was still at  odds with reality. He believed that all he had to do was join the  Church of England and the British people would `come out' for the  Stuarts. It was lunacy, of course, but as the lunatic had the power  of France at his back the British government was obliged to take it  seriously. Seriously enough, at least, to hunt down and execute Archie Cameron.
<P>
Archie's dismal end is significant. It underscores two crucial  aspects of the Jacobite rebellions that popular history forgets;  religious conflict and international power politics. They were always  present. Every time the Stuart banner was raised in the glens of  Scotland, behind it stood a Catholic power, usually France. Where the  Jacobites of Britain saw a crusade to restore their `rightful' king  the British elites saw the manoueverings of Roman Catholic  absolutism. Neither understood the other's point of view. 
<P>
It is an argument that Linda Colley made recently in her remarkable book  'Britons Forging the Nation 1707-1837': `A successful Stuart  restoration would have meant the replacement of a Protestant monarchy  with a devoutly Roman Catholic dynasty. Moreover, since the Stuarts  could never hope to get back without substantial French or Spanish  military and financial aid, it seemed more than likely that their  restoration would be accompanied by a foreign army of occupation, and  not just a foreign army but a Catholic army.'
<P>
As Colley reminds us, by the 1750s Britain was the Protestant power  in Europe. For more than 60 years it had been locked in contention  with the might of Catholic France. If the five Jacobite insurrections  (1689, 1708, 1715, 1719, 1745) are seen as part of that long,  dangerous struggle then the spite of His Majesty's Government towards  Jacobites like Archie Cameron begins to make some sense. This was an  ideology defending itself.
<P>
In fact, it is not too fanciful to compare the situation with the  `cold war' of 1945 to 1990. The parallels are not exact, but they are  striking. Europe - and indeed much of the world - was dominated by  two competing power blocs each with its own persuasive ideology.  Military power was almost equally balanced between them. Each had its  `spheres of influence', colonies and client states. 
<P>
And neither hesitated to dabble in the internal affairs of the  other. Just as the CIA backed the Contras of Nicaragua and the KGB  propped up the Marxist rebels of Angola, so the French regime financed  and armed the Jacobites of Britain.  The Stuarts, father and son,  were pieces in a wider game of power politics. Not pawns, exactly,  more like bishops. Quite useful, occasionally important, but expendable.  
<P>
Archie Cameron was hounded to death by the British government in  June 1753 on the same grounds that the Americans sent Ethel and  Julius Rosenberg to the electric chair in June 1953. He was a threat  to security, a representative of an alien ideology. In 20th century  parlance, Archie Cameron was seen, rightly or wrongly, as a member of  a `fifth column'.
<P>
This international dimension of Jacobitism is brilliantly teased out  in another recent book ('The Jacobites: Britain and Europe  1688-1788') by the American historian Daniel Szechi. He writes:  `...the British  government rightly feared what the Jacobites were capable of  precipitating abroad... Likewise those Continental great powers who  considered allying with the Jacobites did not see them simply as  cannon-fodder, but rather as a force which had the potential,  literally, to destroy their British opponents.'
<P>
Nor was France the only European power to try to intervene in  Britain's affairs via the Jacobites. Szechi points out that, at one  time or another, and for one reason or another, Spain, Sweden,  Russia, the Vatican and even Frederick the Great's Prussia took a  lively interest in the Stuart cause. In fact, the Jacobite soldier  George Keith became the Prussian ambassador to Paris and was involved  (albeit marginally) in the futile Jacobite plotting that went on  after the `45.  
<P>
So, fear of the Continental powers was never far from the British  mind. That fear may have been exaggerated, but it was justified. Both  France and Spain had both shown what was likely to happen to  Protestant `heretics'. And, as Linda Colley argues, the wars with  France had drummed into the British people (Anglicans as much as  Presbyterians and Non-Conformists) a belligerent Protestant patriotism  that was crucial in shaping attitudes. 
<P>
That Protestant mind-set is shown plainly by who `came out' for the  Stuarts when Charles raised the banner in Glenfinnan in 1745. The  clans which rallied around it were, overwhelmingly, Roman  Catholic  or Episcopalian. The Presbyterian families of the far north - the  MacKays, the MacKenzies, the Sinclairs, the Sutherlands - stayed  away. Other Presbyterian tribes - notably the Campbells - joined the  Hanoverian war against Charles.      
<P>
And while there was a flurry of sentimental enthusiasm for the young  prince among the ladies of Edinburgh when he marched into the capital  in the autumn of 1745, the Lowlands proved barren ground. The  regiment he hoped to drum up in Edinburgh never materialised. Glasgow  produced only two recruits, and one of them was a drunk. The way in  which the Jacobites swept aside Sir John Cope's inept little army at  Prestonpans only exacerbated the fear most Lowland Scots felt for the  Jacobites.    There was, it is true, disillusion among Scots with the Union of  1707. But just as strong was the memory of the `killing times' of the  1680s. The mass hangings of Covenanters in the Grassmarket were only  60 years distant. The first Jacobite rising (in 1689) had been led by  Graham of Claverhouse, the scourge of Presbyterianism. All of this was  remembered in the way that old people today remember the `Hungry  `30s' and the rise of Fascism. The Stuarts had poisoned their own  well. Most of Lowland Scotland was relieved to see the Jacobite army  march south. 
<P>
But there was another powerful current running against the Stuart  cause; economic optimism. Mercantile Scotland was doing nicely out of  the British state (and its colonies). Lowland businessmen saw Britain  as many of their 20th century counterparts see the European Union; as  a dripping roast. There was no question of them joining Charles  Stuart in 1745. It would have been like going to the barricades for  John Redwood and Teresa Gorman - only a lot more dangerous. 
<P>
Not that the Whigs had it all their own way. There was some support  for the Jacobites in Lowland Scotland. The muster rolls of the  Jacobite Army reveal that at least a third, and possibly more, of the  recruits were Lowlanders, mainly from the cities, towns and farmlands  of the east coast. And many Scots - like the rest of their  fellow-Britons - were sitting on their hands until a clear winner emerged.
<P>
But this conjunction of militant Protestantism, fear of the Catholic  powers and growing prosperity and political timidity created the  climate in which the Jacobite cause withered. It was apparent in  Scotland. It became even more apparent as the Jacobite army marched  down through the England. If anything, the Anglican establishment of  England was more hostile to the Stuarts than Presbyterian Scotland. 
<P>
Even the Roman Catholic families of Cumbria and Lancashire fought  shy of Charles. The only recruits the Jacobites managed to drum up  were 200 Manchester men, most of them unemployed, many of them from  an Irish background, very few of them with a stake in the economy of  the land. Linda Colley argues that it is a mistake to equate the lack  of active opposition among the English with indifference. `Unless  they were very brave, or very stupid' she writes `they were hardly  likely to take pot shots at an army of Highlanders and risk reprisals  against their homes and families.'
<P>
This sullen hostility did much to undermine Jacobite morale. In  fact, it was crucial. By the time the Jacobite army reached Derby at  the beginning of December, 1745 the leadership - and particularly  Lord George Murray - was in a state of some despair. At a council of  war in Exeter House (now demolished) on Thursday December 5th Murray  pressed for a retreat. His argument was based on the refusal of the  English to `come out' for the Stuart cause.
<P>
A minute of the meeting reports that Murray told Charles that `The  Scots had now done all that could be expected of them. That they had  marched into the heart of England ready to join any party that would  declare for him, that none had, and that the counties through which  the armies had passed had seemed much more enemies than friends to  his cause.' He also pointed out that `... there was no French landed  in England'.   
<P>
Murray made a powerful case. They were in the middle of a hostile  population, hundreds of miles from home. They were short of supplies.  Two Hanoverian armies were lumbering towards them - Wade from the  North, Cumberland from the South. If they were ever trapped and  broken the militias would fall on them like carrion crows and `there  would not be a man escaped.' The situation was hopeless. They should  retreat and build on what had been won in Scotland.  
<P>
Charles disagreed violently. The people of England were cowed by the  Hanoverian `tyrants'. Remove that fear and their love for the Stuarts  would gush like water from a fountain. All would be resolved if they  pressed on to take London. The Hanoverians would flee in front of the  Highland charge, just as they had done at Prestonpans. And the French  were planning an invasion of the south of England. At one point  Charles shouted at his generals `... you ruin, abandon and betray me  if you do not march on.'
<P>
Ironically, the issue was settled by a Hanoverian agent called  Dudley Bradstreet. He was wheeled into the conference posing as an  English gentleman coming to the aid of the Prince with vital - and  completely bogus - information. Bradstreet told the Jacobites that a  third Hanoverian army of 9,000 men under Sir John Ligonier was about  to march. His `disinformation' was enough to defeat Charles. The  Jacobite generals made the decision to retreat back to Scotland.  From the Hanoverian point of view Dudley Bradstreet is the unsung  hero of the insurrection.
<P>
Charles never forgave the way he was overruled by his generals: `In  future I shall summon no more councils,' he announced with  characteristic Stuart arrogance, `since I am accountable to nobody for  my actions but to God and my father and therefore I shall no longer  ask or accept advice.' Nor did he. The decision to face Cumberland on  the hopeless killing ground of Culloden Moor was all his own.
<P>
It is difficult to exaggerate the importance of that `Black  Thursday' in Derby. It was the turning point of the `45. And it  remains one of the great `ifs' of 18th century history. If Charles  had won the argument at Exeter House, could the Jacobites have marched  on and taken London? And if they had, what would have been the  result?  A benign Stuart regime? Or bloody civil war?  They are  questions over which professional historians are still squabbling.  They have yet to reach a consensus.
<P>
`Black Thursday' was, in fact, the beginning of the end for the  Jacobite cause. When the French heard of the decision they abandoned  all plans for an invasion of England. Next day Charles Stuart's army  began the long trail back to Scotland pursued by Cumberland's troops.  They were cursed, jeered and harried all the way to the border by  English civilians. Some died from rural snipers. Exhausted young  Highlanders were butchered by vagrants as they slept in ditches.  Linda Colley sees this as understandable hate `...by the poor and the  vulnerable for outsiders who had dared to shatter the peace of their  communities.'
<P>
In their retreat the Jacobites left behind the 200 men of the  Manchester Regiment at Carlisle. They were quickly rounded up and  taken prisoner. The savagery with which these Englishmen were then  treated is revealing. The colonel, the officers, the regimental  chaplain, seven sergeants and nine other ranks were all hanged, some  in Carlisle, the rest in London. No regiment of the Jacobite army was  treated anything like as harshly. The message to the English people  was clear: meddle with Jacobitism at your peril. 
<P>
The Jacobites turned and fought a successful rearguard skirmish at  Penrith (the last land battle on English soil). And then, on January  17th, 1746 they scattered General Henry `Hangman' Hawley's troops at  Falkirk. `Sir, my heart is broke' the brutal Hawley reported to  Cumberland before going on to accuse his troops of `scandalous cowardice'. 
<P>
After the debacle at Falkirk the Duke of Cumberland took a grip.  Although only 25 years old (the same age as Charles Stuart) he was a  battle-hardened soldier. The skills he had learned in the War of  Austrian Succession at the battles of Dettingen (where he was  wounded) and at Fontenoy (where he was a hero) were brought into play. 
<P>
Cumberland's army (hundreds of them Scots) was marched north to  Aberdeen at the end of February. There it stayed for six long weeks  while Cumberland hammered it into shape. These six weeks were  crucial. If, as has been said, the battle of Waterloo was won on the  playing fields of Eton then the battle of Culloden was won in the  training camps around Aberdeen.
<P>
There is an excellent account of Cumberland's methods in General Rex  Whitworth's little-known biography William Augustus, Duke of  Cumberland. He writes; `Having analysed the enemies' tactics at  Prestonpans and Falkirk, Cumberland and his generals expected the  rebels to adopt similar tactics again: to fire at longish range, then  throw down their firelocks and charge with swords and daggers in both hands.'
<P>
This Gaelic charge had been remarkably effective in the past.  Jacobites had used it to devastating effect from Killiecrankie to  Prestonpans. But the Duke of Cumberland was not Hugh Mackay or John  Cope. `His men had to be taught to withstand the rebels initial fire'  Whitworth writes `and to remain in position even when the enemy made  his terrifying charge, complete with bloodcurdling yells. They could  fire only when given a specific signal to do so, usually by a  particular drum roll.'
<P>
On April 7th, 1746, when Cumberland was satisfied that his troops  were ready, the Hanoverian army broke camp and marched north and then  west along the Moray Firth coast. Offshore, a convoy of supply ships,  guarded by HMS `Fox' kept pace. After ten days of marching,  Cumberland's men caught up with the Jacobite army on Culloden Moor.  The weeks of training paid off. The tactics worked. According to that  fine historian Bruce Lenman `It was the end not so much of a mass  uprising as of an abortive, French-sponsored coup d'etat.'
<P>
The victims of Culloden were many and various. Active Jacobites were  hunted down, burned out, gaoled, exiled and hanged. Highland chiefs -  Jacobites or not - were stripped of their residual legal powers.  Jacobite estates were confiscated and/or sold. Tartans, kilts,  bagpipes, broadswords were banned as weapons of war. As Hanover  stamped its imprimatur on the Highlands, the fragile culture and  society of the Gaels fell apart. It has never really recovered.
<P>
Nor has the Episcopal Church of Scotland. It is the forgotten victim  of Culloden. The Anglicans of the British government turned on it  with a ferocity that shocked many Presbyterians. `After Culloden the  Church dwelt in the shadow of death' says Marion Lochhead in her  (somewhat overheated) history of the Episcopal Church. `The virulence  of persecution of the vanquished foreshadowed the methods of the Nazis.'
<P>
It was almost 50 years before the Penal Laws against the  Episcopalians were lifted. By then the church had been grievously  wounded. Anthony Mitchell, the Bishop of Aberdeen, once listed the  damage; in 1689 the Episcopal Church held two-thirds of the people of  Scotland with 600 clergy; by the 19th century the church had 40  priests and only a twentieth of the people. Now membership is 35,000  - less than one hundredth of the Scottish people. Without the support  of English immigrants (lay and clergy) it might well have ceased to exist.
<P>
Archie Cameron was one of the Jacobite leaders who fled with Charles  Stuart on the French ship `L'Hereux'. He joined his brother Lochiel's  regiment of the French Army as a surgeon, and when Lochiel died  served with Ogilvie's regiment. Like all the Jacobites exiles he  longed to return to Scotland. Unlike most, he plotted to make it  happen. There must have been times when he wished he hadn't.
<P>
Jacobitism itself ended not with a bang, not even with a whimper,  but with a giggle. After Charles died, drunk and degenerate in 1788,  his mantle was taken up by his brother Henry, a Roman Catholic  cardinal. Henry IX, the last Stuart pretender, died in 1807, but not  before he had commissioned Canova to sculpt a memorial in Rome to the  Stuart `kings'. It was partly funded by George, Prince of Wales, the  first Hanoverian to climb into Highland tartans.  
<P>
When `Henry IX' left the European stage he was replaced by those  amiable English eccentrics the `Sobieski Stuarts', who declared both  their descent from Bonnie Prince Charlie and the authenticity of  their book of colourful tartan patterns. The Sobieski Stuarts are  partly responsible for what Tom Nairn dubbed the `Great Tartan  Monster' which still slithers across the British landscape.
<P>
The fact is, the Jacobite ghost still walks. As Murray Pittock  rightly says `The Jacobite cause's own icons of struggle, loyalty,  Highland patriotism, sacred kingship, art, fertility and episcopacy  transmuted themselves into various manners of understanding  Scotland's continuing problems of identity.... The metaphor and  symbols endure.'
<P>
None of which would have made any sense to Archie Cameron as he  stood on the gallows at Tyburn that June day in 1753. There is  something poignant about Archie's death, even after 243 years. If  nothing else, he is a reminder that there was more to Jacobitism than  red-shanked tribesmen with Lochaber axes. Archie Cameron was a  physician and a civilised man. He had studied Moral Philosophy under  the great Francis Hutcheson at Glasgow University and medicine at  Edinburgh and Paris.
<P>
Like many of his kind he had gone into the `45 with serious  misgivings. But through it all he had been loyal to the Stuart cause.  As a result he was about to be crushed in the gear wheels of European  power politics. But the last Jacobite martyr made a suitable exit.  Archie went to his death asking God to `... hasten the restoration of  the royal family without which this miserably divided nation can  never enjoy peace and happiness.'

11th November 1996

<P>
'Information overload' is making us ill, it said in an English newspaper which I have stopped reading because it overloaded my brain's random access memory. 
<P>
I am also giving up American politics, so my cerebral soft disc can cope with the forthcoming Shetland Islands Council by-election in Yell, South. 
<P>
Presidential Tuesday was 'a day atween wadders', a Shetland expression for a fine day between sleet storms. What with the global warming and the windier North Atlantic, our weather windows are narrowing. The Fifth of November was really only a night between weathers.
<P>
The Bressay whole-island-bonfire-and-fireworks-with-warmdogs-to-follow having passed off in a flat, black calm and without injury, I carefully extinguished my sparkler, booted up the Word Wide Web and logged on to the Atlantic weather chart and the latest picture from a satellite high above my head. It took so long to come up on the screen that I phoned our as yet unprivatised Coastguards instead.
<P>
Their information load was brief and to the point. After days of waiting for a weather window to deliver a motorboat to Unst, the island at the end of the British world, my luck was in. The wind would not reach Force Eight again until 3am. I could make the island of Yell, 30 miles away, and complete the voyage next day.
<P>
I was in the Mid Yell pub before closing time. Being the same age as Scotland's National Health Service, I joined the table where my pal, the local doctor, was enjoying an evening off. Besides, I needed his sofa for the night.
<P>
I had recently written a piece about his new defibrillator for jump-starting heart attack victims and, when I searched the digital datafile for a picture of him, I found one of a rabbit and a clown riding a pedalo across a notorious tide race, sponsored by hilarious spectators. The doctor was the rabbit. This was not the dignified mugshot GP Magazine was looking for, digital or not.
<P>
The clown, a notorious Yell ferryman, was in the bar to sign the rabbit for his next medical fund-raiser - welding up an old Volvo so it would float and driving it across that sound between Yell and Unst. A prototype had almost circumnavigated the Mid Yell Pier, but the battery shorted out and there was no defibrillator handy. 
<P>
It was one in the morning, back in the doctor's kitchen, before I remembered what day it was. I tried to reach the American election results home page with my laptop but the Internet had apparently crashed in the US because so many people were trying to do the same thing at the same time. But it was clear, the instant we switched on the telly, that Bill n' Hil had 'made the land again', if not The Hill.
<P>
Until then I had no idea Ralph Nader was the Green's presidential candidate. The BBC broadcast their election special from an echo chamber in Washington DC, so it was difficult to hear all Nader's replies to the duty Dimbleperson.
<P>
Gavin Esler had earlier called it 'an idea-free campaign' but one of Slick Willie's few ideas had been to enrich President Bill Gates of  Microsoft by connecting every American school to the Internet. Revolutionary. The kids might start to enjoy learning, as long as they didn't all try to log on at once. 
<P>
Nader had even better ideas and, now the election was safely over, the US networks were giving him primetime to put them across.
<P>
'The corporation is the power centre in our politics,' he said. If corporations could rent American politicians (and some of ours) there was no prospect of the Comeback Kid or anyone else tackling the big issues of education, health and pensions. Campaign funding reform came first. 
<P>
Nader is a sort of Will Hutton with added Nature Study. Like the author of 'The State We're In', he says the interests of corporations cannot be reconciled with the interests of society. Not only do we let them buy our elected representatives but we also model our social institutions on commercial firms whose structure is inappropriate for delivering welfare, health care and schooling. 
<P>
It is clear by now that private insurance is not going to help the 23 per cent of American children living in poverty. Nor is the internal market going to fix the British NHS. Clarke-Brownian economics, endogenous growth theory notwithstanding, can't deliver jobs without destroying even more of the Nature that so few politicians have studied.
<P>
They don't have a Green candidate in Yell, South. There is a Labour Party member standing as a Lib Dem, and that is curiosity enough. But the corporate virus Ralph Nader was trying to talk about (until he was cut off by a video clip of defeated Republicans calling Clinton 'socialist') is found even in remote islands, thousands of miles from Washington DC.
<P>
A new secondary school for Shetland is delayed by confusion over the Government's bizarre 'Private Finance Initiative'; fat cats of the privatised Hydro Board can no longer guarantee a reliable electricity supply (28 power cuts in my island this year); the market-oriented Royal Mail curtails the hours of country post offices; privatised BA pulls out of island air services and then posts record profits.
<P>
The local NHS and Social Work Department suffer bureaucratic sclerosis - it can take a two-hour meeting of 11 corporate professionals to decide whether an old lady with arthritis needs a home help, day care or hospital. This decision used to be taken by a doctor and social worker who knew the patient personally.
<P>
Even in islands enriched by a tiny slice of BP's corporate profits from Sullom Voe, clowns and rabbits still have to make old Volvos drive on water to finance essential medical equipment for country doctors.
<P>
There's a growing shortage of GPs. Medical students opt for glamorous, highly-paid specialities, not the long hours of single-handed rural practice. No doubt the social marketeers will explain their solution to this crisis on our own Election Night Special. It will probably involve self-diagnosis by e-mail.

<B>5th November 1996</B>
<P><UL><LI>
It's turning into a vintage winter for Scottish Hydro Electric.  Another three hour power cut (sorry, chaps, 'temporary service  outage') in British West Bressay last night. Our editor was on the  ferry to Beautiful Downtown Lerwick when it happened and had to  return before the end of his Labour Party meeting, to make sure the  newdesk didn't crash when the power came back on again.
<P>
His suggestion that Da Hydro and all the other privatised national  utilities be immediately re-nationalised without compensation and the  Tory MPs who voted for it thrown into jail did, not, I fear, find  much favour with the Blairies at the meeting, including Rockin' Jimmy  Paton, the new prospective candidate and former roadie for Elvis Voe  and the Heoganaires.
<P>
Thrown into jail? Surely a bit strong, Jon? Not at all, according to  our editor, who was more than usually incandescent after his second  'outage' in 72 hours. The poor, old-fashioned dear holds firmly to  the principle that the party whip system, which shunts privatisations  through the Hice of Cummings for Governments which don't have a  majority of votes at the ballot box, amounts to 'suborning a Member  of Parliament'. This, he assures, me, is against some law dating back  to the 14th century and never repealed. 
<P>
Lord, luv a duck! What a bor-ring relic this man is! Being a child of  the Thatcher Era (described by our grumpy editor as '17 years under  enemy occupation' - what can he mean?) I thought suborning MPs was  perfectly normal.
<P>
<hr width=60%>
<P><LI>
Still, the power cut was shoved off even the inside pages by the  rib-tickling news that the 'Petrojarl Foinaven', lovely big thrusting  oil pumper that she/it is, did a decidely wimpish about-turn  yesterday and headed for shelter, of all things, off Skelda Ness -  instead of facing the gale and picking up her anchors like a real man  (this gender business with ships is so confusing, isn't it?).
<P>
Loved the spin doctoring by our very own resident Shetlander in  charge of BP's Foinaven oilfield operations (didn't even know the  company was feeling peaky, myself): Les Thomson of Hillswick, for it  is he, told Radio Shetland listeners the diversion was actually a  positive thing because it gave Shetlanders their one and only chance  to see the big beast before she disappeared over the horizon for the  next 17 years.
<P>
Gosh, what a treat. I bet they're dancing in the streets of Skeld  tonight, Les! But don't bet the croft your new baby won't be back inshore soon.
<P>
<hr width=60%>
<P><LI>
Seeing we're being beastly to BP, wot abaht this one, eh, nudge, nudge?  
<P>
According to page 15 of their 'Environmental Assessment' for the new  Atlantic oilfields, the fulmars, gannets and kittiwakes out there on  the dotted line at the edge of the Continental Shelf (sounds like a  swish new Lerwick bistro, doesn't it?) are 'mostly aerial in habit  and are therefore at only moderate risk from oil pollution'. Just  read that again, girls, will you?
<P>
Lord, luv a gannet! Has hunky Dr David Monk, BP's Head of Gannets,  Northern Hemisphere, gone off his chump? Pete Raptor, my favourite  and suprisingly tame ornithologist, reminds me that although it is  indeed true that these birds spend most of the day flying around,  there is one tiddly little problem. The silly things have to eat and,  as there is nothing for them to eat in the air, they land on the sea to feed. 
<P>
And here we come to the big intellectual leap forward, probably a  leap too far for poor David Monk: if there's an oil spill on the sea  where they alight it could, believe it or not, actually get on their  feathers and spoil their entire week! Moderate risk, my tail!
<P>
Isn't science wonderful? Pity there's not a little more of it in the  Environmental Assessment.  Never mind. In appendix A4 we learn the  reassuring news that the chance of an oil spill from 'Petrojarl  Foinaven' ''failing to maintain station'' is, wait for it, one in 625 years.
<P>
With statistics like that, I'm certainly going to stop worrying,  right now this very minute.

 <B>4th November 1996</B>
<P>
<UL><LI>
Life in the corporate fast lane is a risky business, so the wise  high-flyer is always on the look-out for a nice little earner if that  early retirement package should land on the doorstep sooner than expected.
<P>
There is none wiser than our own dear chief of corporate affairs,  Malcolm The Terrible. He's known for some time that one day he'll  have to give up the day job, as whit we aa mun do, hae we or hae we  no a cru. Malkie's already a well known groupie on the folk scene but  rumour has it he's planning a new career as a rock'n'roll impressario.
<P>
More than rumour, dear friends: neighbours on Discovery Hill (so  called because you can see more Range Rover Discoveries from there  than anywhere in the northern hemisphere) were astonished on Sunday  lunchtime to behold the entire cast of tearway local rock combo The  Red Vans trooping into the Green's Swiss-style residence, Fort  Acolyte, for a working brunch.
<P>
They'd have been even more astonished if they'd been inside the  building, for no sooner had the lads got their grubby paws around a  pre-prandial snifter than a bleeper went off deep in the bowels of  the South-Fork-style kitchens.
<P>
Panic gave way to hilarity as their host frantically scrabbled  through various drawers, safes and lockfast places, searching for the  miniaturised electronic device. Turned out it was just His Holiness  checking The Hairy One's satellite tracking transponder to find out  where he was if he wasn't in church.
<P>
The word on the street, pop pickers, is that after a fairly heavy  session The Red Vans agreed to hire him as a roadie. Or was it the  other way round? One can never quite tell with Malkie.
<P>
<hr width=60%>
<P><LI>
Speaking of security, what price the head of the Sitewide Hostile  Intruder Termination Executive (it's an acronym, dummy!) at BP Sullom  Voe? Try driving in the main gate without a pass and all hell lets  loose. But for energetic and determined trespassers - mainly the  Delting sheep (so far) - there's another way.
<P>
The big gale back in January '92 laid waste some 20 yards of the 10  foot high perimeter fence where it runs into the sea at Orka Voe on  the north side of the oil terminal site. No big deal, you may say.  But, Heavens to Betsy, a little bird tells me the fence is still wide  open, almost five years later!
<P>
No need for alarm, however. For everyone knows that even the most  determined terrorist would easily be deterred by having to put on  green wellies and walk a punishing couple of miles around the shore from Toft. 
<P>
A passing goose shooter from Orka Flats tells me he hears BP are  thinking of hiring Big Malkie as their security adviser, once he gets  his Golden Goodbye from Da Coonty. Such a pity he's signed up with  The Red Vans already and won't have time!

Oh Lawks! There's my old chum Malcolm Green caught spending £27,000 (honest) on a Junior Spymaster Kit to de-bug Lerwick Town Hall! And the Rector of St Magnus knew absolutely <I>nothing </I>about it! Dontcha just <I>love </I>it? But how terribly unkind of a certain councillor, whom I will not name as long as the monthly direct debit keeps kicking in, to remark in my hearing: 'What makes them think a spy could make out what Malkie was saying anyway, even if he <I>didn't </I>wrench the tape recorder out of the agent's hands and try to ram it down his froat?'

<p>
<LI>
My Dears! Did you notice that dinkie little boat Golden George (Mmm! Hunky!) has bought the Foula men? Quite, quite divine! One just <I>adores </I>the paint job. I mean, have you <I>seen </I>the peerie bird they've painted on either side of the front - or 'bows', as our pedantic old salt of  an editor calls it? Pierhead skippers ask me what sort of <I>avifauna </I>it could possibly be. Oh, come on, chaps, you must have guessed by now. It's a Wild Goose! No barnacles on my bottom. Get it? Barnacles? Geese? Oh, never <I>mind</I>!

<P>
<LI>
Winter's here, and no mistake. A girl can hardly keep her perm on straight in all this wind and rain! Why, only this morning I bumped into <I>darling </I>Andrew Harmsworth, Da Coonty's evangelical 'agricultural officer', who helps all those poor crofters fill in forms asking for even more Hill Livestock Compensatory Allowances, or 'subsidies' as we intellectuals call them. 'Beastly Day, Andrew!' I chirrupped, accelerating across King Harald Street to avoid the religious tract the <I>pet </I>was about to offer me. 'Da grund wis needin' hit!' he replied. Isn't it quaint how simply everyone is trying to speak dialect these days, even the aristocratic diaspora?

<P>
<LI>
And then they had that <I>marvellous </I>power cut for three whole hours in British West Bressay last night - first proper one of the season, I believe. TV off all over Shetland, forcing people to play <I>charades </I>and take strong drink, even! Our crusty old editor called Da Hydro's 0345 number to complain and swears he got a recorded message saying the number had been changed. So he dialled that one but, silly old butterfingers that he is, found himself talking to Thames Water instead! What a hoot! They had no <I>idea </I>where he was! Come to that, nor did the Hydro lady in Perth (of all places) when he finally got through.

<P>
<LI>
For Heaven's sake don't tell my old chum Bobbity Washoot (now we really <I>are </I>talking hunky!) but his <I>hits </I>are not what they seem. The poor chap's website has a weensie little  problem. It takes two clicks, not one, to reach the news pages and, worse still, his boffins are using those awful, clunky old frame things, so while he thinks he's getting <I>heaps </I>of hits, he's actually getting less than a tenth of the ones those awful bullies (<I>pirates</I>, really, Bobbity confides) are clocking up at Shetland's Number One site - you know where. Call me a beach, but, as they say, 'Great is the truth, and it will prevail'!

<P>
<LI>
Speaking of Bobbity's snailmail website out there in Newsprintland, what's become of  my old friend Spike? Don't <I>ask</I>, please. It's so terribly, terribly sad.
</UL>
<P>

Simply must dash! There's a <I>man </I>at the door

'Oh! Er, why don't you come up and see me, officer?'

<H2>'Refusing to knock at Death's door'</H2>
<P>
by Jonathan Wills
</CENTER>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
11th October 1996
<P>
It's a bit late now, after 20 years in the business, but I am  beginning to suspect that I'm no longer man enough to be a member of  Her Majesty's Press, if I ever was.
<P>
My credentials have been questioned twice in the past year, by  proper, trained journalists who happened to be personing  the  newsdesk of a certain mainland daily when my district news copy on a  suicide arrived in their basket.
<P>
The police euphemism when a sad person takes their own life with a  shotgun is 'a sudden death with no suspicious circumstances'. I  normally despise euphemisms but, great big squeamish softie that I  am, I find this one more civilised and comforting than the stark word  'suicide'.
<P>
If, and only if, the victim is a well-known person who has taken some  prominent role in the local community over the years, a brief  obituary is called for, drawing on old news files and quotes from a  few folk who knew the deceased well. Usually a friend of the bereaved  family can arrange for a photograph of the departed in happier days -  what is known in the trade as 'a collect pic'.
<P>
In a small patch like mine (and everyone else's, for that matter),  this must be done with some delicacy if we are not to distress the  bereaved even further. The same applies to accidental deaths,  particularly those involving children.
<P>
What I am increasingly asked by some mainland newspapers of a certain  hue is, in the words of the young newsdesk lady in the most recent  incident: 'Why haven't you done a death knock?'
<P>
This involves knocking on the front door of the grieving family,  offering them synthetic sympathy, and persuading them to give you an  interview and a picture.
<P>
It is actually quite easy to do death knocks. The recently bereaved  are often garrulous. They commonly give you very juicy quotes and  lots of emotive actuality. The point is that they are invariably in  shock and in no state to decide if they should talk to the media. I  think they deserve more respect, whether they have lost loved ones in  a spectacular horror like Dunblane or  just another car crash.
<P>
After the successful death knock, you are supposed to write something  like this: 'A hysterical mother yesterday broke down and wept  uncontrollably as she told me of her three-year-old daughter's  horrific death fall from a cliff...etc.'
<P>
You don't need to disturb the mother to know that she will be  sobbing, and probably screaming, a few hours after her child has  died. It seems to my old-fashioned, untrained mind that what you  ought to write is: 'The shocked parents of a three-year-old girl who  died in a cliff fall were last night under sedation and being  comforted at home by relatives and friends.'
<P>
That is euphemistic but it is all you can or should say.  The most  unimaginative reader realises the bereaved will hardly be 'over the  moon'. The demand from the Harry Hardnose school of newsdesking is  for 'actuality': blood, guts, tears and meticulously chronicled  wailing and gnashing of teeth. Some TV and radio news programmes are  becoming almost as depraved.
<P>
I find this unpleasant, prurient and semi-pornographic. But then I  only drifted into journalism and was never properly trained. So, once  again, I refused to do the death knock for the young lady on a far newsdesk. 
<P>
Not very politely, I explained that, in my opinion and knowing the  deceased and his distressing family circumstances, a death knock  would amount to intrusion on properly private grief. This, I rashly  suggested, was against the National Union of Journalists' code of  conduct (yes, there is such a thing and some of us old fusspots still  try to follow it).
<P>
'It's not against any code of conduct I know of,' was the tart reply.  Well, of course, she wouldn't, would she? Union membership is rather  out of fashion at the moment in our trade, so she had probably never  seen the clause in the NUJ code of conduct which does indeed say a  journalist shall do nothing to intrude on private grief.
<P>
The previous time this happened, an angry news editor was the phone  within minutes, to berate me for my wimpishness. He reminded me where  my bread and butter came from and demanded the full gories. The  newsdesk, not I, would decide what was in good taste and what wasn't.  I was unable to satisfy this gentleman and he hung up, after a few  parting insinuations.
<P>
Fortunately, I am a freelance, not an employee, and can choose not to  do the dirty work. My customers can take or (more probably, these  days) leave what I file to them. I can always go to the handline  fishing instead. It's the poor souls who actually work for these  crass sensation-mongers who deserve your pity.
<P>
Apart from the morality of death knocks, there are practical  considerations. Every local district in the world has its 'stringer'.  There are millions of us. Without us the big papers would have to  spend fortunes flying crack correspondents out to cover every bus  crash, hotel fire, shipwreck and man biting dog. Or, more likely,  they wouldn't bother to report anything involving single-figure  casualties beyond the cities of the plain.
<P>
Flying death-knock squads cost loadsamoney and invariably cause local  outrage. A good bad example was the reporter who, quite  disgracefully, doorstepped the widow of the pilot killed in the  Shetland air ambulance crash earlier this year. Shetland-based  journalists who treated the widow with respect did not file such a  heart-rending story but were tarred with the tabloid brush and  themselves became local hate objects for a while. 
<P>
The problem with stringers, and our strength, is that we are part of  the community. People have to trust us. We must be on friendly but  properly distanced terms with the local police, firefighters, health  board, hospital, council, court officials and coastguards. In  particular, the population at large must trust us never to betray  sources and not to be partial or for rent. If we lose that trust, we  can't get any information, have no stories to sell and will soon be  at the handline full-time.
<P>
If we do our job properly, we must often write reports which, however  factual and fair, drive local authorities and personalities into a  frenzy of indignation because they did not want their neighbours, let  alone the outside world, to know what was going on. A recent example  was the vilification of journalism as a trade by certain salmon  farmers who, thanks to the efforts of the local press, were revealed  to be doing naughty things with banned chemicals in order to make a  quicker buck.
<P>
Unlike big city reporters, who may never meet today's target again,  we must live with our 'victims' long after the national media have  lost interest in the story which gave offence. This causes some  tension and the occasional punch-up in the boozer. We do not expect  to be universally liked in our communities. But we do what we can to  earn at least a little respect, and a living at the same time.  Outraging the local public's sense of what is right and decent at a  bereavement is counter-productive, to say the least.
<P>
Journalists in general are now rated in public esteem slightly below  pimps and only a little above politicians and dope dealers. The  voyeurism of some newsdesks has a lot to do with that.
<P>
I have just been to our annual Shetland Careers Convention, where I  once again broke it as gently as possible to dozens of sixth-formers  and their parents that journalism can indeed be a slightly dirty  trade. If you're 'interested in creative writing', then go in for  that, not journalism, I always say. 
<P>
But no-one's going to take any notice of a cynical old hack in a  dirty mac, even if his scruples have brought him to the brink of  packing it in. So this year there was the usual crop of talented,  determined trainees. Let's just hope they skip the journalism college  classes on death knocking and later have the courage, as members of   the union and the human race, to tell importunate news editors where  they draw the line.
<P>
They could be out of paid job then, of course. There'll be nothing  for it but stringing a district for life. They needn't blame me. As I  told their parents, so long ago: 'Don't put your daughter on the  page, Mrs Worthington.'

<P>
<H1>The Bressay Essay</H1>
<H3>'My vessel is stopped and making no way through the water'

</H3>
<P>
by Jonathan Wills, 5th December 1996

<H4>(This feature also appears in <I>The Orcadian</I> newspaper, published at Kirkwall, Orkney.)</H4>
<HR>
</center>
<P>
I am always nervous before my night on duty at the Bressay Junior Club, which takes place every winter Wednesday in the public hall. Fortunately, we have been breeding like fruit flies in Bressay. A century of depopulation has been reversed, with a vengeance. There are now several dozen parents in the island, so my turn doesn't come round very often.
<P>
My problem is that I can't stand loud noises. If ever I were captured by The Enemy Within, they would only have to turn up the volume on Radio One in my interrogation cell for 20 minutes and I would break down and give them all they wanted - National Insurance number, Clydesdale Bank PIN, postcode, mother-in-law's maiden name, Christmas card list, the lot.
<P>
The acoustics of our otherwise lovely little Bressay Hall are best described as 'resonant' and the noise on Junior Club Night is indescribable, although lessened by a few hundred decibels since the inestimable Morag organised things like table tennis, pool, draughts, baking and painting to keep the little dears busy. Every island should have a Morag, to say nothing of a Jessie, a Julie, a Sheila and all the other capable mothers (and some fathers, it must be said) who keep order. I hope I didn't forget to mention anyone there.
<P>
My allotted task for the evening was baking. With half a dozen little helpers, who knew a lot more about the business than I did, we soon had three dozen mincemeat pies in the oven. A few eight-year-old purists raised eyebrows at the Readymix frozen pastry I had bought that morning for the occasion. Being very keen on The Environment and self-sufficiency, thanks to the excellent green indoctrination policy of our island school, the younger generation tend to disapprove of people who can't or won't make their own pastry out of real flour and stuff, but they were far too well-brought-up to mention it.
<P>
There is nothing quite like a freshly baked mincemeat pie, almost but not quite too hot to eat. The scene when the pastries were served was like one of those Serengeti TV safari documentaries, where the lions tear a wildebeeste to pieces in seconds. The last pie had just disappeared down a ravening Junior Club gullet when my daughter, who played a leading role in the pastry-cutting operation, appeared in the kitchen to ask where hers was.
<P>
Oh dear... and I had scoffed three myself. But Wir Katy's tears soon dried when I explained that the greatest accolade any cook can ask for is a clean plate (even if the floor is covered in pastry crumbs). She cheered up and we went home, the bairns to beddy-byes and me to the cybergarret, to check that the day's news was up on the net.
<P>
Then the expletive-deleted power went off. By my calculations it was the 30th power cut in Bressay this year. Something of a record, even for the privatised Hydro Board, which appears to spend more on executive share options and public relations (their slogan, believe it or not, is 'We Give You The Power') than on the Bressay electricity supply which, among other things, fires up the TV transmitters for the whole of Shetland. 
<P>
Seeing as how Inspector Morse had just fizzled out in a snowscreen, I was surprised to find my phone call to Da Hydro answered so promptly. They are obviously spending a lot of money hiring all those poor folk who sit on the phone, waiting for all-too-frequent protests from Shetland. The tone of the lady on the other end suggested that she had been inundated by irate couch-tatties demanding to know what I wanted to know: why the power was off; when would it be on again; when the next temporary service outage would be; and whether we got a refund.
<P>
As usual, the unfortunate lady in Perth, or wherever, had not the slightest idea. She was just a buffer between me and the Big Cats I really wanted to tear limb from limb. <I>Their</I> numbers are all now ex-directory. Someone had sent her on an expensive course where psychologists train them not to lose the rag with incandescent customers whose computers, mobile phones, clock-radio-alarms, washing machines and central heating pumps have just gone bump in the night. 
<P>
I explained that the problem was they <I>didn't</I> give us the power. They charged us quite a lot for a service which was now farcical. I asked her to convey to her superiors my full and frank opinion of their abilities. In return for my telling her my postcode (that's because they don't actually know where Shetland is, let alone Bressay), she agreed to take my phone number. She would call me back 'when the power was re-connected'. She would <I>what</I>? My brain went numb. The line went dead.
<P>
The last time the power had tripped, and it wasn't long ago, I dialled Scottish Hydro's 0345 number and was greeted by an Essex voice: 'Fank you for callin' Thames Worter. This is Cheryl. 'Ow can I 'elp you?' OK, I may have punched the wrong number. It was dark and I was furious. But Cheryl's question was not as silly as it seemed. After all, the privatised utilities are all trying to become one-stop shops, flogging us electricity, gas, water, phone connections and, for all I know, optic-fibre pizzas. So, in an ideal, free-market world, like wot Mrs Fatcher used to go on abaht in Essex, there is no theoretical reason why Thames Water should not compete with Da Hydro for our business. Maybe they really could help me.
<P>
Cheryl and I had a good giggle about that, not least when we discussed the logistics and likely response times if they tried to send a repair crew of plumbers and sparkies from Thurrock to Bressay in the middle of a November storm. I liked Cheryl's style and promised to buy her an alco-pop if our Escort Xri's ever crossed. This was <I>before</I> the Budget, you understand. 
<P>
Cheryl's not her real name, of course. She would be fired if identified as the employee who frankly agreed with me that privatisation was a disaster, the utilities should be re-nationalised without compensation, and the MPs who voted for resetting the public's assets should be imprisoned without electricity or limit of time, in the Tower of London, preferably in chains and denied slopping-out facilities. Their friends would, of course, be allowed to bring them food and buckets, as long as they paid the warders a percentage. We are not unmerciful in the Bressay Independent Labour Party. Vengeful, Old Testament, very cross, yes. But never unmerciful.
<P>
In the past six weeks I have canvassed this policy among long-suffering workers in British Telecom, British Airways, British Petroleum and even Da Hydro. Not one opposed it outright, although I did get a couple of cautious 'no comments' from people who knew I wrote for <I>The Orcadian</I>.  Most agreed that, as the parliamentary bills for privatisation were passed by the party whip system, this amounted to suborning Members of Parliament - which, as even Essex Woman knows, is against some ancient law wot 'as never bin repealed. Or didn't orter a bin, anyway. The legislation thus bulldozed through the Hice of Cummings in 17 years under a political army of occupation was therefore null and void.
<P>
I don't yet know what my tartan-trewed friend, Hope Vere Anderson, thinks about this. We have only just met and are getting along famously. I don't want to spoil our promising relationship by raising such controversial matters, not until we are on 'No, no, it's <B>my </B>round!' terms, anyway. 
<P>
If That Lot do get back in, I may need someone to give me a reference when Sir John Feet-Robertson takes the golden goodbye from NoSWA, after all. But I must tell Hope, in all faith and charity, that if he wants preferment for himself (let alone for me) he must stop telling reporters, as prospective parliamentary candidate in the Unionist interest, that his own Conservative Chancellor of the Exchequer is a numpty and didn't orter have doubled the air passenger duty and hiked the tax on Bressay boatmen's diesel.
<P>
This is going to be a <I>very</I> interesting election. Hope Vere Anderson is a true original and will go far, probably as far as Fair Isle, where they very sensibly have their own electricity system. We need more candidates like Hope, people who will tell it like it is and tell the party whips where to stuff their spin-doctored evasions and cynical sophistries. 
<P>
Meanwhile, I have acquired a generator, to ensure that I remain on-line to report the hustings. It's Japanese, needless to say. Well, someone has to <I>make</I> things, now that we don't any more. And very wonderful it is too, if almost as noisy as the Bressay Junior Club. Da Hydro may have run out of excuses about the wrong kind of birds hitting their power lines but, as long as privatised BP Grangemouth keep sending up those one-gallon cans of lead-free by first class post (the only possible explanation for the price they charge), I shall no longer run out of juice. I am forwarding the invoice for the generator to Da Hydro, with a copy to Thames Water.
<P>
What's that? First class post is indefinitely delayed because the Flying Skip only has one door to load cargo? Heavens to Betsy! Privatise Brutish Ridiculous Airlines of the Isle of Man at once! 
<P>
It's privatised <I>already</I>? That's the problem? Oh, I see.
<P>
As my P&O chum (the Scott who's still speaking to me) said, not a couple of power cuts ago: 'If you've time to spare, travel by air.'
<P>
It was some hours into the latest power cut, by the way, before I realised I was still wearing the apron I had donned to help with the mincemeat pies. It's a rather fetching little number, sold by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, and features the colourful signal flags used for routine comunication by mariners, and indeed everyone else, in the days before Edison, Marconi, the Wright Brothers and James Logie Baird. I have only just noticed that the code flag for the letter M for Mike (Forsyth?) is identical to the Scottish Saltire. 
<P>
According to the RNLI apron, confirmed by my copy of (Gordon?) <I>Brown's Signal Reminder</I> - which I really must return to my former employers, the Commissioners of Northern Lights, some day soon - Scotland's national ensign also means: 'My vessel is stopped and making no way through the water'.
<P>
They can say that again. 
<P>
A very Happy Christmas Blackout to you all...
<P>

<STRONG>My journal, kept at ye Manse of Stobister, Breezey Isle, Zetland.  ye 28th day of October, yr. of our Lord 1796.</STRONG>
</I>
<br clear=all>

<P>
<P>
Young Grinnyskull and Dicka Nastigirth called by this morning with a missive under the hand of Grim Story Esq., limner and engraver at Lerook. It bore the legend 'Most Urgent and Confidential' but I had perforce to wait some hours before opening it, while my visitors sat in the parlour tasting the latest consignment of claret, new brought on the 'Shark' from the port of Ardwell in Galloway, and discoursing at length on matters parochial.
<P>
When at last they rose and departed, opining that the vintage was 'ower weel', I retreated to my study where, with trembling hands, I opened Mr Story's communication. It read as follows:
<P>
'Respected and reverend Sire,
<P>
'I have the honour to inform you of a most remarkable circumstance concerning the character and conduct of your former friend, Cap'n Bob Wellshot of Sharniefield, in the town of Lerook. As you will recall, Cap'n Wellshot was some years past entrusted with the management of 'Ye Zetland Intelligencer', and the emoluments therefrom, after a lengthy selection procedure involving minute examination of the register of births.
<P>
'All went well for a time, until Cap'n Wellshot refused a request by his scribes for higher wages. He not unreasonably maintained that all available funds were required for the construction and fitting out of his new barque, the 'Peyroise', whereupon the disgruntled hands enrolled in a combination and threatened to withdraw their labour. At this, Cap'n Wellshot flew into a passion and placed an announcement in the publick prints at Edinburgh, soliciting inquiries from suitably qualified artisans to replace the malcontents.
<P>
'Cap'n Wellshot had some time before engaged as editor of his organ a down-at-heel blackguard, that repellent radical, Dr Witney Garlick. Dr Garlick, being on friendly terms with the mutineers, took it upon himself to intervene and persuaded the ringleaders to accept of Cap'n Wellshot's handsome offer of a farthing a day. He then presented himself at his employer's chambers, anticipating congratulations, and intimated that he would be pleased to agree to a similar augmentation of his own salary.
<P>
'The proprietor astonished Garlick by upbraiding him in the presence of a common journeyman printer, refused his request and roared that Garlick must sign new indentures which would permit Cap'n Wellshot to write the weekly commentaries on publick affairs himself. This the editor refused, whereupon he was threatened with physical violence, peremptorily dismissed the service of Ye Zetland Intelligencer and ejected from the portals of Castle Sharniefield, with Cap'n Wellshot's intemperate imprecations raining about his head.
<P>
'Dr Garlick, as you well remember, thereupon closeted himself in your cellar with sundry sympathetic Writers to the Signet and subsequently sued Cap'n Wellshot at law, the upshot of which was that Cap'n Wellshot was so horrified when he heard what Dr Garlick proposed to tell the tribunal, that he promptly settled the case out of court for a sum equivalent to a year's wages, and appointed a relative, Mistress Trout, in the good doctor's stead.
<P>
'The money was soon drunk and for some years Garlick eked out a pitiful existence, retailing tittle-tattle to the cheaper sort of penny sheets upon the continent of Scotland but, about a twelvemonth past, he commenced in business with the undersigned. I had, as you may have heard, devised an ingenious method of evanescent publishing, employing a lanthron of exceptional brilliance, a complicated arrangement of prisms, an abacus, seventeen yards of stout twine and several distorting mirrors (manufactured by a Mr Fresnel). With this apparatus we were able to project the image of a page of writing upon walls at a great distance, and soon began daily transmissions of intelligences both local and national.
<P>
'My reason for engaging Dr Garlick was that, notwithstanding his loathsome personal habits, execrable political opinions and notorious, irreligious character, I found him an indefatigable scribbler, willing to work long hours in a damp cellar for small reward. 
<P>
'We had considerable success with our 'Evanescent Zetlander and Daily Advertiser for Ye County of Zetland and Many Other Parts Forebye' and soon gentlemen of quality were favouring us with commissions to compose announcements extolling the virtues of their goods and services to the publick. 
<P>
'This came to the attention of Cap'n Wellshot, who had for years nurtured a simmering resentment over Dr Garlick's success against him at law. Cap'n Wellshot being well furnished with manservants, scullery wenches and specie, he determined to gain a monopoly of this new science and ordered an underling to construct an evanescent publishing apparatus superior to mine own, regardless of expense. This task the underling performed to the best of his abilities but, the hapless youth being but a novice in the art, the resulting contraption was deficient in almost every particular.
<P>
'What was the more aggravating was that, every time Cap'n Wellshot selected a suitable wall for a-projecting of his own intelligences and announcements (for no customers had favoured him with theirs), he found his publick distracted by a parallel and simultaneous, but infinitely more entertaining, display from my apparatus. His roars of outrage could, it is reliably reported, be heard in the Isle of Breezey with a favourable wind.
<P>
'When he discovered that my evanescent publishing machine was able (by bending the light from his own emissions through a superior prism) to project images of 'Ye Zetland Intelligencer' upon my chosen wall, dyke, window pane or even wooden panelling, thus augmenting considerably the pitiably small audience he had secured for his business, his wrath and wounded pride knew no bounds. He engaged lawyers at vast expense to pursue Dr Garlick and me at the Lawting, and obtained injunctions preventing us from intercepting his transmissions - or even utilizing the same walls.
<P>
'The lawyers at first cautioned him against such a proceeding (knowing full well that the law of copy writing could not encompass evanescent publishing) but, seeing him determined upon it and that he was willing to make them even richer men than they already were, did his bidding.
<P>
'The result, Respected Sire, is that you are joined in the lawsuit as a co-conspirator of Dr Garlick, and liable to lose all your goods and chattels along with him, even if Cap'n Wellshot's plea should fail, as it most certainly will. For the expenses of lawyers are such that many good families have thus been ruined and brought low by cynical and vindictive litigation, leaving the legally vanquished as monetary victors.
<P>
'The purpose of my communication is to advise you most urgently of your peril, and to offer, gratis, the services of my barber and wig-maker, should you wish to alter your appearance and flee the countrey of Zetland, as I heartily exhort you to do. Dr Garlick has already shaved off his 30-year growth of beard and looks 50 years older, now that the ravages of time and dissipation are revealed to his horrified contemporaries - who know him not. He and I sail on the morrow's evening tide for another jurisdiction, where we and our apparatus shall be free from the legal threats lying over us, and free also to continue our business with impunity. I pray you shall accompany us, for your temporal salvation and the rescue of your honour from obloquy. 
<P>
'I have the honour to remain, as ever, Your obedient servant and solicitous co-religionist,
<P>
<img src="/pics/mark.gif" align=left>
<br clear=all>
<I>(Grim Story, His Mark)'</I>
<P>
This extraordinary epistle hath left me quite dis-commoded. I know not what to do, but the omnipotent wrath of Cap'n Wellshot strikes fear into my heart and I am now almost decided to take ship with Mr Story and his accomplice. I shall sleep upon the matter and meantime instruct my housekeeper to pack my trunks.
<P>
<I>(<B>Editor's note:</B> At this point the journal becomes indecipherable, owing to copious maroon-coloured stains which laboratory analysis has recently shown to be a mixture of human blood and a claret of 1795 vintage, from the Bordeaux region of France. A singular curiosity is a crude stamp across the manuscript, evidently of later date, which says 'Copyright and Personal Property of Captain Robert Wellshot, Master of All He Surveys'.  There is also a suspicious tear through several pages of the journal, which appears to have been made by the point of a dagger or kitchen knife. A further report on the forensic tests will appear in a future edition of The Ken Speckle Papers.)

Manse of Stobister, Breezey Isle, Zetland.  ye 15th day of September, yr. of our Lord 1796
<BR>

<P>
<STRONG>Unto the Hon'ble. Sir Michael Firspyte PC, Lord High Keeper of the Great Seal of Scotland, at the Castle of Edinburgh:</STRONG>
</I>
<br clear=all>

<P>

Respected Sire,

<P>
Your esteemed favour of the 23rd June, requesting further intelligences concerning the state of society and morals in this archipelago, reached me only this day by Dicka Nastigirth's hand. He apologised profusely for the tardiness of delivery, explaining that the master of Mr Pino's sailing packet had been uncertain whether to continue carrying His Majesty's mails, in view of the recent controversy anent the Government bounties upon the sail packet trade betwixt Zetland and the continent of Scotland.
<P>
There is much to report. I shall endeavour fully to acquaint you with the situation, employing my customary brevity of expression.
<P>
There hath lately been a great revolution in the Zetland Commission of Supply, Canon Shand having been ousted by a junto of Sir Jas. Bloob, Lady Eastings and Commissioners Wullamandra Whitret, Magnus Defects and Grotty Redlen. Canon Shand continues to wear the fineries of office and to preside, nominally, at publick sessions of the Commissioners, but his writ runs no longer.
<P>
The occasion of the coup d'etat was the signing of a new covenant with the British Peat Oil Company. Canon Shand weakly protested the document, whining that it amounted to unconditional capitulation to the demands of this enterprising company of adventurers.
<P>
This cavilling Sir Jas. silenced with the immortal words: 'Nivirduleetboy. Dirgottenwis biddabaasan doolchoost haytasignit. Hayta, man! Hayta! Anmi chobsatstekk, furbye.'
<P>
It was, however, the decisive intervention of that great benefactor of mankind, Mr Black Mekkie, which convinced the remaining doubters of the wisdom and propriety of agreeing terms: 'Boogasuv gorrusbeatlads. Amnotblurry Eeanclark. Kupper dirrisbest, burrit worrunt goorenuff.'
<P>
At this, Canon Shand fled the chamber with a wild shriek. He was later heard sobbing at the offices of Mistress Waddermary, the Town Crier, where he made a poor fist of explaining the Solemn Vod bargain to the assembled multitude, rioting in protest beneath the balcony. Some of the impertinent, ungrateful wretches - boors from the island of Whalesahoy - thereupon took a handsaw and attempted to cut through the timbers supporting what remained of the Canon's civic dignity.
<P>
As Commissioner Whitret observed that same evening, when conversing with some gentlemen from the City of London, lately come north to explain the state of the Commissioners' finances to the cashier Thews: 'It seems to be the amends which nature makes to those whom she has not blessed with an elevation of mind, to indulge them in the comfortable mistake, that all is wrong which falls not within the narrow limits of their own comprehensions and relish.'
<P>
At the next meeting of the Commissioners, Mr Thews had doleful tidings. The Treasury was bare, notwithstanding the pact with British Peat and the Shalloot Corporation. Immediate economies were imperative.
<P>
Stilling the feeble murmurings of such few Commissioners as presumed to question the veracity of Mr Thews' statement, and uninterrupted by the stoical Inspector of Schools, Mr Hakkie Rollover MA (who bore his customary glazed countenance, the while humming leisurely to himself), Sir Jas. Bloob outlined his prospectus for restoring thrift to the countrey of Zetland:
<P>
<i>Item First:</i> The parochial schools in the remoter districts to be suppressed forthwith, there having been numerous complaints from masters of quarries and manufactories, that the schools had tended much to corrupt their servants, by teaching them to read and write; that they would be more obedient and dutiful, were they more ignorant and had no education.
<P>
At this, the venerable Commissioner Billsmitten ventured a halting protest: 'The institution of parochial schools is to the honour, as well as the utility of Zetland,' he said, whereupon several of those present feigned drowsiness. 'It shows the wisdom and patriotism of our ancestors in a high degree,' he continued, to the sound of snoring from the benches opposite. 'At these necessary and useful little seminaries of literary knowledge, established in every parish, many have received the first principles of literature and religious knowledge, who have become ornaments to their country, and blessings to mankind.'
<P>
Sir Jas. ignored this interjection and gave the floor to Lady Eastings: 'Might not the schoolmasters also keep the side post offices, where only a runner is requisite?' she inquired. 'The opportunity of the scholars would be yet very useful in sending intimation of letters lying at the office to persons who do not regularly call at the office, thus saving the inordinate expense of a postmaster.'
<P>
Commissioner Whitret indicated that he wished to assist Lady Eastings in her quest for economies: 'Dukeens, whinnayewissabairn, deymeddwis takkapaet ta'a skule wiwirrsletts, anmimidderwiswint tamakka draaerfooa gruel apo da Sabbath nicht fur wir wikksdenners. Kinweeno sevvtwaatree penniesdatwye?'
<P>
Sir Jas. beamed benevolently upon the stout-hearted, well-intentioned representative of the landed interest from Solemn Vod: 'Ayedootitill takkmairasdat,' he said, and proceeded with his prescription for frugality.
<P>
<i>Item Second:</i> Instant suspension of the disgraceful practice, but lately intimated to Mr Thews as a result of his diligent inquiries among carters and packmen, of conveying able-bodied scholars to school at the publick expense.
<P>
At this, there were cries of: 'Fie! For shame!' 'This is a scandal!' and 'Naebdytellwis abootdat, Chim!' The assembly thereupon spontaneously voted a unanimous resolution of approbation for this proposal (Commissioner Slimbo having absented himself briefly from the chamber to answer the call of Nature).
<P>
<i>Item Third:</i> Disposal of the Poor's Dwellings, for a trifling consideration, to the Adolph Rachman Provident Society for the Relief of Distress in Congested Districts, this having been advocated by no less a person than the Hon'ble. Sir Michael Firspyte, a personal friend of Mr Rachman.
<P>
This was likewise approved, Mr Slimbo not having returned from the privy offices. Mr Defects then vouchsafed the opinion that, as the outer islands were now so sparsely inhabited, it might answer the Treasury's needs if they were to relieve the publick of the expense of ferries to those remote districts, their crews being the most unmannerly and importunate gang of over-remunerated rascals it had ever been his misfortune to encounter.
<P>
Sir Jas. cordially thanked Mr Defects for his contribution: 'Magniedatwis daverraneeist tingapomilist!' quoth he.
<P>
Commissioner Youngjock, the Master of Keldabister, could take no more of this: 'I say, dat's a frightfully bad show, du keens, Chim!' he said. 'Du personally assured me afore dis convocation commenced dat du jolly well widna vent dy prejudices on my constituents in Breezey, what?'
<P>
Sir Jas. retorted: 'Dirnaeneedo pankin,'
<P>
'I beg dy pardon?' said Keldabister.
<P>
'Knappin airsfurst,' Sir Jas. snapped and, with a well-aimed gavel at Commissioner Hendrasdochter, moved next business.
<P>
At this point Mr Smeeg slid into the chamber, wearing hose and doublet several sizes too large for him, and whispered into Mr Black Mekkie's ear. Mr Black Mekkie then rasped inaudibly into Sir Jas. Bloob's sinistral aural appendage.
<P>
'Bairns, bairns, wullhayta gitootahere, whick! Dirfan dryrottida riffoda toonhoose!' Sir Jas. exclaimed, leading the stampede for the marble staircase.
<P>
The next item on the agenda was thus not reached but it behoves me to inform you of it, nonetheless. It was a motion in the name of Mr Black Mekkie himself, ordering the expenditure of 13,100 pounds Scots for consultant gentlemen to advise on how best to fit up and expedite a testimonial dinner for Mr Thews, who had detected, amongst his clerks and serving wenches, the unmistakable signs of moral turpitude, lascivious conduct and excessive indulgence in tea, snuff, laudanum and hallucinatory fungi.
<P>
The public spirited and indefatigable Mr Thews (according to an unpublished encomium in my possession, drafted by Mr Black Mekkie's man of business, Mr Yawn Risible) had unhesitatingly penned a missive to all his subordinates, instructing them to report instantly to him any suspicions of improper or immoral conduct by their fellows, on pain of dismissal.
<P>
Furthermore, upon word of this memorandum reaching the publick prints, Mr Thews had interrogated in his cellar an underling suspected of betraying, to Dr Witney Garlick's semaphore scandal sheet, 'Ye Daily Zetlander', the existence of this confidential communication. The said underling, notwithstanding membership of an illegal combination or 'union', had broken down and confessed, immediately upon being shown 'the instruments'.
<P>
If any further intelligences should reach me, dear sir, fear not that I shall lose no time in communicating same to you, via the good offices of Dicka Nastigirth and his runner, Young Grinnyskull.
<P>
I remain, with the utmost respect and my compliments to the Great Seal,
<P>
Your humble servant in Christ,
<P>
(Kenneth Speckle BD (failed), Edin.)
<P>
<i>Post scriptum: I am obliged to you for the remittance which, I greatly fear, is excessively handsome remuneration for such small services as I am able to perform for you and His Majesty.

<P>
<STRONG>24TH AUG.-13TH SEPT. - JANE COX MARTIN
</STRONG><BR>
Jane studied at Salisbury College of Art and, during 30 years, has painted in Scotland and Shetland, England and France. Formerly living in Hillswick, she now lives with her husband at Walls.
<P>
<STRONG>DOD DOW- 'Same Old Rock'
</STRONG><BR>
This is Dod's third show in the Museum gallery, as Shetland continues to inspire his work. Several of his watercolours depict older dwellings, crofts and outbuildings, and the unchanging, unyielding aspect of the landscape. Others feature boats and harbours, with the ever-present sea and sky.
<P>
<STRONG>14TH SEPT.-4TH OCT. - JENNA & LIZZA HUME
</STRONG><BR>
Jenna's work is based largely on the ever-changing landscape of Westray, her home island. The sea is an important source of ideas for her work, providing a sense of continuity with the past yet a feeling of impermanence and change. Lizza combines knitted pieces and other media to serve as a record of her experiences of life on an island. The colours found in the flotsam and jetsam of the beach have influenced the natural faded shades which are present in her work.
<P>
<STRONG>5TH-25TH OCTOBER - RAB MILLER & MICK DONLEAVY
</STRONG><BR>
Rab is showing another set of mood paintings and some sculptures, capturing the essence of today's varied cultures and styles. Mick's first ever exhibition is inspired by the wildlife and scenery in Shetland. He also experiments in different media, and has an interest in body art.
<P>
<STRONG>26TH OCT.-15TH NOV. - ANITA COUTTS
</STRONG><BR>
Anita, whose past work has been mainly colourful, surreal work, brings together a range of Shetland watercolour paintings of people and places from the past.
<P>
<STRONG>SHONA ANDERSON
</STRONG><BR>
Shona has lived in Reawick all her life, and trained as a model painter before taking up a placement at Bonhoga Gallery. She has been painting for the last few years, mostly in finely-detailed watercolours of animals.
<P>
<STRONG>16TH NOV.-6TH DEC. - PETER BRUCE
</STRONG><BR>
Peter plans to exhibit mainly Shetland, Scottish and, possibly, New Zealand watercolour landscapes, plus some figure paintings.
<P>
<STRONG>SOUTH MAINLAND ART GROUP
</STRONG><BR>
This is the second exhibition by the Group, formed in 1992. The group provides opportunities for members to learn through the experience of others. This exhibition will show the wide variety of styles and subjects produced by members throughout the year.
<P>
<STRONG>7TH-31ST DEC. - STEPHEN GORDON
</STRONG><BR>
Born and brought up in Lerwick, Stephen started drawing cartoons under the name 'Smirk' while at University. For over 15 years he has contributed to the Shetland Times cartoons of both a political and general satirical nature. This exhibition, mostly in watercolours, offers an insight into some of his more 'serious' work.
<P>
<STRONG>SUSAN TIMMINS
</STRONG><BR>
Susan will be showing a series of black and white photographs which will reflect her long-time preoccupation with emigration and its effects on subsequent generations.

<P>(The writer runs a small business in Shetland and survived the Braer) 

<UL>
<P><LI>1 <STRONG>Keep</STRONG> a very detailed daily diary of the spill as it affects your business. Note down ALL the hours you spend dealing with things connected with the spill - and what you would normally have been doing. 
<P><LI>2 <STRONG>Look after</STRONG> your customers. You will need them after all this is over. Send them daily bulletins explaining honestly what is happening to your business and why. 
<P><LI>3 <STRONG>Do NOT sign</STRONG> anything, particularly from the polluters or their insurers. NEVER take their advice. Get your own independent advisers. 
<P><LI>4 <STRONG>Remember</STRONG> - you are rightfully claiming what has been taken from you. It's the POLLUTER'S duty to make you whole again. He wants evidence, so write down every expense the spill has caused. 
<P><LI>5 <STRONG>YOU</STRONG> are in the right. Stick together with your business friends and your trade or professional association. If you fall out, only the polluter will benefit. 
<P><LI>6 <STRONG>Look after</STRONG> your staff. They will have compensation claims too. If you have to lay them off, tell them in writing why, so they can use it in evidence to support their claims. 
<P><LI>7 <STRONG>Ask</STRONG> your customers to fax you their reasons if they cancel orders. This is VERY important. 
<P><LI>8 <STRONG>Never</STRONG> make unsubstantiated compensation claims. 
<P><LI>9 <STRONG>Remember</STRONG> - this has happened before. You are not alone. In Brittany, Alaska, Spain and Shetland you have thousands of friends you haven't met yet. They can and WILL help you.

Captain George Sutherland will tell Shetland Islands Council's marine  committee next week that shipping minister Lord Goschen 'has no  intention of positioning a salvage tug in the Fair Isle area this  winter', despite a Government report recommending an emergency towing  vessel for the south Shetland coastline where the tanker 'Braer'  drifted ashore almost four years ago.
<P>
In papers for the meeting, published yesterday (THURS) Capt.  Sutherland reports that the council has support from Orkney Islands  Council, local MP Jim Wallace and the shipping trade press. He  recommends councillors should 'maintain pressure through enlisting  wider political support and continuing with media exposure where possible'. 
<P>
He also wants to pursue the matter through the European Union and  with the leaders of other councils in the Highlands and Islands.
<P>
Council convener Lewis Smith has already written to Lord Goschen  expressing 'grave concern' at the lack of action following a report  by Captain Chris Belton RN, who came down in favour of a  two-million-pounds-a-year salvage tug to cover the Fair Isle Channel  during the winter months.
<P>
Lord Goschen recently replied, saying he had 'favourable reports' of  'trials' with such vessels in the Dover Straits, the South-Western  Approaches and the Minch. But he said the risk of accidents was lower  in Shetland because 'marine traffic is comparatively light'.
<P>
'Harbour tugs can also provide some cover and offshore supply vessels  with towing capabilities do operate in the area,' the minister said.
<P>
'Emergency towing vessels are not a cheap solution to the problem of  vessels in difficulty and we can only embark on such major, long-term  expenditure when we are fully convinced that they will give the  taxpayer good value for money,' he concluded.
<P>
Capt. Sutherland says the minister has 'misplaced faith' in the  capacity of harbour tugs in severe weather and in suitable tugs which  may just happen to be passing when there is an incident.
<P>
A similar campaign is running in Orkney, where marine director  Captain Bob Sclater strongly backs Capt. Sutherland's arguments but  says the Pentland Firth is even more dangerous than the Fair Isle  Channel, with stronger tides and more tanker traffic, and needs an  emergency towing vessel of its own. 
<P>
Capt. Sclater points out that the number of large vessels using the  Pentland Firth will increase next year when shuttle tankers start  hauling 50,000 tonne oil cargoes to the Flotta terminal from the new  Foinaven oilfield.
<P>
Emergency towing vessels were stationed in Prince William Sound,  Alaska, following the 'Exxon Valdez' disaster in 1989, and in  Cornwall after the 'Sea Empress' pollution earlier this year.

<P>
The largest cruise liner to call at Shetland this year spent yesterday (WED) in Lerwick Harbour.
<P>
P&O's 44,000 tonne 'Royal Princess' was on passage from Rosyth to Iceland.
<P>
The big visitor was the 30th liner in what harbour officials believe will be a record season.
<P>
Lerwick already welcomes more cruise passengers than any other Scottish port. With fishing and oil-related trade in the doldrums, the harbour trust is running a publicity campaign to attract more tourist business to the picturesque port.

26th July 1996
<P>
A young Peterhead fisherman risked his life in a vain attempt to save a drowning shipmate off Shetland early yesterday (THURS) morning.
<P>
The trawler 'Sharona' was hauling nets 47 miles south-east of Sumburgh Head when crewman John Main, 58, fell overboard around midnight.
<P>
Twenty-one year old Gordon Strachan dived in to help him but Mr Main, of Ugie Road, Peterhead, appeared to be dead before the rest of the crew could pull him and Mr Strachan out of the water.
<P>
Within 40 minutes of the accident, Shetland Coastguard's rescue helicopter 'Oscar Charlie' was on the scene with a doctor on board. Both men were winched up and flown to hospital in Lerwick, where Mr Main was pronounced dead.
<P>
Mr Strachan was later released from hospital into the care of the Lerwick Fishermen's Mission, who arranged his travel home to Mallard Drive, Peterhead. 
<P>
It is understood that Mr Main, the ship's cook, was sitting on the rail when he was struck by the trawl cod end and knocked over the side.
<P>
Mr Strachan was unhurt. Although 'very shaken and numbed', he spared the victim's family the distress of having to identify the body, by going with police to the Lerwick mortuary to do it himself.
<P>
Fishermen's Mission Superintendent Cliff Powell said: 'He's a very brave young man.'
<P>
The 'Sharona' meanwhile headed for Peterhead, where she was expected to dock last night.

26th July 1996
<P>
The Liberian tanker which spilled oil in Sullom Voe on Tuesday was due to sail for a repair yard last night (THURS), without her 120,000 tonne cargo of North Sea crude.
<P>
Council harbour officials and oil terminal operators BP ordered the 135,000 tonne 'Eurus' to empty cargo tanks and leave the port after divers failed to locate the source of the leak of up to three tonnes of oil.
<P>
Depute port director Jim Dickson said it appeared to be 'a pinhole' which had only leaked under pressure when the tanker was loading. The 'Eurus' was 'perfectly safe' to sail.
<P>
He said the ship's classification society - responsible for providing certificates of seaworthiness - would be informed of the incident.
<P>
The pollution was sprayed with dispersants and cleaned up by wave and propeller action.

24th July 1996
<P>
Scots Secretary Michael Forsyth's new price controls on sea freights to the Northern Isles, and the restoration of subsidy for bulk cargoes, were greeted with delight in Shetland last night (TUES).
<P>
Councillor Magnus Flaws, chairman of Shetland Islands Council's transport committee, said on local radio: 'We're very happy indeed. We made reasoned arguments and the Scottish Office seems to have listened to them.'
<P>
He welcomed the price ceilings, announced by Mr Forsyth in a Commons written answer: 'This does away with the monopoly position people were worried about,' Mr Flaws said.
<P>
He was particularly pleased with the guarantee that, whichever company won the contract to run the 'lifeline' passenger/cargo service between Lerwick and Aberdeen, they would have to carry livestock during the peak autumn shipping season.
<P>
The increased subsidy on livestock exports, from 33 per cent up to 50 per cent of freight costs, was 'a benefit to us, and a good one', he said.
<P>
The council was delighted the way was now open for a privately owned shipping company to secure European funding for building new ships on the route. P&O Scottish Ferries' two Shetland ferries are both over 25 years old.
<P>
There was also relief that the Government rejected the idea of running the Aberdeen-Lerwick service with only one ship: 'It's all good news for Shetland,' said Mr Flaws, a member of the Shetland Movement party campaigning for more home rule in the islands.
<P>
P&O Scottish ferries managing director Terry Cairns said he had not yet studied Mr Forsyth's statement in detail but it appeared to contain 'no problems' for the company.
<P>
P&O are currently bidding to retain the Government-subsidised ferry services to Orkney and Shetland, under a tendering process started by Mr Forsyth's predecessor, Ian Lang MP.
<P>
The Scots Secretary made his statement in response to a report on ferries by the Scottish Affairs Committee, which took evidence in Shetland last winter.
<P>
'The Government's overriding priority remains the need to ensure the viability of the lifeline passenger services to Orkney and Shetland,' Mr Forsyth said.

24th July 1996
<P>
Government arguments against compulsory insurance for ships are 'nonsensical', according to Shetland Islands Council's marine director, Captain George Sutherland.
<P>
For three years the council has been urging shipping ministers to make all vessels carry insurance in British waters, so that there is someone to pay up if a ship runs aground and spills oil.
<P>
In papers published yesterday (TUES) for next week's council policy committee, an exasperated Capt. Sutherland makes an outspoken attack on the Government, accusing ministers of 'procrastination' over three years.  He says a consultation document sent out last month shows the Government is 'reluctant to make continued trading conditional on holding appropriate insurance'.
<P>
'This is clearly wholly unsatisfactory,' he tells councillors, noting that the council is still 1.5 million pounds out of pocket for helping to clear up the mess after the 'Braer' tanker wreck. The Government itself had costs of 600,000 pounds after an uninsured Russian fish factory ship, the 'Borodinsky Polye', foundered near Lerwick in late 1993.
<P>
The Department of Transport argues that insurers cannot be compelled to provide cover: 'In extreme market conditions business operations might be placed beyond the law by a requirement to be insured,' the consultation paper says. 
<P>
Compulsory insurance could 'distort the working of a free market' and put insurers under 'moral pressure' to cover 'commercially unsound' risks, civil servants believe.
<P>
Capt Sutherland's scathing reply is that this is 'nonsensical' and unworkable.  If shipowners cannot afford to insure hulls, machinery and cargoes, they should not be in business, he says.
<P>
He also advises councillors to press for a national contingency plan to deal with oil spills and formalise who is responsible for what. He rejects Government pleas for 'voluntary agreements' to carry out 'non-statutory, implicit duties' after spills.
<P>
'For so long as the Government fails to require compulsory insurance for all vessels in UK waters, local authorities and harbour authorities dare not commit themselves to unconditional agreements,' he says.
<P>
Capt. Sutherland says he was 'surprised' the council was left off the Government's list of organisations to be consulted, but recommends they  send a strongly worded letter to the Transport Department.

21st June 1996
<P>
The Scottish Liberal Democrat leader, Jim Wallace MP, last night 
[THUR] renewed his plea for the Government to station a salvage tug 
in his Orkney and Shetland constituency.
<P>
For the third year running since the tanker 'Braer' drifted 
helplessly onto rocks in Shetland in 1993, Mr Wallace said harbour 
tugs at the Sullom Voe and Flotta oil terminals were 'not really 
adequate' to help a disabled tanker in the open sea.
<P>
He welcomed shipping minister Lord Goschen's decision to pay for a 
tug off Wales and Cornwall this winter, in addition to those 
stationed at Dover and Stornoway, but said: 'This only underlines the 
need for a similar salvage tug ... around Orkney and Shetland.'
<P>
He assumed the two tugs already in place had proved their worth but, 
in view of a recent tanker incident in the Minches after the 
Stornoway tug's winter contract had ended, he urged the minister to 
look at all-year-round salvage cover.
<P>
In a letter to Lord Goschen, he said: 'I appreciate that any 
additional cover does cost money, but surely the experience of the 
'Braer' and the 'Sea Empress' highlights just how much it costs NOT 
to have adequate precautions in place.'

28th March 1996
<P>
A Norwegian tanker suffered an engine failure while leaving the Sullom Voe oil terminal last month, it was revealed yesterday (Wednesday).
<P>
A report to Shetland Islands Council's marine committee said the engine of the tanker 'Prospekt' failed on February 24 as she was leaving Jetty One in the council-controlled port.
<P>
After the ship was brought alongside again, engineers found the problem was a faulty governor. The ship was repaired and allowed to sail, council officials said.
<P>
Two other incidents involving tankers last month are detailed in the report, published yesterday. 
<P>
A Liberian tanker, the 'Knock Sheen' had too much oxygen in her tanks - a potential fire risk - and was sent out to sea again on February 28, until inert gas levels were restored.
<P>
Inspection of the Bahamian tanker 'Singa Star' on February 19 showed an instrument on the bridge was not working properly.
<P>
Both ships subsequently loaded their cargoes and sailed without any more trouble.
<P>
Council policy is to publish even minor incidents involving tankers at Sullom Voe, partly as a deterrent to sub-standard ships.

Despairing of the Government paying for a salvage tug to help tankers  that get into trouble around Shetland, the islands' marine director  is calling for a wider political campaign.
<P>
Captain George Sutherland will tell Shetland Islands Council's marine  committee next week that shipping minister Lord Goschen 'has no  intention of positioning a salvage tug in the Fair Isle area this  winter', despite a Government report recommending an emergency towing  vessel for the south Shetland coastline where the tanker 'Braer'  drifted ashore almost four years ago.
<P>
In papers for the meeting, published yesterday (THURS) Capt.  Sutherland reports that the council has support from Orkney Islands  Council, local MP Jim Wallace and the shipping trade press. He  recommends councillors should 'maintain pressure through enlisting  wider political support and continuing with media exposure where possible'. 
<P>
He also wants to pursue the matter through the European Union and  with the leaders of other councils in the Highlands and Islands.
<P>
Council convener Lewis Smith has already written to Lord Goschen  expressing 'grave concern' at the lack of action following a report  by Captain Chris Belton RN, who came down in favour of a  two-million-pounds-a-year salvage tug to cover the Fair Isle Channel  during the winter months.
<P>
Lord Goschen recently replied, saying he had 'favourable reports' of  'trials' with such vessels in the Dover Straits, the South-Western  Approaches and the Minch. But he said the risk of accidents was lower  in Shetland because 'marine traffic is comparatively light'.
<P>
'Harbour tugs can also provide some cover and offshore supply vessels  with towing capabilities do operate in the area,' the minister said.
<P>
'Emergency towing vessels are not a cheap solution to the problem of  vessels in difficulty and we can only embark on such major, long-term  expenditure when we are fully convinced that they will give the  taxpayer good value for money,' he concluded.
<P>
Capt. Sutherland says the minister has 'misplaced faith' in the  capacity of harbour tugs in severe weather and in suitable tugs which  may just happen to be passing when there is an incident.
<P>
A similar campaign is running in Orkney, where marine director  Captain Bob Sclater strongly backs Capt. Sutherland's arguments but  says the Pentland Firth is even more dangerous than the Fair Isle  Channel, with stronger tides and more tanker traffic, and needs an  emergency towing vessel of its own. 
<P>
Capt. Sclater points out that the number of large vessels using the  Pentland Firth will increase next year when shuttle tankers start  hauling 50,000 tonne oil cargoes to the Flotta terminal from the new  Foinaven oilfield.
<P>
Emergency towing vessels were stationed in Prince William Sound,  Alaska, following the 'Exxon Valdez' disaster in 1989, and in  Cornwall after the 'Sea Empress' pollution earlier this year.

<P>
A Shell helicopter last night (THURS) flew an injured Portuguese  seaman to hospital in Lerwick after a fall on a supply ship 100 miles  north-east of Shetland.
<P>
The un-named casualty suffered a broken wrist and bruising in the  accident aboard the 'Stirling Clyde', alongside the Brent Delta oil  platform, a Shell spokesman said. 
<P>
A doctor from the 'Safe Gothia' accommodation rig flew to the ship  and gave first aid before taking the patient back to the rig. A Bell  212 chopper later transferred him to the Gilbert Bain Hospital,  landing just before 11pm.

7th November 1996
<P><A HREF="crash4.jpg"><IMG SRC="crash4s.jpg" ALIGN=left WIDTH=270 HEIGHT=130 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=5></A>
A report by accident investigators into the Shetland air ambulance  crash six months ago says better runway lighting is needed at  Tingwall Airstrip, where the Loganair plane was trying to land at  night in crosswinds gusting to gale force.
<P>
The cause of the crash may not be known until after a Fatal Accident  Inquiry in February.
<P>
The accident bulletin, from the Air Accidents Investigation Branch  (AAIB) of the Department of Transport, says the pilot was effectively  flying 'blind' and could not see the airfield lights as he banked the  plane in a tight turn on his second attempt to land. He had earlier  overshot because of the crosswind.
<P>
The airstrip owners, Shetland Islands Council, say they are  discussing improvements with the Civil Aviation Authority, while  Loganair have already imposed new wind, visibility and height limits  on night-flying by pilots with less than a year's experience of the  Shetland airstrips.
<P>
The pilot, Capt. Alan Young (37) died instantly when the  Britten-Norman Islander plane hit the ground at 125 knots, a mile  short of the Tingwall runway, at 11.36pm on May 19 this year. He had  been based in Shetland for nine months and was married with two young children.
<P>
A doctor on board was seriously injured. His life was saved by the  only other passenger, a nurse who escaped with minor injuries. They  were returning to their base at Lerwick's Gilbert Bain Hospital after  a 200-mile mercy flight taking a patient to Raigmore Hospital, Inverness.
<P>
The report, published yesterday (WED), finds the twin-engined plane  was fully certificated, properly maintained and airworthy, with all  systems functioning normally at the moment of impact. The position of  the controls suggested Capt. Young was trying to gain height when he crashed.
<P>
Captain Young was a fully licensed pilot with over 3,800 hours'  flying experience, including eight night landings at Tingwall in the  previous six months. Because of a 'miscalculation', his medical  certificate had expired 19 days before the fatal flight, technically  invalidating his radio licence, but he had made an appointment for  his medical during the week of the accident. Loganair have since  improved their record-keeping to make sure this cannot happen again,  the report says.
<P>
The post-mortem produced no evidence of medical problems which could  have affected Capt. Young's performance on the night of the crash. He  was 15 minutes over his permitted duty hours for the day but this was  within the limits of 'discretion'.
<P>
<CENTER><B>Cause still unknown</B></CENTER>
<P>
The bulletin does not blame Capt. Young or establish the cause of the  accident but implies that he may have become disoriented by the lack  of ground lights in the narrow valley where he had to turn the plane  to line up for the final approach to the runway.
<P><A HREF="crash7.jpg"><IMG SRC="crash7s.jpg" ALIGN=right WIDTH=252 HEIGHT=172 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=5></A>
The weather at the time was marginal, with a strong easterly wind  gusting to 37 knots, low cloud and rain. The airstrip lies a mile  north end of the narrow part of the Tingwall valley, where violent  wind squalls are common in strong crosswinds blowing over the  surrounding hills. 
<P>
Shetland Islands Council's transport director, Joe Gray, said  yesterday (WED): 'Discussions have already begun with the Civil  Aviatin Authority about the suggestion for additional lighting. There  is no criticism of the existing system, which is tested and checked  by the CAA regularly. It's a suggestion we can consider. It's not an  urgent thing.'
<P>
Transport committee chairman Magnus Flaws said: 'It's obvious that  the airport has been run to the entire satisfaction of the CAA, up to  this tragic accident. It was up to full standards.' He promised the  council would consider what more needed to be done as soon as possible.
<P>
Last night (WED) Dr Gerald Freshwater, who almost died of severe  crush injuries in the crash, said: 'It would be improper of me to say  anything that might prejudice the Fatal Accident Inquiry, or to  second-guess the comments of the AAIB inspector, still less to upset  Mrs Young further. It was a tragic occurrence and I hope that people  will remember that Captain Young lost his life in the service of others.'
<P>
Dr Freshwater (47), who is still recovering from his injuries, said:  'We must do whatever it takes to make sure there continues to be an  air ambulance here. We will always need specialist care which cannot  be provided at our local hospital, excellent as it is.'
<P>
Nurse Maureen Polson (27), who found herself still strapped in her  seat at the rear, after the tail section of the aircraft flipped over  the rest of the wreckage, was sway from Shetland yesterday (WED) and  could not be contacted for comment on the AAIB report.
<P>
<CENTER><B>Loganair were last to see report </B></CENTER>
<P>
Although the council and Dr Freshwater have had a draft copy of the  report for some weeks, Loganair managing director Scott Grier said he  first saw it in a fax from the BBC radio station in Shetland  yesterday (WED) morning.
<P>
'The bulletin has not tried to speculate on the cause of the accident  and certainly has not established the cause,' he said. 'I'm pleased  the report does not criticise the pilot or the company. We've been  flying in the islands since the late 1960s and we're continually  reviewing our procedures to make sure our operations are as safe as possible.' 
<P>
Mr Grier said he would be talking to the council about the runway  lighting recommendation, which 'made some sense' to him. 'Anything we  can do, we'll follow through,' he pledged.

<P><A HREF="anchors.jpg"><IMG SRC="anchorss.jpg" ALIGN=left WIDTH=252 HEIGHT=144 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=5></A>
BP's production ship for the new Foinaven oilfield was preparing to  leave the shelter of the Shetland coast last night (WED) to hook up to ten  35-tonne anchors 100 miles offshore.
<P>
A company spokesman in Aberdeen said a last-minute snag with a steel  drum on one of the anchor handling tugs accompanying the 'Petrojarl  Foinaven' was not expected to delay the massive operation, due to  begin today (THURS).
<P>
BP denied dockside rumours that the trouble was on board the  production ship itself.
<P>
Lerwick Harbour has been busy with the big tugs over the past few  days as BP prepared to take advantage of an expected 'weather window'  after gales which set up heavy seas earlier in the week.
<P>
The 200-million-barrels Foinaven field lies in the deepest and  roughest water ever drilled in UK waters to produce oil. The  'fast-track' development has been dogged by technical problems and  labour disputes in the Spanish shipyard which converted the former  Russian ship into a 'Floating Oil Production, Storage and Offloading'  vessel, or FPSO.
<P>
First oil production is scheduled for March next year, 14 months  later than the original target, but the development is still expected  to set a record the time between discovering and bringing on stream a  major oilfield.
<P>
The 'Petrojarl Foinaven' will load 60,000-tonne shuttle tankers in  the open ocean. The field is due to be pumping 85,000 barrels a day  by 1998, with an estimated production life of up to 17 years.

7th November 1996
<P>
A Shetland trawler under tow by the Aith lifeboat last night (WED)  managed to clear a net fouling her propeller in rough seas 20 miles  out in the Atlantic.
<P>
Six hours into the tow, the 110-foot-long 'Santos' reported that she  was able to continue unaided to the port of Scalloway.
<P>
Lifeboatmen in the west Shetland village of Aith had put to sea  shortly before noon, after the four-man crew of the trawler radioed for help.
<P>
Last night (WED) the weary lifeboatmen were punching into a strong  north-easterly wind on their way back to base, as the 'Santos' headed  for harbour to check for damage.

Shetland retailers who sell portable electricity generators reported  good business yesterday (WED) after the first snowfalls of the winter.
<P><A HREF="snow1.jpg"><IMG SRC="snow1s.jpg" ALIGN=right WIDTH=216 HEIGHT=111 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=5></A>
Demand for 'gennies' was brisk at Thulecraft Ltd of Lerwick as  manager John Watt found customers looking to insure themselves  against the chaos of last winter's power cuts.
<P>
The Shetland News editorial department in Bressay is one of the local  firms installing its own standby generator, after the frustrating  experience of more than 20 power cuts this year.
<P>
After Tuesday's perfect, calm evening for Guy Fawkes Night bonfires  and fireworks, wet snow and sleet showers brought icy roads to  sheltered districts by yesterday morning and a white mantle for the  highest point of Shetland, Ronas Hill (450m). 
<P>
A brief north-easterly gale blew further wintry showers over the  islands during the day and forecasters say we are in for a chilly week.

<P>
Norwegian research to make plankton grow faster, by putting  artificial fertilisers into the sea, is 'dangerous nonsense'  according to the international local authorities' environmental  organisation, <A HREF="http://www.zetnet.co.uk/coms/kimo/">KIMO</A>.
<P>
Speaking in Lerwick yesterday (TUES), after KIMO's sixth annual  conference in Orkney, KIMO secretary Rick Nickerson said the European  Union should immediately halt funding for the project.
<P>
The 40 councillors at the meeting unanimously condemned experiments  by the multi-national  Norwegian company Norsk Hydro to fertilise the sea with nitrates, the  chemicals which cause pollution problems in shallow coastal waters  when rain washes them out of farmers' fields into rivers.
<P>
Mr Nickerson said there could be 'disastrous' effects on life in the  oceans if the 'Maricult' experiment got out of hand.
<P>
'Once these substances are put into the sea there would be no way of  controlling their effects,' he said. 'Councillors also agreed it was  ludicrous that the European Commission should  financially support this project when it was asking local authorities  all over Europe to spend billions on sewage treatment plants - to  reduce nitrate inputs into the sea and meet EU directives on water  quality and urban waste water regulations.
<P>
'The newly-launched European research programme Maricult is a joint  scientific and industrial effort consisting of several projects,' he  explained. 'Norsk Hydro has initiated and will support Maricult which  is to run for five years. Scientists from Norwegian and German  research institutes are involved and the European Community is said  to have provided financial assistance through its marine research programme.'
<P>
Scientists have described Maricult as programme aiming at a better  understanding of how plankton growth relates to nutrients in the sea.  Norsk Hydro say the research will study the effects of adding  nutrients, along with biological ways of making the sea more  productive. They believe artificial fertilisation could increase  harvests of seafood to help make up for an expected world shortage of  food protein.
<P>
Mr Nickerson said: 'For the very first time, the ultimate goal of  marine scientists is to  release substances in large quantities into the oceans. If these  experiments are successful, they see their experiments as a precursor  to large scale ocean fertilisation.'
<P>
If it did prove possible to increase fish stocks by dumping nitrates  and other fertilisers into the sea, he said there were 'serious  questions' about the effects, which could reduce the variety of sea  life, interfere with Nature's food web, reduce oxygen levels and lead  to damaging blooms of marine algae. 
<P>
KIMO called on the European Commission to think again about the whole  project and make sure it would have no harmful effects.

5th November 1996
<P><A HREF="antares.jpg"><IMG SRC="antaress.jpg" ALIGN=right WIDTH=252 HEIGHT=137 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=5></A>
A nine million pounds super-trawler pulled into Lerwick Harbour on  her maiden voyage from Norway yesterday (MON), altering course so the  proud skipper could show off his latest command to nurses and doctors  at Shetland's hospital.
<P>
Skipper Laurence Irvine (50), a father of five, is one of eight  shareholders in the 12-man crew of the 1,762 tonne 'Antares'. His  24-year-old son, Laurence Junior, is a crewman.
<P>
The boat handled well in a gale on the 200-mile crossing from the  builder's yard in Flekkefjord, West Norway, where she was launched  last week by the skipper's wife, Irene. 
<P>
After calling briefly at his home port of Symbister in the isle of  Whalsay, Mr Irvine made a detour on the way to Lerwick to load gear  and stores, taking the 211-foot-long steel-hulled vessel in by the  south entrance at Breiwick, where staff at the Gilbert Bain Hospital  could have a better view.
<P>
'I was in the hospital after I was taken seriously ill last year and  they looked after me very well,' he said. 'I promised them then I'd  give them a first look at the new boat.'
<P>
The project was financed by the sale of the old 185-foot purser  'Antares' (formerly the 'Radiant Star'), a loan from the Clydesdale  Bank in Lerwick and a nine per cent shipbuilder's subsidy from the  Norwegian Government. 
<P>
Asked if it was a risky investment at a time of reduced catch quotas  and uncertainty in the industry, Mr Irvine said: 'We always invest  everything we earn back in the boat. I never worry at nights about  it. You either have to move with the times or get left so far astern  you can't catch up.'
<P>
The 'Antares' is the third ship of her class built for Whalsay crews  in the past year. Islanders are currently investing over 30 million  pounds in their fleet and another new boat is due from Norway in  three weeks' time.
<P>
The crew plan to fish for herring, mackerel and other pelagic fish up  to 500 miles from home, on grounds from the west of Ireland to the  Arctic Circle.  
<P>
<CENTER><B>The fourth of the line</B></CENTER>
<P>
Skipper Irvine's first berth when he left school at 15 was with his  father on the old wooden seine-netter 'Zephyr', just 66 feet long.   Their first 'Antares' was an 86-foot purse-netter built by Forbes of  Sandhaven in 1975. 
<P>
She had the same eight shareholders as the latest, fourth, 'Antares'.  The stable partnership has been one of the successful and innovative  in an island noted for its dogged commitment to the fishing through  lean times and fat alike.
<P>
In 1978 they built their first steel ship, a 106-footer from another  yard in Flekkefjord, followed in 1985 by the purchase of the 'Radiant  Star', re-named the third 'Antares', which they lengthened to 185  feet the following year.
<P>
The new vessel is a marvel of hi-tech. Fitted with enormously  powerful winches, she handles a net worth over 100,000 pounds,  'flying' it like a kite under water on steel hawsers. The 'Antares'  can fish just above the bottom in the deep waters of the open  Atlantic, or near the surface  when pursuing shoals on the shallower  banks of the continental shelf around Shetland. 
<P>
The latest full-colour sonar on the luxuriously-appointed bridgetells  the fishing master how many fish there are, what species and how deep  they are swimming. Once on board, refrigerated seawater tanks and a  quick-freeze plant keep the catch in prime condition for market.
<P>
Satellite phones, faxes and e-mail keep the 'Antares' in constant  touch with her agents, LHD of Lerwick, and help the skipper make the  all-important decision on which market to head for to get the best price.
<P>
'With the speed of this boat and the ability to freeze the fish down  in two hours, rather than 24, we can reach markets in Scandinavia or  Britain to land the product in the best condition for the best  price,' Mr Irvine said.
<P>
<CENTER><B>'We're no Hoover' </B></CENTER>
<P>
He indignantly denied environmentalists' claims that the trend to  bigger and more efficient boats is 'hoovering up' the shoals and  destroying the sea's ecology:
<P>
'We actually have less fish to catch on the quota than with the old  boat,' he said. 'Europe has cut the mackerel quota by 30 per cent and  the herring by half. But the price of mackerel has shot up from 115  pounds a tonne to around 600, so we'll probably land less fish but  hopefully make more money.
<P>
'We're not hoovering the sea. We'll only we working full out when  we're catching species like horse mackerel and blue whiting, where  there are no catch quotas.'  
<P>
The 'Antares' is a handsome, massively-built ship, powered by a 2,800  kilowatt Wartsila diesel engine and designed to take the worst the  north-east Atlantic can throw at her. Which is just as well, because  the winter fishing for large 'Atlanto-Scandian' herring will take her  hundreds of miles into stormy Arctic waters between Iceland and  northern Norway.
<P>
Mr Irvine has never considered taking a less stressful job on shore:  'I'm not cut out for anything else,' he said. 'This boat is something  we've worked for all our lives. There's always doom and gloom in the  fishing  and I can't say it's a piece of cake but the main  uncertainty is if they keep cutting the herring and mackerel quotas.  As it stands now, I think we can scrape through. If they cut it more  we'll certainly be in trouble.'
<P>
He points out that the 'Antares' is a purely commercial venture, with  no public money involved. They did inquire about assistance from  Shetland Islands Council and were offered it, but found they could  get a slightly better interest rate from the bank.
<P>
Mr Irvine would not speculate on what size of boat the partnership  might go for next: 'The next stage is to try and pay for this one,'  he smiled, and turned to his desk to deal with a pile of official  paperwork from the Departments of Transport and Fisheries.
<P>
At this moment an electronics engineer popped his head in the door of  the skipper's cabin with a last-minute snagging list. He wanted to  know which of the crew cabins had the faulty TV set. 'I don't know.  You'd better check them all,' said Mr Irvine, as the rest of the crew  worked in a gale and rain on deck to load gear in time for fishing  trials, due to start on Thursday.
<P>

BP's new oil production ship, designed to withstand the worst waves in the world had to seek shelter last night (Monday) just three days after arriving on station at the Foinaven oilfield west of Shetland.
<P>
Operation manager Leslie Thomson said the 'Petrojarl Foinaven' would be sheltering on the west side of the islands until the weather eased enough to start hooking up the ship to 10 huge anchors, already laid in 1,400 feet of water, 100 miles from land.
<P>
Mr Thomson said it was an unexpected opportunity for islanders to see the ship which otherwise would have remained out of sight over the horizon for all of her working life.
<P>
When anchored, BP say the ship can ride out hurricane force winds and seas 100 feet high.
<P>
Last night the wind was force 8 gusting 9, at the Lerwick Coastguard station.

5th November 1996
<P>
TV reception in Shetland was blacked out last night (TUES) for the  second time in three days when a Hydro Electric transformer blew up  on the island of Bressay.
<P>
Bressay Councillor Tavish Scott (Liberal Democrat) said: 'This is not  good enough. I want an explanation from the Hydro and an assurance  that they're doing everything possible to make sure this doesn't happen again.'
<P>
On Friday night a power cut blacked out Bressay and the main BBC and  ITV transmitters on the island's Ward Hill for over three hours.
<P>
Last Christmas parts of Shetland were without power for five days  after a blizzard brought down power lines but last night's weather,  although bad, was not exceptional by Shetland standards.
<P>
As high winds and rain swept over Bressay (pop. 370) one angry  islander said: 'This is a joke. I want compensation. What's it going  to be like when the real winter weather starts?'
<P>
Power was restored after three hours.

3rd November 1996
<P>
A new phase of offshore oil development began at the weekend, in wild 
seas 100 miles out in the Atlantic west of Shetland.
<P>
BP's giant oil production ship 'Petrojarl Foinaven' arrived on 
station at the Foinaven oilfield, Britain's first 'Atlantic Frontier' 
development, at 9.30am on Saturday after a 1,130 mile journey from a 
shipyard in Spain.
<P>
The 'floater' will be held in position by 10 anchors in 1,400 feet of 
water on the edge of the continental shelf. During the winter BP plan 
to connect the 'Floating Production, Storage and Offloading facility' 
(FPSO) to flexible hoses which will bring the oil up from 
remotely-controlled seabed wellheads and manifolds into the 95,000 
barrels capacity tanks on board. 
<P>
Production is due to begin in the spring, using 60,000 tonne 
'shuttle' tankers which will moor astern of the 'Petrojarl Foinaven' 
and ship the oil to the Flotta terminal in Scapa Flow, Orkney. 
Foinaven has estimated reserves of over 200 million barrels.  Gas 
from the field will power turbines on board the FPSO or be 
re-injected to maintain pressure in the oil wells.
<P>
The project, originally described as a pioneering 'fast-track'  development, has been delayed a year by technical problems, design  changes and strikes in the shipyard where the former Soviet submarine  tender was lengthened and converted. 
<P>
The Foinaven oilfield lies under some of the roughest water in the  north-east Atlantic. The area can experience freak waves when storms  conflict with upwellings of the North Atlantic Drift current. Large  ships have been damaged by such waves but BP believe their new  floater, swivelling to face the wind and waves, can cope with the  worst the West Shetland weather can throw at it.
<P>
They say the technology of loading tankers offshore has already been  tried and tested in exposed locations in the northern North Sea,  where winter weather is almost as bad. 
<P>
After islanders voiced worries about potential pollution, the company  set up a consultative committee on environmental concerns and  produced an 83-page 'Environmental Impact Assessment' and a  five-volume oilspill contingency plan - designed to cope with any oil  which may reach the shore. Fishermen and fish farmers in the islands  are being trained to use floating booms and skimmers, to contain and  retrieve spilled oil, but BP spokesmen insist the risks of pollution  are low and spills are likely to be very small.
<P>
The company has steadfastly refused to hold a public meeting in  Orkney or Shetland to debate the environmental issues, preferring  'one-on-one' contact with the public at 'roadshows' which have  visited the islands twice.
<P>
<CENTER><B>A second bonanza in prospect?</B></CENTER>


<P>
Foinaven is the first of several fields being developed in an area  believed to contain almost half the UK's known oil reserves. Many of  the finds lie in water so deep that conventional production platforms  and submarine pipelines are not practicable. But there is speculation  that the giant Clair field, in shallower water just 40 miles west of  Shetland, may require a new pipeline to the Sullom Voe oil terminal  in the early years of the 21st century, bringing the islands a second  oil bonanza.
<P>
With the price of oil high and continuing unrest in the Middle East,  the pressure is on to solve the technical problems of producing oil  from the 'challenging' environment west of Shetland. Reserves in this  politically stable, free market area are doubly valuable when  companies reflect that only about six per cent of the world's oil  provinces are free from state ownership and control.
<P>

3rd November 1996
<P>
A Fraserburgh fishing boat with seven crew on board made it safely  into port  this morning (SUN) after the Shetland Coastguard  helicopter helped prevent a sinking.
<P>
The trawler 'Utility' (FR 393) radioed for help late on Saturday  night when she sprang a leak in her engine room, 70 miles south of  Sumburgh Head, Shetland.
<P>
After the helicopter Oscar Charlie lowered two mobile pumps to the  boat just before midnight, the crew managed to bring the flooding  under control and headed for Fraserburgh.

2nd November 1996
<P>
The freeze on spending by Shetland's cash-rich charitable trust is  likely to end late next year, after trustees heard yesterday (FRI)  they had 8.1 million pounds of unspent revenue.
<P>
The trust, run by all 26 Shetland councillors and two independent  trustees, has been funded by Shetland's oil revenues over the past 20  years and now has total assets worth over 203 million pounds, 17 per  cent more than a year ago.
<P>
After setting aside funds to maintain the real value of the trust and  refurbish buildings, plus 15 per cent for 'contingencies', the  trustees still have 13.9 million pounds available next year,  according to a budget strategy report approved yesterday. But they  only plan to spend 5.8 million pounds of it.
<P>
Trust chairman Bill Manson said he felt 'disappointment and  frustration' that the council of which he is a member could not move  faster to resolve its own financial difficulties.
<P>
This 'inhibited the trust from making immediate full use of its  resources,' he said. The financial future was 'little clearer' than  it had been a year ago.
<P>
The trust's policy is only to accept spending bids previously  approved by Shetland Islands Council. For the past two years the  council has refused to agree any 'new bids'. The council, which fears  its general fund is running into an 'unsustainable' deficit, is  trying to save five million pounds a year by 2000 AD. 
<P>
Council convener Lewis Smith said after the trust meeting in Lerwick:  'During the next financial year, if the council gets its financial  situation under control, then as far as I'm concerned the council can  start making new bids to the trust.'
<P>
Mr Smith said a long-delayed care centre for elderly people in Unst  (pop. 900), Britain's most northerly inhabited island, was 'the priority'.
<P>
One reason for prudence has been uncertainty about oil revenues but a  new deal with the oil companies was signed this summer to ensure the  future of the Sullom Voe tanker terminal. 
<P>
The council also has a problem with a 60 million pounds housing debt  run up in the 1970s when thousands oil workers flooded into the  islands. Negotiations are continuing with the Government to write off  the debt, but are complicated because the money is mostly owed to  private finance houses, not to the Public Works Loan Board, and a  write-off would thus affect the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement.
<P>
Independent trustee John Scott, who is also Shetland's Lord  Lieutenant, told the meeting he objected to consideration of a report  which discussed the council's housing debt. 'This is nothing to do  with the trust,' he said. 'It is council business. These are totally  separate bodies.' Mr Scott's motion to defer the report until the  'inconsistencies' were sorted out failed to find a seconder among the  councillors around the table, who included his own son, Tavish Scott.
<P>
Mr Manson said later: 'I don't think there's any trustee who doesn't  want to spend this money. If the council takes too long to make a  decision (on new bids) then we'll have to have a serious debate about  our future policy.' He would not comment on the suggestion that the  trust might start accepting bids from outside bodies , without  reference to the council.
<P>
Candidates for helping to spend the eight million pounds surplus  include: a leisure centre at the village of Aith, for the rural areas  of the West Mainland of Shetland; a project to develop the music  industry in Shetland; and some 'non-statutory' education items, such  as extra school music tuition and nursery education. Observers  believe this could partly solve the current budget crisis in the  education department, which has called in consultants to help it save money.

2nd November 1006
<P>
A Church of Scotland old folks' home in Shetland was saved from  closure at the second attempt yesterday (FRI), when the Shetland  Islands Council Charitable Trust approved a capital grant of up to  882,000 pounds. 
<P>
The deal to reprieve the Walter & Joan Gray Eventide Home in the  village of Scalloway faltered six weeks ago when so many councillor  trustees were away on official business that trust chairman Bill  Manson could not get a quorum.
<P>
Yesterday there was a better turnout and the grant went through on  the nod. Councillors had earlier agreed that, because it helped  continue an existing service, the project would not violate their  policy of making no new bids to the charitable trust meantime.
<P>
The grant, including VAT, will pay half the costs of rebuilding the  home but retaining the attractive facade of the 19th century building  on the Scalloway waterfront.
<P>
The council will provide up to 138,000 pounds a year towards running costs.
<P>
Council social work director Bill Bennett had earlier said there were  'compelling financial reasons' to agree the Kirk's request. It would  have cost the council 1.7 million pounds to provide a similar home  for the 10 residents and 10 day-care clients.
<P>
The Kirk had said it would have to close the home because it could  not afford to lose 119,000 pounds a year running it.
<P>

2nd November 1996
<P>
It is now a lot safer to have a heart attack in one of Britain's more  remote islands.
<P>
Helped by a 50 per cent grant from the British Heart Foundation, the  1,000 residents of the Shetland island of Yell have bought a 5,600  pounds defibrillator machine for their local ambulance.
<P><A HREF="mcdonnell.jpg"><IMG SRC="mcdonnells.jpg" ALIGN=left WIDTH=144 HEIGHT=204 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=5></A>
Defibrillators are used to 'jump start' heart attack victims and  monitor their condition while the ambulance is on the way to  hospital, saving precious time when the patient arrives at casualty -  in this case 30 miles and a ferry crossing away from Yell.
<P>
Dr Mike McDonnell, the island's GP, says the new equipment fills a  gap in emergency care: 'Now you can choose to have your heart attack  on Yell, knowing you'll be no worse off than those in the rest of  Scotland,' he said yesterday (FRI), after the defibrillator was  formally presented to the local ambulance.
<P><A HREF="defib.jpg"><IMG SRC="defibs.jpg" ALIGN=right WIDTH=216 HEIGHT=152 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=5></A>
The Scottish Ambulance Service in Shetland has assisted with training  and modified the Yell ambulance to accommodate the new equipment.
<P>
Dr McDonnell said the 'paradox' in the past had been that the further  a patient was from hospital, the less the chance of access to a defibrillator. 
<P>
'The Scottish Ambulance Service Trust has declined to provide  defibrillators to the ambulances based in the remoter areas because  of the problems of ensuring training for contractors, who are not  directly employed by the trust,' Dr McDonnell said.
<P>
'The odd ones out ... are those living in the remoter areas of  Scotland who are served by contracted-out ambulances, often based at  local garages and manned by local bus drivers or car hirers.'
<P>
Health boards in the Highlands and Islands were attempting to tackle  the problem and seeking assistance from the British Heart Foundation. 
<P>
'Frustrated by delays in supplying essential equipment, our own  remote, rural community has already solved its own problems,' the doctor said.
<P>
In Yell the islanders have set up a Health Centre Support Group which  provides equipment such as nebulisers for those with asthma, blood  testing kits for diabetes sufferers and physiotherapy equipment for home use. 
<P>

2nd November 1996
<P>
(Don't panic - this is what's in the printed version. We're not  allowed to look at the online edition or refer you to it)
<P>
The paper leads with more details of the controversy over council  chief executive Malcolm Green's purchase of 25,000 pounds' worth of  anti-surveillance equipment for Lerwick Town Hall.
<P>
Other stories include:
<P>
* Increasing evidence that Shell will keep Unst airport open as a  diversion for offshore helicopter flights, saving several of the jobs  lost when Chevron pulled out;
<P>
* A computer error at the Co-op Superstore in Lerwick which delayed  up to four weeks in charging Switch-card holders for their groceries  - with annoying and embarrassing results;
<P>
* Shetland Oil Industries Group is sending a delegation to the  Falkland Islands, where offshore oil exploration is hotting up;
<P>
* BP's new 'floater' - the 'Petrojarl Foinaven' production, storage  and loading ship - is on her way from a Spanish shipyard at last,  bound for the new oilfield 100 miles west of Shetland.
<P>
What's not in this week's Shetland Times (in either the print or, so  we're told, the electronic edition):
<P>
*  Many letters from readers complaining about The Shetland Times'  legal action against The Shetland News;
<P>
*  Any mention of the fact that The Shetland Times has not accepted a  peace offer from The Shetland News;
<P>
*  Any mention of the links to Shetland Times pages being made by  websites all over the world. Will there be many other court actions? We  think we should be told.

31st October 1996
<P>
Fourteen children on the west side of Shetland are staying home from  school as parents protest about a new school bus route.
<P>
The primary and secondary pupils from the crofting townships of Twatt  and Clousta did not return to school in the village of Aith this week  after the October break.
<P>
They stand at their former pick-up points each morning while the  school bus stops and waits for them a few hundred yards away. Three  minutes later, the bus drives on and the children go home.
<P>
Head teacher Glenda Moffat said today (THURS) the situation was  'regrettable' and 'unfortunate'. She said the parents had been to see  her and had stressed they were not deliberately keeping their  children home from school.
<P>
'They say they've still not been officially informed that the  arrangements have been changed,' she said.
<P>
This morning White's Coaches manager John White, who recently won the  contract in competition with a relative of one of the parents, said  he was meeting the terms of his contract with Shetland Islands Council.
<P>
'I told the parents about the new arrangements the day before the new  term started,' he said.
<P>
'I'm using a bigger bus than the former operator and bairns like it  because it's better than being crammed three to a seat in a minibus.  This tender was awarded on the basis that we would stop at the main  road pick-up points and I'm doing just that.
<P>
'I regret any inconvenience to the pupils who have to walk a little  further but the maximum extra distance is only 600 yards.'
<P>
Parent Janet Davidge said she was worried about road safety at the  point where Mr White now stops to collect the pupils: 'They have to  walk diagonally across the crossroads. There are blind corners and no  verges on the side roads. 
<P>
'It's the Wild West out here,' she said. 'In winter we have violent  gales, heavy rain and snow. The weather is absolutely hellish and  five-year-olds are expected to walk through it. By the end of  November it'll be pitch dark at that time of morning.
<P>
'We just want the bus to come the same way as before,' Mrs Davidge  said. 'We phoned the council and they said they hadn't changed the  route. We don't know who to believe any more.'
<P>
Education director Jim Halcrow backed Mr White: 'He's meeting the  terms of the contract. It's the responsibility of parents to make  sure their children go to school. We're providing transport for them  to do so. If they choose not to use it, parents must make their own  arrangements.'
<P>
He said the Clousta to Aith route was unaffected by the council's  recent decision to cut back on some school transport as an economy measure.
<P>
Today all of Aith School's pupils were kept at home - when a power  cut after a fault in a transformer blacked out the school.

1st November 1996
<P>
A Shetland councillor last night (Thursday) appealed to air travellers  to tell the council about their experiences under the new set-up  after British Airways withdrew from island air services.
<P>
Tavish Scott, vice-chairman of the Shetland Islands Council transport  committee, was speaking after a 'robust' meeting where senior staff  from British Regional Airlines and Loganair were given 'a hard time'  about concerns in Shetland, Orkney and the Western Isles.
<P>
'People are already finding it difficult to book flights to go away  at Christmas-time,' he said. 'You can't necessarily get the day you  want, nor the best fare.
<P>
'There's also a big concern that it's no longer possible for business  travellers to reach Edinburgh or Glasgow from Shetland in the  morning. The airlines admitted we had a cast-iron case and they're  going to have to look at it. They know fine this shouldn't have  happened,' he said.
<P>
Mr Scott also complained about timetabling confusion, saying staff at  Sumburgh Airport did not even have a timetable when he asked for one  on his way south to the meeting.
<P>
'The people from the airlines had a hard time. They haven't done a  great job communicating to any of the island groups and people regard  it as a <I>fait accompli</I>,' he said.
<P>
He said the public could help the council argue from 'facts rather  than anecdotes' by letting the transport department know the details  of their experiences, good and bad, with the new flight arrangements.

1st November 1996
<P>
Tourism in Shetland shows 'positive and solid' growth as the industry  claws back the trade lost by bad publicity after the Braer tanker  disaster, according to the islands' tourism director, Maurice Mullay.
<P>
Mr Mullay told the first annual meeting of the new <A HREF="http://www.shetland-tourism.co.uk/">Shetland Islands  Tourism</A> there was a seven per cent increase this year in inquiries  about holidays in Shetland.
<P>
'Members reports on the past season showed encouraging results,' he  said, particularly in the rural areas and offlying islands of  Shetland. 'Visitor numbers by air and sea have increased but fewer  yachts visited because of the bad weather this season. An increase in  cruise liner passengers  was a boost to local businesses.
<P>
'Whale watching was popular and the sightings attracted excellent  press reports,' Mr Mullay told the meeting. 'Our public relations operation   continued to give outstanding value, with media coverage valued at  hundreds of thousands of pounds.'
<P>
The meeting elected Peter Tulloch of Kirkhouse Chalets, Bixter, as  chairman of the new statutory tourism body, Shetland Islands Tourism.  Julie Jenner, who operates an award-winning bed & breakfast  establishment at Skellister, South Nesting, was appointed vice-chairman.
<P>
New directors joining the SIT board were Laurence Tulloch of Yell,  representing the North Isles, and Arthur Williamson, representing  Scalloway, Burra and Trondra.
<P>
Mrs Jenner paid tribute to the dedication and efforts of the  directors over the past year, and regret at losing Peter Guy who had  been a keen and enthusiastic chairman. Mr Guy left the islands last  month. Mrs Jenner also paid tribute to the hard work and long hours  worked by the tourist office's pleasant and efficient staff.

1st November 1996
<P><A HREF="ferry.jpg"><IMG SRC="ferrys.jpg" ALIGN=left WIDTH=234 HEIGHT=155 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=5></A>
Shetland's latest ferryboat was delivered at last yesterday (Thursday)  but it will be a while yet before the 'New Advance' is snug in her  specially-built home port on the island of Foula (pop. 50).
<P>
Around 40 local people and journalists greeted the 38-foot boat as  she chugged into the west Shetland port of Scalloway just before 10am  yesterday after an overnight voyage from the builders' yard in  Stromness, Orkney.
<P><A HREF="lewis.jpg"><IMG SRC="lewiss.jpg" ALIGN=right WIDTH=180 HEIGHT=238 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=5></A>

Welcoming the new arrival on behalf of Shetland Islands Council,  Convener Lewis Smith said: 'I'm absolutely delighted to see the boat  here at long last. It's been long awaited and very controversial. But  she is here now and she can be based in Foula.'
<P>
It is eight years since the council started planning the new pier and  ferry. The 'New Advance' is the second attempt. An earlier version  was rejected as unsuitable. The boats cost around 400,000 pounds each.
<P><A HREF="rope.jpg"><IMG SRC="ropes.jpg" ALIGN=left WIDTH=216 HEIGHT=154 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=5></A>
Mr Smith said it was 'a new beginning' for Foula: 'It gives the  island a tremendous advantage to have this ferry now. She's a very  good-looking and trim ship. I'm sure she'll do the job admirably.'
<P>
After three weeks of weather delays in bringing the boat north, Mr  Smith admitted that everyone concerned with the project had felt  'very tense' over the past few days.
<P><A HREF="detail.jpg"><IMG SRC="details.jpg" ALIGN=left WIDTH=180 HEIGHT=256 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=5></A>
The next problem is to find a skipper willing to live in Foula, after  Captain Allan Cook resigned earlier this year and left the island.
<P><A HREF="rob.jpg"><IMG SRC="robs.jpg" ALIGN=right WIDTH=180 HEIGHT=248 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=5></A>
Mr Smith said: 'The post has been advertised, and we hope that there  will be a skipper appointed as soon as this is practicably possible.
<P>
'The intention is that the New Advance should be based in Foula.  She's designed to be based in Foula and that is where she will be  when we have a skipper for her, and when minor alterations are made  to the lifting gear at the pier there.'
<P>
The new one million pounds harbour in Britain's most remote inhabited  island is unsafe in violent storms and the 'New Advance' will have to  be lifted out of the water.
<P>
The Orcadian who skippered the boat from Stromness to Scalloway,  Colin Garriock, was happy with the way she performed during the  14-hour crossing: 'No complaints at all', he said.

31st October 1996
<P>
Eight years after Shetland Islands Council started planning an  improved ferry service to the island of Foula, a purpose-built Foula  ferryboat was at last steaming north last night (WED).
<P>
The 400,000 pounds 'New Advance' left Richardson's boatyard in  Stromness, Orkney, hopefully bringing to a close a celebrated and  expensive saga of blunders and disappointments.
<P><A HREF="advance1.jpg"><IMG SRC="advance1s.jpg" ALIGN=left WIDTH=216 HEIGHT=161 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=5></A>
Prolonged gales over the past three weeks had prevented the boat  sailing for Shetland but last night Shetland Islands Council's marine  department confirmed she was on her way to her first port of call,  Scalloway Harbour, where the twin-engined, 38-foot fibreglass-hulled  vessel is due at nine this morning.
<P>
Last night the council's convener, Canon Lewis Smith, said he was  thinking of going to Scalloway to meet the new arrival: 'But I'm not  sure if it's bad luck for a minister to see her first,' he joked.  Canon Smith is Rector of St Magnus Episcopal Church in Lerwick.
<P>
The recent bad weather was not the first bad luck or delay for the  project. Four years ago the council rejected the 'Westering  Homewards', the first ferry built specially for the 18-mile exposed  crossing to Britain's most remote inhabited island. That boat, which  also cost 400,000 pounds, failed sea trials. After failing to find a  buyer, the council handed her over to Shetland's fisheries college as  a training vessel.
<P>
A new harbour, and a crane to lift the new ferry out of the water at  Foula, have brought the total bill for the project to almost two  million pounds. Around 50 people live on the island.
<P>
Last year a skipper was hired for the Foula ferry and a chalet was  shipped to the island for him to live in. But the boat was delayed  and, after disagreements with other islanders, Captain Allan Cook  left before ever taking command of his little ship. The council has  advertised for a new skipper willing to live in the island but has  not yet made an appointment.
<P>
Government regulations say the skipper and crew must possess full  professional qualifications, which until now have been in short  supply on Foula. A training programme has meant further expense for  the council. 
<P>
Council policy is to base the ferry in Foula. Councillor Jim Gear, a  Foula resident, insists that is the only way to provide a reliable  service, arguing that a Foula-based crew can more readily take  advantage of breaks in the weather to make the run to West Burrafirth  on the Shetland Mainland. 
<P>
A Foula base also means five part-time ferry jobs bringing cash into  the island.
<P>

31st October 1996
<P>
Shetland fishermen are going to the top today (THURS) to put their  case for drastic reform of Europe's common fisheries policy and to  protest against the proposed 40 per cent cut in the number of boats.
<P>
A delegation from the Shetland Fishermen's Association and Shetland  Islands Council spent yesterday preparing for today's high-level  meeting with European Fisheries Commissioner Emma Bonino.
<P><A HREF="goodlad.jpg"><IMG SRC="goodlads.jpg" ALIGN=right WIDTH=216 HEIGHT=241 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=5></A>
Association secretary John Goodlad said the session was 'a  first-class opportunity to put Shetland's concerns to the person who  is ultimately responsible'.
<P>
Mrs Bonino has aroused the wrath of Scottish fishermen with her 40  per cent proposal. The Shetland delegation will also explain to her  why they want 'early action' to control foreign, 'flagship' fishing  vessels - which fly the Red Ensign to get a share of Britain's fish  catch quotas.
<P>
Mr Goodlad, who was due to address the European Parliament yesterday,  said he would put the case for European funding to rebuild and  modernise the Shetland fleet. 
<P>
Backing up the fishermen's delegation are two Shetland councillors -  Loretta Hutchison from the fishing island of Whalsay and Drew Ratter,  chairman of the council's development committee.
<P>
Mr Ratter said in Brussels yesterday: 'We hope to bring home to Mrs  Bonino how very vulnerable Shetland and other remote fishing European  communities are to a 40 per cent cut in the fleet. We rely very  heavily on fishing and the proposed reduction is too high.'
<P>
In Tenerife last week a new European fisheries committee,  representing islands and coastal communities all around Europe, gave  Mr Ratter the go-ahead to lead the campaign for reform. 
<P>
'We have problems in common with places such as the Canary Islands  and we need a united front in lobbying European institutions and  committees,' Mr Ratter said. 'We agree there's a need for  conservation and reducing catching capacity for some fish stocks but  we want a complete reconsideration of the current proposals.'

A grey Soviet ghost from the Cold War lay at anchor off Lerwick,  Shetland, yesterday (WED), on her last voyage to the breaker's yard.
<P>
The 6,000 tonne 'Ugra' class ship 'Tobol', a former ammunition ship  for the Soviet submarine fleet, is under tow by the Russian tug  'Atriya' from Murmansk to Bombay, where she will be scrapped.
<P>
The tow parted off Norway last week in severe weather. The tug  skipper managed to re-connect with a temporary towline and told  Coastguards he wanted to shelter off Shetland while he made up a new  cable for the three-month, 16,500-mile passage to India.
<P>
The tug has visited Lerwick before, in 1992. The skipper told harbour  officials yesterday he expected to be under way again by the end of the week.

<P>
30th October 1996
<P>
Shetland Islands Council has spent 20,000 pounds on sweeping Lerwick  Town Hall for electronic bugs - allegedly at the request of the  Scottish Office.
<P>
But rumours that council bosses also eavesdrop on staff phone calls  are not true, a council leader said.
<P>
Vice-convener Jim Smith told the full council yesterday (TUES) the  anti-bugging devices were bought by chief executive Malcolm Green,  without councillors' knowledge. They cost 'around 20,000 pounds.
<P>
Mr Smith said it was essential to ensure secrecy when the council was  negotiating with the oil industry and Government representatives. 
<P>
Speaking on local BBC radio after the meeting, he said: 'They don't  want to be overheard ... and we've been asked by some of the Scottish  Office people to ensure that the place is what they call secure  before they actually come in and speak to us. And that's it. We just  have an anti-bugging device which tells us if anybody's planted  microphones or whatever.'
<P>
Last night the Scottish Office said they had no knowledge of anyone  asking the council to install anti-bugging devices.
<P>
Earlier, Mr Smith explained that there had been no need for Mr Green  to tell councillors about the equipment because he had 'delegated  authority' to deal with security at the Town Hall, which houses Mr  Green's offices and the council chamber, currently being refurbished.
<P>
Answering questions from Councillor Loretta Hutchison about alleged  covert surveillance, Mr Smith denied rumours that the council  monitored staff calls. They had a call-logging system, as many  organisations did, but no-one eavesdropped on phone conversations. To  record a single day's calls would use up 500 hours of tape, he said.
<P>
Mrs Hutchison said after the meeting that she had been tipped off  about the de-bugging gear by 'someone of standing' and had done a bit  of detective work herself before asking the question.
<P>
'I was very annoyed about having to ask such questions about the  council but I felt I had to do it,' she said.
<P>
Last night a spokesperson for the local government union, Unison,  said: 'We're very glad to have this assurance that staff calls are  never monitored.'
<P>
During the past two years Mr Green and his senior staff have been  involved in lengthy negotiations with BP, Shell and the Government  about the future of the Sullom Voe oil terminal. 
<P>
During the secret talks, senior council representatives were given  confidential briefings including private oil company information, Mr  Smith said.
<P>
A new deal to secure oil supplies for Sullom Voe was concluded in the  summer. It involves the council in the management of the plant, which  BP run on behalf of 30 oil companies. 
<P>
Mr Smith confirmed that talks were now going on behind closed doors  about the Shetland oil terminal's role, if and when large quantities  of oil and gas are produced from the new oilfields west of the islands.
<P>
The sums of money involved are huge. West Shetland is believed to  contain almost half of Britain's known oil reserves. Shetland Islands  Council's oil revenues, held in a charitable trust, are now worth  over 200 million pounds and the council stands to make further  millions out of land rents and possibly other fees if a new pipeline  is laid from the west side fields

30th October 1996
<P>
An attempt to stop the appointment of consultants to advise Shetland  Islands Council how to save 750,000 pounds a year on its inter-island  ferry services was heavily defeated yesterday (TUES).
<P>
Councillor Jim Gear said it was 'a nonsense' and 'not appropriate' to  hire consultants at a cost of up to 80,000 pounds, when the council  had the expertise itself and had already conducted a year-long  internal study which had showed how to save 'hundreds of thousands of  pounds'. He moved they reject the idea.
<P>
Councillor Lindsay Smith agreed, saying the decision to bring in  outsiders was making the council 'a laughing stock with the public'  but transport committee chairman Magnus Flaws said they needed 'new ideas'.
<P>
Former transport chairman Jim Irvine said he was 'shocked' when the  council ditched the internal review and went for outside consultants:  'It's just a cop-out,' he said.
<P>
Mr Flaws said the internal review had only come up with 'short-term'  economies and it had become clear to him that they could not make  progress on the 'pretty hard decisions' needed in the longer term. He  revealed that 10 companies have been asked to tender for the job.
<P>
Asking councillors to review the ferry service put them in 'an  impossible position' because of the conflict between the interests of  their island constituents and the council's need to save money: 'They  also have to live in these islands,' he said.
<P>
Councillor Leonard Groat said: 'Nobody should be afraid to let the  service come under scrutiny of outside consultants at any time'. 
<P>
Convener Lewis Smith said: 'We may even reject everything they tell  us. The council is not abdicating its responsibility. The decision  willbe made by councillors.'
<P>
After further debate, the full council voted 14-4 to proceed with the  consultancy exercise for ferries, which receive a subsidy of six  million pounds a year and have some of the cheapest fares in Britain.
<P>

<P>
A final attempt to save Shetland Islands Council's leisure and  recreation department failed yesterday (TUES), leaving officials  clear to go ahead with the break-up of the 21-year-old organisation,  in an attempt to cut costs.
<P>
Councillor Florence Grains tried to persuade a meeting of the full  council to delay a decison on the department's future until after  talks with the Shetland Arts Trust and Shetland Recreational Trust,  which council leaders want to take on much of the old department's work.
<P>
'We're taking things in the wrong order,' she said. 'Things are  getting a bit confused.' Discussion with the trusts 'should take  place first and the decisons later, rather than the other way round.'
<P>
Councillor Leonard Groat said a lot of work had been done already and  asked what staff would think if the council changed its mind again. 
<P>
Vice-convener Jim Smith noted that Mrs Grains did not oppose handing  the museums and archives section of leisure and recreation back to  the education department and assured her: 'If the trusts don't agree,  we won't be tranferring anything to them'.
<P>
Mrs Grains' motion was then heavily defeated, as the leisure  department's first and only director, John P. Nicolson, sat  grim-faced in the public gallery. Mr Nicolson, now retired, is a  candidate in a forthcoming council by-election.

<P>
Four jobs are to go at the Shetland College of Further Education,  Shetland Islands Council agreed yesterday (TUES).
<P>
College principal Gordon Dargie said early retirement packages for  two lecturers and one technician were approved.
<P>
He would also try to re-locate a Building Construction lecturer  elsewhere in the council. The lecturer's post was 'no longer required  because of a downturn in the number of trainees from the local industry'.
<P>
The offer to find the lecturer another job is seen as a possible  compromise with the education union EIS, which had warned of  industrial  action if compulsory redundancy went ahead.
<P>
The union's general secretary, Ronnie Smith, is the son of Shetland's  education chairman, Lerwick Labour councillor Bill Smith.
<P>
The original target was to cut five posts at the college. Mr Smith  senior said recently he regretted the need for the job losses. 
<P>
Mr Dargie said: 'The job losses are part of a number of measures  taken following a review and consultation of staff on reducing  running costs at the college.'  The range of courses offered would be  maintained.
<P>
Shetland College is one of only two in Scotland still under local  authority control. There are plans to set it up as an independent trust.
<P>

29th October 1996
<P>
The charitable trust which has husbanded Shetland's oil revenues for  20 years is awash with money it is loath to spend, while the islands  council continues to make budget cuts.
<P>
The Shetland Islands Council Charitable Trust is now worth 203  million pounds, says trust financial adviser Andrew Matthews, who is  also the council's finance director.
<P>
In a report published yesterday (MON) for this Friday's trust  meeting, Mr Matthews reveals that trustees have a 13.9 million pounds  'surplus' to spend in the financial year 1997/98, after investing 1.1  million pounds to maintain the trust's value - and setting aside 15  per cent for 'contingencies'. 
<P>
But he advises the 26 councillors and two independent trustees to  spend just 5.8 million pounds next year and to continue their policy  of only accepting spending bids previously approved by the council.
<P>
Mr Matthews says the 8.1 million pounds surplus is 'available at  present prices for each year into the future' but adds: 'I would  caution against regarding the whole figure as being able to fund  ongoing revenue expenditure: such an approach would preclude one-off projects.'
<P>
Among the major projects currently delayed because of the council and  trust policy of 'no-growth' budgets are a care centre for old folk in  Unst, Britain's most northerly inhabited island, and a leisure centre  for the village of Aith on the west mainland of Shetland.
<P>
Some councillors are looking to the trust to bail out the council's  education budget, currently under severe pressure as outside  consultants examine ways to cut spending.
<P>
Education chairman Bill Smith said yesterday (MON) he favoured using  trust cash for 'non-statutory' items in Shetland's much-admired  education service. 
<P>
'We have to be careful we don't spend Shetland's own money on things  which are the Government's responsibility to fund,' he said, but  'possibilities' were nursery education and the extra music tuition  for which island schools are famous.
<P>
The charitable trust's 20th annual report lists some impressive  achievements over the past year in social welfare, community projects  and industrial development.
<P>
Chairman Bill Manson reports spending of 550,000 pounds on the  Independence at Home Scheme, designed to help the inform or elderly  to avoid going into hospitals or instituions; another 600,000 pounds  was spent on Christmas bonuses to almost every pensioner household;  and 84,000 pounds went to a Community Alarm Syetem which allows the  housebound to call for help around the clock.
<P>
The trust assisted a wide range of projects run by voluntary  organisations and other Shetland trusts, ranging from marriage  guidance and sports halls to a new history centre in the island of Bressay.
<P>
Loans totalling over 300,000 pounds were made to farmers and crofters  and the trust's hire purchase company provided 1.2 million pounds for  local industry to buy equipment. The company also built a new  livestock marts and agricultural marketing centre and contributed to  the new 11.5 million pounds swimming pool and bowls hall at the  Clickimin Leisure Centre in Lerwick.
<P>
The current market value of the trust's assets is equal to almost  9,000 pounds for every man, woman and child in the islands.

27th October 1996
<P>
Yell, Shetland's second biggest island, is suffering 'dramatic'  depopulation, according to figures compiled by the island's doctor.
<P>
The crisis highlights problems affecting many of Shetland's offlying islands.
<P>
Dr Mike McDonnell has told Yell Community Council of his worries  about the future of the remote community where he has been the GP for 22 years.
<P>
He says Yell (pop. 1,024) has lost 12 per cent of its people in 10  years because of lack of work and a low birth rate. He calculates the  male unemployment rate at 10 per cent, compared with around four per  cent for Shetland as a whole.
<P>
Dr McDonnell says he supports measures to help the neighbouring  island of Unst (pop. 900), which recently lost more than 30 jobs when  oil company Chevron closed down its helicopter base at Baltasound  airport. But he believes Yell's employment problems are 'more  insidious, yet more profound' and calls on Shetland Islands Council  to assist all three North Isles - Yell, Unst and Fetlar (pop. 100).
<P>
In his letter to the community council, the doctor says: 'The  population figures maintained at the Yell Health Centre are more  accurate and more telling than the 10-yearly census returns, and show  a quite dramatic fall in the Yell population ... from 1,169 ten years  ago to the current level of 1,024 - which is the lowest ever recorded  on Yell. Unfortunately the trend is continuing.'
<P>
'Yell has the lowest proportion of under fives in Shetland; the  figures represent the lowest birth rate in the county and indicate  that the falling numbers are not being offset by an increase in  births. The employment picture also gives rise for concern,' Dr  McDonnell says. 
<P>
He warns that a proposal to base the Yell-Unst ferry at Belmont on  Unst, rather than Gutcher, Yell, could lead to even more losses.  Ferrymen and their families would be forced to move to Unst to keep their jobs.
<P>
Yell has faced crises before. In the 1960s a special conference was  held there, to plan development initiatives, after the collapse of  the Antarctiuc whaling industry which formerly employed many Yell  men. The economy picked up when the island gained mains electricity  after the 'Yell For Light' campaign and, in the mid-1970s, when  Shetland Islands Council started a ro-ro ferry service.
<P>
Fast, frequent and cheap ferries allowed many Yell folk to commute to  work at the Sullom Voe oil terminal on the other side of Yell Sound  but in recent years oil-related work has tailed off. Island  industries such as fishing, shellfish processing, knitwear,  agriculture and tourism have not been able to provide enough new jobs.
<P>
Yell's current difficulties reflect similar concerns in other small  communities. Fewer than 4,000 of Shetland's 23,000 inhabitants now  live on the offlying islands of Yell, Unst, Fetlar, Whalsay,  Skerries, Bressay, Fair Isle, Foula and Papa Stour. Burra Isle and  Muckle Roe are linked to the Shetland Mainland by bridges but Bressay  is the only other island which could practicably be linked by a  bridge or tunnel and that could cost over 20 million pounds.
<P>
As the council moves to cut its spending, the six million pounds a  year subsidy for inter-island ferries is under scrutiny, with  consultants being hired to advise on economies. 
<P>
Dr McDonnell is one of many islanders who fear that fare increases  and less frequent sailings would accelerate the drift to the Lerwick  area, where half of Shetland now lives within 10 miles of the  county's only town.
<P>

25th October 1996
<P>
A 62-year-old Orkney man who admitted indecently assaulting a  12-year-old girl was sentenced at Lerwick Sherriff Court to six  months in prison yesterday (THU)
<P>
John Robert Tulloch, known as 'Orkney John', of 1 Brakefield Cresent,  Haroldswick, Unst, Shetland, pleaded guilty of three charges, all  involving indecency.
<P>
The most serious incident happened on the evening of the October 4 in front of Lerwick's Garrison Theatre, where he seized hold of a  12-year-old girl and attempted to expose himself.
<P>
He also admitted indecently assaulting a woman at her house near the theatre later the same evening and being guilty of a similar charge  arising from an incident in the island of Unst on April 29 this year.
<P>
Solicitor Michael Inkster said that there would be no repeat, due to  the fact that Mr Tulloch was now on his way to being able to 'control  his drinking'. There had been a difficult phase in his marriage and  he now sought marriage guidance, he said. He had the support of his wife.
<P>
Mr Inkster asked Sheriff Colin Scott Mackenzie not to be too hard on  his client.
<P>
The Sheriff jailed Tulloch for six months, saying he had 'no other option'.

25th October 1996
<P>
A woman who threatened two police officers and an SSPCA inspector with a shotgun in Walls, Shetland, escaped a prison sentence at Lerwick Sheriff Court yesterday (THU).
<P>
On September 13 last year police constables John MacLean and Donna Newton went with SSPCA inspector Ron Paterson to investigate allegations of  animal neglect on a croft at Houll, Walls, on Shetland's remote west side.
<P>
They were confronted by crofter Margaret Jean Fraser (55), who pointed a shotgun at them. It later proved to be unloaded but the police did  not know that at the time.
<P>
Defence solicitor Bobby McDonald said this was a type of offence that could not be 'brushed aside', but he asked Sheriff Colin Scott  Mackenzie to take into consideration that Fraser had 'no income at  all' and her savings had 'dwindled to few hundred pounds'.
<P>
A social inquiry report concluded that some benefits could be gained  by deferring the sentence. Mr McDonald said that his client was  considering applying for social assistance.
<P>
He said: 'Keeping her in contact with the social services and  carrying out a psychiatric report at the same time will benefit Mrs Fraser.'
<P>
Sheriff Colin Scott Mackenzie accepted the recommendations and decided to defer sentence until April 17 next year. He told Fraser: 'I am  satisfied ... that you are no danger to the public. If you co-operate  with the social work department the outcome of this can be quite different.'
<P>
At Fraser's first appearance in court the sheriff had praised the  police officers for their courage and steadfastness in disarming Mrs Fraser.

<P>
The Crown Estate should hand over the inshore seabed to local people,  the Shetland Movement said yesterday (WED).
<P>
Jack Burgess, chairman of the party seeking more home rule for the  islands, said the seabed should be 'under democratic control' and  managed 'in accordance with the wishes of the local community'.
<P>
Commenting on the continuing rental disputes between the Crown Estate  and several committees running small boat marinas in Shetland, Mr  Burgess said: 'They're really community activities and they shouldn't  be commercially rented.
<P>
'The Shetland Movement has decided to press for the ownership of the  inshore seabed to be transferred from the Crown Estate to local  public ownership,' he said.
<P>
In Shetland such a change would be 'appropriate', because the council  already had powers to control what went on in coastal waters.

An independent Scottish Parliament would increase pensions  immediately and remove standing charges on electricity and phones for  pensioners, Willie Ross, the Scottish National Party's prospective  parliamentary candidate for Orkney and Shetland said yesterday (WED).
<P>
The promise came as the Queen opened the last parliamentary session  before the general election, due by May next year.
<P>
Mr Ross said: 'Scottish pensioners have been hammered by successive  Tory governments, and have been abandoned by the Labour Party.' Only  Scottish independence could offer 'a bright future for elderly Scots', he said.
<P>
The prospective candidate cited a recent Age Concern survey in which  77 per cent of Scots said pensions were too low.

23rd October 1996
<P>
A council helicopter yesterday (TUES) flew Shetland ferries boss  Captain Mike Hogan to Foula, to reassure frustrated islanders that  their new ferry will be delivered as soon as weather permits.
<P>
Last night the 400,000 pounds 'New Advance' was still waiting for a  break in the weather at Stromness Harbour, Orkney, where builders  Richardsons completed her two weeks ago.
<P>
Britain's most isolated island community is looking forward to the  last chapter in the six-year Foula ferry saga.
<P>
A spokeswoman for the council's marine operations department said  yesterday: 'We're planning to make the move towards getting her here  at the weekend.'
<P>
The forecast was looking 'more hopeful for the weekend' she said.  'We're ready to sail her to Shetland provided that we're not let down  by a change in the weather.'
<P>
The council is currently recruiting a new skipper for the 18-mile exposed Atlantic crossing to Foula after Captain Allan Cook, hired as skipper last year, resigned before his new command was ready for sea.
<P>
Meanwhile Foula (pop.50) has not been served by a ferry for the last three weeks because of poor weather. Capt. Mike Hogan met islanders  in a bid to defuse the island's ferry crisis.
<P>
Foula residents claimed the council showed a lack of commitment to  the service. There was a backlog of cargo waiting to come in and  livestock to leave the island for market.
<P>
At present one ferry serves Foula and Papa Stour from the pier at  West Burrafirth on the Shetland mainland. The shorter and more  sheltered crossing to Papa Stour has operated around 20 times during  the last three weeks.
<P>
Councillor for Walls and Sandness, Foula resident Jim Gear, said: 'It  brings at home to everyone who is aware of the fact that this is the  sort of level of service which we suffer under when the ferry service  isn't run from the island.'

23rd October 1996
<P>
Plans for a promotional video to bring in business to a half-empty  council harbour at Scalloway, Shetland, could cost up to 25,000  pounds, members of the Blackness Pier Committee will hear this week.
<P>
Captain Malcolm Brennan, small ports manager for Shetland Islands  Council, says advertising should be 'as widespread as possible'. The  video would cost between 9,000 and 25,000 pounds, depending on how  much archive material is used.
<P>
Harbour works at Scalloway over the past decade have cost over 6  million pounds but traffic has slumped dramatically from 488 vessels  in 1993 to just 365 last year. 
<P>
The improved port facilities were built largely in response to demand  from the local fishing fleet but the number of fishing boat callers  dropped from 268 in 1994 to only 158 last year.
<P>
Delays in developing the new Atlantic oilfields - for which Scalloway  is the nearest port - have dashed hopes for increased oil-related business.
<P>
Captain Brennan says Scalloway should be represented at the Scottish  Fishery Exhibition in Aberdeen next March and the video would also be  'a powerful tool' for attracting small cruise liners, the oilfield  supply industry and general cargo work. 
<P>
The committee of councillors and port users has already agreed they  need a business plan to turn around the fortunes of the loss-making  harbour and cash in on its strategic position as Shetland's main west  coast port.

22nd October 1996
<P>
Shetland fishermen's secretary John Goodlad has been building  alliances with Norwegian fishermen, by attending their annual conference.
<P>
On his return from Norway yesterday (MON) Mr Goodlad said his talks  with the Norwegian Fishermen's Association had been 'very good and open'.
<P>
He found they had similar problems to the Shetland fleet, including  'the whole question of fewer fishermen in the future and fewer boats,  the conflict between big and small boats, as well as the increasing  price of quotas'.
<P>
Mr Goodlad said: 'For example, there's a huge debate on the decision  taken by the Norwegian government to allow an American company to  come in and buy 12 licences for white fish trawlers.'
<P>
The visit was the third of its kind in recent years, as the Shetland  fishermen try to get an insight into the views of Norwegian fishermen  who are often on the opposing side during quota negotiations.
<P>
Similar thinking lay behind last month's move by Councillor Drew  Ratter, Shetland Islands Council's development chairman, when he  hosted the first meeting of a new European committee where fishing  communities from the fringes of Europe, such as Galicia and the  Canary Islands, can discuss common problems.

21st October 1996
<P>
Nearly four years after the oil tanker Braer went aground at the  southern tip of Shetland, MPs are to debate a legal framework to make  the seas safer.
<P>
Shetland councillors say the Government's response to Lord  Donaldson's report on 'Safer Ships, Cleaner Seas' does not go far enough.
<P>
Islanders are taking a keen interest in the debate and Shetland  Islands Council's line is that little has changed to improve marine  safety since  the Braer disaster.
<P>
In July the council approved a report by their marine director,  Captain George Sutherland, who accused the Government of  'procrastination' and said civil servants' arguments against  compulsory insurance were 'nonsensical'.
<P>
The council is demanding a ban on Russian klondykers and other  uninsured ships carrying dangerous cargoes and large quanities of  fuel in UK waters.
<P>
In the Government's opinion compulsory insurance could 'distort the working of a free market' and put insurers under 'moral pressure' to cover 'commercially unsound' risks.
<P>
The Department of Transport argues that it cannot force insurance  companies to provide cover: 'In extreme market conditions business  operations might be placed beyond the law by a requirement to be insured.'
<P>
'This is clearly wholly unsatisfactory,' Captain Sutherland said.  Shipowners who could not afford insurance should not be in business.
<P>
The council has gone to the Court of Session to claim 1.5 million  pounds of compensation for helping to clear up the mess after the  'Braer' tanker wreck. The Government itself is owed large sums.

21st October 1996
<P>
Shetland Islands Council has lifted the ban on harvesting shellfish,  imposed earlier this year on parts of the coastline after tests  showed high levels of paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP).
<P>
According to the Environmental Services Department, measurements of  PSP in Clift Sound, around Burra and Trondra, off Skelda Ness and in  Basta Voe are again at an acceptable level and there is no longer any  risk to the public.
<P>
The levels of PSP were among the highest recorded in the UK this year, and were most unusual for Shetland, where cold Atlantic waters normally keep the poison at bay. Orkney, lying further south, has had almost annual warnings about PSP.

Land rents of £7.6 million from the Sullom Voe oil terminal  will make no difference to Shetland Islands Council's budget  problems, a senior official told the council's policy committee  yesterday (Friday).
<P>
The money has been kept in a 'suspense account' but finance manager  Graham Johnston said half of it would be given back to terminal  operators BP under the recent deal to guarantee the future of Sullom  Voe after the year 2000.
<P>
The other half would go into the council budget for 1997/98 but  policy chairman Jim Smith said it would do the council no good  because the Scottish Office would deduct it, pound-for-pound from  their grant to the council.
<P>
'This money is treated as income by the Scottish Office and that will reduce our grant from them. It makes no difference in the council's  need to save five million pounds annually by the year 2000. If we  don't do that we're running into a deficit,' he said.
<P>
Mr Johnston told the policy committee that, despite the problems with  the General Fund, their balance sheet had 'fundamental strength',  supported by 'substantial' reserves of over £417 million.

19th October 1996
<P>
Shetland's generous grants for leisure and recreation came under  attack yesterday (Friday) as councillors discussed how to dismantle the  department that hands them out.
<P>
Unst councillor Joan Easten told the policy committee: 'We must look  very carefully at leisure and recreation. I can't see how to maintain  the grant scheme, while other council services are due to be cut.'
<P>
In the current financial year 1996/97 the Leisure and Recreation  department is giving away nearly £1.2 million to sports and  swimming clubs, voluntary organisations, playschemes, the arts,  community halls and other projects.
<P>
Councillor Willie Tait, chairman of the marine committee, said new and well-maintained ferries were very important for Shetland and it was difficult to explain to the public why so much money went to leisure  and recreation when there was not enough to replace old ferries.
<P>
Leisure committee chairman Billy Stove warned that the Leisure and  Recreation Department was 'an easy target'. He said: 'Let's have a balance between Leisure and  Recreation and the other council services.' Shetland had a good sporting tradition and he called on councillors  to maintain this.
<P>
The policy committee accepted a report by education director James  Halcrow on how the leisure department should be divided between the  Education Department, Shetland Recreational Trust and Shetland Arts Trust.

<P>
18th October 1996
<P>
A new Viking invasion is taking place in Shetland, with Norwegian  salmon farmers exporting their capital west over the sea, to escape  Oslo government restrictions and maintain access to European Union markets.
<P>
As Norway clamps down on salmon production, partly in response to  complaints from Shetland about unfair competition, so many Norwegians  are investing in the islands that islanders may lose control of the  35 million pounds a year industry.
<P>
Magnus Flaws, chief executive of the Shetland Salmon Farmers'  Association, said yesterday (Thursday) the Norwegian government was  issuing no new salmon farm licences and was re-assessing existing ones. 
<P>
'This creates a situation where there's no room for expansion,' he  said. 'Some of these companies are looking outside Norway and,  obviously, they're looking at Shetland. Some of the local salmon  farmers may sell out, because these (Norwegian) companies do have a  lot of money.'
<P>
With salmon prices at a record low - between 75 and 80 pence per  pound, Mr. Flaws said many farms were under severe economic pressure.  The break-even point is between 95 and 100 pence a pound.
<P>
He hoped prices would recover once negotiations to restrict Norwegian  salmon exports to the rest of Europe were concluded.
<P>
'Some farmers might be able to live for half a year with these  prices, given the fact that they have other sources of income. Others  will have to sell earlier,' he said.
<P>
Drew Ratter, chairman of Shetland Islands Council's development  committee, said the council's ability to help was restricted. He  welcomed the flow of Norwegian money.
<P>
'It helps to develop the industry further,' he said. It proved that  Shetland was a perfect place to grow salmon. Jobs were being secured  and even more might be created.
<P>
The industry produced around 12,000 tonnes of salmon in Shetland last  year and employs almost 700 people, directly and indirectly.
<P>
According to Frank Johnson, managing director of Framgord, Shetland's  biggest salmon producer, processor and seller, the Norwegian money  has come at just the right time.
<P>
Last month Framgord announced a deal with the Norwegian company  Nordvik, which will rear thousands of extra tonnes of salmon at sites  which Framgord has acquired on the west coast of the islands.
<P>
Mr Johnson said: 'Investment has to come during a recession, in order  to remain competitive.' The co-operation with Nordvik would ensure a  steady flow of salmon into Framgord's new 2.4 million pounds  processing plant at Lerwick.
<P>
As salmon prices have fallen in recent years, Shetland producers have  been looking at new markets. Mr Flaws said: 'We have to keep our eyes  open for any new species that could grow in this (water) temperature.  People can diversify, maybe even to grow mussels alongside salmon farms.'

18th October 1996
<P>
Next month's Shetland council by-election in the island of Yell will  be a three-cornered contest between an ex-councillor, a former  council director and a local resident.
<P>
When nominations closed yesterday (THURS) the nominations for the  Yell South poll on November 14 were: 
<ul>
<P>

*  Lerwick lawyer and Children's Panel Reporter <B>Sandy Cluness</B>, who  represented the Twageos ward in the town during the early 1980s. He  will stand for the Shetland Movement party; 
<P>
*  Liberal Democrat candidate <B>John P. Nicolson</B>, from the village of  Scalloway, who recently took early retirement as the islands  council's leisure director after a high profile row with chief  executive Malcolm Green; 
<P>
*  <B>Alan Ogden</B>, the only candidate living in Yell (pop. 1000), is  standing as an independent at his second attempt to win a council seat.
</UL>
<P>
The by-election follows the resignation of Councillor Peter Guy, who  has left the islands for a new job in Yorkshire. Mr Guy won the South  Yell seat as an independent at a by-election in 1993 and was  re-elected unopposed the following year. He was chairman of the  council's leisure and recreation committee, and also chaired the  islands' licensing board and tourist authority.

17th October 1996
<P>
A council care centre for dementia sufferers in Shetland will cost half as  much again as originally thought, it was revealed yesterday (WED).
<P>
Councillor Leonard Groat, chairman of Shetland Islands social work  committee, said he was 'very annoyed' when he discovered that  conversion work on the former Viewforth eventide home in Lerwick  would cost 220,000 pounds more than the 438,000 pounds budget.
<P>
He pledged that the centre for 15 dementia patients and some day-care  clients would still open as planned late next year - and the budget  blunder would have 'absolutely no effect' on home helps and other  community care workers.
<P>
Mr Groat blamed the 50 per cent miscalculation on the council's  design department, which has since been re-organised: 'When this  project was approved we thought the costing of 438,000 pounds was all  we needed but only a year and a half later we discovered the  problems,' he said.
<P>
A report on the affair by social work director Bill Bennett for  tomorrow's (FRI) meeting of the council's policy committee says: 'Due  to the time scale available this costing did not benefit from the  advice of service or structural design consultants. This work was  undertaken later.'
<P>
The consultants, who included Stirling University's 'Dementia  Services Development Centre', recommended design changes for patients' safety  - and complete replacement of the boilers and much of the electrical  system at Viewforth.
<P>
Mr Bennett says the extra cost can be met by using 115,800 pounds  allocated by Shetland Health Board for looking after dementia  sufferers, and by moving 104,200 pounds from the council's own  'community care revenue budgets'.
<P>
Mr Groat said it was not 'over-spending' but 'under-budgeting'. The  220,000 pounds had been held for 'contingencies' and using this money  to complete Viewforth to the proper standard would have 'absolutely  no effect' on care in the community for elderly and disabled people.
<P>
In March this year the council voted to reduce spending on home  helps, to help finance the new dementia centre.

17th October 1996
<P>
Geography has traditionally been the big problem for business in  Shetland, but a new company based in the village of Scalloway plans  to 'capitalise on remoteness'.
<P>
AB Associates Ltd, run by former Shetland council development officer  Andrew Blackadder, says being far from the madding crowd is a  positive advantage when selling business advice and social/economic  research skills to other remote areas throughout Europe.
<P>
Mr Blackadder, a qualified town planner who specialises in handling  applications for European Union development assistance, said: 
<P>
'I think we're fairly unique among consultants, in combining  experience in economic policy and analysis with European affairs, and  this gives us the opportunity to take advantage of a gap in the market.'
<P>
Fellow directors include: Mr Blackadder's former boss - retired  council development director Jack Burgess; publishing expert Susan  Fogg; and Shetland College business studies lecturer Maureen Christie.
<P>
AB Associates has already won a contract with Shetland Islands  Council to carry out European work formerly done by Mr Blackadder and  Ms Fogg when they worked for the council.
<P>
Now they plan to become a new Shetland export business: 'So far our  work has come mainly from Shetland,' Mr Blackadder said, 'but we're  hoping to persuade companies and public authorities in other island  and rural areas to make use of our skills and special insight into  island and rural problems.'

17th October 1996
<P>
Unemployment in Shetland fell slightly last month but there are signs  that the 25-year oil-fired boom in the islands' economy is tailing off.
<P>
Although only 3.9 per cent of the registered working population was  out of a job - one of the lowest figures in the UK - the total of 465  jobseekers was 123 more than in September last year.
<P>
Recent redundancies in the building trade, aviation and oil-related  work have contributed to the trend, while Lerwick Harbour's dramatic  36 per cent decline in traffic this year is reflected in fewer  fishing industry jobs and a downturn in oilfield supply boat business.
<P>
The Shetland dole queue figure of 3.9 per cent compares with 7.5 per  cent for the UK, Scotland's 7.9 per cent, Highland's 8.7 per cent and  five per cent in Aberdeenshire.

The 'best meal of the year' was a sell-out in Shetland last night  (WED) as gourmet supporters of the Fishermen's Mission crowded into  the North Atlantic Fisheries College at Scalloway.
<P>
The finest Shetland seafood made a spectacular buffet for diners at  the annual mission fund-raiser, sponsored by fish farmers, fishermen,  fish processors and the college.
<P>
Mission superintendent Cliff Powell said the reputation of the 'Fish  Fiesta' was such that nearly all the 90 tickets sold within 36 hours,  at 12.50 pounds a go.
<P>
'They say it's the best meal of the year,' said Mr Powell, who  recently succeeded Superintendent Ian Munro as the 'Mission Man' in  the islands. 'We're very grateful for the generous support of our  sponsors and guests.'
<P>
The Royal National Mission to Deep Sea Fishermen is making a special  fund-raising effort this year, to help pay for upgrading its own  kitchens at the Mission building in Harbour Street, Lerwick, a  popular meeting-and-eating place for fishermen and the general public alike.

16th October 1996
<P>
Land rents from the Sullom Voe oil terminal, totalling 7.6 million  pounds, were kept in a 'suspense account' by Shetland Islands Council  officials last year, rather than being spent on council budgets,  councillors will hear later this week.
<P>
The council's policy committee will be asked on Friday to approve the  decision, described by officials as 'prudent' while negotiations with  the oil industry about a new deal were still going on. 
<P>
The deal, agreed earlier this year, provides a rent of around three  million pounds a year from Sullom Voe when existing agreements run  out in August 2000. 
<P>
Keeping last year's rent in the bank left the council's current  account in the black by just 800,000 pounds on March 31, instead of  8.4 million pounds.
<P>
With another 7.1 million pounds due from Sullom Voe in the current  year, councillors are still trying to find economies of five million  pounds a year by the turn of the century, and recently voted to hire  consultants to tell them how to save on schools and ferries.
<P>
The Shetland council is making progress towards staying solvent in  the 21st century but serious problems remain, according to the latest  annual report and accounts, published yesterday (Tuesday).
<P>
Finance manager Graham Johnston tells councillors their balance sheet  has 'fundamental strength', supported by 'substantial' reserves of  over 417 million pounds.
<P>
Although the education and transport departments continued to spend  over budget, other departments made savings and control over General  Fund spending in the finacial year 1995/96 was 'adequate', he says.
<P>
'This should not give rise to complacency, however, since long term  budget projections continue to indicate the creation of insupportable  General Fund deficits if nothing is done to contain them,' Mr Johnston writes.
<P>
Although the council still faces uncertainty over future Govenment  support for its 82 million pounds-a-year revenue spending, it has the  opposite problem on its capital programme, which was underspent last  year by 11.8 million pounds, or almost 30 per cent. 
<P>
'More effective programme co-ordination and management' is needed,  according to the finance department.
<P>
The council was again debt-free last year, apart from a 60 million  pounds housing debt, run up in the 1970s to house incoming oil  workers. Negotiations with the Scottish Office are continuing, with a  view to  writing off the loans, mostly from private financiers.

15th October 1996
<P>
New buildings for Shetland's senior high school could be an  investment for the islands' oil revenues, according to convener Lewis Smith.
<P>
Former pupil Mr Smith said yesterday (MON) the Government's Private  Finance Initiative was 'the only way' to fund a new Anderson High  School in Lerwick - but the main investor could be the council's own  charitable trust, through its property company, Shetland Leasing and  Property Developments Ltd (SLAP).
<P>
The 180 million pounds trust currently invests most of its Sullom Voe  oil terminal revenues in the Stock Market and Government securities.
<P>
The issue came up when the Shetland Education Committee yesterday  discussed a list of expensive maintenance work on the Anderson High,  part of which dates back to 1862.
<P>
Councillor Tavish Scott (Liberal Democrat, Lerwick Harbour and  Bressay) asked why there had been no progress in the past two years  on a replacement school.
<P>
Mr Smith likened the existing buildings to 'a barrack block on a  peninsula', remote from playing fields, expensive to heat and with  'appalling' access and facilities for the disabled. 
<P>
The council had already decided the 'only sensible option' was a  'greenfield' site at Clickimin on the western outskirts of the town,  where the new school and halls of residence could use the gymnasium,  swimming pool and sports grounds owned by Shetland Recreational Trust.
<P>
'I think the Private Finance Initiative, as long as the present  Government is in power, will be the only way we can finance a new  Anderson High School. I suspect if there's a change of government  it'll still be the only way,' Mr Smith said.
<P>
'There are possibly ways in Shetland in which we can do that and not  have an outside company providing the private side of the finance ...  We could use our own capital and there would be a return on that investment.'
<P>
The 33 million pounds project was 'top priority for the council's  whole capital programme'.
<P>
The committeee asked officials for a detailed report on the new  school by the end of this year, along with proposals from consultants  on ways to save money on their 23 million pounds annual education budget.
<P>

15th October 1996
<P>
A prosecution is likely after electronic road rage blocked one of the  fastest-growing lanes of Britain's information super-highway for  seven hours over the weekend, it was revealed yesterday (MON).
<P>
Several thousand customers of <A HREF="http://www.zetnet.co.uk/">Zetnet Services Ltd</A>, the Shetland-based  Internet access provider, suddenly found themselves in cyber-gridlock  late on Saturday night. Electronic mail and Internet access through  the company's Manchester computer banks slowed to a crawl as the  traffic jam spread nationwide.
<P>
Zetnet technical director Tim Cole was called in to his Lerwick  office to deal with what at first looked like a computer failure. But  it quickly became clear that a 'malicious' user, surfing after hours  in London University's computer centre, was deliberately jamming the  system.
<P>
Mr Cole explained yesterday (MON): 'It seems there was an argument  between one of our customers and the user of another system on  Saturday night, all very silly and childish. The user of the other  system decided to do something very nasty and bring down the whole of  Zetnet in revenge - a case of road rage on the information superhighway. 
<P>
'Technically, what this as yet unidentified person did was send  continuous streams of very large packets of information to one of our  140 local call rate phone lines. The effect was that our normal  traffic was getting bullied out of the way, which brought 95 per cent  of our customers to a standstill,' Mr Cole said. 
<P>
The situation was so serious by 4am on Sunday that Mr Cole had to  call out BT Net's senior technical manager, Peter Willis. He traced  and cut off the offender's access to Zetnet and normal surfing was  resumed by 7am.
<P>
Mr Cole said a prosecution in England was 'likely' under the Misuse  of Compters Act. 'We were hit and damaged very badly, and so was BT  Net, by someone acting like a little kiddie,' he said. He likened the  situation to a 'hard nut' biker driving the wrong way up the M62,  causing accidents and 'forcing other drivers off the road'.

12th October 1996
<P>
Asking mainland experts how to save money on island schools is a lot  cheaper than hiring outsiders to suggest economies in ferry budgets,  Shetland councillors learned yesterday (FRI).
<P>
Papers published for next week's education committee meeting reveal  that two redundant Strathclyde Region officials are willing to  examine the islands' 23 million pounds annual education budget - for  fees and expenses of 10,000 pounds.
<P>
Last week councillors agreed to a budget of 50-80,000 pounds for  consultants to come up with annual savings of 750,000 pounds on the 6  million pounds a year cost of council ferry services.
<P>
The ferries job is going out to tender but the education review will  not, if councillors accept the advice of education director James Halcrow. 
<P>
In his report, Mr Halcrow says the scope of the education  consultants' work should be limited to 'the range of possible areas  for initial policy consideration by the council, along with an  assessment of the likely implications in quality of service and  expenditure terms'.
<P>
This is taken to mean that Shetland's own education officials will  draw up the detailed plans for savings to put before the council next year.
<P>
Mr Halcrow said yesterday (FRI) the terms of reference for the study  were 'fairly broad brush'. Rumours that the consultants would be  drawing up 'a hit list of schools for closure' were 'pure speculation'.
<P>
As expected, Mr Halcrow recommends hiring former Strathclyde Region  chief executive Neil McIntosh and former Strathclyde senior depute  education director David Alexander. Both men retired during local  government reorganisation earlier this year and now work for the  COSLA Consultancy, set up by the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities.
<P>
Mr Halcrow said: 'There was no need to go out to tender, nor would  you have been able to get this kind of expertise in the open market.'  He said about half of the consultants' fees would be 'retained by  COSLA for the benefit of local government'.
<P>
Councillor Bill Smith, Shetland's education chairman, said yesterday  (FRI) he had no comment on the proposal not to go to tender. 
<P>
Asked about the cost difference in the consultancy exercises for  education and ferries, he said: 'It's all to the good. I hope the  effects will be in the same proportion.'
<P>
Mr Smith, a veteran Labour councillor, has firmly resisted cuts in  Shetland's 37 schools, which consistently produce some of the best  results in Scotland.
<P>
The controversial decision to hire outside consultants is part of a  council-wide drive to save a total of 5 million pounds a year by the  end of the century.

11th October 1996
<P>
A senior Scottish fisheries scientist yesterday (THURS) denied  <A HREF="http://www.greenpeace.org/">Greenpeace</A> allegations that the Government is promoting the  exploitation of deep-sea fish stocks west of Scotland.
<P>
Dr John Gordon of the Dunstaffnage Marine Laboratory near Oban said  British and European Union public money was funding research about  life on the deep sea floor and the effects of catching fish which can  live up to 80 years.
<P>
The impetus for the new fishery was coming from fishermen, not from  Government, he said.
<P>
Greenpeace have asked the Prime Minister to ban the developing  deep-water fishery, saying species like Orange Roughy, Round-nosed  Grenadier and Black Scabbard Fish are slow-growing and cannot  replenish themselves if fished intensively.
<P>
The environmental campaigners' UK chief executive, Lord Melchett,  wrote a personal letter to John Major in August, warning of 'a  biological disaster' and economic collapse of the trawler fleet if  fishing effort continues in waters up to 3,000 feet deep, west of  Shetland and the Hebrides.
<P>
Dr Gordon said Greenpeace were 'right in a way'. The fish did mature  very slowly, living in constant darkness and near-zero temperatures.  There was evidence that some species produced few young. While there  could be good catches in the early stages of a deep-sea fishery,  these could rapidly decline as older fish were caught and not  replaced by younger stock.
<P>
'We have to be cautious in exploiting these stocks but the Government  is not advocating or promoting it, rather helping research to find  out more,' he said. 
<P>
Dr Gordon is due to give a second lecture about deep-sea fisheries  next week at the <A HREF="http://www.nafc.ac.uk/">North Atlantic Fisheries College</A> in Scalloway, Shetland.
<P>
College principal Morgan Goodlad said yesterday that market economics  were likely to limit the fishery: 'The cost of harvesting them is  higher, because you need bigger ships, working further from shore,  and more expensive gear. And they're difficult to market because they're new. 
<P>
'They're also very ugly fish, totally unattractive. To cover the  higher cost of catching them you need a premium price, not what you'd  get for putting them in fish fingers,' Mr Goodlad said. 'On top of  that, the sustainability of the fishery must be highly questionable.'
<P>
Dr Gordon said a few Scottish boats were following the lead of the  French fleet and targeting Orange Roughy in particular, but most UK  landings of deep-sea species were still a 'by-catch' of trawling for  the more valuable, and better-known, Monkfish and Blue Ling.

11th October 1996
<P>
Shetland councillors yesterday (THURS) elected Councillor Billy Stove  as new chairman for their Leisure and Recreation Committee - and  immediately agreed to scrap their Leisure and Recreation Department  as an economy measure, without knowing how much money the move will save.
<P>
The committee remains in being but will hand over most of the  department's functions to the council's Education Department and two  charitable trusts, after approving in principle a review by education  director James Halcrow.
<P>
The defunct department's museums, archives, community work and sports  staff will transfer to education, the committee unanimously agreed  after a short debate. 
<P>
Most of the properties run by leisure and recreation, including  Lerwick's Islesburgh community centre, youth hostel and Garrison  Theatre, will be managed in future by the independent Shetland  Recreational Trust, if detailed negotiations between the council and  the trust are successful. The council will retain ownership.
<P>
Councillors also agreed to ask the recreational trust to manage the  council's sports pitches, playgrounds and public parks. Mr Halcrow  said the trust had 'a good record' and already provided a booking  service for some council-owned properties.
<P>
The leisure department's tourism promotion work moves to the  Development Department and the Shetland Arts Trust will be asked to  take over all arts projects.
<P>
Mr Halcrow's 14-page report said it was 'not possible to quantify, at  this stage, the savings which will accrue'. He made no mention of  redundancies, other than not replacing the recently retired leisure  director, John P. Nicolson. 
<P>
An eight-member review group of councillors suggested the changes  earlier this year, as part of a search for economies. The leisure and  recreation department currently costs around 4.8 million pounds a  year and hands out oil fund grants worth over 1.1 million pounds to  dozens of island sports clubs, playschemes, village halls and voluntary groups.
<P>
Mr Halcrow said he could not make detailed recommendations on how a  reduced grants budget should be allocated until councillors  themselves decided what the overall cuts should be.
<P>
The new committee chairman, Mr Stove, is a Lerwick councillor who was  formerly vice-chairman. He succeeds Councillor Peter Guy, who  recently resigned when he moved to North Yorkshire. Councillor Bobby  Johnson was elected as the new vice-chairman of the only council  committee which will no longer have its own department to supervise.

11th October 1996
<P>
Shetland crofters seeking council compensation, for fences allegedly  flattened by snowploughs during last year's Christmas blizzards, will  be out of luck if councillors accept a recommendation by officials.
<P>
A report for next week's Shetland Islands Council roads committee  says the council's insurers, Zurich Municipal, have rejected the 17  claims, totalling 7,500 pounds.
<P>
Roads and transport director Joe Gray says although there is 'no  evidence of fault or negligence' by snowplough drivers who cleared  500 miles of roads in five days, it would be 'reasonable' to use the  council reserve fund to compensate people whose fences, in his  opinion, were 'most probably damaged by the council during snow clearing'.
<P>
But, while he is 'not unsympathetic' to the claimants, Mr Gray says  the council has no legal liability in the absence of proof and, if it  did pay for the fencing, might be unable to resist future claims when  insurers refuse to.
<P>
'It should not be forgotten that crofters have a responsibility to  protect their own assets in the same manner as everyone else,' he  says in his five-page report. 'Presumably, the option not to carry  this type of (insurance) cover was borne of their own free choice.'
<P>
'This conclusion has been arrived at after much consultation and  consideration,' Mr Gray says, but, on the advice of council legal  staff, he firmly recommends 'no further action'.

<P>
The Livister Youth Club in the island of Whalsay has joined the  growing number of Shetland organisations using e-mail and the World Wide Web.
<P>
Youth leader John Dally said yesterday (THURS): 'We think we're the  first youth club in Shetland to be online.'
<P>
With access via Zetnet, Shetland's nationwide Internet service  provider, the club has its own mailbox, <A HREF="mailto:lyc@zetnet.co.uk">lyc@zetnet.co.uk</A>. 
<P>
Mr Dally said: 'Members will be able to log on to the Internet and  hope to make contact with young people around the world. As we  develop expertise, we plan to devise a home page of our own.'

10th October 1996
<P>
The two million pounds, six-year saga of a new ferry for Foula,  Britain's most remote inhabited island, is nearly over.
<P>
After building a special pier costing over a million pounds, and a  400,000 pounds boat which failed sea trials, Shetland Islands Council  announced yesterday (WED) that their second attempt at a Foula ferry  was a success, after spending another 400,000 pounds. 
<P>
Only bad weather is now preventing delivery of the 38-foot-long 'New  Advance' from Richardson's boatyard in Stromness, Orkney, to Foula (pop. 50).
<P>
Last minute hitches over certificates for the boat brought new delays  after the builders finished work more than a month ago. The council  is currently recruiting a new skipper for the 18-mile exposed  Atlantic crossing.
<P>
Foula councillor Jim Gear said yesterday: 'It's been a long time.  We're all very pleased that we now have a solution, with a ferry  which we believe will be satisfactory.' The island had suffered  because of the delays but he hoped the Foula economy could now start  to develop again.
<P>
The Foula ferry fiasco has attracted national media attention as one  problem after another dogged what once seemed a straightforward project:
<P>
*  The original design proved unstable at speed in following seas,  leading to an official inquiry and acrimony among councillors about  who was responsible (no-one was, it emerged);
<P>
*  The council had to repay European grants for the boat, which was  eventually converted to a training vessel at Shetland's fishery college;
<P>
*  The islanders' insistence on having their ferry based on Foula,  rather than the Shetland mainland, meant an expensive crane had to be  fitted, to lift the boat out of the water during the winter;
<P>
*  Foula-based crew hired for the first ferry had to be kept on   while the second one was built and the island was served meantime by  a mainland crew;
<P>
*  The council shipped a chalet to Foula to house Captain Allan Cook,  hired as skipper last year. But he resigned after six months, changed  his mind and then resigned again earlier this year after  disagreements with other islanders.
<P>
*  Under Government regulations, unless the council can recruit a  fully qualified skipper the ferry will still have to be based at West  Burrafirth, on the Shetland mainland.
<P>

10th October 1996
<P>
Councillors wearing their planning hats yesterday (WED) voted to  close down a Shetland country pub which they approved last year with  their licensing board hats on.
<P>
Undismayed, Clive Mouat of the Pierhead Restaurant and Bar in the  picture-postcard village of Voe said he would put in a new planning  application to stay open.
<P>
Depute planning director Alastar Hamilton told councillors Mr Mouat  had not replied to letters pointing out that he did not have planning  permission for a pub, only for a restaurant and guest house.
<P>
The problems were unauthorised change of use of the building and not  enough car parking on a narrow road through the village, Mr Hamilton  said. He recommend enforcement action to close the public bar. 
<P>
Local councillor Maisie Colligan told the meeting: 'I can't see a way  round this .. I feel quite sad about it.' The pub was 'a very popular  place' but she felt she had no option to moving for enforcement action.
<P>
Councillors, including those who sit on the licensing board, the  agreed without a vote to give Mr Mouat a month to shut his public bar. 
<P>
Committee chairman Bill Manson said the Pierhead's public bar licence  was 'a quite separate matter' and should not be discussed at a  planning meeting.
<P>
Mr Mouat said he had thought he did have the proper permits: 'I'm not  wanting to fight with anybody about this. I spoke to the planning  department on Monday and showed them my plans for the car park on the  sea frontage. I'm sure I can satisfy their concerns.' He would be  applying shortly for new planning consents.

<P><A HREF="fence.jpg"><IMG SRC="fences.jpg" ALIGN=left WIDTH=254 HEIGHT=162 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=5></A>
Suburbia is creeping up on one of Scotland's most famous prehistoric  sites but yesterday (WED) Shetland councillors granted planning  permission for a fence which has caused offence to Historic Scotland,  keepers of the 2,000-year-old Broch of Clickimin.
<P>
The Edinburgh-based quango which looks after ancient monuments  opposed a retrospective planning application by Laurence Chapman, The  Willows, South Road, Lerwick.
<P>
Mr Chapman had already concreted in the posts for the 'ranch style'  wooden fence, unaware that he was doing wrong. His new house is a few  hundred yards from the famous Pictish fort, already surrounded on  three sides by the suburbs of Lerwick (pop. 7,500).
<P>
In a letter to Shetland Islands Council's planning committee, Ewan  Young of Historic Scotland said the fence was 'utterly inappropriate'  and would have 'an unfortunate visual impact upon this important  structure' and 'further detract from its archaeological and  architectural significance'.
<P>
Promising the council's planning department 'full support to resist  firmly the proposal', Mr Young said the setting of the broch had  already been 'compromised' by new house-building in the area: 'The  effect has been visually to place the broch in, and thereby to  associate it with, suburbia,' he wrote.
<P>
Local councillor Billy Stove said the building restrictions were  'stupid' and 'astounding'. All his constituent wanted to do was fence  in the horse which he and his wife kept in a paddock next to the house.
<P>
'It seems you can't even put up a clothes line in case you spoil the  view of the Picts' Castle from a quarter of a mile away,' he said.  The fence would only be a metre high. He moved approval, against the  advice of the planning department and Historic Scotland, who would  only agree to a post-and-wire fence.
<P>
Councillor Drew Ratter, a crofter with considerable fencing  experience, seconded Mr Stove but warned: 'You can easily have  problems with horses and one-metre-high fences.'
<P>
The controversial structure was then approved without a vote.

9th October 1996
<P>
Consultants advising Shetland Islands Council how to run its ferries  better must be literate and come up with annual savings of around  750,000 pounds, councillors agreed yesterday (TUES).
<P>
They approved a consultancy budget of between 50,000 and 80,000  pounds and a brief for the job, which goes out to tender shortly and  has already attracted interest from more than 30 firms.
<P>
The transport committee said the review should be 'comprehensive' and  must result in a ferry service which is 'satisfactory, efficient and  affordable' while ensuring 'the social and economic wellbeing of the islands'.
<P>
The project, due for completion by the end of March next year, is  part of a council-wide drive to save a total of 5 million pounds a  year on the general fund.
<P>
Committee chairman Magnus Flaws sought to allay Councillor Jim Gear's  fears of cuts in services by saying the consultants could only  recommend. It was for the council to decide and there would be  'widespread consultation' during the process.
<P>
The ferrymen's union TGWU fears the review may bring wage and job  cuts. TGWU district officer John Taylor said last week he did not  understand the need for outside consultants but senior councillors  insist the price will be worth it if long-term savings are made in  the ferries budget, currently running at between five and six million  pounds a year.
<P>
A stipulation by council transport director Joe Gray is for the  review to be 'in good English, free from grammatical and  typographical errors'. In his draft terms of reference, Mr Gray went  on to say he would require 'a comprehensive method statement'. 
<P>
Our Management-Speak Correspondent writes: 'This is understood to  mean tenderers must say exactly how they plan to do the job.'

<P>
A ship took part in a winching exercise with a Coastguard helicopter  off Shetland yesterday (TUES) morning - and five hours later did it  for real with an injured crewman.
<P>
Coastguards said the British-registered oilfield standby ship 'Viking  Ranger' was 20 miles west of the island of Foula when second engineer  Robert Jones, from Montrose, suffered burns in an accident on board  at around 3.30pm.
<P>
The rescue helicopter 'Oscar Charlie' was scrambled from Sumburgh  Airport. The crew airlifted Mr Jones from the deck, in a Force 8 gale  and heavy seas, and flew him to the Gilbert Bain Hospital in Lerwick,  where he was landed at 5.05pm.
<P>
Last night the hospital refused to confirm that Mr Jones was a  patient and declined comment on his condition.
<P>
Earlier in the day the 'Viking Ranger' had exercised with the same  helicopter while on passage from the West Shetland oilfields to  Lerwick, where the ship was due late last night (TUES).

9th October 1996
<P>
Shetland fishermen's chairman Josie Simpson is spending a second week  on the road, lobbying politicians for reforms in fisheries policy.
<P>
Mr Simpson, a retired herring boat skipper, is at the Conservative  Party Conference in Bournemouth, with colleagues from mainland  Scottish ports, to press the case for more local control of  fisheries, better stock conservation, rebuilding the fleet and  controls on foreign boats exploiting waters around the Northern Isles.
<P>
Last week Mr Simpson and Shetland Fishermen's Association secretary  John Goodlad lobbied the Labour conference in Blackpool, as the  Scottish Fishermen's Federation stepped up efforts to make fishing  policy a major issue at the forthcoming general election.
<P>
This week Mr Goodlad is flying to Brussels, to urge the European  Union to take 'a very firm line' with Norway in this month's  negotiations about the share-out of mackerel catches.

9th October 1996
<P>
The National Lottery Fund may be asked to help build the long-delayed  Westside Leisure Centre, says Shetland Recreational Trust chairman Joe Irvine.
<P>
Writing in the annual report of the trust, published yesterday  (TUES), Mr Irvine says trustees are 'frustrated' by lack of progress  on their eighth leisure centre, planned for the village of Aith in  the west mainland but stymied by a continuing freeze on spending by  Shetland Islands Council's Charitable Trust.
<P>
Mr Irvine, who is head teacher of Brae Junior High School, says the  public demand is clear: more than half a million people passed  through the doors of trust's seven centres last year, 23 times the  total population of the islands.
<P>
He describes another record year as fitness-crazy islanders flocked  to the new 11.5 million pounds Clickimin swimming pool and bowls hall  in Lerwick.
<P>
Mr Irvine says the trust suffered 'a severe blow' when it lost the  services of manager Andy Meyers, who has moved to a new job in the  south, and his predecessor John P. Nicolson, whom councillors last  year forced to resign as a trustee, under a controversial new policy  preventing council officials serving on trusts.
<P>
Mr Meyers and Mr Nicolson, who has since retired after 21 years as  the council's leisure director, are praised in the report as 'a  formidable double act' who oversaw the building of the recreation  trust's 'magnificent facilities' throughout the islands.
<P>
The most popular leisure centres of all in the 12 months to March  this year were on two offlying islands, each with a population of  only around 1,000. 
<P>
In Whalsay, the pool and leisure centre at Symbister attracted some  47,000 patrons, 47 times the local population. Unst, Britain's most  northerly island, was almost as keen on fitness and fun, with  admissions amounting to 37 times the number of residents. 
<P>
The trust was founded in the early 1980s, with an endowment from the  islands oil revenues, and charged with promoting health and social  welfare, through sports and leisure activities for all ages.

8th October 1996
<P>
Council investments of around 800,000 pounds in Shetland's beef  industry are threatened by the continuing BSE crisis, according to a  detailed report for today's (TUES) meeting of Shetland Islands  Council's development committee.
<P>
Andrew Harmsworth, the council's agricultural officer, reveals the  full extent of the problem for the first time. 
<P>
He tells councillors that although there have only been 12 BSE cases  in Shetland's 2,316 beef breeding cows and heifers, involving just  eight out of 167 herds, the current price drop of 30 per cent is 'a  severe strain' on farmers and crofters.
<P>
He says solving the financial crisis is 'well beyond the capacity' of  the council's grants budget, which for over a decade has used oil  revenues to encourage farmers and crofters to keep more and  better-bred cattle, thus improving the land and diversifying  agricultural incomes. 
<P>
Largely as a result of the council's efforts, 'dwindling' beef cow  numbers in the early 1980s have increased by a fifth in 15 years,  sustaining 'a very valuable asset' now worth 1.3 million pounds a  year, Mr Harmsworth says.
<P>
Although losses on beef are compensated by current high prices for  Shetland's staple trade in lambs, he believes the council's  investment is now 'under threat' and beef herds will decline again if  the market remains depressed next year.
<P>
Development committee chairman Drew Ratter, who is also secretary of  the Shetland Crofters' Union, said yesterday: 'We've been working  hard to improve the health of our beef cattle for years and this blow  is no fault of our own.
<P>
'We don't have the fodder to keep stock over the winter so we're  forced to sell and take a loss. Ninety per cent of all BSE cases are  in dairy cattle. Our hill-fed beef is a good, clean product.  Suckler-cow producers who have no record of BSE should have different status.'
<P>
Mr Ratter, a crofter who is himself selling cattle at auction today,  said the Government's performance on the BSE cull and compensation  was 'a piece of nonsense' designed to 'postpone spending until after  the election'.

8th October 1996
<P>
A Shetland-born poet with an increasing national reputation has won  the islands' top writing prize.
<P>
Christine De Luca, nee Pearson, a former pupil of Anderson High  School, Lerwick, was the judges' unanimous choice for the 1996  Shetland Arts Trust Literary Award, with her book of poems 'Voes and Sound'.
<P>
Ms De Luca, a graduate of Edinburgh University, qualified as a  geography teacher and now works for the Scottish Examination Board.
<P>
Her former English teacher, John Graham, joint editor of the literary  quarterly 'New Shetlander' which regularly publishes Ms De Luca's  work, said yesterday (MON): 'This is one of the best collections of  poetry to come out of Shetland for 20 or 30 years.
<P>
'Christine was a very bright, sparkling pupil, a very talented young  lady. That talent is now maturing,' he said.
<P>
The judges were particularly impressed by by Ms De Luca's equal  facility in English and her native dialect.
<P>
She said she was 'absolutely delighted' that, unlike the prophet in  the  old saying, she had been accepted in her own country: 'It's very  special,' she said.  She is currently working on a second collection  of poems. Like the first, it will celebrate the Shetland landscape  and her favourite places on the west mainland of the islands.
<P>
Mr Graham himself was voted BBC Radio Shetland Playwright of the Year  for his play 'A Bit o' Laand', exploring the fierce attachment of old  people to their crofts.
<P>
Shetland's Young Writer of the Year was 14-year-old Floortje  Robertson from the village of Walls, with 'Countdown for Luke', the  tale of a space cadet who falls foul of a crew of nasty aliens.

8th October 1996
<P>
A new one million pounds bridge to one of Shetland's most picturesque  islands is planned to start construction in two years' time, with not  a mention of toll charges or the Government's Private Finance Initiative.
<P>
Shetland Islands councillors are expected to grant planning  permission tomorrow (WED) for the 100-yard long bridge to Muckle Roe  (pop. 103), almost half a century after the old bridge was rebuilt by  the former Zetland County Council.
<P>
The existing bridge has a 10 tonne weight restriction, which prevents  tourist coaches visiting the island, causes difficulties for crofters  and contractors moving heavy machinery, and hinders truck drivers  delivering central heating oil and agricultural fertiliser.
<P>
David McNae of the council's roads department said yesterday the new  structure would bring the road to Muckle Roe into line with council  policy of no weight restrictions. Assuming planning permission is  granted, he hoped to put the project out to tender early next year  and to make a start in the spring of 1998.
<P>
The old bridge, parts of it dating to before the First World War,  will then be demolished.
<P>
Mr McNae said there were no plans for bridge tolls.
<P>
Planning officials are recommending contractors to take care not to  pollute the narrow, tidal Muckle Roe Sound during construction and  demolition works, and to avoid a nearby site of special botanical  interest, the Muckle Roe Meadows.
<P>
The three-mile-wide island is a thriving crofting community and has  some of the finest coastal scenery in Shetland.

8th October 1996
<P>
A 62-year-old man was remanded in custody at Lerwick Sheriff Court  yesterday (MON) after admitting indecently assaulting a 12-year-old girl.
<P>
The court heard that John Robert Tulloch, 1 Brakefield Crescent,  Haroldswick, Unst, Shetland, seized hold of the girl outside  Lerwick's Garrison Theatre on Friday evening and attempted to expose himself.
<P>
Tulloch, known as 'Orkney John', also admitted indecently assaulting  a woman at a house near the theatre later the same evening.
<P>
The court deferred sentence to October 24, pending social inquiry,  community service and victim reports.
<P>
Earlier on Friday, Tulloch had been released on bail pending a trial,  after appearing in the Lerwick court to deny indecently assaulting a  woman in the island of Unst on April 29.
<P>
He admitted five previous convictions, none involving indecent assault.

7th October 1996
<P>
The first of the winter's big power cuts meant no hot breakfast or  Sunday roast for much of Shetland yesterday (SUN), when a broken  lightning conductor at the Sullom Voe Terminal's power station  tripped out the islands' entire electricity grid.
<P>
A Hydro Electric spokeswoman said the incident was 'serious' but  denied it had anything to do with a new generator at the company's  Lerwick power station, which has suffered teething troubles over the past year.
<P>
She said equipment at Lerwick failed to detect the fault, which led  to the blackout.
<P>
Every consumer in Shetland was affected by the major power cut at  8.45am. Hydro engineers managed to restore electricity to Lerwick  within 15 minutes. Southern and western parts of the islands were  re-connected at 11.20am but many areas were cut off until shortly before 1pm.
<P>
The incident came after a night of high winds and rain, following a  series of momentary power cuts in some parts of the islands during  the past few days.

4th October 1996
<P>
Over 200 representatives of local businesses attended a fund raising event organised by Sail Shetland Ltd. in the Clickimin Centre last night (THUR).
<P>
In November last year Sail Shetland succeeded in its bid to attract the Cutty Sark Tall Ships Races to Lerwick in 1999. The company will be responsible for organising the event, which is expected to attract  thousands of visitors  to the islands.
<P>
Chairman of Sail Shetland, Canon Lewis Smith, said in his address: 'The choice of Lerwick as a host port is wonderful news for Shetland. The stay provides a focus for the whole community to work together on a major international event, an event which will be the biggest and most spectacular Shetland has ever known.'
<P>
According to Bob Steele, treasurer of  Sail Shetland Ltd., 80,000 pounds of the 500,000 pounds needed to stage the spectacle has been already raised before last night reception.
<P>
The idea of last night's meeting was not just to raise as much money as possible, but to make local businesses think what they might gain by sponsoring the event. The Tall Ships will generate an estimated 2.2 million pounds in the local economy.
<P>
More than one hundred square riggers, schooners and yachts are expected in Lerwick harbour between the 9th and the 12th August 1999. Shetland is  the half-way mark on the races between St. Malo in France and Aalborg in Denmark.
<P>
Guest at the reception was Brigadier Robin Duchesne of the International Sail Training Association, which has organised the  races since 1956. He said: 'At least half the crews have to be aged between 15 and 25.We are absolutely strict about that. The Cutty Sark Tall Ships Races are really about young people.
<P>
'We are international. The first prize goes to the ship that has done the most to promote international understanding and  friendship,' he said.
<P>
Shetland Islands Tourism director Maurice Mullay is expecting 4,000  extra visitors for the cavalcade of sail, besides the 3,000 crew  members. He said: 'We have to make sure that there are adequate facilities, enough beds for instance. We will put out an appeal to the general population for spare beds to cope with this demand.
<P>
'I have every confidence in the people of Shetland to come forward as they have in the past,' he said.

5th October 1996
<P>
The top man in Greenpeace UK has written a private letter to the  Prime Minister, asking him to stop oil production from Britain's new  West Shetland oilfields - and to take a world lead in solar power and  other sustainable energy.
<P>
BP and Shell have already spent hundreds of millions of pounds on  developing the first three fields in the 'Atlantic Frontier' up to  100 miles west of Shetland - Foinaven, Schiehallion and Clair.
<P>
Peter Melchett, executive director of Greenpeace UK, wrote to the  Prime Minister on August 21. The letter, seen by The Shetland News  Agency yesterday (FRI), said there was no need to exploit the oil,  because there was plenty elsewhere, and no 'common benefit' from doing so.
<P>
Lord Melchett said there was a 'serious contradiction' in the  Government's energy policy. The Department of Trade and Industry was  'fast-tracking' BP's new oilfields, despite Environment Secretary  John Gummer's commitment, at the Rio eco-summit four years ago, to  reduce the amount of carbon dioxide from burning oil, gas and coal.
<P>
'Relatively simple calculation shows that the world's atmosphere  cannot sustain the use of more than a few per cent of known fossil  fuel reserves,' Lord Melchett said.
<P>
'If there is one place which is a touchstone for Britain's commitment  to environmental protection and sustainable development, it is West  of Shetland... There are new and considerable risks to people and the  environment which arise through the largely untested and ''frontier''  technology which the industry intends to employ.'
<P>
The Greenpeace boss charged that there had been 'very little public  debate and almost no Parliamentary scrutiny' because the projects  were being 'fast-tracked with minimal public information'.  Even  statistics about seabirds, collected for the oil companies by the  Joint Nature Conservation Committee, were classed as 'commercial in  confidence'.
<P>
He told Mr Major: 'Greenpeace calls on you to halt the development of  the oilfields west of Shetland and, in so doing, to give the world  leadership by showing that you intend to put Britain and its energy  policy on a true path to a more sustainable future.'
<P>
A BP spokesman in London said yesterday (FRI): 'We decline to comment  on a private correspondence between Lord Melchett of Greenpeace and  the Prime Minister.'
<P>
Downing Street said yesterday (FRI) that the Prime Minister had  replied to Lord Melchett but regarded such letters as 'confidential'.
<P>
The 500 million barrels Foinaven oilfield is due on stream in April  next year, loading tankers at a wellhead in 1400 feet of water, 100  miles west of Shetland.
<P>
Lord Melchett told Mr Major it was 'remarkable' that only one British  government building had a solar electric panel. Solar energy could  provide two thirds of our energy needs, even in Britain. Renewable  energy sources were more abundant than fossil fuels, yet the  Department of Trade and Industry spent roughly twice as much on  publicity and promotion for the oil industry as it invested in solar  technology.
<P>
Lord Melchett also attacked proposals to exploit stocks of deep water  fish in the same area of the Atlantic, saying the ecology of the deep  ocean was 'fragile' and could not sustain heavy fishing: 'It is  widely feared that the development of fisheries for these very deep  fish is very likely to result in a biological disaster,' he wrote.
<P>
Fishermen from Shetland and elsewhere are gearing up to exploit the  shoals of Orange Roughy and other deep-sea fish.

<P>
'Alarming' statistics show that a six-year-old Shetland scheme to  re-cycle aluminium cans for charity has failed to stop islanders  throwing away more than 60,000 pounds' worth of the valuable metal.
<P>
Vic Thomas of Shetland Amenity Trust yesterday (THURS) called for  renewed efforts to halt the waste.
<P>
'The trust has run the scheme since 1990 and the marvellous efforts  of schools, youth clubs, canteens, offices etc. have raised over  6,000 pounds for national charities, school funds and local groups,' he said.
<P>
'Last year in the UK over 40 million pounds' worth of aluminium cans  were thrown away and lost to the recycling industry. Here in Shetland  we recover and recycle 11 per cent of available cans. That's a loss  of 11,000 pounds a year.
<P>
'This alarming discovery means we throw away more cans each year than  we've collected since the scheme began. Shetland has dumped over  60,000 pounds' worth and is continuing to do so,' Mr Thomas said.

<P>
'Bleeding Bunny Disease' has reached Shetland, only four years after  the first case was reported in the south of England.
<P>
The good news for farmers and crofters has brought heartbreak to  island children as their pet rabbits succumb to the killer plague,  known to vets as viral haemorrhagic disease.
<P>
Shetland vet Juliet Nicolson said yesterday (THURS) her practice on  the west side of the islands had had 20 pet rabbit deaths reported in  the past fortnight.
<P>
'It causes internal bleeding and liver damage and is always fatal,'  Mrs Nicolson said. How it spread was unknown but it could be blown on  the wind, carried by birds, or through food or bedding.
<P>
A Scottish Office spokeswoman said they had reports of cases in wild  and domestic rabbits.
<P>
'It's quite virulent and there's a high mortality rate,' she said. It  was made a notifiable disease in 1991 and the first case was in 1992.
<P>
The Scottish Office recommended pet owners to vaccinate their rabbits.

3rd October 1996
<P>
The transport workers' union TGWU yesterday (WED) flatly rejected a  proposed 27 per cent pay cut for some Shetland ferrymen and demanded  an urgent meeting with island councillors.
<P>
TGWU district officer John Taylor was speaking in Aberdeen after a  flying visit to consult his members on council ferries to the small,  offlying islands of Fair Isle, Foula and Papa Stour.
<P>
Last week ferry managers gave the union a report which advocates the  wage reductions as part of a council-wide ecnomy drive.
<P>
Mr Taylor said the union spent two years negotiating a pay and  conditions deal, signed in 1994 with the council: 'We will accept no  changes whatsoever but require an urgent discussion to see if there's  a hidden agenda.' 
<P>
He feared the plan was to base the Foula ferry crew on the Shetland  mainland rather than their home islands. Papa Stour is already served  by a mainland crew and it would be impracticable to base the Fair  Isle ferry at the small, exposed Grutness Pier which is the mainland  terminal for the ferry 'Good Shepherd IV'.
<P>
Last night Councillor Alastair Goodlad, vice-chairman of the  council's marine committee, said on local BBC radio: 'There had  better not be a hidden agenda.' Council policy was to base the Foula  ferry in Foula, and that was that.
<P>

<P>
Leaders of Shetland's fishermen are in Blackpool to lobby the Labour  Party conference and Dr Gavin Strang MP - the man tipped to be  fisheries minister if Labour win the general election.
<P>
Shetland Fishermen's Association chairman Josie Simpson and secretary  John Goodlad joined colleagues from the Scottish mainland in arguing  the case against foreign 'flag-ships' - which register in UK ports to  get a bigger share of British fish stocks.
<P>
The delegation also put the case for reforming the European Common  Fisheries Policy and for schemes such as 'scrap-and-build' to  modernise the fleet.
<P>
Dr Strang, whose wife Bettina hails from the island of Bressay, is  well acquainted with the Shetand fishermen's case, having been  briefed in detail by Mr Goodlad at a meeting last month.
<P>
Meanwhile Mr Goodlad yesterday (WED) described as 'a gross  exaggeration' a report by the Scottish Council, Development and  Industry, which said 40 per cent of UK fish landings were illegal and  part of a multi-million pounds fraud.

3rd October 1996
<P>
A team from the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) has arrived in  Shetland to urge salmon farmers to obey the law when using divers to  work on their fish cages.
<P>
Frank Murray, HSE's senior Scottish inspector, said yesterday (WED)  the aim was to encourage safe practice 'rather than get people prosecuted'.
<P>
Mr Murray said there was evidence some divers working on salmon farms  were not fully trained or registered, ignored standard safety  procedures and, because of ignorance, were hazarding their long-term health.
<P>
'The smallest (diving) team possible is a supervisor and two divers,  but the practicalities of coping with underwater hazards, handling a  boat, recovering a diver in an emergency, etc., mean that a team will  normally need to consist of at least four professionals, sometimes  more,' he said.
<P>
HSE had heard of 'much smaller' teams working from boats in remote  areas, which was 'both unsafe and illegal', Mr Murray said.
<P>
He offered free advice to fish farmers, diving contractors and  individual divers.

2nd October 1996
<P>
Shetland council ferry bosses want to cut the pay of some inter-island ferrymen by 27 per cent, as part of an economy drive.
<P>
Reliable sources close to talks with the men's union, the TGWU, say the islands affected are Foula (pop. 50), Papa Stour (35) and Fair Isle (pop. 70).
<P>
The four-man crews of these ferries work shorter hours than their colleagues on services between the main Shetland islands but are paid the same, under an agreement signed in 1994 after a prolonged dispute.
<P>
A report on negotiations with the crews at the council's Joint Consultative Committee (JCC) was withdrawn from the agenda of the Shetland Islands Council Marine Operations Committee yesterday (TUES).
<P>
Chairman Willie Tait said the staff side had 'declined to discuss it' as they wanted more time for consultation with ferry managers.
<P>
Marine director Capt. George Sutherland said yesterday he could not comment on what went on at the JCC, which met in private: 'The consultation process is still going on,' he said.
<P>
It is estimated the proposal could save the council over 70,000 pounds a year in wages.
<P>
TGWU official John Taylor was in Shetland yesterday to meet his members on the ferries but neither he nor shop stewards were available for comment. ENDS

2nd October 1996 
<P>
It would not be 'appropriate' to discipline Shetland council officials who spent 90,000 pounds on repairs to a pier without formal approval, their boss said yesterday (TUES).
<P>
Captain George Sutherland, marine operations director and depute chief executive of Shetland Islands Council, told his committee the spending on the ferry ramp at Symbister in the island of Whalsay had been brought forward after a survey showed the work was urgent.
<P>
The figure was still within the total repairs budget because other projects were delayed, but Capt. Sutherland expressed 'regret' that 'the correct procedures' were not followed and promised staff would be better trained in future.
<P>
'There's no question that they weren't aware of the proper procedure,' he said.
<P>
Referring to a recent case where two senior leisure department officials were disciplined after similarly unauthorised spending of 134,000 pounds on recreation projects, Councillor Tavish Scott said the council had to be consistent: 'I wouldn't like to see double standards,' he said.
<P>
Councillor Brian Gregson asked: 'What is the possibility of disciplinary action?'
<P>
'I considered it,' Capt. Sutherland replied, 'and decided it would not be appropriate.'
<P>
After hearing that the marine department had a high turnover of management staff recently, the committee voted unanimously to approve the spending retrospectively, but instructed Capt. Sutherland to give the full council more details of the affair later this month.

2nd October 1996
<P>
A skilled engineer made redundant at Britain's most northerly airport has lost no time in setting up his own business and winning a promising contract.
<P>
Jack Barclay, from Haroldswick, in the island of Unst (pop. 900), has invested 100,000 pounds in Unst Inshore Services, supported by Shetland Enterprise and Shetland Islands Council.
<P>
Mr Barclay offers an engineering and fabrication service and has won a contract from Globus - the local agents for salmon cage manufacturer Polar Circle - to service and repair all their cages in Shetland.
<P>
Mr Barclay also plans to produce agricultural and fish farming equipment, currently imported at high prices, as well as adapting equipment built by other companies to the specific needs of local businesses.
<P>
The development has secured a total of 50,000 pounds in backing from Shetland Enterprise and Shetland Islands Council.
<P>
Shetland Enterprise chief executive David Finch said: 'This is an important development which will not only benefit the fragile community of Unst but will help farmers and fish farmers source cheaper but equally high quality equipment, by reducing the need to import.'
<P>
Mr Barclay was born in Shetland. His parents were originally from Unst and moved to New Zealand when he was a child. He came 'home' on holiday over 20 years ago on holiday and decided to stay. He married in the island and worked as a lightkeeper before taking a job at the airport.
<P>
He said yesterday (TUES): 'Before the announcement of job losses at the airport, I was thinking about branching out on my own. My redundancy in March and the backing of Shetland Enterprise and Shetland Islands Council gave me the impetus to set up this new venture.
<P>
'I've already secured one major contract and have been doing work for fish farms all across Shetland. Initially the business will provide work for myself and a seasonal apprentice, but it is my hope that, as the fabrication work increases, there will be enough to take on a small number of staff,' he said.
<P>
A fast, aluminium-hulled motor launch Mr Barclay built recently in his spare time has been widely admired.

2nd October 1996
<P>
A 71-year-old widow from Shetland is setting off for the west coast of Canada today (WED) to meet a penpal she hasn't heard from for 55 years and has never met.
<P>
It's all thanks to 'The Shetland News', who put Jean and Steve in touch for the first time since before Pearl Harbor.
<P>
Jean Williamson, from North Lochside, Lerwick, is on the 10.30am non-stop flight from Glasgow to Vancouver, due to land at 12.45pm British Columbia time.
<P>
Waiting at the customs gate will be 73-year-old Steve Kirton, a retired builder originally from Australia, who says he stopped writing to the 16-year-old Jean in 1941 because he felt she was getting too serious: 'I chickened out. I was very young and very shy,' he said when the two got back in touch in June this year.
<P>
Steve joined the Australian Army after Pearl Harbour, was taken prisoner at the fall of Singapore, and spent three years in a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp. 
<P>
After the war he tried without success to contact the penpal he'd known as Georgina Irvine. But the schoolgirl from the village of Wester Skeld had grown up, married Willie Williamson, moved to the town of Lerwick and was now known by her middle name of Jean.
<P>
When Steve enrolled for a creative writing class in Burnaby, British Columbia, he quickly made friends with fellow mature student Jim Milina, who used a search engine to find Shetland and sent an e-mail to 'The Shetland News'.
<P>
Within 48 hours (after a false start with another Georgina Irvine, no relation!) we traced Jean, who still works in the family painting and decorating business founded by her late brother-in-law, Frank Williamson of Lerwick.
<P>
Jean said she had heard of the Internet but didn't know what it was: 'If it hadn't been for the Internet we'd never have got in touch again. I think it's great. He's a super guy to speak to on the phone. We're very jolly. He's called several times. He was so happy to speak to me for the first time.'
<P>
Neither penpal kept the letters so there will be a lot to catch up on when Jean lands in Canada with her son George as chaperone.
<P>
Jean, mother of six children and eight grandchildren, insists there is no romance in the air: 'As far as I'm concerned, it's just renewing an old friendship.' Taking a breather from the floor during an old time dance in a Shetland village hall at the weekend, she said: 'I'm really looking forward to it. It's such an adventure.'
<P>
Steve, now separated, also has six children - two of them living near him in British Columbia. Following a recent heart attack, he's not able to travel far and is delighted Jean can make the trip: 'After all these years, it's funny to think we've never actually met,' he said.
<P>
The only disappointment for Jean is that she'd planned to bake Steve a special cake and take it with her. But the Canadian Customs said fresh cakes were not allowed as cabin baggage, so now she plans to bake it in B.C. instead.

30th September 1996
<P>
 New technology let down Norway's prune-powered oarsman in his daring  bid to row alone across the North Sea, Norwegian Coastguards said  this afternoon (MON).
<P>
As a Sea King helicopter flew 32-year old adventurer Svein Ove Ask to  the fishing port of Aalesund, he told rescuers both his satellite  Global Positioning Systems (GPS) had failed two days ago, leaving him  with no clear idea where he was.
<P>
'He activated his emergency beacon at 10.30 BST and was picked up by  the helicopter at noon, about 100 nautical miles from Aalesund,' a  Coastguard spokesman in Bergen said. 'The weather was rough but he'd  been through much worse.'
<P>
Mr Ask, a journalist and father of two boys aged five and three, had  endured seven nights of continuous gales since leaving Lerwick on September 22.
<P>
He astonished critics during the past week with the extraordinary  seaworthiness of his partly-enclosed, 19-foot-long rowing boat, based  on a 1,000-year-old 'Nordfjording' skiff design. 
<P>
In Force Nine gales and 20 foot seas he put out a sea anchor, enjoyed  his favourite snack of dried prunes, and slept in his coffin-shaped  cabin, waiting for the wind to ease.
<P>
'He was in very good condition. He's rough and tough. We think it  should be a big enough achievement for him just to have survived it,'  the Coastguard spokesman said.
<P>
'We expected that something could happen because of the bad weather  we always have at this time of year. It was a very high calculated  risk. We don't like it,' he said.
<P>
In the first five days southerly gales blew Mr Ask over 100 miles  north of his intended course to Bergen, just 180 nautical miles east  of Lerwick. By the weekend he was 85 miles north-east of the Muckle  Flugga lighthouse - further from Bergen than when he started. 
<P>
During the last two days of the epic row the wind veered westerly and  he was making good progress towards Norway when his navigation  equipment failed. In such a small boat, pitching wildly in heavy seas  under overcast skies, it was impossible to obtain an accurate fix of  his position once his GPS equipment had failed.
<P>
This afternoon (MON) a Norwegian rescue service vessel was trying to  find and recover his boat, 'Ingolf Arnasson', named after the Viking  discoverer of Iceland. 
<P>
Norwegian Coastguards had warned Mr Ask not to try the 200-mile  crossing during the equinoctial gale season, but Shetland Coastguards  said he was as well prepared as possible and praised his safety  precautions, while admitting they wished he would leave the attempt  until next summer.
<P>
A senior Norwegian Coastguard said last week he feared expensive  resources could be tied up trying to rescue someone who had no good  reason to be out on the North Sea at this time of year. In the event,  Bergen Coastguards said today's (MON) search and rescue mission had  been 'very straightforward' and had not diverted them from other tasks.
<P>
In early July Mr Ask arrived in Lerwick after a 10-day row from  Maloy, the first man to accomplish the solo crossing for 27 years. He  admitted that his partner Anne Grethe Heen thought he was 'a little bit crazy'.
<P>
Two other Norwegians who left at the same time gave up and were last  month (AUG) rescued during a second attempt when their open boat was  swamped half-way to Shetland. They survived five days adrift in a  liferaft, staying alive by killing and eating a seagull.
<P>

1st October 1996
<P>
The leader of Scotland's anti-nuclear councils last night (MON) demanded radioactive waste reprocessing at Dounreay be stopped for good and said statements by the plant managers were 'downright insulting to the public'.
<P>
Shetland councillor Bertie Black, convener of Nuclear Free Local Authorities Scotland (NFLAS), said after the Caithness plant shut down for repairs: 'After yet another radioactive leak into the sea, how dare the management of Dounreay claim that such leaks pose no threat to the public and expect us to believe it?
<P>
'The credibility of the Dounreay publicity machine is totally non-existent. I think we've got to the stage where, hopefully, the population of northern Scotland will demand that this reprocessing ceases entirely,' Mr Black said.
<P>
NFLAS represents 16 Scottish councils who recently complained about the alleged risks of flying spent nuclear fuel rods into Wick Airport on the way to Dounreay.
<P>
A spokesman for Dounreay said yesterday (MON) that the leak discovered in cooling water pipework on Saturday could take months to fix, but the radioactivity levels were a tiny fraction of natural background radiation.

The Millennium Commission's grant of 33.35 million pounds for the proposed University of the Highlands and Islands (UHI) will help to 'reverse the export of ability and opportunities' from the area, the principal of The Shetland College said yesterday (MON).
<P>
Gordon Dargie, who runs the most northerly college involved in the university project, said the grant was a challenge to the UHI partners - colleges, councils and local enterprise companies - to secure matching funds from other sources.
<P>
'Schools throughout the Highlands and Islands have traditionally achieved the highest standards but the area has traditionally lacked an infrastructure to support higher education,' Mr Dargie said. 'The area traditionally has exported well-qualified school pupils to higher education in the Central Belt and, in doing so, has exported many job opportunities.'
<P>
As a result, Scotland's remoter communities had 'largely had to do without the updated professional qualifications and skills' which were benefiting economic development elsewhere, he said.
<P>
Shetland Islands Council had been a founder member of UHI and the islands' two colleges each had 'something unique' to offer - marine science at the North Atlantic Fisheries College in Scalloway and textile design at the Shetland College of Further Education in Lerwick.
<P>
Mr Dargie said it was 'a great day' after months of preparation and hard work.
<P>
Northern Isles MP Jim Wallace said the Millennium Commission grant towards the 80 million pounds initial budget of the university was 'a huge boost'.
<P>
The multi-campus university, making full use of computer communications, would 'present the Highlands and Islands with new opportunities, not just for students but for local businesses and communities as well,' he said.
<P>
'It is particularly welcome news for those of us who have kept faith with the project and have consistently tried to promote it. It provides real encouragement to ensure that the remaining pieces are quickly put in place.'

1st October 1996
<P>
A second Shetland council department has admitted spending public money without proper authority.
<P>
Marine director George Sutherland will ask councillors today (TUES) for retrospective permission to spend up to 90,000 pounds on a new ramp and other works for the ferry terminal at Symbister in the island of Whalsay.
<P>
In a paper for the Marine Operations Committee, Capt. Sutherland says a survey showed the work needed to be done as quickly as possible and his officials brought it forward, because some other projects had suffered unavoidable delays.
<P>
Although the total budget for repair and renewal of ferry terminals throughout the islands is unaffected, Capt. Sutherland says: 'It is clear that the proper approval and authorisation procedures were not followed.'
<P>
He explains there have been some staff changes recently but recognises he should 'arrange appropriate training, instruction and guidance' for his managers 'to ensure that the council procedures are rigorously followed in future'.
<P>
Earlier this year the council's former leisure and recreation director, John P. Nicolson, was disciplined by chief executive Malcolm Green after internal auditors reported that 134,000 pounds' worth of recreation grants had been paid without formal approval.
<P>
Mr Nicolson took early retirement in the summer and is still disputing the discipline decision.
<P>
Capt. Sutherland is Mr Green's deputy chief executive. The work at the Symbister ferry terminal is currently under way.

1st October 1996
<P>
A Sheriff yesterday (MON) banned a man from visiting the Shetland island of Bressay, after hearing that he had made a 'menacing' phone call to his former partner living there.
<P>
Eric Ronald MacLaren (49), 49 Kalliness, Weisdale, Shetland, appeared from custody before Honorary Sheriff George Henderson in Lerwick Sheriff Court and admitted a breach of the peace outside the office of the Shetland Children's Panel in the town last Monday.
<P>
He also admitted a breach of the peace by phoning the woman and 'threatening to injure or kill himself'. The woman cannot be named, for legal reasons.
<P>
Solicitor Eric Peterson said MacLaren had been unhappy about the outcome of a Children's Panel hearing after his relationship with the woman had broken down. His client apologised for the trouble caused.
<P>
The court deferred sentence until October 24 for social inquiry and community service reports and granted bail, on condition that MacLaren did not contact the complainer again and did not set foot on the island.
<P>
Bressay (pop. 400) has no resident police officer and is served by an hourly ferry from Lerwick, half a mile across Bressay Sound.

30th September 1996
<P>
Norway's intrepid solo oarsman is back in home waters but still has a hundred miles to go in his hair-raising attempt to become the first man to row from Norway to Shetland and back.
<P>
Svein Ove Ask (32) pulled across the UK/Norway median line near the Magnus oilfield at the weekend. Yesterday (SUN) he was steadily pulling east after surviving a week of continous gales between Shetland and Norway.
<P>
Coastguards said he was north of latitude 62 degrees and about half way across, although the southerly gales had blown him over 100 miles north of his intended track. Yesterday's south-westerly gale was helping him in the right direction, for the first time since he left Lerwick last Sunday.
<P>
A French trawler skipper who spotted Mr Ask's tiny boat on Saturday altered course to investigate, fearing the 19-foot 'Ingolf Arnasson' was a liferaft from a wrecked ship.
<P>
Mr Ask told the trawler by radio he was well and did not need any help.
<P>
It is thought he will try to head for Maloy, the fishing port he left in June on the first leg of his controversial expedition. 
<P>
Some Norwegian rescue service bosses consider him foolhardy but Mr Ask insists he has the right boat for the job and so far has confounded critics who advised him not to attempt the return crossing during the equinoctial gales.
<P>

28th September 1996
<P>
The Norwegian trying to row from Shetland to Bergen in the middle of the autumn gales was last night (FRI) more than 30 miles further from his goal than when he set out from Lerwick five days ago.
<P>
Svein Ove Ask, a journalist and father of two from Nordfjordur, ignored a bad weather forecast and warnings from Norwegian Coastguards when he set off in a 19-foot-long wooden boat for the 208 mile trip.
<P>
Although he has now rowed half the distance from Lerwick to Bergen, persistent southerly gales have blown Mr Ask far off course.
<P>
The defiant oarsman, attempting a feat even the Vikings would have baulked at, says he has food for another 15 days and his partly-enclosed boat is designed to cope with violent North Sea gales.
<P>
There was no radio contact with Mr Ask yesterday (FRI) but a satellite logged him as he at last crossed the Greenwich meridian in latitude 61.6 degrees, 115 miles north of the southern tip of Greenland.
<P>
Senior Norwegian Coastguard officials have severely criticised Mr Ask's expedition but the veteran of five abortive attempts to row alone from Norway to Shetland points to his successful crossing from the fishing port of Maloy to Lerwick in June this year.
<P>
Two other Norwegian rowers who attempted the crossing in July survived by the skin of their teeth when they were rescued from a liferaft five days after their open boat capsized. They were forced to eat a raw seagull to survive.

<P>
A crewman on the P&O ferry 'St Sunniva' died yesterday morning (FRI) while on passage from Aberdeen to Shetland.
<P>
John Russell Slater (40), 1 Sanquhar Mains, Forres, Morayshire, was a steward on the 4,000 tonne ship. 
<P>
Police said Mr Slater's colleagues became concerned at his condition when they went to waken him in his cabin shortly before six in the morning.
<P>
The captain immediately ordered extra speed and docked ahead of schedule at Lerwick, where a doctor and an ambulance were waiting at the quayside. But Mr Slater was pronounced dead just after 7.30am.
<P>
Shetland police said they understood he was a single man. There were no suspicious circumstances but a report on the sudden death would be sent to the procurator fiscal.

28th September 1996
<P>
The feud between retired Shetland council director John P. Nicolson and his former boss, chief executive Malcolm Green, reached new heights of bitterness yesterday (FRI).
<P>
Writing his first ever letter to 'The Shetland Times', the former leisure and recreation director accused the council chief of 'harshness and brutality' in his 'management style'.
<P>
Mr Nicolson said Mr Green did not reply to a request for a meeting to discuss the allegations earlier this year but had 'certainly told me very succinctly where to go' when he had complained on other occasions.
<P>
He had never been given details of the 'procedures' which Mr Green said existed for staff complaining of harassment.
<P>
Mr Nicolson, who was disciplined by Mr Green earlier this year after procedural confusion over 134,000 pounds of recreation grants, said he had suffered 'harassment and vindictiveness' in a 'bullying, over-bearing culture'.
<P>
His concern was for 'other council employees who ... might have less in the way of family and other support'.
<P>
He said so much power was now concentrated in the chief executive's office that Mr Green's position had become 'impregnable' and the position of other staff 'less secure'.
<P>
In a side-swipe at councillors who last week refused to overturn the disciplinary finding against him, Mr Nicolson said there was no 'political intervention at the appropriate level'.
<P>
'What we have now is the absence of very necessary checks and balances,' he said.
<P>
After criticism by five pro-Nicolson councillors during last week's secret council debate on the affair, Mr Green publicly denied the charge of vindictiveness. Yesterday his secretary said he was 'unavailable for comment' on the letter and referred calls to the elected council convener, Lewis Smith.
<P>
Mr Smith said he would consider whether to comment once he had studied the letter. 
<P>
Meanwhile Mr Nicolson has said he is willing to be a candidate at a Shetland Islands Council by-election in the island of Yell next month.

<P>
The Banff-registered fishing boat 'Wayfarer' sent out an emergency call in the early hours of yesterday (FRI) when a crewman suffered suspected appendicitis.
<P>
The Shetland Coastguard rescue helicopter flew 100 miles to the ship and winched up the casualty in high winds and heavy seas. He was later landed at the Gilbert Bain Hospital in Lerwick for treatment.
<P>
The crewman has not been named.
<P>
The 'Wayfarer' was on standby duty alongside the drilling rig 'Maersk Vinlander' in the East Shetland Basin oilfields.
<P>
The incident was the 57th callout this year for the Sumburgh rescue chopper operated by Bristows for the Coastguards.

27th September 1996
<P>
Those few Shetlanders who were awake at three am today (FRI) enjoyed a spectacular view of the total eclipse of the Moon.
<P>
After days of thick cloud, the sky over the islands suddenly cleared as the full moon rose on Thursday evening. By 3.20am BST the lunar eclipse was total, the first since April 1994.
<P>
Right on cue, a flock of migrating geese flew south over Bressay Sound, silhouetted against the pale orange moon.
<P>
Coastguards, police officers and port controllers at Lerwick and Sullom Voe were among the awed spectators.
<P>
At The Shetland News, grizzled old hack Jonathan Wills was so moved by the sight that he woke up his 10-year-old son Tom.
<P>
'I've finally found out how to wake that boy up,' he said. 'He was out of bed and at the window in seconds. If only we could have lunar eclipses in the mornings.'
<P>
And no-one got a picture. Or did they? If you did, please e-mail  <a href="mailto:editor@shetland-news.co.uk">editor@shetland-news.co.uk</a>  now!

27th September 1996
<P>
Svein-Ove Ask, who yesterday (THURS) spent a fourth day battling high winds and heavy seas north-east of Shetland, has hit back at critics of his attempt to row alone from Shetland to Norway during the equinoctial gales.
<P><A HREF="safety.jpg"><IMG SRC="safetys.jpg" ALIGN=left HSPACE=10 VSPACE=5></A>
In an open letter, written before he left Shetland on Sunday afternoon, and released in Norway yesterday (THURS) by his friend and spokesman Jonny Birkelund, Mr Ask (32) said the critics should back him or ban him:
<P>
'Never before have so many talked so much about which they know so little,' he said. 'Rescue Leader Sigurd Torp, at the Main Rescue Centre at Sola, Norway, commented to the newspaper ''Bergens Tidende'' in negative terms about my rowing expedition across the North Sea. 
<P>
'Totally without knowledge about my project, he says that crossing the North Sea is hazardous. As far as I know, a boat such as mine has never before been built in Norway. Torp and others who speak with expert knowledge cannot, based on experience, comment on the safety of a closed-compartment vessel like this. 
<P>
'I have learnt from previous errors and have found a solution which works very well safety-wise. This concept has been used in successful crossings of oceans far wider than the North Sea. A properly secure crossing of the North Sea is fully possible, even in bad weather. I maintain that the degree of difficulty is not very high, either,' he wrote.
<P>
Mr Ask said his safety equipment, including items compulsory on much larger vessels, could make the rescue service's work easier, and thus not 'tie up large resources', as Mr Torp had claimed.
<P>
Mr Torp and other critics should 'either accept that expeditions like this can still be allowed to take place' and help to make them absolutely safe, or 'work towards a total prohibition'.
<P><A HREF="safety2.jpg"><IMG SRC="safety2s.jpg" ALIGN=right HSPACE=10 VSPACE=5></A>
Mr Ask, a journalist and boat repair expert, is attempting to become the first man to row from Norway to Shetland and back. His 19-foot 'Nordfjording' boat is custom-made, combining thousand-year-old wooden boat building traditions with modern materials such as divinycell and epoxy.
<P>
In contrast to their Norwegian counterparts, Shetland Coastguards have praised his safety precautions, while saying they wished they could have dissuaded him from putting to sea.
<P>
Mr Ask estimated the 200 mile crossing would take 15 days at most but on Day Five yesterday (THURS) continuing southerly gales were still driving him north rather than east.
<P>
As he crossed the Greenwich meridian at 61 degrees north yesterday (THURS), winds were forecast to ease to near-gale force seven and veer south-westerly, allowing him to start clawing east towards the oilfields midway between Shetland and Norway.

27th September 1996
<P>
Shetland's council leader has renewed demands for a salvage tug to be stationed in the islands during the winter months, after discovering that a Government report favours the idea.
<P>
As the first of the winter gales swept over Shetland yesterday (WED) Convener Lewis Smith published his letter to Viscount Goschen, the shipping minister, complaining that the Department of Transport had 'taken no action' on the findings of Captain Chris Belton RN.
<P>
Capt. Belton carried out a review of salvage tugs around the British coast after the tanker 'Braer' broke down and went aground on the southern tip of Shetland in January 1993, spilling 85,000 tonnes of oil.
<P>
Mr Smith said councillors were 'gravely concerned' at the lack of progress in the past three years, in view of Capt. Belton's recommendation for an emergency towing vessel to help disabled tankers in and around the Fair Isle Channel.
<P>
'There is essentially no difference between the towage and salvage provision in this area before and after the Braer,' Mr Smith wrote.
<P>
He noted that a similar recommendation for a tug in the Western Approaches was 'apparently similarly ignored until the 'Sea Empress' incident brought that omission to prominence'.
<P>
He said the 'Sea Empress' had 'again drawn attention to the futility of depending on harbour tugs for salvage'.
<P>
<h4><b>Port boss criticises tanker tracking scheme</b></h4>
<P>
Meanwhile Captain George Sutherland, marine director for the Shetland council, has criticised a new Department of Transport scheme for electronic tagging of tankers.
<P>
In a report published yesterday (THURS) for next week's meeting of the council's marine operations committee, Capt. Sutherland says the new Automatic Ship Identification and Reporting System (AIRS) is 'embryonic' and 'parochial', being limited to the range of coastal VHF radio - 40-miles or so.
<P>
He wants AIRS tried out on Sullom Voe oil terminal tankers but says it may not be compatible with ship-tracking technology in Norway and other countries.
<P>
He believes it will be 'well into the next century' before there is a universal, internationally agreed radar surveillance system to tell shore authorities where individual tankers are at any one time.
<P>
Capt. Sutherland also calls again for changes to the wording on nautical charts showing the 'Areas To Be Avoided' (ATBAs) by large vessels around the Shetland coast. He thinks tankers not carrying oil should be subject to the same rules as laden ships, because they commonly carry thousands of tonnes of contaminated ballast water and fuel oil.
<P>
He complains that passing ships do not have to observe the same safety routeing procedures as Sullom Voe tankers and warns of the 'continuing potential' for head-on collisions on the edge of the ATBAs.
<P>
Councillors are asked to re-affirm their marine safety policies and to continue lobbying efforts nationally and internationally.

<P>
A change in the wind allowed Norwegian rower Svein Ove Ask to make  some headway to the eastwards yesterday (WED) on his attempt to row  alone from Shetland to Norway.
<P>
But he was still way off course after three days of adverse weather  and faces another gale at sea tonight (THURS).
<P>
Although he has rowed an estimated 75 miles since leaving Lerwick on  Sunday, Mr Ask's last reported position was only 20 miles north-east  of the Muckle Flugga lighthouse at the northern tip of Shetland. He  still has 160 miles to go.
<P>
Yesterday morning he radioed Shetland Coastguards to say all was well  after a night of high winds and heavy seas.
<P>
Last night the wind eased and veered south-westerly, allowing him to  row due east. 
<P>
The offshore marine forecast for tonight shows renewed southerly  gales, with gusts to severe gale force nine and waves up to 25 feet high.

26th September 1996
<P>
The Aberdeen-based airline Business Air are pulling out of Shetland, leaving Loganair's franchised British Airways Express operation with a monopoly on air routes to the isles.
<P>
The decision means fewer daily flights and poorer connections for travellers and comes on top of British Airways' recent announcement that they are quitting the far north after half a century.
<P>
The news of the third shake-up in island air services in five months was broken to councillors and other members of Shetland's tourism advisory panel by Loganair managing director Scott Grier in Lerwick yesterday (WED) afternoon.
<P>
Tourism director Maurice Mullay said: 'I'm very disappointed although it's not entirely unexpected ... It means a cut from seven to five return flights a day but we hope the lower cost operation may eventually mean lower fares. We're going to miss Business Air as they've been first-class partners in promoting Shetland tourism.'
<P>
Councillor Tavish Scott said Business Air's decision created a monopoly and gave a poorer service which was not in the best interests of Shetland: 'It can't be good news,' he said. 'Business Air forced some price competition on the route.' He said councillors would be keeping a sharp eye on Loganair/BA Express fares.
<P>
Business Air founder and managing director Ian Woodley confirmed last night (WED) they would cease operations to Sumburgh Airport from October 26, after three years of flying to the islands.
<P>
Mr Woodley expressed 'regret' at the decision: 'We gave British Airways a run for their money but neither BA nor Business Air was making a profit,' he said. 
<P>
'This may well be the opportunity for the services to the islands to begin to run on a viable basis.'
<P>
'I don't think there will necessarily be a diminution of service,' he said, although he admitted connections with ongoing flights would 'not be 100 per cent'. Passengers' bookings and fares would be honoured when they were transferred to British Airways Express.
<P>
Mr Grier, who has 20 years' experience of the Loganair operation in the Northern and Western Isles, said British Airways Express would adopt the British Airways' fare structure, including discount and promotional fares.
<P>
Referring to recent criticism by Scots Industry Minister George Kynoch, Mr Grier said: 'The perception of air fares is that they're very high. In fact a very high proportion of passengers are on discounted or promotional fares. We'll be looking for ways to offer lower fares and we'll give passengers a fair deal. But it's more important now to get the operation up and running smoothly.'
<P>
He agreed with Mr Woodley there was 'over-capacity' on the route. He promised inter-island flights operated by Loganair for BA Express would continue as normal.
<P>
British Airways Express would operate a winter timetable of five return flights a day between  Aberdeen and Sumburgh, Mr Grier said. Three would use 64-seat ATP aircraft, one flight a 34-seater Saab 340 and the fifth a Short 360.
<P>
'We feel we've got quite a strong product. We hope to make as many onward connections as possible and we recognise the importance of the air services for tourism,' said Mr Grier, a member of the Scottish Tourist Board.
<P>
Tourism director Mullay said Mr Grier knew the islands well and had said he was willing to listen: 'We've always had a good relationship with him,' he said.
<P>
Yesterday's (WED) news contradicted Business Air's promises when they were taken over by Airlines of Britain in April this year. A Business Air spokeswoman said then: 'It's Business Air as usual. Competition on the routes to the islands will continue.'
<P>
Last month British Airways decided to pull out of six loss-making routes to the Scottish islands, handing over to the BA Express franchise operation run by the Airlines of Britain Group, which  includes Loganair and Business Air.
<P>
BA's chief executive, Bob Ayling, said at the time that the national airline had experienced 'almost 50 unprofitable' years' in the Northern and Western Isles.

26th September 1996
<P>
Two Shetland fishermen are furious about a killer net which fouled their gear east of Shetland earlier this week.
<P><A HREF="mononet.jpg"><IMG SRC="mononets.jpg" ALIGN=left HSPACE=10 VSPACE=5></A>
Brothers Stanley and Steven Gray were dredging for scallops east of the island of Bressay with their boats 'Sola Gratia' and 'Elly Gerda' when Steven's gear caught on the tangled lump of nylon monofilament drift net.
<P>
'It destroyed a day's fishing,' Stanley said yesterday (WED). 'It took eight hours to clear it. We suspect it was lost by a big foreign boat. This stuff is incredibly destructive and ought to be banned.'
<P>
The net was landed at Morrison Dock in Lerwick. Entangled in the pile of mesh, six feet across and three feet high, were dozens of prawns, fish and big crabs.
<P>
A spokesman for the Scottish Fisheries Department said it was legal for British boats to carry monofilament nets outside the six-mile limit, and foreign vessels outside 12 miles.
<P>
John Uttley of Scottish Natural Heritage said they had previously expressed concern about the use of monofilament nets because of the damage to seals, porpoises and dolphins which cannot see the fine nylon mesh in time to avoid becoming trapped in it.
<P>
'These nets, when fishing or when lost, have the potential to entangle all sorts of wildlife, including cetaceans, seals and seabirds,' he said. Monofilament nets had been blamed for the deaths of dolphins off the Irish coast.
<P>
'They're selective at fishing, in that they only catch larger fish, but they're very non-selective on big sea mammals and seabirds,' Mr Uttley said.
<P>
The Gray brothers said the incident was the final straw for them after they suffered severe losses because of the 'Braer' tanker pollution three years ago.
<P>
'There are no scallops left in the south of Shetland because of pollution and only small shells in the north because it was overfished when boats had to move north after the Braer,' Stanley Gray said. They had not received full compensation and planned to sell up and switch to cockle dredging with a smaller boat.
<P>
'You can't make a living any more at the scallops, even without discarded monofilament nets fouling your gear,' he said.

The Government has installed equipment to identify and track oil tankers around Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles - but not enough ships are volunteering for electronic tagging, according to the civil servant in charge of the scheme.
<P>
Steve Harding, project officer at the Marine Safety Agency (MSA), said yesterday (TUES) that a major foreign tanker owner, trading to the Shetland oil port of Sullom Voe, had converted its fleet but many others had not.
<P>
'The coastal stations are set up. It's all effective and working and we're just waiting for people to come and join us,' he said. The UK Government hoped all tankers and other vessels carrying hazardous cargoes would meet the target date of 1999, proposed by Britain at the International Maritime Organisation (IMO).
<P>
It is understood that it cost less than 80,000 pounds to set up the three receiving stations - a small fraction of the price tag on a coastal radar system. 
<P>
The MSA project uses the same principle as the radio transponders fitted to civil airliners for decades past. In the USA, similar technology tracks hire cars and railway containers, as well as tagging criminals on parole.
<P>
Mr Harding said the beauty of the MSA's automatic ship identification and reporting system (AIRS) was that it linked VHF radio and satellite navigation equipment already installed on most tankers. 
<P>
All shipowners had to do was convert their onboard computers. Coastguard stations could then pinpoint the ship's position, identify the vessel and hopefully avoid unpleasant surprises like the 'Braer' tanker wreck.
<P>
Lord Donaldson's inquiry into ship safety recommended such a system in 1994, a year after the 'Braer' broke down unseen on a dark January morning and later drifted ashore on Shetland, causing extensive pollution.
<P>
Northern Isles MP Jim Wallace last night congratulated the Marine Safety Agency on its achievement: 'I'm always prepared to give credit where credit's due,' he said. 'In Shetland we've been calling for a transponder system since before the Braer went aground.' 
<P>
Mr Wallace said the Government should now put the pressure on the IMO and, failing agreement there, the European Union could require all large ships to convert to the system.
<P>
Mr Harding said the AIRS equipment had been installed since March to cover the Fair Isle Channel, the Pentland Firth and the North Minch, using stations at Compass Head (Shetland), Dunnett Head (Caithness) and Melvaig.
<P>
'It only costs around 500 pounds to convert a ship's computer,' he said. 'The clever bit is that the equipment only responds automatically if the ship is in the area you want to cover, so you can avoid clogging up your receiver with too many signals.'
<P>
Yesterday (TUES) at least one mariner was using a similar system off the Shetland coast to send his position to Norwegian Coastguards. Solo rower Svein Ove Ask was pulling in the general direction of Bergen, as a satellite logged his position from signals sent by a tiny transponder on board his 19 foot boat.

25th September 1996
<P>
A former Shetland council director who took early retirement after a row with the council's chief executive last night (TUES) declared himself ready to stand at next month's by-election in the island of Yell.
<P>
John P. Nicolson said he was willing to be nominated for the poll on November 14 to replace Councillor Peter Guy as member for Yell South. 
<P>
As director of leisure and recreation, Mr Nicolson formerly reported to Mr Guy, who has chaired the leisure and recreation committee for the past two years. 
<P>
'I'm very interested in standing if I get enough electors to nominate me,' Mr Nicolson said. 'I know something about the workings of the council, I think I could do a reasonable job for South Yell and I have an awful lot of friends among the Yell folk.'
<P>
Mr Nicolson said if elected he would 'set aside' any hard feelings or 'sour grapes' about the circumstances of his departure from the department he ran for 21 years. He was recently disciplined by chief executive Malcolm Green after an investigation into procedural confusion about 134,000 pounds' worth of grants to recreation projects. Councillors rejected his appeal.
<P>
'Vindictiveness gets you nowhere,' he said last night, 'but there are things that need to be done for the good of the community as a whole.'
<P>
Mr Nicolson would not be the first Shetland council director to stand for election. His former colleague Peter Malcolmson won a Lerwick seat for the Liberal Democrats in 1994 after an acrimonious dispute which led to him leaving his post as social work director.
<P>
As officials made arrangements for the Yell South poll, council leader Lewis Smith yesterday paid tribute to Mr Guy, who is leaving the islands after his recent bereavement and intends to start a new life in North Yorkshire.
<P>
'Peter has been an enthusiastic and hard-working councillor,' Convener Smith said. 'He has served his constituents well and played a full part in the life of the council.'
<P>
As chairman of the Leisure and Recreation Committee and of the licensing board, Mr Guy had shown 'considerable ability and a flair for conceiving new and imaginative initiatives', Mr Smith said.
<P>
'The council joins the community in thanking Peter Guy for his commitment to Shetland and we wish him well in the future.'
<P>
Maurice Mullay, chief executive of Shetland Islands Tourism, also expressed regret at Mr Guy's departure. As an enthusiastic chairman of the new tourist authority he had been a great asset to the islands.

25th September 1996
<P>
Solo rower Svein Ove Ask was blown off course yesterday (TUES) as his bid to row back to Norway from Shetland ran into heavy weather.
<P>
The 32-year-old Norwegian journalist hauled on his oars all day, against heavy seas and southerly winds gusting to gale force eight, but only succeeded in slowing his northerly drift. 
<P>
As night fell, Mr Ask and his tiny boat 'Ingolf Arnasson' were still just 15 miles off Unst, the most northerly Shetland island. Once past Unst, he has no chance of returning to Shetland unless there is a dramatic improvement in the weather.
<P>
Last night the weather was deteriorating, with waves of up to 40 feet and gales reaching Force 10 forecast tomorrow in sea area Viking, between Shetland and Norway.
<P>
The oarsman carries food and water for 20 days. He said before he left Lerwick on Sunday that he was hoping the wind would veer south-westerly, allowing him to make headway to the east. 
<P>
Mr Ask's average course during the first 48 hours of the planned 10-day, 200-mile crossing is taking him towards Lofoten, 600 miles north-east of Shetland and far to the north of his intended landfall at the fishing port of Maloy.
<P>
In June he rowed alone from Maloy to Lerwick, the first man to achieve the feat since 1969.

25th September 1996
<P>
Two Bulgarian refugees in Shetland heard yesterday (TUES) that the Home Office still wants to deport them, despite a recent grant of political asylum.
<P>
A spokeswoman in London confirmed that Home Secretary Michael Howard was asking the Immigration Appeals Tribunal to reverse a decision by an adjudicator in favour of Georgi Spasov and Dmitar Dmitrov earlier this month.
<P>
The two men led a strike on board a fish factory ship in Lerwick last year and say they fear persecution and imprisonment by former Communists, if returned to Bulgaria. 
<P>
They have the support of island church groups, trade unionists, councillors and Orkney and Shetland MP Jim Wallace, but Mr Howard's officials decided to deport them in June. Mr Spasov and Mr Dmitrov successfully appealed to an immigration hearing in Glasgow.
<P>
Yesterday Mr Dmitrov was working on a Shetland building site. He took the news calmly but did not want to say anything that might antagonise the immigration authorities.
<P>
Both men are working for Lerwick building contractor WAG Construction (Shetland) Ltd, where director Mrs Mary Leask said the firm did not wish to comment, 'for fear of jeopardising their case'.
<P>
Lerwick interpreter Derek Herning, who has worked unpaid on the case for over a year, said: 'It's a disappointment but it was half expected. I didn't think the Home Office would let us get away with this.'
<P>
Canon Lewis Smith, convener of Shetland Islands Council, said he was 'disappointed but not surprised' by Mr Howard's move.
<P>
'Georgi and Dmitar are members of our community now and Shetland wants them to stay,' said the canon who, as rector of St Magnus Episcopal Church in Lerwick, acted as pastor to the 'Rotalia' crew during their exile in Shetland.
<P>
'They've already presented their case successfully and I trust they'll be able to achieve the same outcome when the appeal is heard,' he said.
<P>
The two men were represented at the hearing last month by solicitor Paul Seils of the Scottish Refugee Council. Their victory was seen as a major diplomatic blow for the Sofia government, dominated by ex-Communists, and for British Home Secretary Michael Howard. 
<P>
Bulgaria is on the 'white list' of countries which, in Mr Howard's opinion, do not threaten the civil rights of their citizens.
<P>
When they were granted political asylum on September 12, Mr Seils said the decision vindicated the two Bulgarians' 'realistic' fears of persecution. 
<P>
'The Home Secretary has been naive in his assessment of the way ... the Bulgarian government operates,' Mr Seils said. It was 'patent nonsense' that no-one had a justified fear of persecution in a 'white list' country such as Bulgaria.
<P>
Mr Seils was not at his office to comment yesterday (TUES) but it is understood that the appeal may be heard in about 10 days' time. 
<P>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>Background to the Bulgarian saga:</h2>
<P>
Mr Spasov and Mr Dmitrov were on the four-man strike committee which led protests at living conditions aboard the Bulgarian fish processing ship, or klondyker, 'Rotalia', stranded without fuel or supplies at Lerwick during the winter of 1994/95. 
<P>
The crew were backed by the Bulgarian Seafarers' Union, the International Transport Workers' Federation and Euro-MPs including Winnie Ewing and European Union president Klaus Hensch.
<P>
After a three-month strike for arrears of wages, dating back three years, most of the crew accepted repatriation in April last year. But the privatised state shipping company Okeanskiy Ribolov then reneged on a deal brokered by Jim Wallace MP, and did not pay the men all they were owed.
<P>
Mr Herning has been in regular touch with Bulgaria and says many of the repatriated crew are still unemployed. Strike leader Jordan Jordanov, who returned to the port of Burgas to pursue claims against the company, has been bankrupted, his marriage has ended and he has lost his home. 
<P>
Mr Jordanov has now been forced by lack of funds to close an office he had opened and it is increasingly difficult to get in touch with him, Mr Herning says.
<P>
Home Secretary Michael Howard is himself the son of two pre-war refugees from oppression in Romania. There has been speculation that his parents would not have been permitted to remain in the UK under Mr Howard's strict new immigration rules.
<P>
Scots Liberal Democrat leader Jim Wallace MP last night called on Mr Howard to relent.
<P>
'The Home Secretary should have the good grace to accept the decision (to grant political asylum),' Mr Wallace said. 'The Government already puts plenty of hurdles in the way of genuine asylum seekers like Georgi and Dmitar, when they have already satisfied the adjudication officer.
<P>
'They should just be allowed to stay,' he said.
<P>
Shetland Trades Council chairman Coin Mackay said: 'When Bulgaria's ambassador to the United Nations accuses his own government of being behind attempts to kill him, it wakes you wonder what Mr Howard is talking about.'

24th September 1996
<P>
An optical illusion sent a search and rescue team on a wild Solan Goose chase yesterday (MON).
<P>
The crew of the Shetland Coastguard helicopter 'Lima Charlie' were on a training exercise near the bird reserve island of Noss when they saw what appeared to be orange smoke from a marine distress flare.
<P>
For over half an hour they searched the rocks below the 600-foot cliffs, looking for shipwrecked mariners, but found nothing except thousands of Gannets, also known as Solan Geese.
<P>
Returning to the spot where they had originally seen the 'flare', the truth dawned: the illusion had been created by a patch of sunlight on the birds' droppings which encrust the cliffs, making a streak of white guano look orange.

24th September 1996
<P>
A Shetland councillor last night (MON) resigned his seat because he is moving to North Yorkshire.
<P>
Councillor Peter Guy, who was widowed last year, said he had 'a great love for the islands' and deciding about his future had been very hard: 'It's probably one of the most difficult decisions I've ever taken in my life,' he said.
<P>
Mr Guy, who hails originally from Cornwall, won the Mid and South Yell seat as an independent at a by-election in 1993 and was re-elected unopposed the following year. He is chairman of the council's Leisure and Recreation Committee, and also chairs the islands' licensing board and tourist authority.
<P>
Mr Guy and his late wife Christine, a much-loved music teacher in the island of Yell, first came to Shetland more than 20 years ago when he was posted as an air force officer to the RAF Saxa Vord radar station in the island of Unst.
<P>
On leaving the RAF, Mr Guy worked for BP's Sullom Voe oil terminal, serving as the company's Shetland press officer for many years.
<P>
A great outdoors enthusiast, he is well known in the islands as author of the 'Walking the Coastline of Shetland' guidebooks. 
<P>
In a letter of resignation, Mr Guy said he would cease to be a councillor from September 30, but would return to Shetland on holiday as often as he could.
<P>
Mr Guy's council ward is due to be amalgamated with neighbouring North Yell at the next council elections in May 1999.
<P>
There is speculation that retired council leisure director John P. Nicolson may be asked to stand at the by-election caused by Mr Guy's departure.

24th September 1996
<P><A HREF="coffee1.jpg"><IMG SRC="coffee1s.jpg" ALIGN=left WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=216 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=5></A>
Lone Norwegian rower Svein Ove Ask last night (MON) enjoyed a flask of hot coffee, some chocolate bars and a daily paper - delivered by Coastguard helicopter.
<P>
The crew of the Sumburgh-based search and rescue helicopter were on exercise east of Shetland when they rendezvoused with the intrepid oarsman's 19 foot boat.
<P>
Mr Ask was well and cheerful, 24 hours into his 200-mile row home to Norway. Despite rowing 35 miles since he left Lerwick on Friday afternoon, adverse winds had driven him north along the Shetland coast and he was still only six miles out to sea.
<P><A HREF="coffee2.jpg"><IMG SRC="coffee2s.jpg" ALIGN=right WIDTH=252 HEIGHT=153 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=5></A>
Shetland News photographer Graeme Storey, who was on the helicopter Lima Charlie, said Mr Ask told them by radio he was 'doing fine, with no problems and quite happy'. He 'looked in the pink' and was astonished and delighted when the helicopter appeared overhead and lowered a bag with supplies.
<P>
Last night Mr Ask was making some headway in choppy waves and a Force 6 southerly wind, east of the offlying islands of Out Skerries.
<P>
Mr Ask is attempting to become the first man to row from Norway to Shetland and back. He made the westbound crossing in 10 days at the end of June. Norwegian Coastguards are tracking his progress by satellite.

24th September 1996
<P>
Archaeologists have uncovered a 2,000 year old Iron Age farm in the Shetland island of Yell.
<P>
At the end of a four week excavation for Historic Scotland, at Bayanne House, Sellafirth, Shetland Amenity Trust archaeologist Val Turner said yesterday (MON) they had found an Iron Age house which appeared to be the same age as the Shetland brochs - round tower forts from around the time of Christ.
<P>
'It's come as something of a surprise to both the archaeological team and Sellafirth residents alike, as the field which covered it was completely flat, with no stone visible,' she said.
<P>
The coastal site is being eroded by the sea and has been known about since the 1880s, when it was dug into and tools were found.
<P>
This summer's dig by freelance archaeologists Hazel Moore and Graeme Wilson has revealed several floor levels of a house which had been repeatedly rebuilt.
<P>
Ms Moore said they uncovered a complex of walls and middens, and a small, flimsy structure on top, with a stone tank and a hearth inside: 'This seems to have been a shelter, possibly for Iron Age fishermen preparing shellfish for bait.'
<P>
Geophysical survey by experts Alan Stapf and Michele Graham suggests there are far more substantial remains that at first thought, Ms Turner said.
<P>
The finds include burnished pottery. Ms Turner said: 'I've never seen anything quite as fine as this before. It may even have been imported.'
<P>
Site owners Tony and Liz Gott are said to be delighted with the discovery and hope it will eventually become a visitor attraction.

24th September 1996
<P>
by Rob Edwards
<P>
(a version of this report also appeared in 'Scotland on Sunday')
<P>
After the Osprey wave power machine was wrecked by the power of the waves, a few days after being installed off Dounreay last summer, it was hard to imagine that anything else could go wrong. But, in line with Murphy's ineluctable Law, it has.
<P>
Wreckage salvaged from the seabed over the last four months has repeatedly turned out to be contaminated with radioactivity from the Dounreay nuclear plant. On four occasions since May, monitoring by Dounreay scientists has discovered contamination by caesium 137 on sections of the crumpled 800 tonne device.
<P>
'This is another damning example of the environmental damage being caused by Dounreay,' said Graham Stein from Friends of the Earth Scotland.  'The nuclear industry has blocked the development of wave power in the past. That it should now pollute it as well is like rubbing salt into the wound.'
<P>
Dounreay's spokesman, Morris Grant, said that the contamination originated from 'historical discharges' from the plant's outfall pipe. What he described as 'small spots' of caesium 137 were found on material salvaged from Osprey on 29May, 10 June, 11 June and 2 July.
<P>
Grant said that the highest level of radioactivity measured was 'less than 500becquerels'. Particles containing over a million becquerels of radio activity found on the Dounreay foreshore in the past were regarded by heath experts as potentially lethal.
<P>
Osprey was developed by an Inverness company, Applied Research and Technology(ART), at a cost of 4 million pounds with the aim of generating 3.5 megawatts of electricity. Its massive steel structure collapsed onto the seabed 300 metres offshore in the Pentland Firth in August last year, after unfilled ballast tanks were 'crushed like empty coke cans' by unexpectedly powerful waves.
<P>
Osprey, which stands for Ocean Swell Powered Renewable Energy, was deliberately sited near Dounreay so that it could make use of the nuclear plant's power lines for connection to the electricity grid. The sea there was also thought to have a 'suitable wave power regime' for the generation of power.
<P>
ART brushes aside any suggestion that the Osprey project is ill-fated, and plans to install a revamped 'Osprey 2' in the same place next summer. 'The company is more than happy with the site and will demonstrate its confidence by going back there with Osprey 2,' said a spokesperson for ART. 'The site is excellent for the company's purposes.' 
<P>
Before the first Osprey was installed, the Scottish Office's Industrial Pollution Inspectorate warned that laying its power cable across the beach at Dounreay risked radioactive contamination. There were delays in towing the device up from where it was made on the Clyde because of a tug failure. And during Osprey's launching ceremony, a bottle of 12-year old malt whisky only broke at the second attempt.

23rd September 1996
<P><A HREF="svein3.jpg"><IMG SRC="svein3s.jpg" ALIGN=left HSPACE=10 VSPACE=5></A>
A 32-year-old Norwegian oarsman was alone with a bag of prunes on the North Sea last night (SUN).
<P>
Svein Ove Ask, a journalist from Nordfjordur, is bidding to become the first man to row solo from Norway to Shetland and back.
<P><A HREF="svein2.jpg"><IMG SRC="svein2s.jpg" ALIGN=right HSPACE=10 VSPACE=5></A>
He made the 10-day westbound crossing in June at his sixth attempt, on a diet of prunes, cereals and liver pate.
<P>
Yesterday, after his last hot meal for 10 days - a Sunday roast at a friend's house in Lerwick - he climbed into his tiny boat and pulled east into a head wind, with a bag of prunes in his locker and a pat on the back from Shetland Coastguards.
<P><A HREF="svein7.jpg"><IMG SRC="svein7s.jpg" ALIGN=left HSPACE=10 VSPACE=5></A>
District Officer Les Snaith said Mr Ask had taken as many safety precautions as he could. 
<P>
'We're better able now to offer advice to others because we've learnt so much from the way Svein has prepared his boat,' Mr Snaith said.
<P><A HREF="svein6.jpg"><IMG SRC="svein6s.jpg" ALIGN=right HSPACE=10 VSPACE=5></A>
Mr Ask, father of two small boys, said it might seem dangerous but he was very safety-conscious: 'Safety is everything, and I have two Global Positioning Systems, two emergency beacons, an emergency radar transponder, and I'm using an 'Argos' satellite positioning beacon all the time on my way over.
<P>
'My boat is also my lifeboat, and it has a lot of buoyancy in it. Over 500 kgs of buoyancy, so it will float even if it capsizes.
<P><A HREF="svein9.jpg"><IMG SRC="svein9s.jpg" ALIGN=left HSPACE=10 VSPACE=5></A>
'It will take me maybe 8 to 10 days, but this depends on the weather. I have enough food for 20 days, and water too. I don't count how many miles I have done, I count how few I have left to do. Every ten miles I think that is now only 170, or 160 miles to go. It is better to count down this way,' Mr Ask said.
<P>
Last night the weather forecast was for strong, contrary winds and choppy seas on the lone rower's intended route.

21st September 1996
<P>
The future of a Church of Scotland old folks' home in Shetland is still in doubt, after councillors failed to turn up at a meeting of their charitable trust yesterday (FRI).
<P>
The trust was due to discuss the Kirk's 882,000 pounds grant application for the Walter & Joan Gray Eventide Home in Scalloway, but 15 of the 26 councillor trustees were absent on other business.
<P>
Chairman Bill Manson, the trust chairman, said they were one short of a quorum and the meeting would have to be postponed. He would consider using his delegated powers as chairman, if necessary to avoid delay to the Kirk's plan to rebuild the home.
<P>
Shetland Islands Council has already approved the 50 per cent grant for the home and yesterday's abortive meeting had been seen as a foregone conclusion.
<P>
Councillor Florence Grains said the absence of so many councillors from the trust meeting was 'totally disgraceful'.
<P>
'When you stand for the council you give a commitment and you should honour that commitment,' she said.
<P>
Councillor Magnus Flaws said many members were away on council business. All but four of the absentees had sent apologies.
<P>
Mr Manson said it was the first time in his experience that the trust had been inquorate.

Thirty electrical engineers from all over Europe have been on an expedition to a windswept Shetland hill, to see experiments on new power line designs which could make Christmas power cuts just a bad memory - and also save the lives of hundreds of swans. 
<P>
E.A.Technology Ltd, the research arm of the electricity generating companies, is testing hydro poles made from composite materials which won't rot or snap like wooden poles in winter storms.
<P>
Dr Brian Wareing and his colleagues are also experimenting with new transmission lines, conductors and insulators which can survive repeated assaults by Shetland's wet snow, salt spray and hurricane-force winds.
<P>
Susetter Hill, near the village of Voe, has some of the worst weather in Europe, according to Dr Wareing, a world expert on ice and snow on power lines. It rivals the wicked climate at other EA Technology research stations on Rannoch Moors and in the Dumfriesshire hills.
<P>
'We're testing gear from various manufacturers, including British firms, and we think we could have some world-beaters here,' Dr Wareing said. 'A side benefit is that geese and swans seem to be able to see the insulated transmission cables we're using and are less likely to kill themselves, and cause power outages, by flying into the wires.'
<P>
Video cameras and sensors on the equipment record what happens to the poles in sleet storms and sudden, violent changes of wind speed and direction. A computer in a portacabin squirts the information down a phone line to a laboratory in Chester, where the scientists work out which equipment has the best chance of survival.
<P>
Frank Otto, from the Dresden Electricity in eastern Germany, was impressed with what he saw: 'We have a lot of old concrete poles in rural areas and we're very interested in replacements that will last longer.'
<P>
Norweb engineer Graham Whitfield flew north from Manchester to see the test site. 'We have some pretty extreme weather in east Lancashire but I reckon if something can stand the winters here in Shetland it's good enough for Norweb,' he said.
<P>
The tests have shown that insulated cables cut down corrosion caused by salt spray on coastal power lines. Another promising device uses strimmer wire to reduce wind vibration on insulators, a major cause of failure.
<P>
Dr Wareing and his colleague Dr Steve Stocks are trying out tapered, hollow fibreglass poles which flex up two feet in high winds. The walls of the tubes thicken as the diameter narrows: 'It's like an aircraft's wing: if it bends it won't snap,' Dr Stocks explained.
<P>
These man-made materials might seem environmentally unfriendly but they should last 50 years, will save on forests and can be re-cycled, he said: 'We have to import all our wooden poles from Scandinavia because we can't grow them in Britain. And you shouldn't burn the old ones in your Rayburn anyway, because they're impregnated with arsenic.'
<P>
The scientists' only regret was that the weather failed to perform on cue for the visitors to the company's biggest UK test site: 'It was a lovely sunny day with light winds,' Dr Wareing said. 'But I'm sure it'll get worse as soon as our guests have departed.'
<P>
Sure enough, as the visiting engineers left for the airport a stiff easterly wind sprang up and Susetter Hill was once more shrouded in low cloud.
<P>
Last Christmas much of Shetland was without power for up to five days when blizzards felled dozens of wooden hydro poles. Scottish Hydro Electric admitted they did not reacted to the emergency as fast as they should have, and promised an improved service.

20th September 1996
<P>
Councillors will meet in private at noon today (FRI) to hear a progress report from SIC chief executive Malcolm Green on Sullom Voe's bid to handle oil shipments from the Schiehallion field - the second of the new Atlantic oilfields.
<P>
Schiehallion is due to go on stream in 1998 and BP's Sullom Voe oil terminal is pushing hard for the contract to receive oil via shuttle tankers which will load in the open ocean.
<P>
Sullom Voe failed to win the shipments from the nearby Foinaven field, 100 miles west of Scalloway. BP awarded the contract to Elf Aquitaine's Flotta terminal in Orkney. But Foinaven has been delayed 12 months by technical problems - and the growing realisation in the industry that the weather west of Shetland is more severe than in the northern North Sea.
<P>
The council's recent deal with the oil companies, to ensure the future of Sullom Voe's East Shetland Basin trade, means councillors are now committed to working in partnership with BP to promote the Shetland terminal.
<P>
The agenda for the meeting give no details of what is to be discussed.
<P>
Meanwhile, there are reports that BP have had a very successful test on their Clair field, lying north of Schiehallion and in shallower water, closer to shore. Industry speculation suggests Clair may start pumping oil through a floating production and storage vessel before the year 2000. The field is so large that longer-term exploitation of the reserves will require a pipeline, but technical problems remain with extracting oil from the very complicated subsea geology 40 miles west of Eshaness.
<P>
Council insiders believe the third pipeline into Sullom Voe could trigger an entirely new deal with the industry, possibly bringing major financial benefits to the islands.

20th September 1996
<P>
The 50 islanders of Foula are still waiting for their new ferry, six years after Shetland Islands Council started to build a boat which could be based there in a purpose-built harbour.
<P>
The latest snag is the Plimsoll Line painted on the side of the 'New Advance' - launched recently at Richardson's yard in Stromness, Orkney, but unable to sail for Foula because of paperwork problems. The boat was due to be delivered last weekend.
<P>
Reports from Orkney say the boat sits too low in the water when fully loaded and the Shetland council is refusing to accept her until she meets the specification in every particular. Safety regulations insist that the Plimsoll Line must always be clear of the water.
<P>
The council wasted 400,000 pounds three years ago on an abortive, attempt to build a ferry for the exposed crossing from the Shetland mainland to Foula. The 'Westering Homewards' has since been re-named and handed over to the North Atlantic Fisheries College in Scalloway, as a training vessel. The second attempt has also cost around 400,000 pounds.
<P>
Foula councillor Jim Gear said yesterday (THURS) he was 'concerned' about the latest hold-up, but delays were something Foula had got used to: 'Having it here and having it right is more important than having it tomorrow,' the ever-patient Mr Gear said on local BBC radio.
<P>
It is understood that one possible reason for the problems is the weight of mandatory safety equipment, which has increased the displacement of the 'New Advance', whose size was limited by the need to lift her out of the water when based in Foula during the winter months.
<P>
Councillors are anxious to avoid a second 'Foula ferry fiasco'.

20th September 1996
<P>
Sixteen Scottish councils campaigning against nuclear hazards have called on the UK Government to ban flights carrying radioactive waste to the Dounreay reprocessing plant on the northern tip of Scotland.
<P>
Dounreay has countered by inviting protesters to come and see for themselves.
<P>
The Scottish Nuclear-free Local Authorities organisation (NFLAS) says the flights to Wick airport are risky because:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Containers used for the waste could burst in a crash;
<P>
<li>There is no compulsory routing for planes landing at Wick;
<P>
<li>Radar cover in the area is less than 100 per cent;
<P>
<li>Military aircraft frequently use the same airspace, increasing the risk of mid-air collision;
</ul>
<P>
A report by Greenpeace and NFLAS says eight of the 47 known radioactive flights to Wick since 1991 took place during military exercises, 'implying no account is taken of the increased risks during these periods'.
<P>
The report says military flights in the area are expected to increase by about 28 per cent during the next two years: 'The possibility of nuclear flights encountering unannounced high speed military jet traffic in this area cannot be ignored.'
<P>
At a meeting in Shetland this week, NFLAS Convener, Shetland Islands Councillor Bertie Black, condemned the International Atomic Energy Agency's decision to allow nuclear materials to be flown in flasks which can only withstand a 30 mph impact:
<P>
'The whole idea behind the flask design was supposed to be that, no matter what the accident or transport mode, no radioactivity would be released. Clearly that cannot be the case with the obsolete type B flask.
<P>
'Little or no attention has been given to the risks posed by the high level of military flights in the vicinity of Wick. Should a jet collide with an air transport bound for Wick then the whole area would be showered in deadly radioactive waste,' Mr Black said.
<P>
'That is why we are calling on the Secretary of State for Scotland, Michael Forsyth, to step in and meet his responsibilities to protect the people and environment of Scotland and call a halt to these dangerous and potentially deadly transports.'
<P>
A spokesman for AEA Technology Ltd at Dounreay said yesterday (THURS): 'We have a long-established working relationship with the airport and we're confident in the procedures they have in place to ensure passenger and cargo flights in and out of Wick are undertaken safely.
<P>
'The transportation of nuclear material by air is strictly regulated. Stringent international standards are strictly observed by Dounreay on all moves of material and if regulations were to change we would immediately adopt them,' the spokesman said. 
<P>
'Dounreay have been undertaking reprocessing work for over 30 years. This latest consignment means it's business as usual at the site.'
<P>
He revealed the nuclear plant had invited Greenpeace and other campaigners against 'nuclear dumping' to come and visit the site: 'We have an open door policy and just now we're trying to set a mutually convenient date for the visit,' he said.

19th September 1996
<P>
The man who rowed alone from Norway to Shetland in July has arrived back in the islands to collect his 19 foot boat for the return trip.
<P>
Svein-Ove Ask (32), a journalist from Nordfjordur, was unmoved by pleas from Shetland friends who asked him to wait until next summer.
<P>
Coastguards said yesterday (WED) they also wished he would not embark on the perilous 200-mile crossing during the season of equinoctial gales.
<P>
'No, I think it will be all right. I plan to leave at the weekend, once I see what the weather is like,' said Mr Ask, the father of two young children, as he looked over his boat 'Ingolf Arnasson', stored in a Lerwick warehouse since his epic row three months ago.
<P>
He explained his detailed plans for dealing with emergencies, such as a capsize, and said he was not afraid of being alone in heavy seas at night, far from land: 'I have done a lot of night rowing on the Norwegian coast. It does not worry me. I know what I am doing,' he said.
<P>
Les Snaith, Shetland Coastguard district officer at Lerwick, said Mr Ask had been to visit them to discuss his plans. 
<P>
'His boat seems pretty well-founded and he's as well-prepared as he could possibly be, short of having an escort craft with him,' Mr Snaith said. 'He reckons it'll take him about 10 days.
<P>
'He's got a radio beacon this time which will let the Norwegian Coastguards know via a satellite where he is at all times.
<P>
'I wish we could dissuade him from going,' Mr Snaith said. 'But he's one of these exceptional people who feel the challenge is worth the risk. We can't stop him and, if he's prepared to take the risk, then that's the bottom line.'
<P>
Mr Ask cheerfully admitted when he arrived at Lerwick from Maloy in July that his partner Hanne Grete Heen (32) thought he was 'a little bit crazy'. The couple have two sons, Arne (5) and Iver (3). 
<P>
Mr Ask is a specialist writer on boat restoration and is well known in Norway for making five abortive attempts to row to Shetland before his successful crossing. There is no record of anyone making the return trip alone in a rowing boat.
<P>
The seas around Shetland during the equinoctial gales can be among the roughest in the world but yesterday (WED) the weather seemed set fair, for a few days at least.
<P>
Two other Norwegian rowers who gave up an attempt to row to Shetland in June tried again last month. They were rescued after drifting for five days in a liferaft, when heavy seas swamped their open boat half way between Bergen and Lerwick.
<P>
Mr Ask believed his specially adapted 'Nordfjording' craft, with its self-draining cockpit, was better equipped for the voyage.

19th September 1996
<P>
A hotel which lay derelict for years in the Shetland village of Scalloway re-opened yesterday (WED) after a refit costing over half a million pounds.
<P>
The Scalloway Hotel in Main Street, once described as an eyesore, welcomed back an old patron for the occasion - Scottish industry minister George Kynoch, making a two-day visit to the islands.
<P>
Performing the opening ceremony, Mr Kynoch recalled that he knew the building well from the days when he visited Scalloway regularly as a businessman, before going into politics.
<P>
Shetland Enterprise and Shetland Islands Council partly funded the restoration of the handsome building by entrepreneur Abdelhaq Zaoui, whose first job in Shetland, 20 years ago, was as a shipyard worker at Moore's slipway across the road.
<P>
Mr Zaoui, who runs the nearby Kiln Restaurant and Fisherman's Arms, took over the only hotel in the picturesque fishing village after it was badly damaged by fire two years ago. The refurbishment has created 24 en-suite bedrooms and a 54-seat restaurant.
<P>
Local councillor Iris Hawkins said it was 'a great day for Scalloway' and 'a dream come true'.

18th September 1996
<P>
A Government minister last night (TUES) hit out at airlines for the high cost of fares to Shetland - and suggested the Scottish Tourist Board should do something about it.
<P>
Scottish industry minister George Kynoch told guests at a Highlands and Islands Enterprise reception in Scalloway, Shetland, he was amazed at the 231 pounds price tag on his Business air return ticket from Edinburgh to Shetland - more than a return flight to New York. Some of his staff paid 10 pounds less with British Airways.
<P>
'I'd just come back from two weeks' holiday,' Mr Kynoch said, 'and I found the ticket to Shetland waiting for me. When I saw the price I just about collapsed. I thought - why aren't we chartering an airliner for this?'
<P>
The tickets for Mr Kynoch and five Scottish Office officials accompanying him on the two-day visit came to over 1,300 pounds - not counting the flights for board members of Highlands and Islands Enterprise, holding an 'away-day' meeting with the minister in Lerwick,
<P>
Mr Kynoch said islanders kept asking him: 'What are you going to do about air fares to Shetland?' His reply was that prices like this were 'shackling' the tourist industry in its efforts to attract visitors to Shetland and other scenic parts of the Highlands and Islands.
<P>
'I really do think the Scottish Tourist Board could help,' he said. 'I'm going back to Edinburgh to ask them to approach the airlines who've taken part in a recent very successful promotion to attract people from south-east England to visit Scotland.'
<P>
Together with Highlands and Islands Airports (HIAL), he believed the tourist board could put up a very strong case that visitors should not be put off by the high cost of visiting the islands.
<P>
During his speech Mr Kynoch praised HIAL for the improvements they had made to Sumburgh, Shetland's main airport, and complimented the local enterprise company and Shetland Islands Council for their successful partnership with the islands' 'great entrepreneurial spirit'.

18th September 1996
<P>
Scots industry minister George Kynoch came face to face with a monster of the deep in Shetland yesterday (TUES), and narrowly escaped a nipped finger.
<P><A HREF="lobster.jpg"><IMG SRC="lobsters.jpg" ALIGN=right WIDTH=206 HEIGHT=180 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=5></A>
Mr Kynoch met the Mother of all Lobsters during a visit to a shellfish hatchery at the North Atlantic Fisheries College in Scalloway. The irate crustacean objected to being picked up by a minister of the Crown, or anyone else.
<P>
College principal Morgan Goodlad showed Mr Kynoch the special tanks where up to 5,000 baby lobsters are raised from the eggs of a single female. The college has pioneered techniques which prevent the tiny lobsters cannibalising each other and has released over 10,000 to the sea, in a bid to restore wild stocks after years of over-fishing.
<P>
Mr Kynoch said: 'This is an ingenious project which shows the potential of Shetland's traditional industries.'
<P>
He said he was no stranger to Shetland, having had business interests in the isles' knitwear industry before he became a minister. Later he visited his old firm, The Shetland Woollen Company in Scalloway, and was shown round the new premises of one of his former business competitors, Judane Knitwear of Lerwick. 
<P>
After meeting staff and students in the textile department at The Shetland Further Education College, he inspected Lerwick Fish Traders' new salmon processing plant in Lerwick.
<P>
Travelling with Mr Kynoch were the board of Highlands and Islands Enterprise, holding their annual meeting in the recently opened Shetland Seafood Centre in Lerwick.
<P>
The minister later presented Shetland Enterprise with an award to mark their success in signing up 32 island companies for the 'Investors in People' scheme which promotes staff training.

<P><a href="lodge.jpg"><img src="lodges.jpg" align=right border=0 hspace=5></A>
We have more than 200 years of experience in sailing to Orkney and Shetland and a cruising history to Norway dating back to 1886  - who better to introduce you to these northern lands?
<P>
Whether you choose to travel on our scenic short sea ferry crossing from Scrabster (near Thurso) to Stromness in Orkney, on the popular daytime sailing from Aberdeen to Stromness, or to Shetland, sailing overnight from Aberdeen to Lerwick, one thing is certain - you will be full of admiration for these beautiful islands, as well as the ships that take you there.
<P><a href="ork1.jpg"><img src="ork1s.jpg" align=left border=0 hspace=5></A>
Let us sail you far from the jostling crowds to the haunting beauty of the Orkney and Shetland Islands, and, during the summer months, on to Bergen in Norway..Many people have landed there before you, some as early as 3,000BC, most famous of all were the Vikings, but they were not alone and all around you will find historical treasures ready to be explored.
<P>
<STRONG>We have made it even more tempting for you, with many special fare offers, to make this the year you discover the magic of Orkney and Shetland for yourself.</STRONG>

Many people have landed on Shetland before you but most famous were the <A HREF="http://www.shetland-tourism.co.uk/vikings/vikings.html">Vikings</A> - their influence is still very prevalent today.
<P>
The sea is part of everyday life in Shetland which makes it the natural way to reach Britain's northernmost islands, some 100 in all, which have a dramatic history and a character all of their own.  Sailing towards Shetland in summer there is scarcely any night, just a dimming of the sky around midnight, known in Shetland as the 'Simmer Dim'.
<P><a Href="cmin.jpg"><Img align=right src="cmins.jpg" hspace=5 border=0></A>
Many people have landed on Shetland before you - some as early as 3 000 BC - but most famous were the Vikings who landed and made Shetland their home.  All around Shetland you can see historical treasures.  Visit Jarlshof where seven distinct civilisations can be traced amongst its ancient dwellings; Mousa Broch, Britain's best example of an Iron Age Fort; and Scalloway Castle, built by the cruel Earl Patrick Stewart.
<P>
Everyone who visits Shetland is awed by the stunning cliff scenery considered by many to be the most beautiful and dramatic in Britain.  Widlife abounds.  Native <A HREF="http://www.zetnet.co.uk/sigs/ponies/">Shetland ponies</A> roam free, <A HREF="http://www.zetnet.co.uk/sigs/seals/">seals, porpoises</A> and otters can be seen and the vast colonies of  <A HREF="http://www.zetnet.co.uk/sigs/birds/bird1.html">gulls and gannets</A> are breathtaking.  The angler will enthuse over the rich loch and sea fishing and seldom anywhere today will you find the freedom and the friendship that still exist in Shetland.
<P><a Href="burning.jpg"><Img align=left src="burnings.jpg" hspace=5 border=0></A>
Perhaps you will spend some time reading or listening to the fascinating myths and sagas of the Vikings brought to life by the many historical settlements that surround you.  Those interested in more modern history will enjoy seeing the places associated with the 'Shetland Bus', of WW II fame.  The Vikings came from Scandinavia as did the Shetland Bus and each weekend in the summer it will be possible for you to sail direct from Lerwick to Bergen in Norway, sailing in the wake of the Vikings and the Shetland Bus.

Sailing to Northern Lands is an exciting adventure!  Every Saturday during June July and August our MV St Clair sails direct from Lerwick in Shetland to Bergen, Norway's most special city situated in the west amongst spectacular mountain scenery - and gateway to the fjords.
<P><A HREF="lehmkuhl.jpg"><IMG SRC="lehmkuhls.jpg" ALIGN=left HSPACE=5 border=0></A>
This unique Scottish Connection sailing from Aberdeen, via the Shetland Islands, to Norway provides the stepping stones to a holiday you will never forget.
<P>
You can leave Aberdeen at 1800 hours on a Friday and be in Bergen by midnight on Saturday, or you can stop off in Shetland and carry on to Norway the next weekend and still benefit from the special rates.
<P>
On the return journey an early morning departure from Bergen on Sunday sees you back in Aberdeen at 0800 hours Monday morning having stopped off in Shetland on the way.
<P>
Why not sail from Aberdeen or Scrabster to Orkney, Orkney to Shetland, then on to Bergen.  Whatever your chosen route to these Northern Lands we will be pleased to make all your travel arrangements for you.

A look at the map shows why Lerwick Harbour has been a logistics support centre for 25 years of offshore oil exploration, construction and production in the northern North Sea - and now the Atlantic Frontier:

<UL><LI>Nearest to the East Shetland basin.
<LI>Close to the West Shetland fields.
<LI>Handy for decommissioning older North Sea installations.</UL>
<P>
Based at Lerwick, you save money, cut turnaround time, speed up deliveries and improve safety  - with the security of full engineering back-up and communications. 
<BR>You can virtually halve your fuel costs, because Lerwick is so much nearer to the action.

Two entrances make Lerwick accessible in all weathers. Harbour staff, pilots, tugs, Customs, agency and consular cover are on call 24-hours, year-round.

The harbour has full radar surveillance, well-marked, dredged channels, deep anchorages, good shelter, small tides and <A HREF="http://www.shetland-news.co.uk/websites/lht/information/information.html">ample berthing</A>. Bunkers, water, refuse disposal and cranes are at the quayside, day and night.

Extensive repair facilities include a floating dock for 2,750 tonne dwt vessels - plus trained divers, coded welders, skilled shipwrights, marine engineers and essential spares.

Lerwick Harbour is the most accessible, efficient and economical port for oilfield support in the northern North Sea - the right package in the right place at the right time. 
<P>
The further north you work, the more logical to choose Lerwick. The nearest ports on the British mainland are the remote ones - particularly in winter. Lerwick is right at the centre - and the facilities are as good as many big city ports.
<P>
At Lerwick Harbour Trust we've been working with the offshore oil and gas industry for over a quarter of a century. We know what you need - and how to deliver it on time. 
<P>
Like many of the local service companies based around the harbour, Lerwick Harbour Trust has ISO 9002 quality assurance accreditation.

<P>
<STRONG>Four Hundred Years in the Business</STRONG>
<P><A HREF="albertbuilding.jpg"><img src="albertbuildings.jpg" align=right border=0 hspace=10 vspace=5></A>
Lerwick Harbour started life as a fishing port four centuries ago and is poised to strengthen its position in the next century as one of Britain's premier fishing ports.
<P>
Lerwick Harbour Trust, formed in 1877, has invested in new quays, sheltered docks, processing factories, net-handling areas and a temperature-controlled fishmarket, to make the port's facilities second to none. 
<P>


<br clear=all>
<P>
<STRONG>Never closed</STRONG>
<P>
Many ports have access problems in bad weather and low tides - not Lerwick. The approaches are well-lit with continuous, computerised radar cover. Pilots and tugs are available at any time. You can enter Lerwick's harbour of refuge in any weather, all-year round, day or night - there are two entrances and the tidal range is only 2.5 metres. Alongside, most berths have potable water, with mobile cranes, pumps, generators and specialist equipment on 24-hour call. Lerwick offers comprehensive repairs, maintenance, bunkering and stores around the clock.

<P><P><A HREF="office.jpg"><img src="offices.jpg" align=left border=0 hspace=10 vspace=5></A><P>
There is a slipway and floating dry-dock with full engineering backup for fishing vessels of up to 2,750 tonnes. The port has all agency services, brokerage and full Customs cover. If you are making a crew change, there are fast frequent daily air services to the UK mainland as well as regular overnight ferries to Aberdeen. More and more mainland boats are using Lerwick as a winter base. Rest and recreation facilities are first-class. In emergencies, few ports in the far north are as well equipped as Lerwick, with its high-speed RNLI lifeboat, Coastguard station, the search-and-rescue helicopter based at Sumburgh and a modern general hospital. 
<br clear=all>
<P>
<STRONG>At the Centre of Things</STRONG>
<P>
Lerwick is the fishing port at the centre of every North Sea and North Atlantic fisherman's charts. The harbour welcomes over 2,500 fishing vessels a year - not counting the local fleet - and numbers are growing as more and more skippers decide that Lerwick makes commercial sense for them. When you are not fishing your boat is eating up money, so it makes sense to use a base which minimises steaming time to and from the fishing grounds - and where specialists can get you back to sea quickly if you suffer a breakdown.


<P>
<STRONG>Lerwick - for the White Fish Fleet</STRONG>
<P><P><A HREF="unload.jpg"><img src="unloads.jpg" align=right border=0 hspace=10 vspace=5></A><P>
With markets five mornings a week and overnight fridge-freight sailings to the Scottish mainland, your catch reaches mainland and Shetland customers in prime condition. Lerwick's new fish market is one of the most modern in the UK, meeting the latest temperature control and hygiene regulations. The port has a high capacity ice plant with its own quay, supplying boats on demand, night and day. Onshore there are extensive white fish processing factories operated to the highest standards. The harbour has shelter for large numbers of trawlers and seiners in adverse weather. 


<br clear=all>
<P>
<STRONG>Lerwick - for the Pelagic Fleet</STRONG>
<P>
The port's all-weather anchorages are the centre of a huge trans-shipment operation for herring and mackerel. Specialist operators provide full agency and consular services with stores, ship tenders, bunker fuel and waste disposal available at all hours.

<P>
On shore, the Shetland Catch factory has new equipment for speedy discharge of your catch. There are deep-water berths to load reefer ships trading world-wide.

<P><A HREF="nets.jpg"><img src="netss.jpg" align=left border=0 hspace=10 vspace=5></A>
At Dales Voe, the largest vessels can lie alongside the quay which has a minimum water depth of 12.5 metres.

<P>
A large fish-meal and oil factory lies on the eastern shore of the harbour, handling fish wastes and industrial species.

<P>
Suppliers of refrigeration gases and spares for the pelagic fleet are based on the dockside.

<P>
<STRONG>Repairs and Maintenance for the Fleet</STRONG>
<P>
When something goes wrong, you do not have to waste time steaming back to mainland Scotland or Norway for repairs. The nearest slipway and dock are right here in Lerwick. 'If you bend it, Lerwick can mend it'. Experienced, skilled people will turn out at short notice around the clock to work on your problem, whether it's mechanical, electrical or electronic.

<P>
Specialist firms offer services like these up to, and beyond, mainland standards of quality and reliability:

<UL>
<P><P><A HREF="welder.jpg"><img src="welders.jpg" align=right border=0 hspace=10></A><P>
<LI>	Repairs, maintenance and modifications to hulls, deck machinery , fishing gear, marine engines, refrigeration plant, electrical gear, navigation equipment, electronics and telecommunications.

<P>
<LI>	Net-mending, handling, stacking and manufacture.

<P>
<LI>	Wire-rigging, shipchandlery.

<P><LI>	Divers, shipwrights and marine surveyors.

<P>
</UL>
<br clear=all>
When work is over, Lerwick is a great place to relax and have fun after a rough trip - maybe at the Fishermens' Mission, one of the best in Britain, or in cheerful waterfront bars, good restaurants and cafes.
<P>
Lerwick has the best leisure facilities of any town of its size in Scotland, including a new swimming pool, games hall and sports pitches.
<P>
If you are fishing in the northern grounds, it makes sense to use this convenient international port.  We will be delighted to welcome you to our growing fleet of satisfied customers.

<H1>
Lerwick Harbour
</H1>
<H2>
Shetland's Front Door
</H2>
</CENTER>
<P>

Lerwick is Shetlands main commercial port, equipped for fast, efficient handling of passengers, vehicles, containers, ro-ro freight, general, bulk and specialised cargo.
<P>
A large, deep, sheltered anchorage with good holding ground is available in all weathers. Buoyage and navigational aids are first class and meet new international standards. Channels in the North Harbour and North Entrance have been deepened, to meet the demand from increased traffic and the trend to bigger ships.
<P><A HREF="clair.jpg"><IMG SRC="clairs.jpg" ALIGN=left HSPACE=10 VSPACE=5 BORDER=0></A>
People and their goods have been landing on the western shores of Bressay Sound ever since the <A HREF="http://www.shetland-tourism.co.uk/vikings/vikings.html">Vikings</A> discovered this superb natural harbour over a thousand years ago.
<P>
The Vikings had to get their feet wet coming ashore and Lerwicks first docks were not built until the early 19th century. But modern passengers on the <A HREF="http://www.shetland-news.co.uk/websites/pno/">P&O ferries</A> from Aberdeen, Orkney and Norway are welcomed in a purpose-built terminal at Holmsgarth Quay.
<P>
The terminals two roll-on/roll-off berths handle most of Shetlands imports and exports. The development is central to Lerwick Harbour Trusts major investments along the two-mile waterfront over the past 20 years.
<P>
Nearby, the trust has built a new quay, dedicated to conventional lift-on/lift-off cargo handling. <A HREF="http://www.zetnet.co.uk/shetnews/oil/oil.html">Oilfield supply</A> vessels can trans-ship cargoes at Lerwicks service base quays, minimising haulage costs.
<P><A HREF="barge.jpg"><IMG SRC="barges.jpg" ALIGN=right HSPACE=10 VSPACE=5 BORDER=0></A>
Backing up the dockside service are experienced local haulage firms, Lloyds and other <A HREF="http://www.hay.zetnet.co.uk/">ships agents</A>, shipbrokers and Department of Transport surveyors. There is full Customs & Excise cover, plus <A HREF="http://www.shetland-news.co.uk/websites/lht/information/phonenos.html">consulates</A> for major European maritime nations, and interpreters on request.
<P>
Lerwick is also the terminal for <A HREF="http://www.zetnet.co.uk/shetnews/tourism/time.html">Shetland Islands Councils</A> busiest ro-ro ferry. The Leirna runs hourly to the island of Bressay, which shelters the harbour from easterly winds. 

<P>
Beyond Bressay is the National Nature Reserve island of Noss, served by the Noss Sound ferry from May to August. In summer, two boats run daily birdwatching excursions to Noss from Lerwicks Victoria Pier. 
<P>
<STRONG>The Best Recommendation </STRONG>
<P><A HREF="2entrance.jpg"><IMG SRC="2entrances.jpg" ALIGN=left HSPACE=10 VSPACE=5 BORDER=0></A>
Lerwick Harbours satisfied customers include <A HREF="http://www.shetland-news.co.uk/websites/pno/">P&O Scottish Ferries</A>, Shetland Line, the Royal Navy and major cruise ship operators.
<P>
Overnight passenger-cargo sailings run all year round to Aberdeen, with two calls a week at our neighbouring Orkney Islands. Shetland Line have a twice-weekly conventional freight service to the mainland.
<P>
In summer theres a weekly connection with Scandinavia - the P&O Scottish Ferries ship St Clair links Lerwick with Bergen in Norway, making us Britains most northerly international terminal for scheduled passenger/cargo services.
<P>
International trade goes on all year, with regular cargo sailings, by inducement, to Scandinavia, the Baltic, Channel ports, the Mediterranean and even Japan - where prime <A HREF="http://www.zetnet.co.uk/smoke/">Shetland seafood</A> is in great demand.
<P>
Thousands of masters and their crews have been impressed by the service at Lerwick Harbour. We think youll be pleasantly surprised too, and we look forward to doing business with you. Why not <A HREF="mailto:lkharbour@lht.zetnet.co.uk">Email us</A> today?

</H2>
</CENTER>
Tourism is big business for Lerwick Harbour. The bustling port is a visitor attraction in its own right, as well as being Shetland's main port of entry.
<P><A HREF="harbour1.jpg"><IMG SRC="harbour1s.jpg" ALIGN=right HSPACE=10 VSPACE=5 BORDER=0></A>
<STRONG>Cruise ships</STRONG> have been calling at Britain's most northerly town for more than 60 years; Lerwick's superb natural harbour lies just north of the 60th parallel, a natural port on cruises to Norway, Iceland, Faroe and the north of Scotland.
<P>
A Lerwick stopover is a popular introduction to these hundred beautiful islands for thousands of first-time visitors. Lerwick now welcomes more cruise passengers than any port in Scotland.
<P>
<STRONG>Mini-cruises</STRONG>, using <A HREF="http://www.shetland-news.co.uk/websites/pno/">P&O Scottish Ferries</A>' scheduled overnight sailings, offer a leisurely way for passengers to discover the islands during the long hours of summer daylight.
<P>
<STRONG>Cruising yacht</STRONG> arrivals number more than 300 a year. Most of them make Lerwick their first landfall. The yacht-friendly port is a convenient base for exploring the 900-mile Shetland coastline.
<P><BR> <BR clear=all>
<CENTER>
<STRONG>Cruise Operators: make Lerwick your next port of call</STRONG>
</CENTER>
<P><A HREF="upright.jpg"><IMG SRC="uprights.jpg" ALIGN=left HSPACE=10 VSPACE=5 BORDER=0></A>
Lerwick harbour and the Shetland Tourist industry have the facilities, the skills and the experience to make sure your ship's visit is a success.
<P>
The port is open in all weathers, around the clock, equipped and staffed to handle the largest cruising vessels. Pilots and two tugs are available 24 hours, with radar-assisted approach if required. Deep-water anchorage and quays are sheltered from all winds.
<P>
Cruise ships of up to 15,000 tonnes grt can lie alongside at berths with potable water and bunkers.
<P>
For large ships at anchor, your launches run a five-minute shuttle to a floating pontoon in a sheltered dock, equipped to modern safety specifications. The small tidal range, just 2 metres, adds to ease of operation.
<P>
Services available include 24-hour Customs clearance, shipchandlery, dockside security, bonded stores and ship's agency. Hotels offer excellent facilities. Scheduled air and sea links to the mainland are fats and frequent, telecommunications are world-class.
<P>
Cruise operators find professional standards here equal to much larger ports in Britain and Scandinavia. That is why they come back year after year.
<P>
<B>P&O Scottish Ferries</B> run a varied programme of Shetland and Orkney holidays, ranging from two-night mini-cruises to 14-day package tours. The company has a weekly excursion from Lerwick to Bergen, Norway, in the summer months.
<P>
Full details, including sailing schedules, fares and advance booking, are available from <A HREF="http://www.shetland-news.co.uk/websites/pno/">P&O Scottish Ferries' home page</A>.
<P>
<A HREF="buses.jpg"><IMG SRC="busess.jpg" ALIGN=right HSPACE=10 VSPACE=5 BORDER=0></A>
<B>Visiting Yachts</B> have their own sheltered berths in <B>The Small Boat Harbour</B>, right in the centre of Lerwick. Boats from Scandinavia, Germany, the Netherlands, France and mainland UK are most numerous but it's not unusual to meet boats from as far away as the USA, Canada and Australia.
<P>
<B>Customs</B> clearance is available at the dockside, where sailing skippers will also find fresh water, bunkers and refuse disposal. Nearby are groceries, banks, shipchandlers, car-hire Admiralty Chart agents and a boatyard skilled in repairs and maintenance for sailing craft.
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.shetland-tourism.co.uk/">The Shetland Tourist Centre</A> overlooks the yacht harbour and provides information, updated daily, on activities and tours around the islands.
<P>
A few steps along the waterfront the <B>Lerwick Boating Club</B> always has a friendly greeting for visiting sailors. There is an hospitable bar, with musical entertainment at weekends. Yacht crews may use the laundry and showers.
<P><A HREF="lakota.jpg"><IMG SRC="lakotas.jpg" ALIGN=left HSPACE=10 VSPACE=5 BORDER=0></A>
The club runs a weekly programme of sailing events; visitors are most welcome to take part. The annual Round-Bressay Race, Skerries Race, Lerwick Regatta and Inter-club Regatta (where crews compete from all over Shetland) are popular attractions.
<P>

Lerwick hosts several major international sailing events: the annual <B>Bergen-Shetland Race</B> is a highlight in May and attracts over 50 yachts; every two years the <B>Dutch North Sea Triangle</B> calls at Lerwick; and the port is also on the itinerary of the <B>Round Britain and Ireland Race</B>, run every four years by the Royal Western Yacht Club of England.
<P>
The Cutty Sark Tall Ships Races will visit Lerwick in early August 1999. The visit by the fleet is being locally arranged by <A HREF="http://www.zetnet.co.uk/sigs/sail.shetland/">Sail Shetland</A>, and the port is looking forward to this historic occasion.

<H2><I>EMU to give travellers a break</I></H2>
<P><BR></P>
<P>A traveller with $1,000 visits each of the 15 member states of the European
Union (EU), converting the hard-earned currency at each frontier.  Because of
commission charges the $1,000 becomes $500 before any of the trip expenses have
been met.  Economic and monetary union (EMU) is scheduled to come into effect on
January 1, 1999.  Initially it may only involve a small group of EU countries --
perhaps Germany and France, along with the Benelux countries -- but a start will
have been made. The project is often seen as distant and remote from the
concerns of ordinary citizens.  The intergovernmental conference (IGC), opening
in Turin at the end of March, will be keenly aware of the need to transform the
EMU project from a technical, bureaucratic exercise into an open, democratic
process that is relevant to real people. <BR></P>
<P>The currency swindle carried out daily by European financial institutions
provides a promising example of how this could be achieved.  People need to know
in advance what their travelling is going to cost, but this is often be
impossible with fluctuating exchange rates.  In some countries black market
operators prey on the naive.  Price transparency would be of great help to
travellers.  At present fluctuating exchange rates mean that it is hard for
travellers to compare the real value of goods and services across borders. EMU
would make pricing differentials crystal clear and so travelling consumers would
benefit from strengthened international competition.  European legislation on
the dubious banking practice of charging at both ends of an international
currency transaction would mean we really are moving in the right direction.<BR></P>
<P>Travellers have been growing accustomed to the liberty afforded by the
absence of passport controls among the Schengen group of EU countries --
Benelux, Germany, Spain, Portugal, Greece and Italy.  With the accession of the
Nordic countries to Schengen, and assuming an easing of terrorist tensions in
France, this benefit will be extended much further.  The signs are that Europe's
policy-makers are, not before time, waking up to the economic importance of the
travelling public, and starting to take their interests into account.<BR></P>

<H2><I>Time Travel - Celebrating the Year 2000</I></H2>
<P><BR></P>
<P>Greenwich in London has beaten off a fierce challenge from Birmingham to win
the race to host Britain's millenium celebrations in the year 2000.  Lying in
the south east of the capital, Greenwich is already a hugely popular tourist
destination.  It lies on a longitude of zero and so, in the 19th century, world
commerce depended on sea charts which used Greenwich as the Prime Meridian.  At
a conference in Washington DC in 1884 it was decided to use Greenwich mean time
to standardise time all over the world.  Greenwich Observatory, not to mention
the Cutty Sark, have proved themselves as massive long-term tourist attractions.<BR></P>
<P>The Imagination Group Ltd has been selected by the government-appointed
Millenium Commission to design and develop the event, which will consist of
entertainment and educational activities lasting throughout the year.  They will
propose the erection of 12 pavilions, each focusing on a different aspect of
time, and arranged to form a giant time circle.  The Price Waterhouse
consultancy, commissioned by the government, believes that 10m-15m visitors will
be attracted to the area. <BR></P>
<P>Given that figure, Greenwich was vulnerable to legitimate criticism from its
Birmingham rival in that, like London as a whole, the area suffers from a poor
transport infrastructure.  Massive improvement to the local rail service would
be needed. Hopes rest with the Jubilee Line, part of London's underground, and
the Docklands Light Railway, both of which are to be extended to take in
Greenwich.<BR></P>
<P>The Greenwich bid benefited from strong support from the City of London, and
was chosen mainly because the government believes that the long term economic
benefits will be greatest there.  Greenwich Peninsula, a derelict site owned by
British Gas, will be transformed.  The Hausner consultancy, also commissioned by
the government, believes that &#163;500m will be invested in the area, and that
10,000 permanent jobs will be created.<BR></P>
<HR>
<H2><I>All roads lead to Brussels?</I></H2>
<P><BR></P>
<P>An ambitious high-speed rail network intended to link London, Paris, Cologne
and Amsterdam will have Brussels at its core. The project is one of a series of
planned international transport links in Europe, known as trans-European
networks (TENs), and trumpeted by the European Commission as bringing home the
concrete benefits of European integration to travellers. Journey times would be
slashed. From Brussels, time to Paris would be cut from 2 hours 25 mins to 1
hour 20 mins, and to London, from 3 hours 15 mins to 2 hours 5 mins. Yet despite
the Commission's claim that it is &quot;transforming a network into a patchwork&quot;,
quarrels over funding and political rivalries have reduced progress to a snail's
pace. <BR></P>
<P>The Brussels-centred network is not expected to be operational until at
least 2005 &#151; only the section between Lille and the Channel Tunnel is
currently in use.  Belgium took seven years before finally agreeing to finance
the system, with tensions between the Flemish and Walloon communities
contributing to the delay.  The country's regionalised structure meant that
planning permission had to be given separately in Flanders and Wallonia as well
as in Brussels.  The Walloons were eventually able to secure the inclusion of
the town of Li&egrave;ge on the route, despite the engineering complexity and
extra expense involved.  In Germany progress has so far been so slow as to be
barely perceptible: only a small stretch of track near Cologne is currently
being upgraded.<BR></P>
<P>Elsewhere TENs are hampered by a similar lack of momentum.  A proposed
high-speed rail and combined transport link between Berlin and Verona is going
nowhere fast. Germany and Italy stand to gain the most in economic terms, though
the route must necessarily pass through Austria. So the Austrians are
understandably cagey about being drawn into any funding commitments. The greatly
delayed Channel Tunnel was a prime example of the acute difficulty of getting
agreement on finance.  With European finance ministers procrastinating over how
much to spend on the project, Eurotunnel, the private sector operator, was
simply unable to service its debts. <BR></P>
<P>&quot;Many countries behave as if construction and funding are the job of
someone else,&quot; snaps EU transport commissioner Neil Kinnock. The private
sector, which needs a return on its investment within a reasonable period,
cannot be expected to shoulder the entire burden. Part of the problem is that
many of the future benefits, such as time saved, less congestion and pollution
on motorways, and accelerated trade in goods and services, are very difficult to
quantify.  Improved transport links across the continent would make every
European country more attractive as a tourist destination and therefore bring
further real economic benefits&#151;gains which are liable to be overlooked by
national administrations focusing solely on the purse strings.<BR></P>

<P><BR></P>
<P><B>Copenhagen</B> International Airport will build a new passenger terminal
to be shared by its main client, Scandanavian Airlines System (SAS), and two new
clients, Lufthansa and Thai International.  &#164;  Britain's Virgin Group has
signed an agreement to acquire 90% of <B>Belgium's</B> second-largest airline,
EuroBelgian Airlines.  EBA will be renamed Virgin European Airways but will
operate separately from parent Virgin Atlantic Airways.  &#164;  <B>Frankfurt</B>
will open a second airport railway station to accommodate high-speed intercity
trains.  Dubbed Terminal 3, it's expected to begin operation in 1999.  &#164; 
<B>Paris</B> may build a third airport north of Beauvais in Picardy to relieve
overcrowded Charles de Gaulle and Orly.  Another possible site is south of
Chartres; the final decision will depend on TGV connections.  &#164;</P>

<H1>Following in the Poet's Footsteps</H1>
<P><I>by Nathalie Zeidman</I></P>
<HR>
<H2><I>From Wordsworth to Peter Rabbit</I><BR></H2> 
<P>There's no lovelier corner of England than the Lake District, and no better
way to explore it than to settle in to one of its quaint villages.  A good
choice is Ambleside at the north end of Windermere, the largest of the lakes. 
Ambleside is a center for coach tours, scenic walks, and lake excursions, as
well as a stop on the Morris Dancers' circuit.  It's also the heart of
Wordsworth country.  But you don't have to be a poetry lover to head straight
for the Wordsworth shrines; most tourists do.   The best place to start is Dove
Cottage, four miles up the road from Ambleside.<BR></P>
<P>Local buses make the run hourly.  The small house where the poet wrote some
of his finest poetry has little to distinguish it from other white-washed,
slate-roofed cottages in Cumbria -- only a small sign.  Everything there is
small: the rooms, the garden, the desk where he wrote, &quot;My heart leaps up
as I behold a rainbow in the sky.&quot;  Only the talent was big.<BR></P>
<P>Across the Rothay River from Dove cottage is Grasmere, the village most
associated with Wordsworth.   At the river's edge a self-service coffee-and-tea
garden offers, along with tea and scones, a view of the churchyard where the
poet lies.  Above Grasmere, the hills are sleepy with sheep and, in the spring,
new-born lambs.  The village itself caters to tourists who come in busloads and
overrun the shops.  Hand-knit woolens, crystal, and salon paintings are a bit
pricey; but Grasmere  gingerbread, as good as its reputation, is within most
budgets. <BR></P>
<P>The second-most visited Wordsworth shrine is Rydal Mount, an easy
mile-and-a-half walk from Ambleside along a narrow ridge that parallels the
road.   In the distance, views of Loughrigg Fell recall the paintings of
Constable and Thrner.  It's a friendly walk.  Ramblers pause to chat about the
early blooming hawthorn or late blooming lilac as they hold open one gate after
another.  Rydal Mount, a handsome manor house, is kept as it was in the poet's
day by his descendants, who live there.  Wordsworth himself designed the
terraced gardens to provide the privacy he needed to compose his poems.  
Visitors following his footsteps find themselves inspired.<BR></P>
<P>The noted Victorian art critic John Ruskin also lived in the Lake District
in a fine home on public display.  But by far the most noted Victorian author to
live there was Beatrix Potter, creator of Peter Rabbit.  A nostalgic visit to
Potter's Hilltop Farm is on the itinerary of several coach tours.<BR></P>
<P>Bus tours are a good way to go if you don't enjoy driving on the &quot;wrong&quot;
side of the road but do enjoy knowledgeable commentary laced with wry humor. 
Brown's Luxury Coach Tours is headquartered in Ambleside, and better-known
Mountain Goat Tours has an office there.  Each operates half-day and full-day
tours.  One popular excursion in the half-day &quot;Five  Tarns Tour.&quot; 
<I>Tarn</I> is Norse for &quot;small lake&quot;, as <I>fell</I> is Norse for &quot;mountain.&quot;
 The Vikings, early invaders, left vocabulary as well as sheep for the &quot;uncivilized&quot;
Celts.  <BR></P>
<P>In addition to Hilltop Farm, the &quot;Five Tarns Tour&quot; takes you to
the sixteenth century village of Hawkshead, where the parish church with its
twelfth-century Norman tower looks down on the grammar school Wordsworth
attended, and a town square unchanged by time.  Along the way the coach dips
into Little Langdale valley.  The landscape here turns craggy with slate
outcroppings and the fell burns coppery in the afternoon sun.  Once copper
mining and slate-quarrying country, today it's the haunt of rock climbers.<BR></P>
<P>Another outstanding coach trip climbs Kirkstone Pass, at 1500 feet England's
highest, on the way to Ullswater, where, if the season is right, you'll see
Wordsworth's &quot;host of golden daffodils.&quot;  Wherever you go in the Lake
District, no matter the season, dry stone walls pattern the landscape.  Once
they defined private pastures.  Now these parti-colored, rough-cut rocks topped
by the bluest of slate turn the slopes into an iridescent patchwork.  It's a
comfort to the eye, and a miracle of artisan engineering: these dry stone walls
have stood four centuries without a glob of mortar.<BR></P>
<P>If you're staying in Ambleside, you don't have to join a tour to go
exploring.  Windermere at the south end of the lake is only fifteen minutes by
bus.   Full of Victorian charm, Windermere alas is also full of tourists.  But a
walk downhill to the lakeside suburb of Bowness, past cricket fields,
bow-windowed bed-and-breakfasts, and sweets shops, is pleasant.  From Bowness
you can return to Ambleside more leisurely by steamer. <BR> </P>
<P>If you're tired of meeting bus and steamer schedules, at the tourist office
you can pick up for 12p (20 cents) a map with three easy walks in and around
Ambleside.  Even without a map you can find your way to Stock Ghyll Park and its
waterfall: follow the road that climbs behind the Salutation Hotel through
groves of oak, birch and elm, being careful not to crush the delicate blossoms
of wild garlic that last the summer.  Half-hidden in the mist, Stock Ghyll Falls
seems the perfect background for those rituals the Druids practiced, even before
the Saxons came or the Rornans settled at the lake-end of town.<BR></P>
<P>One ritual still practiced in Ambleside is the yearly visit of the
Kendal-Westmorland Step Dancers.  Any Saturday in May, teams from Harrowgate,
Ripon, Merseyside and Kendal turn the Garden Center's parking lot into a
theater-in-the-round.  The program is traditional.  Colorful dancers, graceful
even in thick clogs, twirl ribbons, clash staves, wave garlands, and swing
partners to the accompaniment of concertinas, banjoes, horns and drums.  What a
way to welcome spring!  Originally Morris dancing was performed by men as a
fertility rite.  In the early nineteenth century, female mill workers in
Lancashire took up clogging when conversation at the workplace was banned.   The
women whose uniform included wooden shoes with iron bands began tapping out
their message to each other over the clatter of the looms.   On the way home
from work they often continued their &quot;Morris code&quot; on the cobblestone
streets.  It doesn't work with  Reeboks or Birkenstocks, tourists find.<BR></P>
<P>For a town of only two thousand those streets are pretty sophisticated.  A
number of shops display high fashion clothing and if you need real walking
shoes, Ambleside is the place to buy a pair.  A half dozen stores including a
wholesale outlet out-fashion Fifth Avenue's Ambercrombie and Fitch.  You won't
find souvenir shops.  After all, Wordsworth, though he had an government office
here, didn't live here.  However, the stationer's carries a stock of slate
coasters with scenes of Dove Cottage.  As for the makings of a picnic lunch, you
can pick up sandwiches, sweets, fruit and drinks at any one of a dozen catering
shops.  Dinner presents no problem.   In addition to hotels, many of which are
noted for their cuisine, moderately priced restaurants like Luigi's and
Bertram's serve authentic Italian dishes and local fish; forty dollars for two
includes wine.  Hotels tend to be more expensive, pubs less so.<BR></P>
<P>After dinner there isn't much to do:  walk to the lake, stroll to the
bowling green; drop in at a pub, the movie house, the jazz club.  Or return to
your room and watch telly.  British television is really no better than
American; it only seems so.  Maybe because you're in Ambleside.  &#164;</P>

<P><B><I>What's Up in European Rail</I></B></P>
<P><BR></P>
<UL><LI>Sunday Eurostar service between London and Brussels will be completely
revised, with many journeys now following a 7-day-a-week pattern.<BR></LI>
<LI>Additional TGV services will be introduced from Lille Europe (Eurostar
station) to Marseille and Montpellier.  New trains from Lille Europe to
Bordeaux, Rennes, and Nantes will also be introduced.<BR></LI>
<LI>The <I>Marie Curie</I> Paris-Stuttgart EC train will be replaced by a
Strasbourg-Stuttgard IR service with connections to and from Paris.  The <I>Orient
Express</I> will run approximately two hours earlier from Paris and one hour
later from Budapest.<BR></LI>
<LI>The couchette train between Madrid and Paris, <I>Puerto de Sol</I>, will
no longer run.  Summer-weekend couchette cars from Oostende to Verona (trains
1218/19) are also withdrawn.<BR></LI>
<LI>Berlin-Kiev sleeping cars will run in the <I>St. Petersburg </I>Express to
Warsaw, and will then be conveyed via the Polish/Ukraine border instead of
traveling via Brest.  This will avoid the need for passengers to have Belarus
transit visas.<BR></LI>
<LI>The <I>Napoli</I> Express will be withdrawn and replaced by a new EN train
from Paris to Roma Ostiense.  The <I>Gallelei</I> will be rerouted via Modane
and renumbered, but plans to run this train via Pisa have been scrapped, and it
will continue to serve Bolgna.  The <I>Parthenon</I>, which previously ran in
high summer from Paris to Brindisi, connecting with ships to Greece, will be cut
back to Ancona, losing its name in the process.  The Lausanne-Milano train at
1113 (connecting out of the <I>Lutetia</I> from Paris) will become a Pendolino
train, operated by high-speed tilting rolling stock under the new <I>CISALPINO</I>
banner.<BR></LI>
<LI>The <I>Balt Orient Express</I> is withdrawn but retained between Budapest
and Bucharest as the <I>Muntenia</I>.  These two cities are also linked by a
new EuroNight train, giving a faster journey.  The overnight
Berlin-Prague-Vienna train, <I>Sansouci</I>, has been withdrawn as a separate
train, but the through cars continue to run, being conveyed in the <I>Metropol</I>
between Berlin and Breclav.   The <I>Bart&oacute;k B&eacute;la </I>(Stuttgart-Budapest)
will be extended to start from Frankfurt.<BR></LI>
<LI>A new CityNightLine train named <I>Berlin</I> will run Berlin-Z&uuml;rich.
 It will also have a portion from Dresdin to Z&uuml;rich via Leipzig.  The <I>Italia
Express</I> is changed to Rome from Cologne instead of Dortmund, and will no
longer have a portion originating at Frankfurt.<BR></LI>
<LI>There will be a new high-speed <I>CISALPINO</I> Pendolino train between
Geneva and Milan, leaving Geneva at 10:39am and leaving Milan at 6:40am.  Two
additional <I>CISALPINO</I> trains will be added on this route for winter
1996/97.<BR></LI></UL>

<H1>The Minster at York</H1>
<P><I>Excerpt from &quot;A Satchel Guide for the Vacation Tourist in Europe&quot;</I></P>
<HR>
<P><B>With this issue of <EM>EV</EM> we  begin a series of excerpts from this
fascinating  guide for Americans visiting Europe -- published in 1880.  While
many of the anonymous editor's observations are timeless, be aware that whatever
is said in these excerpts was said more than a century ago... so the usual
admonition to verify travel information prior to relying upon it is rather more
in force than usual!</B></P>
<HR>
<P>York was an old town when Agricola (ad 78) made it one of his principal
stations.  Here Hadrian lived, and Severus and Constantius Chlorus died; and
here, as many believe, Constantine the Great was born.  Here the first English
parliament was held, in 1160, and for five centuries parliaments were
occasionally summoned to the ancient city.  Here are remains of Roman towers and
of the earliest British churches.  The walls, built we know not how long before
the time of Henry III, after being battered in many a siege, were breached in
our day to admit the railway train.  The old ramparts, still encircling a large
part of the city, now serve the peaceful purpose of a public promenade.<BR></P>
<P>The Cathedral or Minster is of course the chief attraction of York.  It
stands on the site of a Saxon church in which King Edwin or Northumbria was
baptized on Easter day, ad 627.  This was replaced by a larger edifice, which
was burnt in 741.  Another, built by Archbishop Albert (who came to the see in
767), was burnt in 1069, when William the Conqueror was devastating Yorkshire. 
A portion of the inner wall of the existing crypt is perhaps a remnant of this
early Saxon church.  Thomas of Bayeux, the first Norman Bishop, built a new
church before 1100.  Archbishop Roger (1154-1181) pulled down the choir and
rebuilt it on a larger scale.  Archbishop Gray (1215-1255) appears to have
rebuilt the south transept in its present (Early English) form.  John le Romeyn,
treasurer of York (1228-1256), built the north transept and a central tower.  In
1291 Archbishop le Romeyn (son of the treasurer) began to rebuild the nave,
which was finished in 1355.  The chapter-house belongs to the same (Decorated)
period.  In 1361, Archbishop Thoresby began the lady chapel and presbytery
(early Perpendicular) which where probably completed by 1373; and between that
date and 1400, the old Norman choir was entirely replaced by the present one.<BR></P>
<P>In the vestry, some vernerable curiosities are exhibited; among the the <I>horn
of Ulphus</I>, laid on the altar more than 800 years ago by Ulph, lord of a
great part of eastern Yorkshire, in token that he bestowed certain lands on the
church.  In the Library (8000 volumes) are many rare and curious books,
including manuscripts of Cicero of the 11th and 12th centuries, breviaries and
psalters of the 13th century, works printed by Caxton, Wynkyn de Worde, etc.,
and manuscript volume by the poet Gray, etc.<BR></P>
<P>The extreme length of the cathedral is 524&#189; feet; breadth across the
transepts, 250; height of the central tower, 213; of western towers, 250; within
the height of the nave is 99&#189; feet.  The great east window is 76 feet high,
32 wide.  One of the best views of the exterior of the cathedral is from the
walls of the city.<BR></P>
<P>The minster is rich in old stained glass.  In the north transept the five
lofty and norrow lancet windows (54 feet high, 5&#188; wide) known as the &quot;Five
Sisters,&quot; are filled with their original Early English glass, of lovely
diapered patterns.  The great west window, with its exquisite flowing tracery,
also contains the original glass, the gift of Archbishop Melton (1317-1340).  If
the east window at Carlisle is the most beautiful in the world, this is but
little inferior to it, and some have given it the preference.  There is scarcely
any modern glass in the other windows of the nave.  Nowhere in England can one
see a larger or more perfect display of the painted glass of the early part of
the 14th century.  &#164;</P>
<HR>
<H2>Hints for Travelers</H2>
<P><I>from &quot;A Satchel Guide for the Vacation Tourist in Europe&quot;
(published Boston, 1880)</I><BR></P>
<P><B>&quot;Money for the trip</B> is best taken in the form of a letter of
credit from some trustworthy banking-house.  Decide how much you will spend
abroad; allow a margin of twenty-five or thirty percent for contingencies, and
get the letter for the gross amount.  Take with you in English sovereigns only
enough to cover 'extras' on shipboard and the first few days of travel after
landing at Queenstown or Liverpool -- say, ten sovereigns if you are traveling
alone.  The letter will contain a list of banks in all the leading  cities of
Europe, from which you can draw from time to time what you need.<BR></P>
<P>If you expect to spend only two or three hundred dollars abroad, it is as
well to take one hundred of it in sovereigns, and the remainder in the form of
one or two drafts...&quot;</P>

<P><BR></P>
<P><B>&#164; The five most dangerous European countries in which to take the
wheel yourself?  Turkey, Portugal, Spain, Macedonia, and the Czech Republic,
according to a United Nations report quoted in <I>Cond&eacute; Naste Traveler</I>.
 Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Ireland, and France enjoy the top European slots at
the safer end of the list.  (We presume that out of fairness, they <I>didn't</I>
include downtown Paris!)</B></P>
<P></P>
<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF0080">&#164; Montenegro and Croatia are hard at work
rebuilding their coastal tourist industries, where more than 400,000 visitors
flocked annually before the onset of the Balkan wars.  Repairs in Croatia's
Dubrovnik, which prior to the fighting was one of Europe's best-preserved
medieval cities, are well underway, and numerous hotels and resorts along the
region's famous beaches are being refurbished with high hopes for a resumption
of tourism.  If the current peace effort holds, look for terrific bargains this
fall and winter, as operators try to get newly re-opened properties and newly
re-hired staff up to speed for next year's summer season.</FONT></B></P>
<P></P>
<P><B>&#164; The Greek Islands remain one of the most popular destinations for
American cruise travelers, with more than 50,000 Yanks floating about the area
each season.  But for the next few months, take care where your ship is schedule
to land:  labor unrest at Piraeus is disrupting service for some lines, and may
spread to other ports.  Local unions are upset at the proliferation of low-wage,
non-Greek crews.</B></P>
<P></P>
<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF0080">&#164; Other troubled waters:  European
environmentalists find themselves at odds over plans to widen, dredge, lengthen,
or otherwise upgrade canals in varous EU countries.  Proponents believe that the
canals, which were important freight routes in the days before lorries and
autobahns, can once again play a role and help reduce Europe's widespread truck
pollution.  Others oppose the work, fearing damage to fragile wetlands, fishing
areas, and bird habitats.  For tourists too there is both upside and downside:
more &amp; longer canals will offer greater travel options, but your floating
hotel may be likelier to share the &quot;road&quot; with a petrol barge.  And in
at least some of the projects, historic bridges might have to be altered or torn
down to allow for larger ships.</FONT></B></P>
<P></P>
<P><B>&#164; Big changes may be coming to the operation of trains in the
Netherlands.  The government-run service is going over to private ownership,
with the former chairman of Philips Electronics at the helm.  The new CEO is
known as a fierce master of efficiency, while Dutch Railways is regarded as one
of the industry's more slothful beaurocracies; expect sparks to fly.</B></P>
<P></P>
<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF0080">&#164; Along with fighting over passengers, the
new Eurotunnel is in a scrap with English Channel ferry companies over duty-free
sales.  Complaining that the ferries' onboard shops give boat operators an
unfair edge, the rail tunnel owners are backing a European Commission move to
eliminate duty-free sales by 1999.  While their advantage lasts, the ferries are
making the most of the $300 million-dollar business -- the largest part of it in
liquor and cigarettes -- by cutting prices even further to keep travelers on
board.  But Eurotunnel, which can sell duty-free at its Calais and Folkestone
terminals, is matching the cuts and then some, making for some of the lowest
booze prices in Europe.  Among other effects, the competition has led to the odd
spectacle of French shoppers traveling to England to buy cognac!</FONT></B></P>
<P></P>
<P><B>&#164; Speaking of tunnels:  if you thought the Paris M&eacute;tro was

<H2>Charlie Chaplin Sleeps Here</H2>
<P><B><I>Vivey: French with good manners</I></B><BR></P>
<P><I>By Kit Snedaker</I><BR></P>
<P><B>There&#146;s nothing funny about Vivey.</B>  Maybe that&#146;s why
Charlie Chaplin spent the  last 25 years of his life in this little Swiss town. 
Vevey is just one of those charming, convenient spots on the shore of Lake
Geneva that&#146;s been inhabited since the Romans put it on the map, as a
staging area called Vibiscum.  Curved around the lake shore, the town&#146;s
narrow, winding streets, smart shops, interesting eateries, fountains, castle,
market and parks are not only lively, but user friendly.  No homeless.  No
stretch limos, either.  When the Chaplins bought a house in the suburb of
Corsair in 1952, Vevey didn&#146;t fuss over them. They lived happily ever
after.  Well, almost.  Charlie died in 1977, and was buried in Corsair&#146;s
graveyard.  Several years later his wife, the former Oona O&#146;Neil, got a
note saying: Your husband&#146;s body has been stolen and we are holding it for
ransom.  Her public reply: I won&#146;t pay a single Swiss franc.  No matter
where his body was, she told authorities, he lives in my heart.  This delighted
the thrifty Swiss.  Police doubled their efforts and found the casket dumped in
a nearby pasture.  They caught the men who had taken it, put them in jail and
reburied Charlie under tons of concrete.<BR></P>
<P>Not long afterwards, in 1982, town fathers commissioned British sculptor
John Doubleday to do a statue of &#147;the little tramp.&#148;  They set it up
in a tiny square on the Quai Pardonnet, a waterfront park.  The first day it
stood there and everyday since, a passerby picks a flower and tucks it in
Charlie&#146;s outstretches hand.  Standing there in shoes so big the toes turn
up, bamboo cane bent at an improbable angle, Chaplin has a perfect view of the
swans on Lake Geneva or Lake Leman, as the Swiss prefer to call it.  On benches
behind him locals and visitors sit and watch the swans, too, but hold up a
camera and watch the scramble.  Strangers rush to put a protective arm around
Chaplin&#146;s shoulders or dust off his derby or make sure his flower is fresh.
 Vevey is crazy about him.<BR></P>
<P>There&#146;s even a restaurant with his name misspelled -- Charly&#146;s
Cafe. But only one; the Swiss don&#146;t exploit celebrities.  Not for them
souvenir Chaplin coffee mugs, calendars, or plaques saying Chaplin Ate Here.
Acceptance is what Vevey gave the Chaplins, and a place to live at once
sophisticated and &#147;small town&#148;.  But &#147;small town&#148; just an
hour away from snappy Geneva by fast, clean, regular trains; and minutes from
the countryside.<BR></P>
<P>A helicopter overview sorts it all out:  mountains rise just behind town,
vineyards run down their slopes;  the Rhone flows placidly through a nearby
village into the lake.  Air Glacier&#146;s owner/pilot, Ernest Devaud, loves to
show off his Canton of Vaud.  When he isn&#146;t taking passengers flightseeing,
he delivers building material up the mountain or hurries to a rescue -  human or
cattle.  In fact for just 50 Swiss francs per year, any farmer can call Devaud
anytime to chopper in and pull a cow out of a crevasse or take someone down the
mountain to a hospital.  He swoops over the moody, medieval Chateau Chillon made
famous by Lord Byron&#146;s The Prisoner of Chillon, then circles Castle Aigle
(once a fortress, now a wine museum), Chateau d&#146;Oex, a ski resort with
cheesemaking center, and Eschallens&#146; Bread and Wheat Museum.  Maybe Chaplin
didn&#146;t get to all those spots, but they make his Vevey more interesting.
Wine, cheese, mountains, castles and museums indicate what this part of the
world is all about.<BR></P>
<P>Four museums are right in town, each of them new, bright and shiny.  The
Museum of Old Vevey, in a 16th Century castle near the lake, is the smallest - 
one floor.  The Swiss Camera Museum is all glass and hands on; try cropping a
shot with magnetic frame, and see the antique Kodaks with the photos they made. 
The Game Museum in Castle Tour de Peilz, at the end of the esplanade, tempts
visitors to stop and play. But the best is the Alimentarium.  Despite its
off-putting name, this food museum is graphic and grabbing.  A huge sculpted
apple with a bite out of it welcomes visitors.  At the exhibit of what the
average Swiss eats in a month, an attendant is ready with an explanation.  Much
as in the States, a Swiss diet is high in meat and fat, but with twice as much
cheese and wine.<BR></P>
<P>Nearby stands the mockup of a hut from North Cameroon with appropriate
grains and vegetables in original baskets.  Take pictures; touch the exhibits. 
Children romp through.  If there&#146;s a lot of chocolate, old and new, at
least the brand name of the museum&#146;s founder, Nestle, is discreetly hidden.
 Bread and wheat are celebrated in the two-year-old Bread and Wheat House at
Echallens.  Since this is a Living Crafts Museum, it begins with a bakery and
small restaurant.  Visitors smell croissants, bread and pastry baking.  Bakers
roll, cut and braid breads at an open counter. Children crowd up to knead and
shape their own snacks.  Then they watch their efforts slide into any of four
different kinds of ovens.  Old flour mills, grinding stones and harvesting
equipment stand on the floors above, illustrating the whole history of grain
cultivation.  And on the top floor a voice-over slide show describes it all.<BR></P>
<P>Wine has its own museum at Castle Aigle.  Here in the Rhone Valley thrifty
Swiss saved the best parts of a 13th century castle and filled it with wine
memorabilia.  They left the arrow slits in the walls and fireplaces big enough
to roast an ox.  Among the drinking cups and wine presses a drawing on one wall
dates from the 18th century when the castle was Aigle&#146;s prison.  A lonely
prisoner sketched his homeland there on the wall of his cell, adding a sad
lament underneath.  The Swiss had the good sense to leave that, too.  From his
tiny window the prisoner could see the vineyards that stretched in all
directions.  They still do.<BR></P>
<P>One of them, Clos du Boux at Epesses, belongs to Luk Massy.  During the
harvest his days are 18 houre long.  Pickers toss bunches of fat green grapes
into wedge-shaped baskets.  Men hoist them on metal backpacks and walk down hill
to dump in the crushers.   Massy is not only famous for his white wine, but as
the central character in John McPhee&#146;s book about the Swiss army, &#147;Concorde
Swiss&#148;.  He talks more about working in vineyards in Sonoma, Argentina an
Australia than his experiences with McPhee, however.  Harvest here is a romp
compared with Napa and Sonoma.  More pickers laugh; more new wine is passed
around. Settled in at a long wooden table beside an antique crusher, vintner J.
P. Potterat, is asked if he&#146;s ever considered updating his equipment.  &#147;If
I didn&#146;t do it this way,&#148; he answers, &#147;you wouldn&#146;t visit
me.&#148;  In vino veritas.  Visitors are solicited.<BR></P>
<P>Up in the Vaud Alps above Epesses, Jean Raynaud and his family make the last
gruyere of the season at their summer chalet.  A mixture of skimmed evening and
whole morning milk from their 62 cows heats in a copper cauldron over a wood
fire.  Two little boys push trucks along the stone floor.  A cat paces the wall
licking its chops.  When the milk is warm Raynaud measure out a dropper-full of
rennet and squeezes it in.  He swings the cauldron off heat, stirs it with a
long metal fork.  The milk, now solidified to junket, breaks into curds and
watery whey.  Then the cauldron swings back on the fire to firm the curds the
old-fashioned way.  If they used modern equipment would visitors like me drop
in?  Visitors welcome here, too.  While the curd heats visitors sit down at a
kitchen table set with bread, cheese, plates, carved wooden spoons and two
wooden buckets of pudding-thick, beige cream from the evening&#146;s milk.  Dip
in the  wooden spoons and lick off that sweet, fat goodness.  Sip some hot,
sweet, cinnamon tea.  Put shreds of pungent, aged gruyere on homemade bread and
take a crusty bite.  Sip new wine. Nothing ever tasted better.<BR></P>
<P>Maybe Chaplin didn&#146;t see all this, but he knew it was there.  Every
Saturday morning his cook, or his wife came to Vevey&#146;s market square where
farmers bring just-picked vegetables, apples or pears depending on the season,
and handmade cheese.  Fruity white wine from nearby slopes waits in stores
around the square.  Fresh bread and croissants are heaped in the windows of
nearby bakeries.  Buyers stock up and settle at an outdoor table for coffee and
pastry.  Vevey isn&#146;t funny at all.  It&#146;s French with good manners, and
respect for life&#146;s essentials.  This civilized mix of rural and urban,
lakes and mountains suited America&#146;s little tramp, from the top of his
derby right down to the worn-out soles of his enormous shoes.  &#164;</P>
<HR>
<P><B>Getting There:</B>  Although most major carriers fly directly to Geneva
from gateway cities, the best way to start a Swiss experience is on Swiss Air. 
Geneva&#146;s airport is friendly, and clean. Fast trains run from  there to
Vevey at least every hour.  Staying There:  Hotel des Trois Couronnes, 49 Rue d&#146;Italie,
right on Lake Geneva has high ceilings, brass beds and a magnificent view of
Lake Geneva.  The park with Charlie&#146;s statue is out the back door, through
the terrace and across the road.  Rates are from about 200 Swiss francs to 400. 
Another good spot is Hotel Du Lac, also on Rue d&#146;Italie with rates about
the same. Hotel de Famille by the railway station is less.  All prices include a
continental breakfast.<BR></P>
<P><B>Getting Around:</B>  Vevey, indeed all of Switzerland, has good, fast
public transportation.  The railway  station is in the middle of town and hotel
concierges have handy time tables.  There are also frequent  buses. You can rent
a car for the week or the day for trips into the mountain or  see the Vevey
Tourist  Board for group tours. Vevey&#146;s tourist board offers a variety of 
packages.<BR></P>
<P><B>What To See:</B>  To get an overview of the area, take a helicopter
flight on Glacier Air.  Rates vary  depending on the season and length of
flight. Owner Earnest Devoid loves his business so much he says, &#147;It doesn&#146;t
matter if someone bothers me for a few minutes so long as he&#146;s interested
in flying.&#148; Devoid frequently takes people who can&#146;t afford a ride
along with him on a transport just to give them a taste of flying.  Guests are
welcome, depending on the season, at the grape harvest or up in the Alps at a
chalet to watch and taste homemade cheese. Museum of every sort, including
miniature soldiers (in Morges) dot nearby  towns.<BR></P>
<P><B>When to Go:</B>  Anytime. In the winter ski packages are excellent; in
summer there&#146;s sightseeing and  mountain climbing and swimming.  Places to
Eat:  Besides good hotel restaurants, Vevey has Charly&#146;s Cafe for Asian
food and Fontana, an Italian restaurant on Rue de Centre, Amis on Rue des Jarden
and Bel-Air on Rue du Nord for fondues and raclettes (melting cheese spooned on
potatoes and vegetables, a Swiss national dish). Chex Aziz serves Tunisian food,
and small tea rooms or bakeries with tables and good Swiss coffee are
everywhere.<BR></P>

<BODY><H2>EuroData for Windows</H2>
<P>Frequently Asked Questions, Bug Reports, and Corrections</P>
<HR>
<P><B>Installing the downloadable version: </B> When you download EuroData
from the Internet or an online service, what you receive is a single
self-extracting executable file called ed2wset.exe.  The best way to install
EuroData is to locate your downloaded copy of this file in Windows File Manager
and double-click on it.  EuroData will then install just as if you were
installing from a setup.exe program on a floppy disk.  Once EuroData is
installed, you may delete the ed2wset.exe program (you may wish to save it off
to a floppy first in case you want to re-install EuroData later).</P>
<P><B>Sharing copies of EuroData: </B>It is acceptable to make copies of
EuroData for your friends, but please encourage them to register their copy of
the program separately.  EuroData may <B>not</B> be posted to any bulletin
board, uselist, or online service, or otherwise distributed to the general
public, without express authorization from Personal Programs.  EuroData is a
copyrighted program and is not shareware or in the public domain.</P>
<P><B>Bookings &amp; Purchases: </B>The current version of EuroData   does not
include online booking or purchasing capabilities.   These features will be
included in an add-on program,  EuroData Connections, which should be released
in the first quarter of 1996.  If you register your copy of EuroData for
Windows, you will be notified when EuroData Connections is available.  There
will be no charge for this add-on.  The current version does allow you to
generate and print    Reservation Requests and other reports, and you may fax
these from your computer if your fax software supports faxing as a print option.</P>
<P><B>When installing EuroData under Windows 95</B>, do not place it in a path
which includes a non-Win31 compatible segment (e.g., &quot;c:\Program Files\..&quot;).
 EuroData will fail to resolve this path correctly in internal operations.  All
of our testing indicates that EuroData runs fine under Windows 95 provided it is
placed in a Win31-compatible path (e.g. the default, &quot;c:\ed2w\...&quot;)</P>
<P>At the <B>highest screen resolutions</B> (over 800x600), EuroMap will not
display cities in the correct positions because the background bitmap is too
small.  There is no present workaround for this except to run EuroData at a
lower resolution.</P>
<P><B>Accented Characters:</B> The online Help in some versions mistakenly
says to use an ALT-SHIFT combination to enter accented characters.  The correct
combination is CTRL-SHIFT.</P>
<P><B>Print Preview: </B>With some HP-DeskJet printers, print jobs may take
much longer to generate than with other printers.  During this time the
hourglass cursor may return to normal, giving an impression that nothing is
happening.  We are trying to resolve this problem, which is due to the 2-way
communication (printer-PC) that the HP driver utilizes.  If you are using an
HP-DeskJet, be patient and the print preview screen should appear in 5-10
seconds.
</P>
<P>In EuroData program version 1.0a (12.20.95), a problem occurs with the
Itinerary Report when a <B>car rental</B> is entered with Number of Days = 1. 
The rental will show up on its rental day <EM>and</EM> on each subsequent day
in the Itinerary Report.  Unfortunately the only work-around for this is to
increase the number of rental days to at least 2.  This bug is corrected in
subsequent versions.  If your verson of ed2w.exe has a date of 12.20.95 and you
have encountered this problem, you may want to download the latest version of
the .exe file (see &quot;Updates &amp; Patches&quot; below).</P>
<P><B>Online Capture:</B> A problem may occur if you attempt to use this
feature to capture text from a Windows Help program (including EuroData Online
Help).  Under some circumstances this may cause your system to lock up.  Since
capturing text from a help program would be an unusual use of this feature, you
will probably not experience this problem. 
</P>
<P>In the unlikely event that EuroData for Windows terminates unexpectedly due
to a program error, it's advisable to close all applications and exit Windows
before trying to run EuroData   for Windows again.  Attempting to run EuroData
again without rebooting could cause further problems, including General
Protection Faults.</P>
<P>There are reports of <B>Print Preview</B> causing GPFs under certain
circumstances.  This primarily affects developers who are using the file
VSVIEW.VBX in the Visual Basic development environment.  Because EuroData is a
Visual Basic program, if you have been using VB as a development tool it is
generally advisable to reboot your system prior to running the EuroData
executable.  Print Preview may also encounter problems if you change your screen
resolution after running EuroData and do not fully reboot the system prior to
running it again.</P>
<P><B>Deleting items from the Travel Routes Table:</B>  There is a bug in the
current version of EuroData that prevents deletions from working.  If you need
to remove items from the Travel Routes Table, you can edit the data file
directly using Notepad as it is stored as a plain text file.  Simply locate the
items you want to remove and delete them, then save the file.  Avoid leaving
blank lines where the deletions were, and <B>do not</B> delete any of the
section headings (numbers in brackets, for example &quot;[5]&quot;).</P>
<P><B>Changing the Italian Lira value:</B>  When you make small changes in the
&quot;$1 = nnnn.nnnn Lira&quot; calculation in the Currency Exchange Window it
may appear not to save the change.  This occurs because EuroData actually stores
exchange rates the other way around, i.e. &quot;1 [currency] = $nnnn.nnnn&quot;.
 Because of the Lira's very small unit value, &quot;$1=1550&quot; and &quot;$1=1563&quot;
(for example) both work out to &quot;$0.00064&quot; and this is the value that
is stored.  When you bring it up again, EuroData recalculates the $1=Lira value
(1/.00064) and it appears the same.  The workaround for this is not to worry
about it -- any change less than 20Lit in the rate won't have much impact on
your budget (we're talking 1/1000s of a cent here!).</P>
<P>A utility program, <B>Version Check</B>, has been installed with EuroData.
This program can be used to help identify any version conflicts in Windows
system files if you are having trouble running  EuroData.</P>
<P>Using the <B>UnInstall</B> utility:   An &quot;uninstall&quot; icon has
been added should you wish to remove   EuroData from your computer.  When you
double-click this icon,   an uninstall program will run that removes everything
from your computer than EuroData Setup placed there.  Be very careful  about
deleting system files (with extensions of .vbx or .dll) as these may be used by
other programs.</P>
<HR>
<H2>Updates &amp; Patches</H2>
<P>You can download the latest ed2wset.exe update (2.27.96)
<A HREF="http://www.eurodata.com/edwsetup.exe">here</A> (979kb).   version.) 
Corrections &amp; changes made in the version above include:</P>
<UL><LI>1-day car rental bug is fixed</LI>
<LI>Expanded Travel Routes Table shows more information</LI>
<LI>Notes for Travel Routes and Hotels now appear on report printouts</LI>
<LI>Backspace key now works in Credit Card Password entry</LI>
<LI>Mis-assigned cities on map are corrected (Lugano is back in Switzerland!)</LI>
<LI>Help error about foreign characters is corrected</LI></UL>
<HR>
<P><B>EuroData for DOS Data Import</B></P>
<P>Import Tools are now available for converting hotel &amp; travel route
records from EuroData for DOS to a format usable by EuroData for Windows.  Two
separate programs are required to do this: download 
<A HREF="http://www.eurodata.com/ed12cv.exe">ED12CV.EXE (Step 1)(191k) here</A>
and
<A HREF="http://www.eurodata.com/ed12dn.exe">ED12DN.EXE (Step 2)(97k)</A> here.
 The latter program is a self-installing executable which should be run from
within Windows.    If your verson of EuroData for Windows (ed2w.exe) is dated
before 1/7/96, you may also want to download the latest version (see above)
which provides better support for notes in travel route records.  Please note
that only hotel and travel route records can be converted; itineraries created
in EuroData for DOS cannot be converted for use in EuroData for Windows.</P></BODY></HTML>

<P>Rain spattered against the windows of the Edinburgh Express heading out of
London's Victoria Station, but inside the train it was  pleasant and
comfortable.  The journey north that would take me into Scotland:  the land of
castles and refineries, someone had said.  Three and a half hours later, I was
met at Edinburgh's uncrowded Waverly Staion by friends, having enjoyed varied
views of sheep grazing, villages, and the shorelines of eastern England and
Scotland.  As we drove away from the station, I became keenly aware of tall,
serious-looking, dark granite houses and office buildings.  They looked as if
they had been constructed by tall, serious people.<BR></P>
<P>The following morning my host advised me to take a taxi downtown in order to
get my bearings and some maps, to help find my way around this gracious city of
750,000.  The cabbie was cooperative and friendly, and once I got my American
tongue around the directions in a way that a Scotsman could understand. we were
off to the Tourist Information Office.  As for his  half of a chat we had on the
way down, I dinna ken bahr-ely a word -- though this improved mightily through
the day, as my ear adjusted to the clipped pronunciation.<BR></P>
<P>In due time, armed with my map and other information, I found the Royal
Mile, which extends from the granite majesty of Edinburgh Castle to the Palace
of Holyroodhouse, the Queen's residence in the city.  Today the Royal Mile is
lined with shops and museums, and its cul-de-sacs contain such interesting sites
as the house where the first encyclopedia was printed, or the Poetry Society of
Edinburgh, which  houses a great collection of twentieth century poets in
Gaelic, Scots, and English.  There is John Knox's house, the People's Story
Museum, the High Kirk of St. Giles, and the Museum of  childhood (probably the
noisiest museum in the world!).  There is Camera Obscura, with its unique optic
views of the Castle grounds, and the Brass Rubbing Center -- too many
interesting places to mention.<BR></P>
<P>Edinburgh Castle, at the head of the Royal Mile, receives over a million
visitors a year, who come to view the ancient battlements -- some dating back to
the eleventh century -- and the Crown Jewels of Scotland.  The Palace of
Hollyrood House, at the other end of the Mile, offers a visit to the chamber
where Rizzi, Mary Queen of Scots' purported lover, was murdered -- the dried
bloodstains on the floor are reportedly his -- with a voyeur's peep to the room
where Queen Elizabeth II dines during the two weeks she spends in Edinburgh
during the summer.  There is also a massive ballroom, whose walls are lined with
portraits by Jacob de Viet; almost all are likenesses of Charles II, king from
1660 to to 1685, and renowned for many things though not for his modesty.  It
was Charles who rebuilt the Palace in its present form.<BR></P>
<P>Hollyrood Park, adjoining the Palace, retains 650 acres of lovely garden and
magnificent parkland, which makes its way from the gentle slopes of blooming
gorse and broom at the edge of the city, up into the steep hills to the sheer
rock of Salisbury Crags and the windswept summit of Arthur's Seat, a long
extinct volcano.  The Parkland is a greatly-loved walking and climbing place. 
It was in the nearby Pentland Hills that Robert Louis Stevenson frequently came
to do his writing.<BR></P>
<P>Having just three days to spend in the city, I had to make choices.  I had
taken an open-air, double-decker sightseeing bus my first day, and was glad I
did, for it gave me a basic grounding in attractions and logistics.  In the
remaining time I was able to visit The National Gallery of Scotland, whose
masterpieces of European art give Edinburgh its claim to being the &quot;Athens
of the North;&quot; the home of Robert Louis Stevenson, with a plaque of the
poem commemorating his street's lamplighter; and the impressive monument to
Scotland's greatest poet, Robert Burns, he of  &quot;My luve is like a red, red
rose...&quot;<BR></P>
<P>Time did not permit me to visit the Royal Observatory or the Botanical
Gardens, and I had to pass on an attraction called &quot;Prince Charlie's
Extravaganza.&quot; I also missed an exciting football (soccer) fray between the
Hibernians and the Midlothians, but was treated to an informal singing fest by a
Newcastle team on the express train returning to London.  The lads were cheerful
and entertaining, if none too sober, as they rendered their lyrics to &quot;the
wild bloomin' heather in the wild mountain time.&quot;  At their stop at
Newcastle-on-Tyne, one of them forgot to get off the train; later, as the doors
re-closed and the train finally started up, a straight, terse message came over
the loudspeaker:  &quot;We apologize for the delay at Newcastle, which was
caused by platform duties.&quot;  Merry Olde England!<BR></P>
<P>Edinburgh has recently been declared a World Heritage City by the Monuments
and Sites Council of UNESCO, an award that puts it in on a footing with the Taj
Mahal, the Pyramids, and the Imperial Forum in Rome.  During the month of
August, the city plays host to the now legendary Edinburgh International
Festival. Marking its fiftieth anniversary this year, this lively carnival of
performance art was started in 1946 as an official entertainment for troops and
refugees, a &quot;lightening of spirit&quot; after the dreadful events of World
War II.  The popular Fringe entertainment began as a volunteer effort by some
talented young people who, piggybacking at first on the coattails of the
official events, in time became a tradition in itself.  Today the Edinburgh
Festival and Fringe has enormous popularity.  This year 9,000 performers from
more than 36 countries are expected during the 23-day festivities from August
11-31, including hundreds of well-known writers, actors, and artists.<BR></P>
<P>There is music, art, theatre, and of course the well-known Film Festival,
this year to concentrate on Italian films and filmmakers.  There is the Poetry
Festival, an international event run from the Scottish Poetry Library.  The &quot;Tattoo&quot;
involves the military bands playing on the esplanade of the Castle.  Those
interested in what is truly an exciting, world-famous event are being advised
that bookings are tight; it is not too early to reserve lodging for NEXT year's
festival. <BR></P>
<P>Prior to this visit, as I citizen of the world I had been ignorant of how
many of the world's acclaimed scientists have been produced by Scotland!  To
name just a few: Alexander Graham Bell, James Watt, William Simpson, who
discovered chloroform(quite by accident, it is said.)  Other famed  Edinburgh
figures include Mr. Brodie, a respected businessman by day, who burgled his
peers by night, giving rise to Robert Louis Stephenson's well-known novelette,
Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.  And of course there is Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, without
whom there would be no Sherlock Holmes.<BR></P>
<P>My last evening in town, friends drove me into nearby Leith, the Port of
Edinburgh about a mile and a half from City Centre.  There we stopped off at the
club room of the Scotch Malt Whiskey Society, a must for those with special
interest in fine malt whiskies.  As every good Scotsman knows, the taste of pure
single malt scotch whiskey is quite unlike that of grain whiskies.  The original
recipe for this essence of taste--having to do with peatings--is said to have
been introduced by the monks as early as the 12th century.  Certainly it has
been good business for Scotland since 1678.  We sampled some twenty- year old
stuff that was superb. <BR></P>
<P>For a unique way to spend next year's New Year's celebration, singing Robert
Burns's &quot;Auld Lang Syne&quot; right where it was written, consider the
Hogmanay celebrations of Edinburgh, a city that has gained the reputation for
hosting the &quot;Biggest New Year Party in Europe.&quot;  This year the
entertainment is scheduled to include the traditional Torchlight Procession,
Hogmanay Carnival and Street Party, and many more events for the whole family,
from December 30, 1996 - January l, 1997.  And then there is always the essence
of Scottish tradition in this festival city: the Piping in the Haggis, on Burns'
night, January 12.  &#164;<BR></P>

<P><STRONG><EM><FONT COLOR="#FF0080">Around Ireland's Dingle Peninsula</FONT><BR></EM></STRONG></P>
<P>We never got to Dingle.  Maybe it was because we missed the boat from Wales.
 Maybe it was because we missed the plane at Heathrow.  But I think it was
because Bob just might have been the laziest horse in Ireland.<BR></P>
<P>Driving a Gypsy peddler wagon around the Dingle Peninsula, you quickly catch
 on to your horse's foibles.  Bob, who hadn't been on the road since the
previous summer, still remembered the turn in to Mrs. Gleasure's Annagh Farm; it
was his usual first stop.  But it was my contention that a day's work for a
horse consisted of a bit more than pulling a lightweight, rubber- tired wagon
less than five miles over paved, level roads.<BR></P>
<P>Mr. Slattery, of Slatttery's Travel Agency in Tralee, had given us a map
showing routes to explore, and camping spots where he had arranged with farmers
to allow us to stay for about $5 U.S. per night.  Mr. Slattery was a most
accommodating man.  We arrived late on the day we were to pick up our
horse-drawn home.  First, we missed the ship from Wales to Ireland.  Then we
arrived at London's Heathrow Airport too late to board the plane to Cork.  The
airline people were sorry, but they couldn't refund our money.  What could we
do?  Well, we could pay some additional money and take the plane to Shannon in a
few hours.  Rather than lose a $300 airfare we went to Shannon, where we were
able to catch a bus to Limerick.  From there another bus went to Rathkeale, but
there was nothing to Tralee where our $20-per-day caravan waited for us. 
Ireland is a small country, at 26,000 square miles half the size of Florida. 
Tralee seemed like Montana away.  We phoned Mr. Slattery, who told us public
carrier couldn't get us there before some time the next afternoon.  I said we
would hitchhike.<BR></P>
<P>Becky grew up in Bellingham, Washington, a small Pacific Northwest
community.  This was our first trip to Europe and hitchhiking was new to her.  
Being the better looking of the two of us, she stood by the roadside with her
thumb out while I sat on our luggage.  We got to Tralee two rides later, after a
short trip to Grenada with a native of Ireland and a second lift from a Canadian
father and daughter in their rental car. These two, after hearing our plight,
took us right to Slattery's Caravan Centre south of Tralee. <BR></P>
<P>Mr. Slattery arranged for us to stay in our rented wagon that night.  We
mentioned that we hadn't eaten  and asked where we could buy some food.   It was
6 p.m. and he had a school board meeting at seven, but  said he could take us
three miles to the nearest store if we didn't spend a lot of time shopping.  We
shopped quickly for dinner and for the next morning's breakfast.   Back in our
caravan, we piled on the covers and dreamed of the journey ahead.  <BR> </P>
<P>Right after breakfast we met Bob.  Having grown up farming with horses in
Iowa in the 40s, I bad some idea of what a horse of Bob's build  could handle. 
Bob would have looked small compared to the American draft horses that we now
see at fairs and parades around the US; he was about the size of a Western
quarter horse, with muscular  legs and broad back.  A pinto gelding, Bob was a
bit overweight from a seven-month winter break, but he wasn't old or
broken-down.   Bob just had ideas of his own of just how far he should be asked 
to pull a wagon in a day.<BR> </P>
<P>I was embarrassed at having to be shown how to harness a horse; but Mr.
Slattery assured me not to  worry, the people at each of the suggested camping
places would help me if I forgot.  Our first-day goal was Mrs. Ashe's Pub at
Camp, some 15 miles west of Tralee.  But Bob was sure a night at Mrs. Gleasure's
would be more pleasant.  When I used the reins to pull his head around so he
couldn't see the driveway he was trying to enter, he stopped dead.  He knew
where the first day was to end and he wasn't planning on going any further.  The
day was sunny but cool, and the sun was not yet over head.  I jumped down from
the plank driver's seat, took Bob's head and pulled forward.  He pulled back. 
He out-weighed me and knew it.  I turned to pleading, but  Bob only understood
Gaelic.  Finally, for reasons that I failed to understand, Bob began moving
forward.  A few miles later I began to understand why Bob wasn't looking forward
to the road ahead.  The narrow, paved lane began to climb up among  heavily
grazed hills.  At Becky's insistence, we climbed down from our caravan and
walked alongside, as Bob actually began to put his shoulders into his work.<BR></P>
<P>By early afternoon we were at the 200-year-old pub.  Mrs. Ashe showed us
where to park our wagon and where to pasture Bob.  Coin-operated showers behind
the pub washed the dust from caravanners such as us.  The caravan was equipped
similar to many American tent trailers of years ago:  it had a sink and a five
gallon jerry can of water.  Beside the sink was a propane two-burner stove, and
beneath the stove a small ice box.  Across the rear was a small table which
folded out of the way of a double bed.  A few dishes, pots and pans, cutlery and
candles completed the outfitting.  <BR></P>
<P>After a shower and a change of clothes, Becky and I went to explore the pub.
 It was nearly filled with local families having dinner and conversation in
English with enough brogue to make eavesdropping   difficult.  Becky was a bit
disappointed that the Irish people weren't more boisterous in the tavern.  They
hardly lived up to the American movie image of the hard-drinking Irish; there
was no singing and no fights.  We had delicious meals which included excellent
potted mussels and a cockle and mussel soup.   At our home on Lummi Island,
Washington, mussels grow on pilings and, at that time, no one we knew considered
mussels food for humans; but we found we preferred them to clams.  The cost of
dinner for two with wine was nine punts, or about US$13.50 including tip.<BR></P>
<P>By now a stiff wind was blowing over the barren hills and a chill came over
us.  We returned to our caravan just before sunset and climbed into bed wearing
sweaters and slippers, with four blankets.  At 8:50, bells from a small church
across the field began to chime.  Before long, families began arriving on foot
along the narrow, blacktopped road.  Since Camp consisted only of the pub, a
grocery store and a few houses, the people apparently walked from nearby farms. 
A hearse drew up and some of the men carried a coffin into the church.  About a
half hour later the bells chimed again and the people departed the church.   The
coffin was left inside.<BR></P>
<P>The wind picked up during the night and we hardly slept as the caravan
shook.  At times we actually felt it roll uphill under the force of the gusts. 
Next morning we found the blocks of wood we had placed behind the wheels were
some three feet behind the caravan.<BR></P>
<P>Bob had been fed and watered and turned loose in a pasture of about two
acres for the night.  In the morning we went out to catch him, but he didn't
have any desire to be caught.  It became a game with him and a desperate
struggle of man over beast with us.  We would ease him toward a corner and, just
when we were sure we had him, he would take a run at Becky and she (wisely)
would choose to step aside.  I figured a bucket of grain might tempt him within
reach; I was wrong.  Then Becky remembered some sugar lumps we had purchased at
a neighborhood store in Tralee.  Bob's weakness was found:  he came for the
sugar.  For the rest of the week, he and Becky were inseparable.<BR> </P>
<P>It wasn't long before we found that Bob was quite pleased with carrots and
apples, too.  When Bob took a notion, he would just stop and munch grass along
the road.    I was determined to have the upper hand; no horse was going to tell
me when it was time for him to quit work.  I would slap the manila reins lightly
on his back and say the equivalent of &quot;giddup&quot; in Gaelic.  Mr.
Slattery said the horse only understood Gaelic and we had learned <I>stop</I>,
<I>go</I>, <I>left</I> and <I>right</I> in Bob's native tongue.  When Gaelic &quot;giddup&quot;
didn't get Bob moving, I would climb down from the caravan and take his head and
lead him.<BR></P>
<P>For the next few days we drove to places with  names like Castelgregory
(where we camped on a narrow spit between Brandon Bay and Tralee Bay) and
Cloghane (on the bay between Stradbally and Brandon mountains).  We'd cross
ancient looking stone-arch bridges and stop to graze Bob and to record the scene
on film.<BR></P>
<P>Ireland is formed like a big basin, with low mountains around its sea coast
and flat farmlands and peat bogs inland.  We were traveling in County Kerry home
of Carrantuohill, at 3415 feet the highest point in  all Ireland.  Any grade of
more than three percent, Bob considered an affront to his dignity; many times 
we climbed from the wagon to walk alongside.  Driving on the left side of the
road wasn't too hard to learn, except for my tendency to turn into the oncoming
lane of traffic when making right turns.  The Irish we met welcomed tourists;
even tourist like us who spent $35 on an average day for groceries, a  hot meal
and a place to park our caravan for the night.  Mid-May was only the beginning
of the tourist season here, and of Mr. Slattery's 30 caravans, only two were on
the road at that time.  We never encountered the honeymooning French couple who
had the other rig.<BR></P>
<P>Most of the people we saw on the Dingle Peninsula were farmers or
shopkeepers.   Their fields were tidy and the greenest we have seen anywhere in
our travels.  They drove small cars at reckless rates (or so it seem to us, as
we plodded along at three miles per hour).  We saw many sheep and dairy cattle. 
Unlike the dairy farms of the midwest where I grew up, the  milkman didn't come
to the farms of Ireland to pick up their milk.  Each farmer had a small
stainless steel tank on a trailer or a number of cans on a wagon which he took
to town each day.   Most were pulled by cars but some were packed on horse or
mule-drawn carts.  The people of Ireland generally show little signs of wealth. 
At the time we were there, the per capita income was $5,190 and 67 percent of
the work force was engaged in agriculture.<BR></P>
<P>When we ran low on Irish currency, I decided I'd catch a bus to Tralee and
visit a bank.   Our American traveler's checks weren't generally accepted by the
local merchants.   After asking when and where I could catch a bus to Tralee, I
casually mentioned the need to go to town to cash some traveler's checks.   &quot;No
need,&quot; I was told. &quot;At 10 a.m. tomorrow the bank will stop right out
in front here for half a hour.&quot;  Next day we waited in line for a van --
something like our library bookmobiles -- to arrive so I could turn my
traveler's checks into punts.<BR></P>
<P>We purchased food each day at small villages along the way, and generally
had a picnic for lunch and ate in pubs in the evenings.  The few other tourists
in the area were recognized by the fact that they would roar past our little
caravan, stop their rental cars, jump out, take our photo and roar away.  It was
sad to think that they wouldn't experience the pleasure of moving at less than
three miles per hour through the most beautiful rolling hills of County Kerry. 
How would they ever know the lanes lined with rock fences or hedges of roses and
scotch broom?  Their vacation was one of racing from picture opportunity to
picture opportunity, for tomorrow they had to see Cork or Dublin.  Tomorrow, we
were going to see a pasture near Inch.<BR></P>
<P>We never got to Dingle.  It was nearly at the end of the peninsula; that
would be another 15 miles or so, and Bob had traveled far enough for his first
week of work that year.  He wasn't the dumbest horse in Ireland.  Maybe not even
the laziest: we noticed his pace picked up as he neared the caravan centre. 
Becky wept when she said good-bye to Bob.  Six years later, we see a brown and
white horse and say, &quot;I wonder how old Bob is doing?&quot;  &#164;<BR></P>

<H1><FONT COLOR="#004080">Pedaling Paris</FONT></H1>
<P><EM><FONT COLOR="#FF0080">by Jerri Clark Kirby</FONT></EM></P>
<HR>
<P>The immediate thought of pedaling a bicycle around the frenzied streets of 
the heart of Paris sounds insane.  It's not. It's probably safer than walking,
and is a lot faster.  Biking liberates you to cover distances more quickly while
allowing you to travel streets that are difficult or impossible in an
automobile.  And you can park your bike almost anywhere!<BR></P>
<P>Bike-tour operators in Paris work hard to ensure the safety of participants.
 They offer well-maintained bicycles, encourage the use of helmets, (which are
not required by law but are recommended), and present thorough lessons  in which
they familiarize participants with the bikes and teach proper operation.  And
there is safety in numbers:  a few cyclists riding together have a noticeable
presence on the streets, which accords them all the needed respect.<BR></P>
<P>The guides know Paris inside and out.  They live in the Paris area and have
biked the city many, many times. They comment on the historical  sites, stop for
good photos, fill you in on neighborhood characteristics.  Normally, a tour
covers about 10 miles in about 3 to 4 hours. There are three tour companies who
specialize in English commentary:  Paris Bike, Paris Velo and Paris a Velo. 
Each company has a variety of interesting itineraries which include pedaling by
some of the more renowned sites such at the Eiffel Tower and Notre-Dame
Cathedral, with forays into areas along the St-Martin canal or up to the Butte
aux Calles.  Routes are carefully laid out to avoid heavy traffic on main
thoroughfares. As you cycle along these &quot;backroads,&quot; you gain an
insider's peek into the homes of the Parisians; you see where they shop; where
the kids play; where they walk their dogs; where they go to market; and where
they stroll and chat with others on warm summer evenings.<BR></P>
<P>Each of these three companies also offers night excursions to view
illuminated monuments; the bicycles have lights and, if you really are a biking
enthusiast with good stamina, you can take a 40-mile tour to Versailles which
includes a castle visit during the six-hour tour.  You don't have to be a
professional bike rider; you just need a reasonable level of physical fitness
and a sense of adventure.<BR></P>
<P>Some friends just returned home from Paris, having taken Paris Velo's <I>La
Rive Gauche</I> (Left Bank) tour, and they were very excited about their
new-found method of getting around this busy city.  Before setting off, each
person in the group (totaling five including the guide),  was outfitted with a
bike and helmet. After receiving lessons in how to operate everything and a
basic itinerary, they were off!  They rode past a highly ornate mosque and up a
narrow street called rue Lacepede to place de la Contrescarpe, quaint with a new
fountain.  On to rue Mouffetard, an ancient Roman road which was actually the
main road in southern Paris until the 19th century.  Up a gentle hill to the
Pantheon, the highest point on the Left Bank. The group stopped for a commentary
about the commanding edifice in the shape of a Greek cross, topped by a huge
dome.  At this point, everyone in the group was used to their bikes, at ease
riding in a group, and eager for more.<BR></P>
<P>They rolled on down rue Soufflot to the Luxembourg Garden and off onto rue
Garanciere, a quiet street lined with <I>h&ocirc;tel particuliers</I>.  The
next stop was place St-Sulpice, a lovely square with a fountain facing the
church of the same name.  A few photos were snapped, and then the group
zig-zagged through the St-Germaine-des-Pres area, once a center of international
Bohemian life and most picturesque.  Then on along the quays of the Seine,
taking in the Louvre on the other side of the river and the Musee d'Orsay on the
bikers' side.  They rolled along the long, straight rue de l'Universite, passing
by the Assembl&eacute;e National and the Invalides garden, before arriving at
the base of the Eiffel Tower.  Someone  had a flat tire and  the tour guide put
on another hat: that of mechanic.  He fixed the flat and off they went to
explore the 15th arrondissement, a residential neighborhood of parks, open-air
markets, quiet streets and  picturesque architecture.  Rambling back to the
starting point, they passed by Georges Brassens park, over a short cycling lane
above the TGV train tracks, the place Denfert-Rochereau and Montsouris park;
then, the challenge of a 200 foot climb up to the Butte aux Cailles. The group
took its time and no one had a problem, thanks to the efficiently-geared bikes. 
The effort was rewarding - the Butte has retained an atmosphere of a country
village, complete with apple trees and cobblestones.<BR></P>
<P>Returning to the Paris Velo bike station, the group reviewed their 11-mile,
3-hour trek, gathering around a large map to note favorite places and make
recommendations to the guide for future trips.  My friends signed up for yet
another tour the next day; they swear this is the only way to see Paris up
close.  I certainly plan to try it on my next visit! &#164;</P>

<P><BR></P>
<P>For cross-country bicycling, fully escorted tours can offer the advantages
of baggage transport and prearranged meals &amp; lodging, but they also lock you
into a particular schedule and route.  Setting out entirely on your own gives
you freedom, but the missed opportunities and unexpected difficulties that can
mar a poorly planned journey may turn your &quot;dream trip&quot; into a bad
memory.  <BR></P>
<P>If your interest is in bicycling France's beautiful Loire Valley, a company
called <STRONG>Bike Tour France</STRONG> offers a unique service that combines
the best of both worlds:  complete a questionnaire on your trip's basic
parameters (when, how long, number of cyclists) and your own preferences (how
much riding per day, particular interests, etc.), and they will produce a
customized &quot;self-drive&quot; itinerary for you, complete with daily travel
routes, detailed maps of riding terrain and local attractions, affordable hotel
recommendations, and an audio cassette guide to listen to <I>en route</I>.  The
kit also includes a translated glossary of French bicycle terms, a summary of
French traffic laws as they pertain to cyclists, and a wealth of practical
advice drawn from owner Jerry H. Simpson's more than twenty years' experience
bicycling France.  For all of this, the charge is just $37.50 per cycling day
for any number of travelers, with a minimum of 5 days.  All of their tours begin
and end in Blois and include directions on getting to Blois via rail from the
major Paris airports.  If you wish to rent a bike in France rather than bringing
your own, they can also provide you with advance reservation forms so that your
rental is set up and waiting for you upon your arrival in Blois.  For more
information or to request an itinerary questionnaire, contact <B>Bike Tour
France at 5523 Wedgewood Drive, Charlotte NC 28210-2432; telephone
1-704-527-0955. </B><BR></P>
<P>Mr. Simpson is also the author of a guidebook in the Active Travel series,
<I>Cycling France</I>.  The book offers maps, summaries of terrain, and
descriptions of what you can see and do along the way on some of France's best
cycling routes, along with information on planning, packing, and transporting
your bike, and is illustrated with 60 photos and 140 maps.  Order <I>Cycling
France</I> for $12.95 from <B>Bicycle Books, Inc., PO Box 2038, Mill Valley CA

<P><B>And you thought <I>your</I> bath remodel was expensive...</B> the City
Council of <B>Bath, England</B>, has drawn up a plan to restore the town&#146;s
famous Roman baths to full working condition, with the plumbers&#146; bill
expected to top $2 million.  They&#146;ve asked the English Heritage foundation
to cover half the cost and are hunting about for the rest.  As coroporate

<P><B>Pounds of flesh...</B> if you&#146;re Britain-bound, buy everything but
your tea-and-crumpets over here before you get on the plane.  A sudden <B>upward
gust</B> has made the pound sterling among the priciest of currencies, with spot
rates hitting $1.75-$1.80 in some locations.  The more pre-pay options you can
take advantage of&#151;dollar-for-pound hotel packages, transit cards, museum
passes, etc.&#151; the better off you&#146;ll be.

<HR>
<P><B>Record-Breaking Year:</B>  1996 is expected to set a new all-time record
for <B>U.S visitors to Europe</B>, according to the European Trade Commission,
with a whopping nine million of us estimated to have headed over this year. 
<I>(A figure Miss Elainey can confirm, as they were all in front of her at the
Louvre admission queue.) </I> The projection is for twelve million annually by
2000, an increase of 750,000 per year..   
</P>
<HR>
<P><B>Personal security for visitors</B> is becoming a mini-industry in
Russia, with concern heightened following the gangster-style shooting of an
American businessman in <B>Moscow</B>.  At least one tour company employs armed
guards to accompany travelers on long rail journeys, and several hotels have
installed metal detectors in lobby entrances.  While most experts say that
Russia can still be visited safely, independent travel is not recommended and
should be undertaken only with considerable care.  Obtaining taxis only through
your hotel, and engaging a reliable translator/bodyguard before venturing beyond
the prominent tourist areas, are among the suggested precautions.  
</P>
<HR>
<P><B>Finally putting right</B> a much older bit of crime, the English have
returned the legendary <B>Stone of Scone</B> to its rightful place in Scotland&#151;700
years after King Edward swiped it.  Scotland&#146;s ancient kings were crowned
on the stone, which until now has rested beneath the Coronation Chair in <B>Westminster
Abbey</B>.  This past November 30&#151;the feast day of Scotland&#146;s patron
saint St. Andrew&#151;it was shipped north for a solemn installation in
Edinburgh Castle, where it may now be viewed.

<HR>
<P><B>Expect to hear a <I>lot</I> about duty-free shopping</B> on your next
trip.  The Tax Free World Association, a trade group devoted to promoting
duty-free sales, is mounting a publicity drive meant to enlist travelers in the
campaign to save duty-free.  According to a decree of the European Commission
(EC), all duty-free traffic in Europe is to be <B>abolished in 1999</B>.  EC
officials believe that duty-free sales are incompatible with the goal of a
single unified market.</P>
<HR>
<P><B>Visitors may be somewhat more appreciative</B> of EC &#147;meddling&#148;
in another area: Europe&#146;s electric standards body, called Cenelac, is being
prodded to complete a plan for reducing the six different types of electrical
plugs found in Europe to <B>a single design</B>, eliminating the need for
travelers to carry a sackful of adapters.  But despite years of meetings,
Cenelac has been unable to settle the matter; part of the problem is that
Cenelac itself is made up of representatives from the various regional
electrical industries&#151;each of whom hopes to avoid substantial conversion
costs by having its current design picked as the standard. 
</P>
<HR>
<P><B>Edgy cigarette smokers</B>, increasingly finding themselves on long-haul
flights with the smoking section eliminated, can hope that an <B>Air France</B>
experiment in compromise works out.  On certain flights to Asia, the French
carrier now bans smoking in <I>all</I> of the seating rows, but provides a
small, powerfully ventilated stand-up area in each cabin where a few smokers at
a time can settle nicotine jitters&#151;without inflicting fumes on the crew or
other passengers.  So far, both smokers and non-smokers have reportedly been
pleased with the arrangement.  
</P>
<HR>
<P><B>Milan&#146;s Malpensa airport</B> will become an international hub soon,

<H2>European Christmas</H2>
<P><BR><I>by Jerri Clark Kirby</I></P>
<P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">Joyeaux Noel: France</FONT></I></B>
<BR> In France, Christmas begins as an all night party.  After attending
Midnight Mass on Christmas Eve, the French return home for a huge meal, with
numerous courses.  The menu varies from one region to another, in keeping with
local traditions, but often begins with oysters and ends with Buche de Noel, a
cake  shaped like a Yule log. After the meal, gifts are exchanged.  No one goes
to bed  until almost dawn and Christmas Day is spent resting and eating.  Most
homes display a Nativity scene, or &quot;creche,&quot; complete with figurines
called &quot;santons,&quot; (little saints).  Most are made by craftsmen in
southern France and the  molds are passed down from generation to generation. 
Represented are the Holy family, shepherds and wisemen as well as local
dignitaries and characters.  <BR></P>
<P>One tradition is to leave the Christ child figurine out of the manger until
everyone returns home from Midnight Mass. The children are then told &quot;le
petite Jesus&quot; has left the gifts.  Other homes are visited by &quot;Pere
Noel&quot; and his partner, &quot;Pere Fouettard.&quot;    Pere Fouettard
reminds Pere Noel of just how well the children behaved during the  year.  If
they were naughty, they will be visited by Pere Fouettard who brings coal and 
spanks them with sticks.  In some parts of France, Pere Noel brings small gifts
on St. Nicholas Eve, December 6th, and returns on Christmas Eve. Generally,
adults wait until New Year's Day to exchange gifts. 
<BR></P>
<P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">Germany: Christmas Tradition</FONT></I></B> 
<BR>Neighboring Germany is strong in Christmas traditions, yet not everyone is
even aware that the Yule log and the Christmas tree have German origins, or that
Santa's visits combine two old German customs.  The  Christmas hymn, &quot;Silent
Night,&quot; was written in German by  priest and first published in Leipzig. 
In ancient times, December 25th marked the festival of Jul, celebrated by 
Germanic tribes to honor the sun god Fryr.  This marked the winter solstice, the
time of year when the sun reaches its lowest point. These Jul ceremonies
included the decorating of homes with evergreen, and the burning of special
logs.   In the fourth century, to stamp its magnificence on this pagan
celebration, the Christian church advanced  its holiday, changing the
celebration of the birth of  Christ from January 6th, Epiphany, to December
25th.  German folklore tells that the tradition of the Christmas tree may have
been further developed by  St. Boniface in his conversion of Germanic pagans in
the fourth century.  He is said to have dedicated a fir  tree to the Christ
child as a substitute for the Sacred Oak of Woden.  Martin Luther, the German
reformer, added candles to his Christmas fir,  Tannenbaum, in the 16th entury. 
Gilded apples, nuts and paper streamers in  various colors were later ornaments.
 <BR></P>
<P>During the 18th  and 19th centuries, the  holiday tradition of a decorated,
candle-lit tree, gradually spread outside of   Germany, first to England and on
to the New World with the arrival of German  immigrants.  For  German children,
St. Nicholas Day is when a tall white-bearded figure in a sheepskin coat and
crown, or  bishop's hat, goes from home to home rewarding good children with
presents and bad children with lumps  of coal.  Early December is also when the
Christkindlsmarkt, or traditional  Christmas fairs, get under way in  many
locations throughout Germany.  Vendors set up stalls in public squares;
Christmas decorations are  hung everywhere and so begins several weeks of music,
shopping, seasonal food and holiday cheer.  The oldest of these fairs is the 600
year old fair in Munich. 
<BR></P>
<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><I>Merrie Olde England</I></FONT></B>  
<BR>England has celebrated the merriest of Christmases since feudal days, when
the halls of grand castles resounded  with merrymaking and feasting.  Heralding
the birth of Christ were Yule logs, plum puddings, boar's head  and caroling. 
Today's England lacks the huge fireplaces for the Yule log, but Christmas
continues to be a  joyful time, with beautiful, elaborate religious ceremonies,
family reunions and happy celebration. Carol  singing at home and at church is a
part of the tradition;  Christmas card sending began in England in the  1840's. 
  On Christmas Eve, stockings are hung above the fireplace or bed, so that
Father Christmas can fill them.  After the children go to sleep, adults decorate
a lush tree and the home with mistletoe, holly and ornaments.  Christmas dinner
is usually served in the early afternoon and includes turkey, roast potatoes, 
mince pie,  and plum pudding served with flaming brandy.  Placed next to each
plate is a Christmas cracker.  Each person pulls the cracker, which gives a &quot;bang&quot;
as it is opened; inside are a paper hat, plastic toy, and message for the
current year.  Everyone wears their paper hats for the rest of the meal.    Many
put gifts of jewelry, money or other fine things into the crackers.   
<BR></P>
<P>At 3:00 pm, the Queen gives her annual message. She discussed the prior
year, plans for the future and positive things about the royal family.  The rest
of the day is spent watching old movies on tv or ice skating on one of the many
frozen ponds in England.  December 26th is Boxing Day, originally a day for the
wealthy to wait on their servants.  Now, it is an extension of Christmas and
another day for the British to party with their friends and family.  &#164;    
If you'd like to experience Christmas in Europe, many companies are offering
tours. One is INTRAV, offering trips including Christmas &amp; New Year's in
Rome, Paris and London;  A &quot;Silent Night&quot; Christmas and New Year's:

<HR>
<P><STRONG><EM><FONT COLOR="#FF0080">An introduction to the book by David
Shore and Patty Campbell</FONT></EM></STRONG><BR></P>
<P><I>The morning sky is ablaze with color as the sun rises over the Swiss
Alps. The first rays to clear the peaks pierce the cool morning air and like a
warm, gentle hand reach through a louvered window, waking a pair of sleepy
adventurers.  They stretch lazily, enjoying the deliciousness of  the crisp
breeze wafting in off the lake, the warm sun shining now into all the windows,
and the snugness and privacy of their own home on the shores of Lake Geneva.</I><BR></P>
<P><I>But they've enjoyed their free Swiss chalet long enough. They've been
there a week; it's time to move on. The rolling French countryside calls. They
consult the map and discover a back road that winds from the border all the way
to Paris. So they fold up the inflatable boat and stow it under the seat, put
away everything loose, and they're ready to head for the open road.  Their
lakeside villa will become a private tour bus.  It will stop wherever they want
to stop. It will turn off onto interesting side roads.  It will even allow them
to change their minds and head for Provence and the Cote d'Azure.  After a day
of marvelous sights and pleasant human encounters, they pull off the road and
into a forest glade rosy with the glow of sunset.  Dinner is a feast, cooked
quickly and intimately in the van kitchen with foods more flavorful and fresher
than those available at home.</I><BR></P>
<P><I>They dine by candlelight at their private table as Mozart serenades them
from the tape deck.   Later, the well-fed couple spends the evening hours
brushing up on their French and reading to each other from tour books about the
fascinating experiences that wait for them along  tomorrow's path.  Tomorrow
night, or the next night, when they are in Paris, they may opt for an evening on
the town -- their city clothes are hanging neatly in the closet -- but tonight
in the quiet forest they admire the stars and then snuggle gratefully into their
own comfortable bed for a peaceful sleep as the sound of crickets wafts through
the louvered window....</I></P>
<HR>
<P>A pretty idyll. But is it just a fantasy? After all, everybody knows that
European travel isn't this easy.  You can't just go there and see what happens
-- you need itineraries, schedules, reservations. Right? Wrong.  With a van or
motorhome, you have total flexibility.  You can change your mind  whenever a
more interesting option appears.  As examples, once we went to Europe with the 
general intention of driving down the boot of Italy, but it turned out to be a
summer of record-breaking heat.  So we went to Scandinavia instead, where
everyone was delighted with the unaccustomed warmth.  Another time we were
driving in Germany one afternoon when we were struck with a powerful desire to
have dinner in France.  So we turned west, crossed the Rhine into Alsace, and
had one of the most delicious meals of our lives in Strasbourg that evening.
<BR></P>
<P>Another thing everybody knows is that travel means hassling with luggage,
check-out times at  hotels, and train and bus schedules.  Not here it doesn't. 
You unpack only once, into your campervan's many handy cupboards and closets.
Check-out time is whenever you feel like  leaving -- and it might not be until
day after tomorrow.  And you can spend your time seeing the beauties of Europe
-- not waiting on the platforms of endless train stations.<BR></P>
<P>Everybody also is convinced that camping means roughing it.  They probably
have memories of  sleeping on the cold ground on scouting trips.  But your van
is a clean, comfortable little house on  wheels, not a drafty tent.  European
campgrounds are not wilderness outposts; they are pleasant  grassy places with
stores, cafes, and other civilized amenities.  And every night you sleep in your
own bed.  That same &quot;everybody&quot; suspects that driving in Europe is a
nightmare of bad roads and wild drivers, and that trying to manage a motorhome
under these conditions would be madness.  Again, &quot;everybody&quot; is dead
wrong.  Most European highways and motorways are state of the art, and a
campervan or small motorhome is as manageable as a car.  European drivers  must
pass rigorous tests before they get their licenses and are usually quite
skilled.  Big-city traffic can be heavy and confusing, as at home, but you can
avoid this problem easily by staying at a campground on the edge of town and
riding the metro or a bus into the urban center. <BR></P>
<P>And, finally, everybody really knows that a trip to Europe costs a fortune,
right?  Wrong once  again.  You can pay as much or as little for a van or
motorhome as your pocket and your thirst for luxury dictate; there is a wide
range of rental vehicles available, from American-style motorhomes to that good
old standby, the VW van.  For trips of two months or more, you'll save by
purchasing a vehicle from a dealer offering a buy-back guarantee.<BR></P>
<P>Actually, you can even make a profit if you time it right.  The first
version of our book was called  <I>Cheaper Than Staying Home</I>, because for
us, in 1981, it was. We sublet our apartment and let  somebody else pay the rent
and the utilities, and went off on assignment to do a book about American street
performers in Europe. We did our own cooking, which didn't count as an expense,
because after all, you gotta eat at home, too. We freecamped behind the houses
of jugglers or under the windows of guitarists, and that was okay, too, because
it put us more in touch with our subjects -- who soon became our friends. When
we ran out of money for gas we found a good place and just stayed there awhile
until our funds recovered.  Eventually we sold our old van when we went home for
almost as much as we'd paid for it three months earlier.<BR></P>
<P>We made mistakes -- lots of them. We bought a terrible old  wreck from a
sinister mechanic in a back alley in London, and three weeks later it threw a
rod and expired on a late Saturday afternoon as we were crossing the Rhine.  We
didn't know how to register the vehicle or buy insurance, so we didn't, a fact
that now makes us pale.  We  crossed borders without changing money and then
tried to use American dollars, a fact that now makes us blush.  In short, we
messed up at every turn, but we had a wonderful time anyway.  We had so much fun
that we  went back the next year, and the next, and almost all the years  since,
for three or more months at a time. Gradually the kinks smoothed out as we got
more  practiced and knowledgeable.  We wrote a little book to help other people
with our hard won  savvy, and our readers wrote and telephoned us by the
hundreds to share their own experiences.  Over the years we have upgraded our
style and travel in what would have struck us as luxury in the beginning -- but
we still choose a van, and still have adventures. <BR></P>
<P>Obviously, we are hooked on van and motorhome travel, as are many Europeans.
But is it for  you? There are some trade-offs for all the good things.  For the
advantage of flexibility you must be willing to make your own decisions, to risk
surprises good and bad (our book tells stories of both kinds).  You must be
willing to do your own driving; (we offer tips on European traffic know-how in
chapter three). For the advantage of always having a place to sleep, you must
pay some attention to the techniques of living in a small space (see chapter
nine for a lesson on van choreography).  For the opportunity to sample the
Continental lifestyle and make European friends you must be willing to try a few
words of foreign languages at least occasionally (for a magic list see chapter
six). <BR></P>
<P>Our book is a guide to the techniques of European van and motorhome travel. 
It is not a destination guide; other than mentioning a few of our favorite
places we're not going to  tell you where to go or what to see.  Nor, obviously,
are we going to give you lists of hotels and restaurants -- you won't need them.
 Nor do we waste space on fillers like climate charts.  What we try to do is
tell all you need to know to rent, buy, sell, drive, and live in a  camping
vehicle in Europe -- and have a wonderful time doing it.  &#164;</P>

<H2>Miss Elainey's Notes</H2>
<P><BR><I><B>News &amp; Gossip on the European Travel Front</B></I><BR></P>
<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">Gambling Man:</FONT></B>  American Airlines
chairman Robert Crandall, in a tussle with Virgin Atlantic over AA's bid for a
partnership with British Airways, has offered to personally bet Virgin's founder
Richard Branson &#163;100,000 that average U.S./London airfares would fall if
the alliance is approved.  Branson, who like Crandall is a colorful &amp;
controversial figure in the industry, claims the AA/BA deal would be
anticompetitive and is trying to have it blocked by regulators. 
<BR></P>
<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">To Russia with Starbucks:</FONT></B>  Magadan
Airlines, a one-time subsidiary of Russia's Aeroflot, has requested permission
to begin offering roundtrip services to Russia from Seattle and Anchorage.  The
airline, which currently runs charters and scheduled services outside the U.S.,
needs approval from the Deptartment of Transportation to begin operating here. 
<BR></P>
<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">No Free Lunch:</FONT></B>  Be wary of &quot;card
mills&quot; offering bogus travel agent credentials for a fee.  While these
companies claim you'll get huge travel discounts just by presenting their card&#151;usually
purchased for about $500&#151;in fact the travel industry is losing patience
with the proliferation of bargain-seeking &quot;agents&quot; and is starting to
clamp down.  Delta and Hertz, among others, have begun limiting trade discounts
to valid holders of IATAN cards, which can only be obtained by booking
significant amounts of air travel through the computerized airline reservation
services. 
<BR></P>
<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">Hail Padania:</FONT></B>  Northern Italians,
frustrated with a perceived lack of representation in the Rome-dominated
national administration, have symbolically declared themselves an independent
country.  The new &quot;nation&quot; of <I>Padania</I>&#151;which is more or
less everything north of the Po River and is headquartered in Venice&#151;has no
plans to actually govern or seek recognition, but can be expected to tweak Roman
noses now and then with the occasional ceremony or press release. 
<BR></P>
<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">Is Fare Tax a Fair Tax?</FONT></B>  U.S. airlines
are battling over how airline tickets ought to be taxed.  Presently, a straight
10% levy is applied to the amount of fare paid; large airlines argue that this
lets low-fare operators get by with a smaller contribution to the air traffic
infrastructure, though their planes cost as much to control and land as any
other.  They'd like to see the tax calculated on miles traveled and number of
seats, without regard to the fare.  But discounters prefer the current system
and say the biggies are just trying to dodge competition by forcing the lowest
fares to  go up.  Congress will have to decide one way or the other; the current
tax &amp; the rules that govern it expire December 31. 
<BR></P>
<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">Fewer Yankee Elbows: </FONT></B> Although the
number of Americans traveling to Western Europe each year continues to rise, we
make up a smaller percentage of the tourists you'll bump elbows with over there
than we did a decade ago.  With increased international travel from Asia, the
continuing eager flood of Eastern Europeans, and improving economies for Western
Europeans themselves, you're apt to hear &quot;Excuse me, you're blocking my
picture&quot; in more languages than ever before. 
<BR></P>
<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">I'll See Your Two Crowns And Raise You Three
Stars...</FONT></B>  Britain is set to announce a new hotel rating system, which
the English Tourist Board hopes will replace the often inconsistent mix of
crowns and/or stars by which lodgings are labeled.  No details of the new
voluntary system have been offered, but it is expected to go into place before
next year's high season. 
<BR></P>
<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">I Demand To See The Consul &#151; Somewhere!</FONT></B>
 If you run into trouble in Zurich, Bordeaux, Poznan, Bilbao, or a host of other
cities around the world, don't be surprised to learn that the American Consul is
out of town&#151;permanently.  Cond&eacute; Nast Traveler reports that federal
budget cutting has left State Department posts as little more than an answering
machines where once small offices were fielded.  Cities that avoided the cut at
the last minute included Florence and Edinburgh. 
<BR></P>
<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">Marlboro Country:</FONT></B> Although smoking in
general is declining around Europe, it remains more prevalent in some countries
than others.  Greece tops the list with an average of 140 packs consumed per
year per family; Swedes puff the fewest with the consumption rate about 49
packs.  The most costly cigarettes are in Denmark ($4.85), which also has the
highest tobacco tax (83% of the retail price).  Smokers get by cheapest in Spain
($1.05 per pack) and Portugal ($1.85).  And the most popular brand Europe-wide? 
Same as it is here, Philip Morris' Marlboro.

<H2>Miss Elainey&#146;s Notes</H2>
<P><I><B>News and gossip on the European front</B></I><BR></P>
<P>&#183; Easier trips from <B>London Heathrow</B> into the city are at last
on the way.  A new fast rail link, due in June 1998,  will slash the journey
time from the current 45 minutes to just over a quarter-hour.  Paddington
Station, near Hyde Park, will be the destination.  In the meantime, expanded
operations by Airbus will provide some immediate improvement: the coach service,
about $9 each way, now stops at all four Heathrow terminals and has increased
the number of pickup/dropoff points in London from 28 to more than 80.<BR>  
</P>
<P>&#183; The <B>Netherlands</B>&#146; soft-drug tolerance policy may be on
the ropes.  Although the Dutch government still defends the approach, EU
neighbors are complaining that today&#146;s reduced border controls force other
countries to share in Amsterdam&#146;s quasi legal marijuana market, whether
they like it or not -- and most of them don&#146;t.  Some polls show that Dutch
public opinion is shifting on the issue, too.  
<BR></P>
<P>&#183; Hopes for renewed travel and tourism in the <B>Balkans</B> continue
to grow.  Air services to Belgrade were scheduled to resume in July, with
British Airways offering three flights a week to the Serbian capital.  And
Thomas Cook reports that trial runs of passenger trains to <B>Sarajevo</B> have
taken place, though regularly scheduled services aren&#146;t yet available.   
<BR>
</P>
<P>&#183; Designs for the new <B>Euro</B> currency have been selected.  The
winning paper design was created by a team of Barcelona designers, while the 1
Euro coin came from a freelance artist in Frankfurt.  The money, to be
introduced in 1999, is intended to be valid currency in all EU countries,
eliminating exchange rate complications.  Controversy still surrounds the
project, however, and it&#146;s not yet clear whether it will be implemented on
schedule by all members.   
<BR></P>
<P>&#183; A popular clamor has persuaded British Telecom to restore some 15,000
of the <B>classic red phone booths</B>, with their original 1930s design, to
locations across <B>England</B>.  In a compromise of past &amp; present, the
old booths feature new phones which can accept your credit or phone card.  
<BR></P>
<P>&#183; Global warming has ski operators in the <B>Alps</B> worrying about a
profit meltdown.  Experts think gradually rising temperatures may be responsible
for declining snowpacks and retreating glaciers.  Low-level resorts in
particular have had trouble making money in a short winter season, and some
climatologists predict shorter seasons to come.  Not everyone agrees; the
director of the Austrian Tourist Board in Tyrol calls the fears &#147;nonsense&#148;
and cites competition from other activities as a more urgent concern.  
<BR></P>
<P>&#183; In a gaffe that has travel agents chuckling (albeit grimly), <B>Delta</B>&#146;s
Sky magazine offered &#147;agent&#146;s take&#148; as a recent crossword puzzle
clue; the correct response was &#147;tenth.&#148;  It was Delta, you may recall,
who launched last year&#146;s across the-board cut in agents&#146; commissions,
which now fall well short of 10% on many tickets.  
<BR></P>
<P>&#183; <B>EuroDisney</B> is finally making money.  The theme park reported
a net profit of $29 million for the third fiscal quarter of this year. 
High-speed rail access from <B>Britain</B> via Eurostar is credited with some
of the improvement.  
<BR></P>
<P>&#183; <B>Spain</B> is moving ahead with a new fast rail service between
<B>Madrid</B> and <B>Barcelona</B>.  The $8 billion system, which could cut
travel time between the two cities from 6 hours to 3, may be constructed as
early as 2002.  Meanwhile, Italy is once again looking at plans to bridge the
Italian mainland to Sicily.  Sky-high costs, due in part to the engineering
demands of so large a bridge in an earthquake-prone region, have scuttled the
idea more than once in the past; but the Public Works Minister, citing a new
feasibility study, has put the project back on the table.

<H2>When in Rome</H2>
<P><BR><I>by Kevin Ford</I></P>
<P></P>
<P>Shortly after I moved to Rome, in fact the first available moment, I visited
some of the most spectacular constructions ever built.  I walked around the
Coliseum, Arch of Constantine, the Foro Romano, San Pietro, and Santa
Pudenziana.  So, yes, I did see all these monuments, but at the same time I
didn't see anything.   
</P>
<P>My purpose of moving to Rome is to study, and the weekend after I arrived I
started classes.  One of the first classes I attended was Medieval Art and
Architecture and the professor began the class with the Arch of Constantine. 
This is the point when I realized I knew nothing.  Just visiting the sites in
Roma without knowledge of the historical background and/or artistical
representations used during the period of construction is almost pointless.  The
Arch of Constantine is a marvelous piece of work as soon as its construction is
explained.  If you are just looking at the arch a person can easily ascertain
what it was for.  The Arch of Constantine is a triumphal arch erected in 313 AD
upon Constantine's victory into Rome, and its symbolic placement at the bottom
of via di San Gregorio, which led to the Senate.  This is what the untrained eye
will see.
</P>
<P>The trained eye&#151;not to claim that after a total of four classes mine is
trained&#151;will notice all the constructions on the arch and their
significance for that period.  The round reliefs and the rectangular plaques on
the arch were actually taken from earlier imperial monuments and mounted on the
arch, which is why the reliefs, plaques and friezes all look like different
styles, they are.  However, the friezes on each side of the Arch of Constantine
are products of sculptors during Constantine's reign.  When looked at closely
you will see that the reliefs and friezes on the arch are symbols of
Constantine's power.  Due to the illiteracy of the people during the period the
mosaics, frescos, and friezes could relay the pertinent information to the
uneducated lay people, a form of propaganda.  It is also generally recognized
that Constantine was a Christian, thus, he legalized Christianity and
subsequently churches were constructed. 
</P>
<P>One of the early churches which remains today is Santa Pudenziana, built
around 400 AD.  In most churches, which had a standard architectural
construction for the period, the apses were decorated with elaborate mosaics. 
As I stated earlier the mosaics were also used as a form of communication to the
lay people.  These mosaics usually represented a specific story or scene from
the Bible.  The mosaic in Santa Pudenziana mainly represents Christ handing his
teachings to Peter and Paul, but that is not the only scene being represented. 
The background, placement of Christ and the others, and eventually the rest of
the items in the mosaic can be read, to the lay people of the time, of Christ as
the ultimate ruler and teacher of all.  Unfortunately, to a person who comes off
the street in to Santa Pudenziana today without prior knowledge of the imagery
and symbols used during the period, all  this might go unnoticed and a very
important aspect of the church has been missed.  </P>
<P>This is a common problem in Roma.  But there is a solution.  When traveling
anywhere where you plan on seeing major historical sights, begin by joining a
professionally-led tour.  If you prefer to go by yourself, precede your visit by
reading about the sites that you will see; choose books that concentrate on the
period around the construction of the sites.  Most books will use examples of
major constructions in defense of the author's argument; at the same time the
books will cover standard imagery and symbols used by artists of the time,
giving you a good background to the style of the period and enhancing your
general interpretive abilities.  You will also notice a growing interest in the
material you are reading and an increasing desire to view the constructions in
person.  Although I've concentrated on references to Rome, I believe this can be
useful advice for anywhere.  But to reference Rome one more time: it is a city
that has survived through more than 2000 years of history and every time you
change position there is a high probability that the next construction or
monument you encounter will be built during an entirely different period,
therefore it is extremely beneficial to have some knowledge about the different
types and styles of art and architecture.  This will undoubtedly aid you while
walking through the cobblestoned streets of Roma and subsequently make your
visit that much more enjoyable.  &#164;</P>

<H1>The Channel Islands</H1>
<P><I>by Spencer Pryor</I></P>
<HR>
<P><B><I>&quot;Little pieces of France, fallen into the sea and swept up by
England&quot;</I></B></P>
<P><I>- Victor Hugo</I></P>
<P><BR></P>
<P>Famous French author Victor Hugo certainly knew what he was talking about
when he described the Channel Islands thus. At just eight miles from France at
their nearest point and over 100 miles from England this group of small islands
has a unique culture and spirit of independence not seen in many larger
countries.<BR></P>
<P>Most tourists make their first landing in the islands on the largest island,
Jersey, which at just over 45 square miles, contains the only large airport in
the group. The main problem with Jersey is that it's a little overpopulated with
84,000 people squeezed into those 45 square miles. However most people live in
the southern part of the island and there are plenty of good walks and scenery
along the coasts of the island.<BR> </P>
<P>As with most European seaside resorts, Jersey (and to a lesser extent the
other islands) is geared up to mass package tourism, albeit at the nicer family
end of the market. It's easily possible for the independent traveller to get
accommodation at fairly short notice, from humble but good B&amp;Bs to five star
luxury at the Hotel L'Horizon or The Longueville Manor Hotel. Jersey Tourism
runs a computerised 'bed bank' scheme from their offices in St. Helier, the
island's capital, which can fix you up with accommodation for a charge of about
$1.50. The only time that it's difficult to get accommodation in the island is
usually in August, when there's a large influx of French tourists, and the
island's premier carnival 'The Battle of Flowers' is in full swing.<BR></P>
<P>The island's capital St. Helier, which contains around half the island's
population is, it has to be said, not the prettiest town in Europe! However,
steps are being taken to rectify this, and the small area in the hub of the town
centered on the cobbled Royal Square is reminiscent of a French provincial town.
It was in this square that the last battle between France and England took place
on British soil in 1781 when the French tried capturing the island. After having
made their way to the capital they were defeated in a pitched battle right on
the steps of the island's Parliamentary chamber and Royal Court, which forms one
side of the square. These buildings date from 1309, although they have been
modernised a number of times since.  Today you can still see some genuine musket
bullet holes high in the wall of the Peirson public house on the corner of the
square. The 'pub' is named after the 24 year-old commander of the British forces
who was killed in the battle and his grave can be found in the neighbouring 
parish churchyard, where coincidentally the commander of the French forces Baron
de Rullecourte also lies. The square was also the scene of the proclamation of
Charles II as King of England after his father's execution. Also see if you can
spot the giant 'V for Victory' sign that was set in the cobble stones of the
square during World War II right under the noses of the occupying German forces.<BR></P>
<P>If you're interested in local culture and traditions, both the island's
Parliament and its Royal Court are 'unofficially' open to visitors. Just ask one
of the uniformed attendants if it's possible to go in and have a look around.
There are a number of fine paintings, including a Gainsborough, on show. If
either the court or the Parliament (The States) are in session it's perfectly
alright to go and sit in the public galleries for a while. However, dress
smartly and above all DON'T take any photos inside, they're particularly touchy
about this! On a Friday afternoon one of Europe's oldest land courts takes place
in the Royal Court, and it's well worth spending half an hour watching as
ordinary people swear oaths, in French, before the court, to exchange property.
It's fascinating how the practising advocates have got the system off to a fine
art, with people leaping up and down all over the place, raising and lowering
their right hands to swear the oaths and so forth. <BR></P>
<P>A couple of other places well worth visiting in St. Helier include the
island's museum, which was recently voted the best museum in Britain, and also
the Victorian covered flower market, where you can see, and buy, lots of the
famous Jersey horticultural produce. Just on the eastern outskirts of St. Helier
amongst the beautiful tress, flowers and lawns of the Howard Davies Park is a
tiny piece of American soil in the form of one of the few American Military
cemeteries in Europe. A number of US aviators and seamen were buried here during
the War and this cemetery is a memorial to them, and maintained by the island's
government in gratitude.<BR></P>
<P>Once outside the capital, there is much to see and do, however your choice
of transport is limited to four options: taxis are expensive; car hire is cheap
and gas is probably the cheapest in Europe, but remember in the Channel Islands
they drive on the left, or middle of the road, depending how wide it is, and
some of these roads are real narrow! There is a good bus service, and a Rover
ticket would cost you about $10 for a week's unlimited travel. Just watch out
you don't miss the last bus back from some of the outlying areas, or if you're
feeling reasonably fit, cycling is a good option. They're cheap to hire and
nowhere is more than 10 miles from St. Helier.<BR></P>
<P>Apart from the island's stunning coastal views the highspots around the
island include the two mediaeval fortresses of Elizabeth Castle and Mont Orgueil
Castle. Elizabeth Castle situated about a mile offshore, but accessible at low
tide was once the home of Sir Walter Raleigh, before he sailed off to the
Americas to discover Virginia, tobacco and the potato. Sir George Carteret who
was the founder of the State of New Jersey was also the Governor of the island
at one time. Mont Orgueil Castle is situated at the closest point to France, and
on a clear day you can see traffic moving along the French coast just 14 miles
away! This huge mediaeval castle overlooks the pretty fishing village of Gorey,
and is well worth a full day's visit. Many times during the islands' turbulent
history the fortress was the only deterrent against French invasion. Indeed in
the 1400s the French managed to storm the castle and hold the island for seven
years until the English recaptured the castle.<BR></P>
<P>In the Parish of Trinity lies one of Jersey's most famous attractions, the
world famous Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust. Although not strictly speaking
a 'zoo', the Trust founded by Gerald Durell is at the forefront of breeding wild
and endangered species, including the world famous gorillas and orang-utans.
There are thousands of animals here ranging from tiny reptiles up to the larger
mammals. Although entry is expensive by Jersey standards, about $7.50, most of
the money is going towards supporting the animals. A definite must for a day
out.<BR></P>
<P>Once out into the country parishes of the north and west of the island, you
can travel along small wooded lanes, exchanging glances with the pretty Jersey
cattle or admiring the pretty granite faced farmhouses and the occasional
'millionaire's mansion' hidden away amongst the trees. Remember that being an
offshore tax haven is now Jersey's biggest business, and the streets of St.
Helier are paved with big international banks and the trill of the mobile phone
of money men doing deals. <BR></P>
<P>One of the island's most spectacular sights is St. Ouen's Bay (pronounced
St.Wanz), a five mile long stretch of golden sands, with the adjoining foreshore
being the island's only national park and conservation area. An ideal place for
a stroll and to watch the surfers riding the Atlantic rollers.  One of the
things you will see around all  the Channel Islands, is the huge amount of
concrete fortifications dating from World War II, when the Germans invaded the
islands in 1940 and placed them under occupation until 1945, Hitler was
determined to hang onto the only piece of British soil he conquered, and poured
thousands of troops and slave workers into the islands to build an impregnable
fortress out of them. In the end the Allies simply bypassed the islands after
D-Day and starved the islands into submission. The story of the Occupation is
told in several museums throughout the islands and some of the fortifications
are open to the public. The best museum is probably the Underground Hospital in
Jersey, which is a huge complex and which has been restored in part to its
original working state. However when one returns to the sunlight after time
spent underground it's hard to shake off a feeling of sadness at the amount of
human misery that went into building these parts of Hitler's grandiose dreams.<BR></P>
<P>The best way to arrive in Guernsey is by sea, so take one of the frequent
fast ferries from St. Helier for the 28 mile journey to the second largest
island in the chain. St. Peter Port, is without doubt the prettiest town in the
Channel Islands, hugging the hillside of the  port with its quaint narrow
streets and walks, complete with whitewashed houses and cottages. As your ferry
arrives in the harbour, you pass the fortress of Castle Cornet, which is famous
for withstanding a nine year siege during the English Civil War when the Castle
was the last surviving outpost of the Royalist cause in the entire British
Isles. Guernsey, at 25 square miles is even more lilliputian than Jersey,
everything seems to be on a 'toy-town' like scale. On the heights overlooking
the harbour area stands Hauteville House, the home where Victor Hugo spent
fifteen years of his life in the late 1800s during his political exile from
France. Here he wrote many of his most famous works including <I>Les Miserables</I>
and <I>The Hunchback of Notre Dame</I>. Today the house is a museum, owned by
the City of Paris, and dedicated to Hugo.<BR></P>
<P>When you venture into the island's hinterland, you'll come across things
like the smallest chapel in the world at Les Vauxbelets, which was created
single-handed by a French priest during the early parts of this century.
Apparently it's an exact copy of the chapel at Lourdes, but on a much smaller
scale. Guernsey is excellent for walking and enjoying the pleasures of small
sandy coves with clean air, and stunning coastal scenic views.<BR> </P>
<P>The other islands of the group are idyllic if you require a bit of peace and
quiet away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life. Situated a few miles
east of St Peter Port the two tiny islands of Herm and Jethou stand like
sparkling jewels in the sea. A twenty minute ferry trip will take you to Herm,
where just a few people live. Not much to do on Herm except walk and laze and
admire the scenery. Walk to the Shell Beach, an amazing natural phenomena that
consists of millions upon millions of tiny sea shells. Apart from that Herm has
a small pub, a very highly rated hotel and restaurant, the White House Hotel,
and not much else. Take a picnic and enjoy a day out. Jethou is normally closed
to the public as it's a direct Crown tenancy. <BR></P>
<P>A further five miles east of these two islands is Sark, the last remaining
feudal state in Europe. This island with its 500 inhabitants has turned its back
on a lot of the modern ways of the world. Cars are banned, although there is the
odd tractor chugging along the narrow lanes. Most people use horses and carts to
transport goods and chattels around, and although visitors can hire bicycles the
best way to get around is by foot. Sark, unlike the other islands virtually
rises out of the sea and is basically a large two square mile plateau five
hundred feet above sea level. The one small harbour is the lifeline to the
island, no airport here! After walking up the steep hill from the harbour, there
is a refreshing 'pub' situated right at the top of the hill! One of the great
natural sights in the islands is La Coupee, a narrow isthmus about six feet wide
that joins Great Sark to Little Sark, and which is two hundred feet above sea
level with a near vertical drop on either side! Although safer now, with the
addition of side barriers, the locals will regale you with tales of how people
were literally blown off the track in high winds and were never seen again. If
you can afford to spend the time stay overnight in Sark, the place is totally
different after all the daytrippers have left to return to the larger islands.
There are a small number of hotels and B &amp; B's and you'll be made very
welcome.<BR></P>
<P>The 'Cinderella' of the islands is the most northerly, Alderney. Today this
wind swept island of 2,000 inhabitants is an anglers and bird watchers'
paradise. The island has a sort of melancholy charm, partly due to its exposed
position in the middle of the English Channel, just eight miles from France, and
partly due to its recent sad past. The whole island's population were evacuated
'en masse' during World War II escaping just before the Germans invaded.
Alderney was the site of the only Nazi concentration camp on British soil, where
many thousands of slave workers, mainly Russians and Poles, were worked to
death.<BR></P>
<P>The only town St. Anne has a sleepy provincial feel to it but the
inhabitants are a friendly lot, even though they were once described as
'eighteen hundred alcoholics clinging to a rock' - not true I hasten to add!
Alderney's current claim to fame is that it boasts the only working railway in
the islands and the two mile round trip using  restored London Underground stock
is quite something. The railway is open on weekends in Summer.<BR></P>
<P>Four main islands - four totally different lifestyles and outlooks. What
binds them together? Not even a common government! The Bailiwick of Jersey and
the Bailiwick of Guernsey each have separate legislative and administrative
offices. Both issue their own currency and postage stamps. As the oldest part of
the monarchy, many an islander will tell you they were on the winning side in
1066 when they conquered England at the Battle of Hastings, and England in
reality belongs to them. Many of the old facets of island life including the
local language, Norman French, are slowly dying out as the islands become more
cosmopolitan with the ingress of new monetary wealth and immigrants from all
over the world. However the islanders still have a stubborn desire to do what
they want, as they have from time immemorial, by fishing, exploring, trading and
privateering, in order to create a self-sustaining community with no reliance on
'outsiders'. Visit it now before the world changes it too much.  &#164;<BR></P>
<HR>
<H2><I>Travel Facts: The Channel Islands</I></H2>
<P><BR></P>
<P><B>Getting There:</B>  Numerous daily flights from European airports
including London, Dublin, Paris, Amsterdam and Zurich, mainly landing at Jersey,
although a few do land in Guernsey. Operators include British Airways, Air UK,
British Midland, Jersey European, Air France, and KLM.  Car ferries from
Weymouth in England. 3 -4 hours by high speed catamaran (around $70 return), or
eleven hours by 'mail boat'. Ferries from St Malo in France, and during the
summer from the nearby small French ports of Portbail, Carteret and Granville. 
Carry your passport -- you'll have to clear Customs and Immigration to get into
the islands, even if you're only travelling from the UK.<BR></P>
<P><B>Inter Island Travel:</B> Half hourly flights between
Jersey/Guernsey/Alderney by Aurigny Airlines. About $45 return. Fast ferries by
Condor three or four times a day to most of the larger islands. Jersey to
Guernsey takes about an hour. Jersey/Sark about 90 minutes. Both about $30
return.<BR></P>
<P><B>Hiring a car:</B> Don't forget your driving licence. Either a US or
International driving licence is required and you must be over 20 years of age
to hire a car. Car hire in the islands is generally amongst the cheapest in
Europe, and although the major rental companies such as Hertz, Budget and Avis
have offices the better deals come from local car rental companies. Try Falles
(Tel: 00 1 44 1534 43222 or fax 00 1 44 1534 46917) in Jersey and Guernsey for
friendly service and a good deal. Watch the speed limits:  maximum in Jersey is
40 mph, and Guernsey 35 mph, with some zones being just 20mph.<BR></P>
<P><B>Climate:</B> Slightly warmer and drier than the UK as the islands are
warmed by the Gulf Stream. One of the best times to visit is the Spring around
May, or early Fall when the gorse on the coastal headlands is a riot of color.<BR></P>
<P><B>Language:</B> English is now the universal language though you may hear
a smattering of the old local Norman French in country districts of Jersey and
Guernsey. 95% of all street names are in French though! Mont Gras D'eau, St.
Brelade sort of trips off the tongue!<BR></P>
<P><B>Money:</B> Both the States of Jersey and Guernsey issue their own
currency, the pound, although it is linked to the UK pound for value. As the
Channel Islands are one of the major financial centers of the world you usually
have no problem spending any currency whatsoever! Credit and charge cards widely
accepted. You will have problems using CI currency in the UK - only banks will
exchange it, although there is usually no charge for doing so.<BR></P>
<P><B>Shopping:</B> Although technically not a 'duty-free' area the local
taxes are exceptionally low and compared to France and the UK bargains can be
picked up. French perfume in particular is a bargain. Locally produced sweaters,
Guernseys and Jerseys, are also good value. The Channel Islands are not part of
the EU for customs purposes so watch out for restrictions on the amount of goods
you can return to the US with.<BR></P>
<P><B>Crime:</B> Virtually non-existant. One of the cleanest and safest places
in the world. Any crimes that are committed are usually by 'mainlanders' rather
than locals. It's safe to walk the streets at any time of the day or night.
Stringent anti-drugs legislation including jail sentences for bringing drugs
into the islands in ANY quantity. Police wear the familiar British 'bobby'
uniforms and are unarmed.<BR></P>
<P><B>Food:</B> Wow! Hundreds of restaurants giving all types of cuisine
ranging from fast food to gourmet. Jersey has a number of Food Festivals
throughout the year - a great chance to try a number of different cuisines.
Fish, including Lobster, Sole, and the local speciality Ormers is good, although
Ormers, in my opinion, are a bit chewy! Jersey Royal potatoes, Guernsey tomatoes
and other vegetables grow in abundance in the islands. In Jersey look for the
'Jersey Fresh' label on all local produce. There is one local vineyard in Jersey
producing a Muscadet type wine, but it's not the best and French wine is
exceptionally cheap. Try out the local beers including the ones produced by 'The
Tipsy Toad' brewery in Jersey's St. Peters. A decent three course meal with wine
and coffee afterwards will set you back about $15 - 20 a head.<BR></P>
<P><B>Packages:</B> A few hotels only deal with tour operators but most will
take direct bookings. Contact Jersey Tourism, Liberation Square, St. Helier,
Jersey, Channel Islands, (Tel: 00 1 44 1534  500800 or fax 00 1 44 1534 500899)
and/or Guernsey Tourism, White Rock, St. Peter Port, Guernsey, Channel Islands.
(Tel: 00 1 44 1481 723552 or fax 00 1 44 1481 714951) for full colour brochures
and hotel lists and brochures. They'll be glad to send them to you.  The States
of Jersey also run a Tourism Office in Paris and London and any office of the
British Tourist Authority will have details about the islands.<BR></P>
<P><B>Guidebooks:</B> There are a number on the market including an 'Insight'
Guide to the Channel Islands, and a Berlitz guide. A number of local publishers
produce informed guide books.<BR></P>

<H2>Rebuilding Giron Castle</H2>
<P><B><I>Brick-Laying Provence Style</I></B></P>
<P><I>by Jeanine Barone</I></P>
<P><BR></P>
<P><B>&quot;If you're staring at the rock for more than a few seconds,&quot;
said Ginour, &quot;it's the wrong rock.&quot;<BR></B>   I had just spent 20
minutes sorting through the rock pile, discarding each one as either too big,
too round, too small, too flat, too irregular.  With a weathered face, shaggy
beard and long curly gray hair topped by a shocking pink cap, Ginou stared over
my shoulder, meditating a moment, his brow wrinkling with intense concentration
as he surveyed the mound and seized a rock with just the right dimensions and
surface.  He continued, &quot;You'll find the right rock once you're in harmony
with it.&quot;  So began my first day restoring a medieval castle in southern
France and my introduction to Henri Gignoux (Ginou), the chief mason of the
project. </P>
<P>It became clear this wouldn't just be a two-week stint in laying stone and
mortar,  a skill hardly needed in New York City.  It was more a session in time
travel combined with Eastern philosophy. We shared spartan rooms with other
would-be masons,  but this was not like any college dorm room.  We didn't need a
clock. The donkey braying outside our window served as our alarm.  No bags of
chips for late night snacks.  Instead, we could reach outside our window and
pick fruit right from the vines crawling up the wall.  No hanging out at the
local bar. We'd sit on the  fortification walls and watch the moon cast a cold
light on the castle above the town of St. Victor.  Out late sipping cappuccino
in the town, we'd meander down dirt paths through a seeming maze of stone
buildings to find our simple room.  Climbing into our twin beds, we'd feel the
aura of the medieval period blanket us.  We couldn't help but to have visions of
armor-clad knights and fair maidens dance in our heads.  </P>
<P>Before my departure I bragged to my friends that I would be rebuilding a
castle. But LeSabrenenque, the organization that conducts restorations in the
area around St. Victor la Coste,  rebuilt everything from paths and bridges to
churches and entire villages.  Founded by Ginou and his wife Simone, Le
Sabrenenque, is headquartered at St. Victor, an 11th century village near
Avignon where we resided for two weeks.  The work is not done quickly. St.
Victor,  Le Sabranenque's first restoration project, took 15 years to complete
-- rebuilding the church and some 15 houses, and clearing rubble and vegetation
to reveal ancient paths, gardens and courtyards. </P>
<P>As one of 35 volunteers, my main project was at Gicon, a 13th century castle
high on a hill half an hour from St. Victor.  Before seeing the site, I had
expected Chateau de Gicon to be one massive structure reminiscent of King
Arthur's days, complete with a moat and drawbridge.  Gicon is actually a series
of buildings, almost like a village, that had fallen three times in its history
and was left in ruin for centuries.  There was no moat or drawbridge, but the
climb through the forest to get there certainly slowed down our progress.  This
plus the stone fortification and sheer cliffs probably dissuaded many uninvited
guests from visiting. </P>
<P>Six years ago, Ginou and his group of volunteer masons started restoring
Gicon, putting in stairs and windows, tiling floors, reconstructing archways and
reinforcing roofs.  The goal was not to bring Gicon back to its original form
but to make it safe for the local wine cooperative to host tasting events. 
These socials would clearly be spoiled if chardonnay-toasting guests were to
stumble off the precipice surrounding Gicon or be knocked out by a section of
crumbling ceiling.</P>
<P>As novice masons, we first tested our mettle with the bucket brigade. 
Twenty of us lined up and quickly passed thirty pound buckets of sand up two
flights of stairs from one individual to the next.  The sand was followed by
pails brimming with water. Worrying that a pail might slip at any moment, I
understood why the &quot;old timers&quot; came dressed in heavy hiking boots
while I naively wore beach sandals. After several mornings of weight training, I
progressed from a two-handed death grip to an almost casual one-handed swing. 
Thirty minutes of this daily was certainly a more social way of muscle building
than back home in the gym listening to the grunts of otherwise silent body
builders.  </P>
<P>More misconceptions were revealed as six of us were led to the cliff top
where we began constructing a stone wall.  In my visions, brick laying should be
a very terrestrial sport.  Therefore, I sunk into the background as volunteers
were sought to climb the scaffolding near the cliff edge or dangle over the
fortress wall only hooked into a safety harness.  I soon found that there were
always plenty of volunteers who didn't mind hanging  precariously in a safety
harness or crawling over a steep-pitched roof.  </P>
<P>The philosophy of laying stone was soon revealed.  Atop a thin layer of
fresh mortar, I lay each rock in no particular pattern, but satisfied with my
efforts. However, this registered as an &quot;F&quot; in Ginou's Masonry 101
class. With a long sweep of his hand, he quickly stopped me and cast my rocks
off the wall. &quot;Placing rocks in the mortar is like music,&quot; he said, &quot;very
fluid and rhythmic.&quot;  He demonstrated by mimicking a conductor and gently
but firmly placing rocks on their long flat surface, one next to the other.  For
the next layer, he laid rocks crosswise with a good layer of mortar between. 
</P>
<P>Try as I may,  I could neither get a feel for the right rocks nor visualize
how a finished wall would look and thought I probably should have stuck with
mixing cake batter rather than mortar. Either I was jinxed or this was a genetic
skill.   My colleagues seemed to have no problem in duplicating Ginou's Zen-like
masonry techniques, while over the next few days,  I accidentally dislodged
several critically placed rocks; made mortar that was as runny as soup; built a
wall only two layers high that somehow resembled a roller coaster; and felt too
silly to meditate over the rocks.  </P>
<P>Not comprehending Ginou's visualizing exercises and with failure weighing me
down, I decided to shadow my more skillful colleagues.  Carol had a knack for
simply stepping up to a stone pile and finding the right rock, and always mixing
mortar correctly.  I took notes from Genevieve who'd done this for five summers:
 on a section of the wall spread a thick layer of mortar  right to the edge;
select big rocks that don't teeter but instead lie flat; lay them on either side
of the wall; make sure they're flush on the outside and then in the middle with
smaller stones.  And with that, my masonry mastery began.  I found rocks that
were big, but not too big; mixed mortar that was thick, but not too thick; and,
like with a jigsaw puzzle, I fit each rock perfectly next to its neighbor. 
Layer after layer, the wall rose to four feet high.  Finally,  I got an
approving smile and a hug from Ginou.  I no longer felt like the outcast mason. 
We neared the top of our wall, using plumb lines to ensure that the rocks were
flush on the top and sides.  </P>
<P>In the end, we all stood back, hands on hips, trowels in hand after  topping
the wall with watery mortar and large, flat stones -- the final stage of a
completed wall.  Like a sculptor critically surveying the delicate curves of a
shoulder or neck in a bust he's labored over, Ginou stood silently over our
piece of work.  We'd been transformed into proud artists.  </P>
<P>Audrey, one of many non-first-timers,  made a mental log entry of another
successful renovation she'd help complete.  For her, this was like returning
home after a long absence, to see changes made while she was gone and relive
memories of past projects, like the stone floor and archway she worked on a few
years ago.  Our last day, we relished the warm breeze and the burning sun on our
arms, the smoothness of the mortar running between our fingers and the cool
firmness of the rocks we selected.  With all our activity centered on the
outdoors, I wondered aloud what we would have done if it were ever to rain. 
Reflecting on the sense of magic here, Audrey replied softly, &quot;It never
rains in Camelot.&quot;  &#164;</P>

<H2>Surviving Rome</H2>
<P><BR><I><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00" SIZE="+2">The Eternal City's Eternal
Crime Wave</FONT></B></I></P>
<P><BR>
<I>by Jerri Clark Kirby</I><BR></P>
<P><B>Few cities in the world hold as much history, art, beauty and excitement
as Rome.</B>   The food and wine are consistently tasty and enjoyable, (and
don't forget the ice cream!).   It's a city of many attractions and wonderful
characteristics.   Unfortunately, it is also a city of widespread petty crime;
the attractions draw tourists and the tourists draw theives.  Italy actually has
a very low rate of violent crimes against tourists, but pickings are good here
and the lightfingered seem at times to be everywhere.   
<BR></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><B>The Gypsies:</B></FONT> Although it's a myth that
all Romany (Gypsies) are thieves, like most myths it has its moments of
appearing true.  You've just left the tour bus, walking towards the Trevi
Fountain, mulling over its relative smallness compared to the image you formed
after having seen a rerun of &quot;Three Coins in the Fountain.&quot;  A cute,
ragged boy of about 10 or 12 pokes a piece of corrugated cardboard in your face,
obviously trying to get your attention to beg for a handout.   While your
attention is on his face and that irritating piece of cardboard he's waving
about, he's picking your pocket or purse with his other hand.   He's good at it
and he will probably be far gone before you realize you're missing anything.  
He may have another little boy, and perhaps even an older woman, working with
him.  While he's getting your attention, the others are stealing your
belongings.  They generally work in twos or threes and are gone before you know
you've been hit.   Besides a piece of cardboard, he may use a newspaper, an ad,
a booklet or a map, anything to get your attention for a few moments.  These
kids are very arrogant and open about their activities.  They are too young to
be prosecuted and if they are caught, are usually let go after being scolded by
the police.  The older women are not hard-core criminals, so are usually not
held either.  When  caught they are soon back out on the street, only mildly
inconvenienced. 
<BR></P>
<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">Pickpockets: </FONT></B> They work in crowded
tourist areas, usually in pairs or groups of three.   One will distract the
victim with conversation while an accomplice performs the robbery.  In one
ongoing routine, one will throw trash at a victim; the second will help the
victim in cleaning up the mess; a third will discretely take the victim's
belongings, disappearing before you realize your passport, money or watch are
gone!  Another variation is for the crook to point out something like catsup on
your trousers or the back of your jacket.   In fact, he's just put it there
himself.  While he offers tissues or his handkerchief to help wipe off the
catsup, another will offer to hold your bag, your camera, your packages.  While
you're wiping up, they've disappeared! 
<BR></P>
<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">Motor Scooter Bandits:</FONT></B> Elderly
tourists who have sought to resist petty thieves on motor scooters have suffered
broken arms and collarbones.  These scooter thieves are amazing, actually.  They
run their motor scooters up on the sidewalks, heading for groups of tourists and
snatching purses or bags from someone backing off to get out of their way. 
Sometimes they use a razor or sharp knife to cut a strap -- they are quick and
accurate.  They've gone before you fully realize that you have been robbed. 
They may also approach from behind, moving so swiftly that you hardly have a
chance to react. 
<BR></P>
<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">Public Transportation:</FONT></B> One very
friendly person engages you in conversation while you're on a bus, perhaps
asking directions or just pointing out interesting sights along the way.  
Another slits your purse or bag with a razor or sharp knife and removes the
contents through the side or the bottom.   By the time you realize how light
your property has become, they've left the bus and blended into the crowds. 
<BR></P>
<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">Rental Cars:</FONT></B> Small items such as
cameras, radios, luggage, briefcases and even cigarettes and food will be stolen
from your parked car&#151;a smashed window is quick! Thieves currently seem to
be targeting vehicles pulled into service stations.   It's really best to store
anything you must leave in the car in the trunk; do this a few blocks before you
actually park the car.  If a thief sees you putting something in the trunk, he'd
as soon break open your trunk as smash your window! 
<BR></P>
<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">What to Do:</FONT></B>  If despite your caution
you are victimized, report it to the police. There are tourist police in heavily
visited locations; elsewhere, you'll probably end up at the local police station
but this is a great opportunity to get an inside look at the workings of the
polizia.  Be prepared for a few hours delay in your schedule.  Many Italian
policemen speak passable English but it sometimes takes time to find one.   File
a report and ask for a copy, which may be required if your insurance company
becomes involved.  (It also makes a good souvenir.)   The inside of a Rome
police station, whether local or tourist, is a fascinating place to people-watch
while you're waiting -- and you will wait!  If your passport is stolen, be
prepared.   Have a copy of your passport (kept separately from the original),
and a couple of passport photos.  These will speed up acquisition of a
replacement passport considerably.   Report the loss of your passport to the
American Embassy at Via Veneto 119/A, phone: (39-6) 46741.   They will see to
the replacement .   Also stop by and report any other losses through theft.  
Reports of this nature are incorporated into regular consular releases and
future tourists will be forewarned.  <BR></P>
<P>Having a photocopy of your return air tickets can be helpful in getting them
replaced quickly.  If you're traveling on a railpass keep a copy of that too,
and consider buying loss insurance for it (available from most railpass
agencies.) 
<BR></P>
<P>A few precautions can keep from getting in trouble in the first place.  Try
to leave all valuables in your hotel safe, if one is available.  Take only money
needed for the day, and carry the name and address of your hotel so you'll know
where to tell a taxi driver to go.   It's best to have travelers' checks with
just a little cash money.   If you must take money, credit cards and passport
with you on tours, a money belt worn under your clothing, with openings next to
your skin, is your best bet.  Don't wear expensive jewelry, and leave your
pockets empty.  If you do take a purse, have one with a strap and grip it firmly
with the latch side towards your body.  Be aware of the people around you at all
times.   If you are alert, chances are the would-be pickpockets or thieves will
move on to an obviously less wary mark.  If you are approached in a suspicious
manner by anyone, talk loudly and turn sideways away from them.  Shout at them,
if necessary.  (Shouting at gypsy kids seems to be a fairly reliable way to get
rid of them.)   <BR></P>
<P>If you notice someone following you, first of all give him a strong,
penetrating look.   If a policeman is nearby, go up to him and point at the
follower -- who will become invisible quickly!  Recent arrivals from eastern
European countries seem to be adding to the problems.  Pickpockets and other
petty crimes thrive at crowded tourist sites such as Trevi Fountain and the
Vatican, and in bus and train stations; the train station at Fumico, (Da Vinci
Airport), seems to be a particular gathering place.  The police chase them away
and even have fierce-looking dogs but they reappear quickly.  Always be wary
when you're at any place, like a ticket window, where money exchanges hands.  
<BR></P>
<P>Count your money before you approach to buy something and after the
transaction is finished.  Another thing -- be careful with your phone card. 
It's better to have the numbers you need to make a call memorized or written
down on a piece of paper, only using the actual calling card where you must
insert it into the telephone.   If you need to make a long distance call from a
public place, be sure no one is spying on you; phone thieves can get your number
from right over your shoulder or with binoculars a few feet away.   Thousands of
dollars can be charged to your number before you even receive your bill. 
<BR></P>
<P>Rome is a city everyone should visit at least once.  And while they no
longer encourage throwing coins into Trevi Fountain&#151;it gobs up the plumbing&#151;you're
still free to toss a wish.  With a little caution, your wish will be that you
too may someday return.  &#164;    <BR></P>

<P><I><B><FONT SIZE="+2" COLOR="#FFFF00">ATMs: The Occasional Roman Rip-Off 
</FONT></B></I></P>
<P><B>Automatic Teller Machines</B> have justifiably become very popular with
European travelers; they provide cash on the spot, in the desired currency,
without the hassle of cashing traveler's checks and generally at a good exchange
rate.  However, there are occasional reports&#151;particularly from Rome&#151;of
ATMs going through all the motions of a cash withdrawal, with the quaint
variation of not actually dispensing any money!  If you find yourself standing
on the sidewalk with receipt in hand but no lira, report it <I>immediately</I>.
 Depending on the amount involved, it may even be worth a long-distance
Stateside call to your issuing bank.  The problem is, when this sort of glitch
happens the ATM is convinced it gave you money, and it has the transaction
record to &quot;prove&quot; it.  If you wait until you get home to report the
incident, it's your word against the entire Italian banking system&#151;and
you'll lose.  &#164;

<P><B>Trav<I>elocity:</I></B><A HREF="http://www.travelocity.com/">www.travelocity.com</A></P>
<P>This enormous Internet travel site is now open for business.  There's more
stuff than you can shake a modem at -- reportedly 200,000 pages all told --
though it suffers somewhat from the &quot;mile wide and inch deep&quot;
syndrome; you can find information about almost everything, but not very <I>much</I>
information about anything.  And they need to fix an annoying quirk that makes
you re-select your destination -- starting at the continent level and working
your way down -- each time you change information category.  The best parts are
found in the descriptions of sights and attractions and general travel advice,
which come from travel info pioneers Worldview.  Not much for hotels as yet,
with lots of listings but only name, address, and phone offered.  They're taking
online reservations for some things (including air travel) and hold 'live' chat
sessions with travel personalities.<BR></P>
<P><B>Rail Pass Express: </B> <A HREF="http://www.eurail.com/">www.eurail.com</A>
has added a chat room, the <B>Caf&eacute; Elsys&eacute;es</B>, to their Web
site at .  The online Caf&eacute; was was featured in 1996 at the Internet World
conference in San Fransisco.  Come on in, pour an espresso, and talk travel. 
Rail Pass Express is also in the process of adding a <B>Britain by Britrail</B>
site to go with their excellent <B>Europe by Eurail</B> pages.<BR></P>
<P><B>Forsyth Travel Library:</B> <A HREF="http://www.forsyth.com./">www.forsyth.com.</A></P>
<P>Located in Shawnee Mission, Kansas, Forsyth Travel Library is the US
distributor of the <I>Thomas Cook European Timetable</I> and holds a long-time
reputation as one of the country's leading experts in European rail travel. 
They are also authorized agents for Rail Europe and can provide you with
virtually any type of railpass you require, along with point-to-point tickets,
sleeper reservations, International Youth Hostel memberships, and a good
selection of maps and guidebooks.<BR></P>

<P>European apartment living for as long as you like.  Great for families! 
They list a number of properties with locations close to business, cultural, and
recreational centers.  Apartment stays can offer a considerable savings over
hotels, if only because you can prepare most of your own meals and avoid
high-priced restaurants.<BR> </P>
<P><B>World Cellular Service:</B> <A HREF="http://www.interport.net/cellular"><B>www.interport.net/cellular</B></A>
</P>

<P><B>Rail Europe:</B> <A HREF="http://www.raileurope.com/"><B></B>www.raileurope.com/</A>.</P>

<P>Great page to check out if you're heading to Jolly Old London.  Addresses,
phone numbers, hours of operation, etc. for a wide range of London museums,
including some off-the-wall places you may not know about.<BR></P>
<P><B>UK Theatre Web:</B> <A HREF="http://www.uktw.co.uk/">www.uktw.co.uk/</A></P>
<P> Offers up-to-date info on what's playing the West End &amp; other theatres
in London.<BR></P>
<P><B>Hotels in the UK:</B> <A HREF="http://www.demon.co.uk/hotel-uk">http://www.demon.co.uk/hotel-uk</A></P>
<P>An online information and reservations service for hotels in London and the
rest of the United Kingdom.  For some properties they sometimes offer special
rates available only on the Web.<BR></P>
<P><B>Holland Tourist Information:</B>
<A HREF="http://www.nbt.nl/holland/home.htm">www.nbt.nl/holland/home.htm</A></P>
<P>You can search for a variety of Netherlands travel topics here.<BR></P>
<P><B>Loews Hotels:</B> <A HREF="http://www.loewshotels.com/">www.loewshotels.com</A></P>
<P>They show only one European listing, but it's a gorgeous Monte Carlo
property overlooking the Meditteranean (rooms from about $280).  If it suits you
they'll soon be able to take your reservation over the Net.<BR></P>
<P><B>European Tourist Information Center:</B>
<A HREF="http://www.iol.ie/~discover/europe.htm">www.iol.ie/~discover/europe.htm</A></P>
<P>Another broad-based offering with selected cultural &amp; tourist
attractions profiled.<BR></P>
<P><B>Relais &amp; Chateaux:</B>
<A HREF="http://www.u-net.com/hotelnet/relais/home.htm">www.u-net.com/hotelnet/relais/home.htm
</A> (UK); <A HREF="http://www.calvacom/relais/accueil.html">www.calvacom.fr/relais/accueil.html
</A> (Mostly France)</P>
<P>The very upscale hotel-and-restaurant group has its own Web page now with
information on properties around the United Kingdom and Europe.  They will take
reservation requests for hotels via e-mail.  (In a side note, they have also
begun taking advance reservations through travel agents for the top-rated, often
hard-to-book restaurants.  But show up -- there's a $60 no-show fee if you
don't.)<BR></P>
<P><B>Trencherman's Guide:</B>
<A HREF="http://www.dcs.ex.ac.uk/wcol/food_and_acc/trench.html">www.dcs.ex.ac.uk/wcol/food_and_acc/trench.html</A></P>
<P>A detailed listing of restaurants in England's West Country can be found
here.  They have details of each individual eatery (including pictures of the
proprietors on some).  This is part of the extensive collection of West Country
pages, many of which are very informative.  They do have a tendency to use
overlarge graphics so it's a bit slow going, but often worth the wait.<BR></P>
<P><B>Walking in Britain:</B>
<A HREF="http://www.gorp.com/gorp/activity/europe/britain.htm">www.gorp.com/gorp/activity/europe/britain.htm</A></P>
<P>&quot;There is an extensive network of local paths throughout the country,
with rights of way extending for some 140,000 miles...&quot;  Thus begins this
page on hoofing it through Britain, and the page extends quite a ways itself as
it imparts a stack of detailed knowledge on the subject.  National Trails are
covered along with less formal routes, and there are plenty of  specifics on
rules of the road and what to watch out for.  A &quot;must read&quot; if you're
planning an English hiking jaunt.  Also a  pleasantly non-commercial site,
though they do advise on the best places to buy maps &amp; gear.<BR></P>
<P><B>Book-Browsing for the Adventure Traveler:</B>
<A HREF="http://www.gorp.com/waisdata/atbook/atsrch.htm">www.gorp.com/waisdata/atbook/atsrch.htm</A></P>
<P>You wouldn't believe how many books there are about traveling until you
spend some time here.  A relative of the Walking Britain page cited above, this
site lets you search by keywords for books on various flavors of adventurous
travel worldwide.  Punching in &quot;Europe&quot; brought up a bevy of unusual
titles, including Rock Climbing Guide to Europe, Slovenia Travel Survival Kit,
and Walking in the Black Forest.  Clicking on individual titles gets you a
synopsis, reviews, price, and online ordering information.<BR></P>
<P><B>Internet Emporium:</B>
<A HREF="http://www.emporium.co.uk/hotguide/index.html">www.emporium.co.uk/hotguide/index.html</A></P>
<P>This site includes a hefty number of English hotels sorted by city or
county.  Information is limited except for a few &quot;featured&quot; hotels,
but there are a lot of names &amp; UK phone numbers if you're building a list of
possible stopping points.  Pages for the featured hotels are quite detailed,
down to rates and driving maps.<BR></P>
<P><B>Affordable London:</B> <A HREF="http://www.bynet.co.uk/afldn/index.htm">www.bynet.co.uk/afldn/index.htm</A></P>
<P>They offer apartment rentals by the week from $506, and apparently take
e-mail reservations.<BR></P>
<P><B>Sisley Garden Tours:</B> <A HREF="http://www.u-net.com/tka/sisley/">www.u-net.com/tka/sisley/</A></P>
<P>This user-friendly tour operator offers garden tours in the UK and France. 
Detailed itineraries, booking information, and even a gardening crossword puzzle
are online at this site.  Unfortunately, we've just been e-mailed that the '96
tours are all filled.  But check it out anyway and think '97.<BR></P>
<P><B>Russian National Tourist Office:</B>
<A HREF="http://www.interknowledge.com/russia">www.interknowledge.com/russia</A></P>
<P>The official site of the Russian National Tourist Office, and very
impressively done.  For Moscow there's a Calendar of Events, Accommodations
Guide, museum hours, and quite a lot more.  St. Petersburg is also covered in
detail.  A must-stop site if you're going to Russia, though hotel information is
limited to names &amp; addresses.  Lots of good pictures which load quickly. 
Linguists only: If you want to test your Cyrillic reading skills, try
www.eurorussia.com.  (You'll need to download special fonts which they have on
hand.)  We have no clue what the site's about, but it certainly looks exotic.<BR></P>
<HR><IMG SRC="http://www.eurodata.com/1st.gif" ALIGN="MIDDLE">
<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Stillwell's Bed &amp; Breakfast Guide:</B>
<A HREF="http://www.stilwell.co.uk/welcome.html">www.stilwell.co.uk/welcome.html</A></FONT></P>
<P><BR><B>An extensive guide to &quot;good value overnight accommodation&quot;
in Britain and Ireland, with B&amp;B rooms averaging &#163;16 per night.  They
don't take reservations (or commissions) but provide you with all the contact
information you need to make your own arrangements.  Very detailed and very
comprehensive; if you've ever wondered where you'd stay in Woolacombe, Devon,
they've got three or four choices for you -- and a pub list to boot. 
Exceptionally well-done site with point-and-click maps, fast graphics, and neat
search tools.  You can even  find inns by such categories as &quot;Converted
Barns&quot;, &quot;Older Houses in Ireland&quot;, and &quot;Thatched Buildings&quot;.</B></P>
<HR>
<P><B>Camelot International:</B> <A HREF="http://www.itl.net/go/to/camelot/">www.itl.net/go/to/camelot</A></P>
<P>For some quick fun you can do a trace on family roots in Scotland here --
just type in your surname and click.  The info comes back suspiciously fast,
however, and in pretty short order they want to sell you a mug with &quot;your&quot;
family crest on it.  If you want to look for yourself, they also offer apartment
and hotel reservations for your full-fledged genealogy trip.<BR></P>
<P><B>Genealogy in Ireland and the UK:</B>
<A HREF="http://midas.ac.uk/genuki">midas.ac.uk/genuki</A></P>
<P>For a more serious take on ancestor-hunting, start out here.  They provide a
full course on how to get started, where to look, and what to look for.  Then,
for Ireland and the United Kingdom, they'll take you into as much detail as you
can handle, on regions, archives, family names, and more.  As far as we can
tell, they won't try to sell you anything at all -- it's run by genealogical
society members who just want to help.<BR></P>
<P><B>Guernsey (Channel Islands):</B>
<A HREF="http://user.itl.net/~bebridel/">user.itl.net/~bebridel/</A></P>
<P>Take a tour of one of the larger Channel Islands on this privately
maintained home page.  Lots of visitor info and a link to very detailed lodging
options for the Islands on Hotel Net (www.u-net.com/hotelnet/channel.htm).<BR></P>
<P><B>Bornholm, Denmark:</B>
<A HREF="http://www.bornholminfo.dk/web/uk/index.htm">www.bornholminfo.dk/web/uk/index.htm</A></P>
<P>A home page for the &quot;ideal holiday island&quot; off the coast of
Denmark.  It's a favorite with bike riders due to 200+ km of cycling routes
networking the scenic island.  The site offers details on places to stay, too.<BR></P>
<P><B>Women Business Travelers:</B>
<A HREF="http://www.delta-air.com/womenexecs">www.delta-air.com/womenexecs</A></P>
<P>Delta Airlines and American Express co-sponsor this collection of
information and advice for female business travelers, whose needs &amp;
interests are too often neglected despite their estimated 40% share of business
travel.<BR></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Paris: </B><A HREF="http://www.paris.org/">www.paris.org</A></FONT></P>

Kiosque&quot; is an online magazine with top-quality articles and an immensely
detailed, up-to-date &quot;What's On in Paris&quot; calendar.  There are city
maps, tons of pictures, and you can even download a Metro map (if you have the
patience - it's big).</B><BR></P>
<HR>
<P><B>Travel to Turkey:</B> <A HREF="http://www.turknet.com/">www.turknet.com</A></P>
<P>Grand Circle Travel, a tour operator specializing in Turkey, is present
here, along with an online magazine (Turkish Style) and a guide to Turkish
hotels.  A good stop if you're heading to Istanbul.<BR></P>
<P><B>Dr. Memory's Travel Pages:</B>
<A HREF="http://www.access.digex.net/drmemory/cyber_travel.html">www.access.digex.net/drmemory/cyber_travel.html</A></P>
<P>Profiled in a recent <I>Travel Weekly</I> article, this &quot;eclectic&quot;
home page can link you to more than 2,000 travel sites around the Net, from
run-of-the-mill to off-the-wall.  It's a non-commercial site run part-time by a
guy who wanted to learn Web programming and picked travel as his favorite
subject.  Worth a visit to see what he's come up with.<BR></P>
<P><B>Hotels in Israel: </B><A
HREF="http://www.netmedia.co.il/info/hotelassoc/">www.netmedia.co.il/info/hotelassoc/</A></P>

<P><B>Overseas Connection:</B> <A HREF="http://www.overseasvillas.com/">www.overseasvillas.com</A></P>
<P>If you're looking for the plushest in digs -- or just want to drool over
some -- this outfit can rent you a villa, castle, or penthouse in a variety of
locales. Our favorite was a Paris apartment with personal chauffeur and a
balcony view of the Eiffel tower.  Their &quot;Property of the Month&quot; is a
14th-century manor in the English countryside; they don't give a rate, but it
comes with eight bedrooms, a library, tennis courts, gymnasium, and a full-time
chef &amp; maid.  Don't bother getting out the Novotel vouchers...<BR></P>
<P><B>Internet Bike Resources for Europe: </B><A
HREF="http://www.abeline.it/fbp-eur.htm">www.abeline.it/fbp-eur.htm</A></P>
<P>This site presents a jumping-off point for a variety of Web resources on

<P>A set of web pages devoted to nothing but castles -- tours, histories,
legends, and more.  If your heart quickens at ancient grey stones towering in
the mist, be sure to stop by.  The webmaster is a true castle lover and it
shows.  There's even a &quot;Castles for Kids&quot; page for the little knights
and maidens in your court.</P>

<H1>Rome's Siren Call</H1>
<P><I>by Carina Dingemans</I></P>
<HR>
<P>Long after the screeching sound of mopeds and enervating rush of traffic
have left your ears, Rome will remain forever etched in your memory. Whether
it's the vast pink sprawl of the Roman baths, the impressive physical and
spiritual power of St. Peter's, or just the bright yellow blossoms of mimosa
that deck the city in spring and early summer, the city will bid you return
again. Cultivated, capricious and at times awesomely beautiful, Rome is not a
city to be forgotten. 
</P>
<P>Built upon layer after layer of culture, Rome has always managed to preserve
the great works of its past without being immolated by them. A monument to
Rome's modern heritage is the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Moderna, which houses an
increasingly vigorious collection of international modern art. Established in
the late 1800s, the museum should not be missed:  not only for the quality of
its collection, but for the reminder it gives that our century can hold its own
amid the marvels of earlier times.  
</P>
<P>The museum, situated at the north end of the Borghese Gardens, affords the
visitor the opportunity of strolling back to the city centre through the gardens
and along the Pincio. From here you can gaze out over one of the finest
panoramas of the city, and on an early evening in summer observe one of Italy's
favorite pastimes -- the passagiata. Here you will see Romans old and young
taking a leisurely sunset stroll, looking at the view and (most important) at
one another. 
</P>
<P>The latter day popes, once some of the greatest patrons of the arts, now
preside over the vast task of preserving and restoring the wealth of fine art,
sculpture, tapestries and other incalculable treasures stored up by their
predecessors. The fruits of their endeavours are on display in no less than 10
Vatican Museums (open Monday-Saturday 9am to 2pm October-June; longer hours in
summer.). A monument and record of the Christian experience, the Vatican art
collection is also a testament to the will of the human spirit. Pope John Paul
II described the collection thus: &quot;They will speak of history, of the human
condition in its universal challenge and of endeavours of the human spirit to
attain the beauty to which it is attracted.&quot; 
</P>
<P>We have the popes' love of beauty to thank for the roll call of painters,
sculptors and architects who created some of the seminal works of art history
under their patronage. The buildings and gardens of the Vatican are home to
works by Fra Angelico, Donatello, Botticelli, Raphael, Bernini and Poussin; and,
of course, Michelangelo's murals in the Sistine Chapel, recently restored and
given a new brush of colour. If you have the time and energy for nothing else
while you are in Rome, slip into the abbreviated tour of the Vatican that
encompasses the Chapel. You may have seen the individual murals a thousand times
before, but only by being there can you appreciate the sheer breadth and
physicality of the original. 
</P>
<P>Rome is a city of churches; they proliferate in every square, however
modest, and seemingly on every street corner. They are visited as much for their
secret treasures as for prayer and meditation. During a hot, or wet, day's
sightseeing they make a tranquil refuge from the world outside as well as being
a rich source of artistic discovery. The 16th century Church of Santa Maria
degli Angeli is entered through an inconspicuous door set in the ruin of what
was part of the 3rd century Baths of Diocletian. Inside, the church has been
sculpted by Michelangelo from the old tepidarium (the warm room between the
steam room and the cold plunge) into an elaborate marbled interior. The outlying
ruins of these Diocletian baths also house the Grand Hotel, an aptly-named haunt
of politicians and celebrities (doubles from around $280).   
</P>
<P>Looking at the turbulent state of today's Italian politics -- headquarted in
the late Baroque buildings of the Palazzo del Quirinale -- you might think that
the spirit of the ancient Romans, with their enjoyment of power, lives on in
their modern day counterparts.	&#164;

<H1>How to Avoid Making a Brutta Figura</H1>
<P><I>by Julie Robinson</I></P>
<P></P>
<P><B><I>Figuring out what's not done in Italy</I></B></P>
<P></P>
<P>In Italy, beautiful country that it is, making a <I><B>brutta figura</B></I>
ranks as deserving more hell fire than the seven deadly sins combined.  For the
country which houses Vatican city and where most of the population would call
themselves good Catholics, that's saying something.  The Italians spend their
lives, between capuccinos and voting for yet another doomed government,
wondering if they're guilty of making this brutta figura. So what exactly do
they intend by the term? Brutta figura literally means an &quot;ugly figure.&quot;
In other words, making one of these is the social gaffe, the faux-pas (no, this
isn't a guide to Paris. We're still talking about Italy). It's the putting your
foot in it, not quite doing things the way a particular society expects you to
do them. 
</P>
<P>The first thing to remember is that lots of things we might consider gaffes
do not fall into this category in the Italian social etiquette. You are not, for
example, cocking up if you arrive at a phone cabin, see a long queue (no,
queue's not quite the right word -- let's stick with a &quot;large disorganised
heap of otherwise elegant individuals&quot;) and leap into the cabin as soon as
the previous occupant comes out.  No, this constitutes a bella figura; you're on
the way to being cool and beautiful.    Nor is it making a brutta figura to
leave your mobile on in an important meeting, and interrupting the Chairman's
speech to take a call from your wife who wants to know   whether you want
spaghetti or tagliatelle for dinner. That's a case of showing you're not going
to be intimidated - you score a good 9 out of 10 for that ploy. 
</P>
<P>So, come on, spill the pepperoni already. What behaviour <I>would</I> send
me hurtling towards Dante's inferno? Well, if you hire a car, watch out.
Traffiquette is a dangerous area where the possibilities of making a speedy
figura are rife. Stopping at a traffic light which is red, but where no traffic
is coming from either side, merits minus 10 on the road from hell to purgatory.
The logic is clear:  you're holding up the guy in his brand
new-from-the-concessionaria Alfa Romeo speedster from getting it home to show it
to mamma.  What worse figura could you make?  On a more serious note, post
offices, police stations (should your traffic infractions come to that), and
other public offices are a well-known breeding ground for foreigners infringing
the norms of accepted behaviour. DON'T dare to question the advice of  the guys
behind the desk. It's part of their job description to send you to another
line/office/building/city. The sooner you learn this and accept it with good
grace, as do the nationals, the better for your mental health and general image.
  The same goes for ticket offices. These are part of the divine mystery and any
attempt to genuinely understand the 133 different train and ticket types, not to
mention the supplements, kilometer calculations and special offers, will be met
with pitiful glares if not outright hostility.  Asking for clarification is on a
par with asking the Pope to prove the Trinity to you. Have faith. Nobody's out
to fleece you. There's an unspoken code of honour (mainland Italy has, after
all, acquired something of value from its Sicilian cousins). 
</P>
<P>Have you figured it out yet? The key is to leave your rationality at home.
Ours is not to reason why, as the saying goes. And it goes without saying that
you won't remember a word of this as you're sitting basking in the beautiful
Venice sunshine savouring your cappuccino. Just don't do it in the afternoon!
Deadly sin number eight and a classic in the brutta figura league.  &#164;

<H1><FONT COLOR="#004080">Walking the South Coast of Devon </FONT></H1>
<P><EM><FONT COLOR="#FF0080">By Paul Wreyford</FONT></EM></P>
<HR>
<P>It is fitting our journey along the South Devon coast should begin at
Plymouth, as it is from these shores many great journeys have begun. Seafarers
such as Drake, Raleigh, Hawkins, Frobisher, Cook, and of course the Pilgrim
Fathers, all left from here to begin their epic voyages throughout the world.
<BR></P>
<P>The South Devon Coast Path begins across the River Plym at Turnchapel.  A
frequent bus service covers the five-miledistance from the centre of Plymouth.
Before heading along the path, you may like to make a little detour to
Mountbatten Point to see the area where T.E. Lawrence, better known as Lawrence
of Arabia, spent the latter years of his life. Lawrence was stationed here in
the Flying Boat Squadron under the name of Shaw.  Slightly inland is Fort
Stamford, just one of a number of fortifications in the area. It was built by
Lord Palmerston in 1847 on the site of an ancient burial ground. It is now a
popular leisure centre. <BR></P>
<P>The path climbs over Jennycliff Bay and Staddon Heights towards the quay at
Bovisand about a mile from Turnchapel. The harbour was originally built as an
alternative to Plymouth Docks. From here you can take in the splendid view of
Plymouth Sound for the final time. This is as close as you will get to the
unusual Plymouth Breakwater which is an island sitting in the middle of Plymouth
Sound. Above the quay is Fort Bovisand - one of the best preserved of the
Palmerston forts.   The popular sandy beach at Bovisand Bay, which is backed by
a number of caravans and chalets, is hidden around the corner and springs up on
you quite unexpectedly. It is the first holiday centre on the South Devon Coast
Path - but certainly not the last! <BR></P>
<P>The walker has to pass straight through the caravan park to reach Wembury
Point which is about a mile away. The view changes here and we now look south
onto the vast English Channel. The imposing rock island directly ahead is the
Great Mew Stone. The large population of gulls explains how it got its name as
the word mew means gull. The seabirds once shared the island with a family who
were banished to it by magistrates for seven years in 1744. It was also
inhabited at the end of the 19th century by a man who bred rabbits for his
landlord.<BR></P>
<P>The point is also home to HMS Cambridge gunnery school. When the red danger
flags are flying the footpath is closed due to firing and the walker is diverted
inland.  Sitting about half-a-mile from the gunnery school is the village of
Wembury. Most of the village is situated inland, though its most prominent
building is a church which sits above Blackstone Rocks. St Werburgh's Church is
named after a 7th-century saint and includes a 14th-century tower and Norman
remnants. Wembury also has an interesting old mill, and was home to the
descendents of Devon author John Galsworthy. The beach, with its excellent rock
pools, is its most popular attraction.  About a mile-and-a-half along, the coast
is broken by the Yealm Estuary. A ferry can be caught from Warren Point and will
save the walker a ten-mile detour around the River Yealm. Unfortunately, it only
operates on demand and so out-of-season walkers may have to catch a bus or be
prepared for a long walk via the busy A379 road. <BR></P>
<P>However you get across, two places which the visitor should not miss are
Newton Ferrers and Noss Mayo, which sit opposite each other on the Newton creek
of the estuary. The two villages are actually joined by a concrete path which
can be used during low tide. Both are picture-postcard villages and popular
during the summer. Old fishermen's cottages line the creek, while newer
buildings sit on steep hillsides.  The narrow streets of Newton are well worth
exploring and offer fine views of the river. The 14th-century parish church
contains a nave which slants off to the right. It is believed to have been built
this way because the head of Jesus, according to legend, fell to the right on
the cross. The church across the river at Noss is a little newer, built during
Victorian times. It was designed by Piers St Aubyn, whose ancestors once owned
St Michael's Mount in Cornwall.  &#164;<BR></P>

<HR>
<P><STRONG><EM><FONT COLOR="#FF0080">A City of Empire Retains Her Glory</FONT></EM></STRONG><BR></P>
<P>Once the seat of a sprawling empire of fifty million, now capital of a
nation of less than eight million, Vienna has maintained a facade worthy of its
former glory.  Opulent neo-Gothic and neo-Baroque buildings line the boulevard
ringing downtown, while the imposing spire of Gothic St. Stephen's  Cathedral
towers over the central city.  Three stunning palaces grace various sections of
the city; the Vienna Woods, inspiration for Strauss' waltzes, cradle the
northwest edge.  Vienna's historical roots run deep, as deep as the Danube River
that bisects the city.<BR></P>
<P>First settled by Celts around 800 BC, then conquered by the Romans, the
country fell under a succession of rulers.  In 996 the first deed containing the
name &quot;Austria&quot; was recorded, and this year the country celebrates its
1,000th anniversary.  During those early days, the country grew under the
relatively peaceful reign of the Babenberg dynasty.  But the dynasty died out in
1246, giving rise to the Habsburg empire that would rule Austria for more than
600 years and make the country the dominant force in Central Europe for much of
that time.  Shortly before the Habsburg era crumbled with the country's defeat
in World War I, the Austro-Hungarian Empire stretched north into what are now
Poland and the Czech Republic, east to the Ukraine and Romania, and south to
Bosnia and Italy.  But the vestiges of that great empire still can be seen today
-- in the buildings that decorate the street corners; in the people who populate
the town.<BR></P>
<P>This isn't a city of blue-eyed blonds, with last names like Fischer and
Schmidt.  Serbo-Croat and Polish can be heard on the subway, and dozens of
streets are named for those who came from the East.  Perhaps symbolically, the
cornerstone event of this year's anniversary celebration focuses on the Danube
River, which snakes its way through Austria on its course from the Black Forest
to the Black Sea.  The exhibit, to be housed in the 12th century  underground
vaults of the Scots Monastery (Schottenstift), will focus on the history and
culture of those who peopled the banks of the Danube and commemorate the
writers, painters and musicians who brought it fame.  Austria first rose to
power in 1683 with the defeat of the Turks who besieged Vienna.  In 1740, Maria
Theresa became the first woman to inherit the throne.  During her 40 years of
rule, she implemented many social reforms, helped fill the empire's empty
coffers, and gave birth to 16 children.  Among them were Marie Antoinette, who
married French King Louis XVI and later was guillotined, and Marie Louise, who
married Napoleon.<BR>  </P>
<P>Maria Theresa also left some of the most palpable traces of the Habsburg
empire in the city today.  Although she didn't commission the construction of
Schonbrunn -- the Habsburg's magnificent summer palace -- much of it was
redesigned under her instruction, and the empress' presence can be felt
throughout the palace.  Of the more than 1,400 rooms in Schonbrunn, about 40 are
open to the public. Among the most notable are the State Apartments, decorated
in 23&#189;-karat gold, and the Million Room, adorned with scores of priceless
Indian and Persian miniatures.  Under the empress, and the succeeding line of
Habsburgs,  Schonbrunn hosted posh balls and lavish banquets; at age 6, Wolfgang
 Amadeus Mozart performed there for the empress and her court.<BR>  </P>
<P>Following World War II, Vienna (like Berlin), was divided into four zones of
occupation by Allied forces, and the British set up headquarters in Schonbrunn. 
The main Habsburg palace, Hofburg, remains one of the most important buildings
in the inner city.  Its earliest sections were constructed in the 1200s, and
successive rulers added their own touches.  Over the years Hofburg developed
into a sprawling complex of more than 2600 rooms.   The royal apartments most
reflect the influence of Empress Elisabeth &quot;Sisi&quot;, who ruled over the
empire with her husband, Francis Joseph, until her assassination in 1898 by an
Italian anarchist. Sisi, a German princess, couldn't abide strict court
etiquette, and caused quite a stir by insisting on outfitting her apartments
with gymnastics equipment.<BR></P>
<P>Also housed at Hofburg is the Spanish Riding School, established in the late
1500s.  The performance has changed little over the years, as the striking white
Lippizaner stallions are put through their paces, often to the strains of one of
Austria's beloved composers.  At the Palace Chapel (<I>Burgkapelle</I>), the
Vienna Boys' Choir stirs the soul, performing classical and modern works during
Sunday Masses.  The third Habsburg palace, <I>Belvedere</I>, was built in the
1700s, but secured its place in history two centuries later: the palace was the
residence of Franz Ferdinand, whose 1914 assassination in Sarajevo gave rise to
World War I. Actually two separate buildings, <I>Oberes Belvedere</I> (Upper
Belvedere) contains works of 19th and 20th century Austrian artists,
particularly the gold-touched paintings of Gustav Klimt.  The lower floor of the
building houses a continually changing display of artworks.<BR></P>
<P>In <I>Unteres Belvedere</I> (Lower Belvedere), Baroque art is showcased. 
Some of Austria's most treasured art is on display at the <I>Kunsthistorisches
</I>(Art History Museum), located across from the Hofburg.  The Art History
Museum was constructed in the late 1800s to house the treasure trove of artworks
collected by the Habsburgs as their empire expanded. The most prized rooms are
the Egyptian-Oriental Collection, which contains  everything from mummies to
bronzes, and the Picture Gallery, housing an overwhelming collection of
paintings from throughout Europe, with works from Brueghel, Durer, Rembrandt and
Raphael among the most prominent.<BR></P>
<P>The Art History Museum and its twin, the Natural History Museum, are among
the dozens of historic buildings lining <I>Ringstrasse</I>, Vienna's most
beautiful boulevard.  In the mid-1800s the medieval walls cradling downtown were
razed to make way for construction of the Ring; buildings from this era, along
with the art and history of the time, are commemorated in a special exhibition
at the <I>Kunstlerhaus</I> (Academy of Fine Arts).  Other elegant buildings
along the Ring are the <I>Rathaus </I>(Town Hall), whose tower pokes above the
trees in the surrounding park, and the <I>Burgtheater</I> (National Theater),
crowned with busts of influential writers.  Inside the Ring stands what is
arguably Vienna's most visible symbol, <I>Stephansdom</I> (St. Stephen's
Cathedral).  Its towering steeple and distinctive roof tiles of green, yellow,
and white dominate the heart of downtown.  Founded in the 12th century, the
cathedral was destroyed by fire a hundred years later, then rebuilt in the
Gothic style.  With a bit of energy, one can climb the 344 steps of St.
Stephen's south tower for a stunning view of Vienna and its surroundings. <BR>
</P>
<P>A few blocks away is the <I>Staatsoper</I> (State Opera). Built in the
1860s, the Opera was subject to such criticism that one of the architects killed
himself.  But it quickly became a favorite in the hearts and minds of the
Viennese, and has long been considered one of the leading opera houses in the
world.  Like many other grand buildings in the city, the Opera was destroyed by
Allied bombs during World War II; reconstruction took 10 years.  Today an opera
or ballet, accompanied by the Viennese Philharmonic orchestra, is performed
every evening  September to June.  <BR></P>
<P>Vienna is a city steeped in musical tradition, which will be remembered this
year in an anniversary exhibit called &quot;The Message of Music,&quot; 
featuring everything from antique musical instruments to historic musical scores
to portraits of famous musicians.  Beethoven, Mozart, Strauss and Haydn are
among the composers who brought Vienna renown, and tiny museums to these greats
are scattered around town in homes where they once lived. Although born in
Salzburg, Mozart composed such world-famous operas as &quot;The Marriage of
Figaro,&quot; &quot;The Magic Flute,&quot; and &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; while
residing in Vienna.  But he died penniless at age 35, and was buried in a
pauper's grave.  The German-born Ludwig van Beethoven moved to Vienna at age 22
and lived in numerous apartments around the city; he was often evicted because
of his vile temperament and late-night compositions.  Through  works like &quot;The
Blue Danube&quot; and &quot;Tales From the Vienna  Woods,&quot; Johann Strauss
Jr. made features of the Vienna landscape  synonymous with waltzes.<BR></P>
<P>The outdoors has a vital role in the lives of the Viennese, who can be found
out for a Sunday stroll in even the most inclement weather.  Among their
favorite haunts is the <I>Lainzer Tiergarten</I> (Lainz Animal Reserve), once a
hunting ground for the Habsburgs.  It also will be the site for an anniversary
exhibit on the history of hunting in Austria. Austrians also frequent the <I>Prater</I>,
a game preserve for the aristocracy that was turned into a public park in 1766. 
Today, the 3,200-acre Prater features an amusement park whose giant ferris wheel
(the <I>Riesenrad</I>) is visible from many parts of the city. There also are
miles of pathways, a swimming pool, tennis courts, horseback riding trails, a
golf course, and facilities for almost any sport.<BR></P>
<P>For a true taste of the countryside, the <I>Wienerwald</I> (Vienna Woods)
is just a short ride from downtown, with miles of hiking trails wandering
through the rolling hills and lush woods.  There's even a public swimming pool
perched on a hill overlooking the city.  On the way back down from the Vienna
Woods, travelers can pass through the quaint village of Grinzing, notable for
its wine pubs (<I>Heurige</I>). Many still make their own wine from the
vineyards that grow almost outside their doors.  Most have cheerful,
vine-covered gardens, and dish up hot and cold meals and hearty servings of
Austrian <I>gemutlichkeit</I>.  &#164;</P>

<H2>The Danube: 1,000 Years of Austria, a Journey.</H2>
<P><I><FONT COLOR="#FF0080">by Julius Formanek, Jr.</FONT></I><BR></P>
<P>This year Austria celebrates the fact that the name <I>Ostarrichi</I>
appeared for the first time in an offical document with many concerts,
exhibitions and other events.  Of course today's Austria has only few things,
geographic or political, in common with the Ostarrichi from 996; but what
Austrians are celebrating is not a nation but an idea, which is represented by
the name Austria.  The Danube embodies this idea, and the history, culture, and
way of life of this region, with so many different nations living along the
river's 2,800 kilometers, is the object of the Milleniums-Exhibition &quot;Die
Donau: 1000 Jahre Osterreich; Eine Reise,&quot; presented through September in
the catacombs of the Schottenstift in Vienna.<BR></P>
<P>The presentation team, led by Dr.Gunther Dumriegl, attempts to capture in 16
&quot;chapters&quot; the feelings and moments in time that can convey to a
visitor the idea of Austria.  Chapter One features black &amp; white photographs
over the last 30 years; in Chapter Two, installations by artists like Fabrizio
Plessi and Hiroshi Sugimoto expound on the idea of &quot;Water&quot;.  Chapters
3 &amp; 4 tell about the landscape and the economic development of the
Danube-region.  The connection of history and Austria's important personalities
is the theme of Chapter 5.  Many original documents and more historical objects
are shown in Chapter 8, the central part of the exhibition.  The role of the
church is illuminated in Chapter 10, where among many other objects you will
find the original 1816 manuscript of the christmas song, <I>Stille Nacht,
heilige Nacht</I> (&quot;Silent Night&quot;) by Josef Mohr and Franz Gruber. 
Chapter 11 tells us the story of the region's Jewish culture, one of its most
important influences.  But, this chapter also shows us a dark side in the
history of the people of the Danube. <BR></P>
<P>Other chapters touch on the history of wine (Chapter 6), art (Chapter 13),
film (Chapter 14), Music (Chapter 15), and literature (Chapter 16). Among the
many exhibits are pictures of Klimt and Schiele, musical manuscripts of Strauss
or Mahler, and personal belongings of Peter Altenberg or Johann Nestroy. My
personal favorite is Chapter 12, &quot;Nature,&quot; where a fantastic
ten-minute multi-media show takes us into the romantic Danube Valley; here it is
neither a geographic nor a political valley, but just a beauty; sit down, listen
and look.  You will like it.  &#164;<BR></P>

<P><!--A Dutch Stone Dowager  Des Indes Ghostly Charm By Kit Snedaker-->The
Hague's des Indes Hotel, more than a century old, doesn't look a day over 50. 
This Dutch stone dowager has been as carefully preserved as a hot house tulip,
but like any lively old society matriarch, des Indes isn't sustained by care
alone.  A large part of the hotel&#146;s charm stems from its exciting past: 
the celebrities, the secrets, the ghosts.<BR></P>
<P>Des Indes was classy from the beginning.  On July 15, 1881 Empress Eugenie,
wife of Louis Napoleon, put her signature at the top of the first page of the
register.  Years later John Philip Sousa signed in with a staff of musical
notes; Arthur Rubinstein simply penned his name.  So did author Thomas Mann and
King Gustaf Adolf of Sweden.  Chang Sui-Chi listed himself as Secretary of the
Chinese Ministry of Ceremonies and Li Ching-Su included both his titles: <I>Mandarin
of the Third Grade</I> and <I>Secretary of the Chinese Ministry of Punishments</I>.
  
<BR></P>
<P>Big name guests were scarce during World War I, even though Holland was
neutral.  If it hadn't been for Mata Hari, born Margaretha Zelle in Dutch
Friesland, things might have been slow at The Hague's best hotel.  As a snappy
little German spy, Mata Hari used des Indes so frequently in her work a Dutch
television crew chose the hotel as the location of a documentary about her.  For
drama, however, des Indes never saw anything like Anna Pavlova.  The 50-year-old
ballerina arrived in a cold January, 1931, with an ominous cough.  She was
scheduled for a farewell performance of her signature role, the dying swan from
Swan Lake, at the Tivoli Theater.  The cough came on, she said, after spending
hours helping injured passengers when her train jumped the track outside of
town.  By showtime the cough had become pneumonia and the star lay abed in the
hotel, gasping for breath.   
<BR></P>
<P>Tradition dies hard.  A standing-room-only crowd waited impatiently as the
orchestra struck up the opening bars of Tchaikowsky's score.  The Tivoli
scrambled to improvise.  A quick-witted electrician looked about, grabbed a pink
spot and bounced the light around the empty stage as though it were Pavlova
turning into the ethereal  dying swan.   Dying indeed!  At half past midnight,
moments after the pink spot took its final curtain call, Pavlova drew her last
breath.  From then on the room behind the front desk was called the Anna Pavlova
Room in her memory.  
<BR></P>
<P>With good reason, as it turned out. From time to time puzzled guests report
seeing a woman in white tutu and pointes wandering down the grand staircase late
at night, as though waiting for her cue.  At the bottom she steps lightly
forward and just disappears. 
<BR></P>
<P>After World War II a younger specter began to show up.  In one of the rooms
(no one will say which) a guest glanced up from his bath to see a Nazi officer
in his undershirt, braces hanging over his uniform trousers, shaving at the
basin.  The officer toweled off and moved through what is now a wall, but put
there since the war.  The startled guest heard breaking glass, a shot and the
Nazi disappeared.  One explanation points to the hotel's black years of German
occupation when Nazis used the des Indes as an officers' billet.  On the roof,
in abandoned pigeon coops Dutch resistance workers hid Jewish refugees and
downed allied flyers waiting to be spirited to England.   
<BR></P>
<P>Between ghosts and traditions the hotel isn't an easy place to run with
seamless service, even in good years.  Not long ago, for instance, a Dutch
actress phoned from Paris to say she left her diamond rings behind.  The manager
assured her he wouldn't rest until he found them.  He did.  In the men's room. 
The rings went off by messenger.  She never asked where they were found and the
manager didn't burden her with that unsolicited information.  Des Indes has been
through enough to understand discretion. 
<BR></P>
<P>Haile Selassie's extended stay in 1958 called for even greater diplomacy. 
The pint-size potentate was uncomfortable at meals because dining room chairs
only brought his head level with his plate.  To bring him up to imperial
eye-level with his guests, the hotel built a throne-like high chair that raised
the Lion of Juda from plate-level to monarch-level -- at least even  with his
dinner partners.    Selassie's chair is still in the lobby, but the hotel hasn't
been so lucky with other memorabilia.  Most of the monogrammed door handles
disappeared into the pockets of light-fingered guests.  A Persian rug rode out
the front door on the shoulders of two men posing as rug cleaners.  A couple of
priceless Chinese vases vanished out the window of the Pavlova Room.   <BR></P>
<P>Despite such lapses in good manners, the hotel has not lowered its standards
a bit.  Des Indes's waiters still wear white gloves to pass such hors d'oeuvres
as Beluga caviar and golden snail eggs.  At banquets they stand, one behind
every two guests, to serve meals the may begin with foie gras and Dutch pea soup
and last into the night.  After dessert these same white-gloved waiters
ceremoniously warm cigars over a flame, clip the ends, dip them in Cognac and
offer one to each male diner. 
<BR></P>
<P>Such courtesies aren't limited to guests.  Des Indes also feeds celebrated
animals.  Every year the hotel opens Den Haag's toney horse show with a banquet
for the entries.  In the park in front of the hotel's entrance, show horses
prance up to silver platters of oats and apples on a long table set with silver
candelabra.  Visiting riding teams, the Canadian Mounted Police, for one, are
feted the same way.  Des Indes has also invited circus elephants to their own
elegant brunch. 
<BR></P>
<P>It's difficult to know whether the tone for the place is set by the hotel or
the town.  Unlike the rest of determinedly middle-class Holland, The Hague is an
elite village.  Its center, a 13th century Hall of Knights, is the seat of the
country's parliament.  The Queen opens the proceedings with a royal flourish
every September even though she is sworn in (not crowned) in Amsterdam, the
capital.  The royal family calls Den Haag home and the Dutch speak of it the way
Americans refer to such exclusive communities as Kennebunkport, Maine, Newport,
Rhode Island or Grosse Pointe, Michigan. 
<BR></P>
<P>If The Hague is the nation's aristocratic heart, des Indes represents stout,
corporal Holland.  For more than 100 years the hotel has remained stately and
plump, aloof from fire, war and natural disasters, sheltering guests and their
ghosts, gathering legends, a survivor by pride of place.  &#164;<BR></P>

<H2>Castle-Hopping Cathar Country</H2>
<P><I>by Douglas Walters</I><BR></P>
<P><B><I>Valleys of Vineyards, Limestone, and History</I></B><BR></P>
<P><B>The Corbieres region in southern France</B> is wind:  wild, wandering
wind, blowing over dazzling white-rock mountains swarming with lizards and
covered with Mediterranean steppe. There&#146;s a little water running down;
small rivers such as the Agly, a crystal-clear stream which threads its way
spectacularly through the narrow, precipitous rock walls of the Galamus Gorge. 
Corbieres is also cassoulet and red wine, the capital of the former, and one of
France&#146;s premier regions for the latter.  In this respect it&#146;s genuine
grass-roots French Culture, far removed from Europe&#146;s discos and urban
sprawl. But most of all, Corbieres is Cathar country.<BR></P>
<P>The Cathars were fanatical Middle Age religious heretics.  They&#146;re long
gone now, victims of the Crusades, but their memory is alive and well.  It lurks
in their remote, abandoned castles in Corbieres, about ten  in all. Most of them
were commanding-heights fortresses, literally built on to the highest points of 
steep rock hills.  The Cathars&#146; aim was, like that of most religious sects,
to escape the rest of the world.  Strictly ascetic -- the Greek origin of the
word cathar means &#147;pure&#148;    they rejected certain beliefs of the
Catholic Church, including the Holy Sacraments and ecclesiastical hierarchy. 
This naturally put them at odds with the Church, ensuring their demise.  The
Cathars&#146; belvederes helped them achieve spiritual eternity, but they couldn&#146;t
escape the French government.    The King&#146;s troops finished them off by
starving most of them out and burning alive the non-repenters in the Thirteenth
Century.  <BR></P>
<P>Today the remnants of their castles overlook vast bucolic valleys of
vineyards and limestone held in place by stunted Mediterranean oak and juniper. 
The Chateau de Foix is the westernmost and most accessible stronghold, about an
hour south of Toulouse off Route Nationale 20.  The rest of the Cathar castles
run roughly eastward to the Mediterranean, irregularly spaced from each other at
ten to 40-minute driving intervals.  Corbieres&#146;s winding provincial roads
make for relatively easy access...until the last few hundred meters before each
castle.  This is where you briefly need your hiking boots because the final
stretch to reach most of the castles is rocky and steep.  Off-road vehicles
couldn&#146;t make it, even if they were allowed to try.  Pack-mule power 
facilitates maintenance work.  As a result, most of the Cathar castles have no
tourist facilities whatsoever, except an isolated cashier (you pay for
everything in France).  This makes the self-guided tours pleasantly close to
nature, and far less crowded and cluttered than most other places in the
country.You pay a nominal $2 fare, then hike the last few steep, rocky meters
up.   This takes anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes depending on the castle and your
lung capacity.<BR></P>
<P>But get ready:  once up you can see forever, and then some.   And you
quickly take to heart the cashier&#146;s advice to hang on to any railings, and
not stray close to unfenced edges.   Corbieres, you see, is the windiest place
in France.   There&#146;s usually a decent blow going on in the valley bottoms,
to say nothing of the castle promontories where sustained winds of 30-70mph are
far from rare, even on clear days.   Gusts are frequently much higher, making it
easy to realize why the Cathars sought out their splendid isolation here.  On
the other hand, this is also the warmest part of France, so you can make the
visit at almost any time of the year.   Outside of the French tourist season in
late spring, and especially fall are best.   This is when the castles are
deserted, and only the wind keeps you company.   It&#146;s a cheap, exciting way
to spend a day, or even a week if, like all self-respecting tourists, you
intersperse the Cathars with some wine degustations.<BR></P>
<P>After a day of castle-hopping, it&#146;s best to eat regional specialties at
an auberge or one of the ubiquitous chambre d&#146;hotes (bed &amp; breakfast)
you&#146;ll stay at.  Most of them are reasonably priced (around $25-40 per
night excluding supper) in pleasant surroundings.  There are few fast-food
joints in Corbieres.    The French government has been generous with Corbieres,
reinforcing local efforts to make the region as receptive as possible to
tourists.   The aim has been to make Corbieres&#146;s Cathar legacy and the B&amp;B
the drawing cards of the region&#146;s tourist industry, maintaining Corbieres&#146;s
folksiness.  And it works.   Building facades in native rock have been restored
or re-done in even obscure towns, to say nothing of places like Cucugnan.   This
is a small Corbieres village, immortalized in French literature by the
19-century French writer Alphonse Daudet in a humorous short story about the
local priest.   From high in the distance, Queribus and Peyrepertuse, both
Cathar citadels, peer down over the vineyards on Cucugnan.   But you don&#146;t
have to be a history buff to appreciate the legacy of the Cathars.   Bien au
contraire:  a good day&#146;s castle-hopping is a lot like skiing the nearby
Pyrenees (hint).<BR></P>
<P>Back at the inn at sundown you&#146;re sunburned, windburn and exhausted.  
At first you just want to hit the sack.   After all, it&#146;s late and, in
addition to communing with the Cathars, driving has taken its toll.   A couple
of times you&#146;ve had to stop for some semi-wild burrows at the roadside.  
They stuck their scruffy heads in the car and you couldn&#146;t resist their
curled up hooves and big, imploring eyes begging you to offer whatever tidbits
you had.   As the sun set you&#146;ve also slowed down to get a better look at a
few sanglier wild pigs foraging at the roadside.  There&#146;s an indescribably
positive feeling in topping off the day at a B&amp;B with a late, genuine French
meal, maybe even some roast sanglier, a popular French dish.   You&#146;re
breaking bread with total strangers from different parts of the world.  One
minute they seem as distant as the Cathars 900 years before.   Then you start
discussing the wind and the clouds howling through the castles, and what life
must have been like for the Cathars.   And before you&#146;ve even left Cathar
country, you&#146;re making plans to return to it.   &#164;</P>

a pair traveling &amp; staying together.  If you&#146;re going solo and only
want to buy one package, expect to pay a premium (called a &#147;single

People at Dover Castle</FONT></I></H2>

<P><BR></P>
<P>In the spring of 1979, my wife and I were on our second visit to England. 
On our first trip we were consumed by the splendor and majesty of castles,
palaces and landscape in and around the great city of London.  While on a
limited budget, we had traveled to the upper part of Wales and both sides of
Scotland, Ayr to Edinburgh.  The wonder and awe of our first visit were still
fresh in our  minds; but the second trip was to acquaint us with our most
unforgettable Englishman&#151;Victor Yeakes of Dover, Kent&#151;a charming man
in his late 60s who served as an enthusiastic  &#147;keeper&#148; at Dover
Castle.<BR></P>
<P>A  quick tour of Dover Castle was on our schedule for that beautiful spring
day, but little did we know that my western style hat (cowboy hat) would open
the door to a true friendship.  The hat&#151;with its high peaked dome and band
of brightly colored feathers&#151;was uncharacteristic of my usual attire, but
it was an attention-getter; as proven by our stop at Canterbury, where in
touring the Cathedral we met a group of Boy Scouts who could not take their eyes
off it.  I offered them a closer view, and before long they were passing my hat
around and taking snapshots with it on.   That hat was to play a prominent role
in meeting my most unforgettable English person.<BR></P>
<P>Upon entering Dover Castle a distinguished guard, while looking at my hat,
asked, &#147;May I answer  any questions for you?&#148;  With that introduction
commenced a most enjoyable and informative personal guided tour of the
historically rich castle.  At the conclusion of our tour I didn&#146;t know if I
 should thank him for his kindness, offer a gratuity or just disappear; so I
said, &#147;Can I do anything  for you?&#148;  As we talked during our tour
Marcelle and I told Victor a little about ourselves, and it came up that we had
attended high school with, and had been personally acquainted with, Elvis
Presley.  On our previous trip when we told people we from Memphis, Tennessee we
were frequently be asked if we knew Elvis; so on this trip we carried our Humes
High School 1953 Yearbook&#151;with  Elvis&#146; graduation picture with a
friendship endorsement to me next to it.  We had copies of the signed picture to
give to those who wanted one.  But Victor, instead of requesting an Elvis
picture, said, &#147;I certainly am attracted to your hat band.&#148;  We 
assured him we would send him a similar one upon our return home, which we did.<BR></P>
<P>Over the years we continued to correspond with Victor and learned more about
this remarkable man. Some of Victor Yeakes&#146; talents included a remarkable
storytelling ability, an exceptional talent for writing both prose and poetry,
an artistic ability to illustrate by cartoon, and the unusual hobby of
participating in an all-British organization known as the &#147;War-horse 
American Union Cavalry Society,&#148; where he held the rank of Commissary
Master Sergeant.  He  was very proud of his outfit and he sent us several
photographs of himself and other members of  the society in full-dress American
cavalry uniforms, circa 1860.  Their organization was (and still is) very active
in their fascination with the American Civil War. They didn&#146;t just read
about and  discuss the events; they actually recreated the times and battles by
collecting and making authentic uniforms, armor, wagons and other equipment
appropriate to their re-enactments. 
<BR></P>
<P>We asked him by letter if we could bring him anything on our planned 1983
visit, at which time we learned that Victor had retired from Dover Castle, due
to failing health.  Despite his condition he was insistent that we visit in his
home, and we gladly accepted.  In response to our offer to bring  him something,
he again surprised us with a request for anything associated with the famous 
American Civil War era composer, Stephen Foster.  We went to Foster&#146;s &#147;Olde
Kentucky Home&#148; in Bardstown, Kentucky and collected some memorabilia and
information, from the home and from a two-act musical show (&#147;The Stephen
Foster Story&#148;) presented by The Stephen Foster Drama Association.  
<BR></P>
<P>During our visit in Victor&#146;s Dover home in 1983, he shared additional
information about his American Civil War activities.  He entertained us with his
musical talent by playing some tapes of popular songs he re-recorded changing
the words to fit events of his selection.  He gave us a copy of a photograph, of
himself and another Dover Castle keeper, taken with The Queen Mother of England
upon her installation as &#147;Lord Warden and Constable of Dover Castle.&#148; 
He also gave a copy of a letter he received from The Queen Mother thanking him
for a poem he wrote honoring her installation.  In addition to being entertained
by his musical talents and reading his &#147;majestically&#148; inspired poem. 
Victor also showed us a booklet he had written and illustrated concerning
England&#146;s 1980s incident in the Falkland Islands.  This thirty-page book
contained some very humorous cartoons intended to capture the humanity of the
people  involved.  As a dedication he wrote on the back cover:  &#147;These
Cartoon Sketches Were Drawn From The  Beginning And To The Ending Of The
Falklands War. And Portray The Feelings And Thoughts  Of Untrained Argentine
Soldiers Against Impossible Odds And A Brave and Determined Foe.&#148;  
<BR></P>
<P>A quick reading of this cartooned book may leave an incomplete understanding
of its purpose, but a closer reading coupled with some knowledge of its author,
reveals the sensitivity, love and compassion within this man     He entrusted
this booklet to me to see if anyone might have an interest in publishing. I
still hold the book to pass to the proper person.  
<BR></P>
<P>Victor was never a hero himself.  In 1940, while on military duty in a
foreign country, he suffered a disabling wound which kept him on the &#147;home
front&#148; during World War II.  This was no easy duty.  He showed us a &#147;bombing
map&#148; plotting the sites where thousands of bombs were dropped on the city
of Dover by German planes going to and coming from raids on London.  He told us
of watching some of these bombs drop.   
<BR></P>
<P>Victor also showed us a copy of the March 27, 1983 edition of News of the
World, a local newspaper, where an article titled &#147;A Traitor Stalks the
Castle&#148; described Victor&#146;s encounter with a &#147;tall, gaunt,
gray-featured man standing halfway up the spiral stairs from which there was no
way out of the dungeon&#148; (a ghost?).  The report tells how Victor, with &#147;hair
on the back of his neck lifted,&#148; nervously walked through Archers Bow Tower
after seeing this thing.  The article reported that &#147;there is legend that a
knight was beaten to death near the defences for treachery.&#148;  Knowing
Victor Yeakes, this reported sighting surprises me not.  
<BR></P>
<P>We told Victor we would return to England in several years, and would
contact him when plans were finalized. In the summer of 1987, while planning to
visit England once again, we sent Victor some items we thought he might enjoy. 
This package was returned by the Royal Mail with an endorsement dated August 1,
1987 stating &#147;Undelivered for reason stated&#151;return to sender.
DECEASED.&#148;  What a sad and shocking way to learn of the death of a friend. 

<BR></P>
<P>Marcelle and I will always remember the warmth of Victor Yeakes; he was a
man of intelligence, a man of wisdom, a man of many talents, a man of compassion
and courtesy.  We will remember and cherish that extra personal relationship we
shared, with a man from a country which has provided the world with so many
enduring memories.  To us the memory of Victor Yeakes will be just as important
as all the others.  &#164;

<P><I><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00" SIZE="+2">rec.travel.europe: A Newgroup for
European Travel</FONT></B></I><BR>Although they receive less media attention
than the World Wide Web, another thriving part of the Internet consists of  the
<B>newsgroups</B> -- basically collections of posted messages, questions,
answers, and endless discussions on particular topics of interest.  There are
literally thousands of newsgroups in existence, on every subject you can imagine
(and, to borrow a line from a popular Internet magazine, a few you'd have
trouble imagining!) 
<BR></P>
<P>Newsgroups differ from the World Wide Web in that they include no graphics,
and unlike Web sites aren't owned or operated by any particular company or
individual.  Picture them as giant bulletin boards in cyberspace, overflowing
with tacked up messages, Post-Its, and notes.  When you got Internet access your
sign-up kit probably came with a newsgroup &quot;reader&quot; &#151; special
software that allows you to access the newsgroup collections and navigate among
them by selecting from a list.  Once you access a particular newsgroup, all of
its recently posted messages are displayed in second list, grouped according to
individual &quot;threads&quot; or ongoing conversations on particular topics. 
Your reader software will then let you browse, save, print, or respond to the
posted messages, or start a new thread by posting a message of your own.  Other
than your normal Internet connection fees, there's no charge for participating
in newsgroups.  For our purposes, the essential newsgroup is rec.travel.europe,
filled with postings on every aspect of European travel.<BR></P>
<P>This is a great place to ask your fellow travelers about their own
experiences, hotel recommendations, destination ideas, and anything else you
want to talk about.  Participants are identified by their e-mail addresses, so
if you start a particularly interesting conversation with someone, you can take
it &quot;private&quot; by corresponding with them directly by email.  You'll see
a bit of advertising on rec.travel.europe, but not very much &#151; posting
unsolicited ads on a newsgroup will make you about as popular as a skunk at a
picnic, and the regular crowd will let you know about it.  If you're a tour
operator or otherwise in the travel biz, the best course for finding customers
here is to be unpushy, join in conversations, share your knowledge, and wait for
opportunities to mention your own offerings when they're directly relevent to
someone's questions or comments.    So if you've just started exploring the
Internet and haven't tried your newsgroup reader yet, go ahead and fire it up. 
Find rec.travel.europe in the list and start mingling with your online
compatriots.  It's interesting and can be a lot of fun.
<BR></P>
<P>And you may find just the answers you're looking for.

<H2>&quot;With Drive Central&quot;</H2>
<P><BR><I><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00" SIZE="+2">On the road with Germany's
share-the-ride program</FONT></B></I></P>
<P><BR>
<I>by Rhea Wessel</I><BR></P>
<P><B>Germany's share-a-ride program is a blessing for both drivers and
riders.</B>  It's not only the cheapest way to cross the country, it's the most
interesting.  I wish someone had told me about the highly efficient and
organised share-a-ride program when I came to live in Germany five years ago. 
All this time I could have had interesting company who would even pay for their
share of the gas.  And I would have been meeting travelers and hearing their
tales from adventures far and wide. 
<BR></P>
<P>The nationwide Mitfahrzentrale MFZ (literally, <I>with-drive-central</I>)
program has offices in most large cities which serve as agents for drivers and
riders.  The nationwide number for the mitfahrzentrale is 19444; from major
cities dial it directly or if calling from out of town, add the city code.
(Example: Frankfurt 069-19444, Munich 089-19444.)  
<BR></P>
<P>My first trip as a driver was from Hamburg to Bonn and I called up the
center to give them the details. I would leave on Sunday at 11:00 a.m. and I had
room for two riders as long as they didn't have too much luggage.  The meeting
point was the MFZ office, strategically set near the autobahn for drivers and
near public transportation for the benefit of riders.  Each passenger paid about
35 marks, or $20 (fees riders pay depend on the length of the drive and are set
by the agency) and we had a jolly old time fighting the traffic together.  One
guy was a computer whiz in his mid-twenties headed to Bonn looking for a job,
the other a student who had visited a friend on the weekend. 
<BR></P>
<P>Once after a vacation, flying in to Frankfurt on a cheap ticket from Madrid,
I decided I would like to make it home to Hamburg without paying as much for the
German train ticket as I did for the flight.  I called up Frankfurt's MFZ to
find someone headed to Hamburg.  I paid a 20 mark fee to the agency, then hopped
in with Izmet, a 33 year-old German of Turkish descent who was headed to Hamburg
for a sales promotion.  He greeted me enthusiastically and before we had even
left Frankfurt,  asked if I knew a place where he could stay in Hamburg.  We
would be arriving late, he hadn't booked anything, and he didn't want to spend a
lot of money.  
<BR></P>
<P>&quot;This is going to be a long ride,&quot; I thought to myself.  But Izmet
turned out to be a great guy and we shared our life stories during the five-hour
drive. When we stopped for gas, I called my roommates to ask if they wouldn't
mind if Izmet slept in our guest room.  In return, Izmet didn't charge me the 35
marks. 
<BR></P>
<P>On another trip from Hamburg to Augsburg, I rode with two young women.  We
cranked up the music and the ride reminded me of a road trip in my high school
days.  Coming from Kaiserslautern to Hamburg, I met Achim, a young German law
student who enjoyed practicing the art of flirting in English; now we exchange
e-mail.  From Frankfurt to Hamburg, a young Brazilian who was a member of a
traditional dance group touring Europe, shared music from his home.  We broke
out a bag of Tostitos bought at an U.S. army post exchange and I was able to
share a taste of my native Texas.        I was so excited about my discovery of
the MFZ that I once practically forced my brother to take riders with him. It
was a winter day, he was tired and I didn't want him to face a long trip home
alone.  So I arranged for him to take two passengers. It turned out that one had
an awful cold and sneezed during the whole trip. My brother lay in bed for a
week trying not to blame me for his illness.  
<BR></P>
<P>I guess riding with the MFZ is like life.  Sometimes you get lucky,
sometimes you don't.  If you're lucky, on your next trip to Germany you'll hook
up with interesting people and see the country from its fabulous network of
roads.  And if you're really lucky, I won't pick you up in my little blue Fiat
with 100,000 miles on it, instead a tank-like Mercedes with a dream driver will
whisk you away.  &#164;

Travel Savings Directory</I>, includes more than 800 hotels in <B>Europe</B>
which participate in their half-price program.  While the &quot;50% discount&quot;

<P>&#183; The <B>Globe Theatre</B> (at least, a rebuilt version) has finally
re-opened on the banks of the Thames, just a short walk from the original site
of Shakespeare's stage.  The new Globe was built with the aim of as much
authenticity as possible, even to the extent of including a partially-open roof.
  It is also the first building since the Great Fire of 1666 allowed to have a
thatched roof -- though in this case, with a built-in sprinkler system.  Perhaps
for these reasons, costs have gone up a bit; today's building ran $12 million,
as opposed to approximately $1500 spent on the original.  If you're
<B>London-bound</B>, check with your travel agent or ticket agency on upcoming
Globe performances.

wonder about the &quot;PP/DO&quot; abbreviation that you see in most
package-deal listings.  What it means is &quot;per person, double occupancy&quot;
-- in other words, the quoted price is based on buying at least two packages for
a pair traveling &amp; staying together.  If you're going solo and only want to
buy one package, expect to pay a premium (called a &quot;single supplement&quot;),
usually 20-50% over the listed price.<BR></P>

<H1>Meet Malta</H1>
<P><I>by Sophia Dembling</I></P>
<HR>
<P><B><I>Europeans know the little country well, Americans hardly at all</I></B></P>
<P></P>
<P>Mention Malta and many Americans get a sort of pained, puzzled expression on
their faces -- which, loosely translated, means &quot;I've heard of Malta but
don't exactly know where or what it is.&quot; Asked to hazard a guess, they
might place Malta in Africa, or maybe near Spain. 
</P>
<P>May we be excused for our ignorance? It's such a small place, just three
tiny inhabited islands and three uninhabited islets in the Mediterranean, about
halfway between the coasts of Sicily and North Africa. The main island, Malta,
is about the size of Martha's Vineyard.  But small as it is and little as we
know about it, the powers of Europe's past knew it well as a stepping-stone
between Europe and North Africa. Players in Malta's history include the Romans
and Phoenicians, Arabs and Carthaginians, Castilians and British (from whom
Malta became independent in 1964).  Napoleon did unutterable damage in a mere
six days occupation; but Malta stood firm against Hitler despite massive
bombing, earning the nation the George Cross depicted on its flag. 
</P>
<P>The Knights of the Order of St. John, an elite multinational order of
fighters and healers, have something to do with the things we do sort of know
about Malta.  You might recognize the Maltese cross, which is the insignia of
the Order of St. John. Its four arms represent prudence, justice, temperance and
fortitude.  And you've heard of the Maltese falcon -- the Mediterranean
peregrine falcon -- which was the annual rent required by Roman emperor Charles
V when he gave the island to the knights in 1530. This modest fee could not be
paid today. The falcon has vanished from Malta, shot, trapped and otherwise
harassed out of existence.  
</P>
<P>The knights were not altogether thrilled with the gift of the little island,
which is no kind of natural paradise. The land is rugged, dry and rocky, though
these days barely in evidence in its natural form because Malta is one of the
world's most populous countries. It takes no more than half an hour to drive
between any two points on the main island and that is accomplished without ever
breaking out into wide-open spaces;  the island is virtually solid with jumbles
of buildings built of native limestone. 
</P>
<P>There are some spots that offer the more familiar ambiance of a
Mediterranean island. Marsaxlokk (say mar-sa-shlock),  the country's fishing
capital, is a village in the southeast where tourists idle in harborside cafes;
colorful boats called luzzus bob on the water, protected by eyes of Osiris
painted on their bows; fishing nets of fine nylon, like pastel-colored hair, are
laid out on the pavement to dry or rest in what looks like impossibly tangled
piles, easily unfurled by fishermen. But Marsaxlokk seems removed from the
bustle of the island and the thick history that coats it. 
</P>
<P>Malta is dense, not only with people and towns but with history and historic
sites -- it has been called a huge open-air museum. The legacy of its long
history includes prehistoric ruins older than Stonehenge and sites visited by
Saint Paul, whose shipwreck on the island brought Christianity to this devoutly
Roman Catholic country. 
</P>
<P>It is the Knights of Malta, however, who left the greatest physical mark on
Malta, after successfully defended it from the power-hungry Ottoman Empire in
1565. The knights reigned on the island for 270 years, building fabulous
churches and lavish monuments to themselves -- each nationality had its own
palace -- before losing power due to increasingly dissipate lives of drinking,
fighting and womanizing. The order still exists but has given up its wicked ways
and returned to its original charitable intents.  The knights, particularly
Grand Master Jean La Vallette (the grand master was the order's elected leader) 
were responsible for the creation of the gorgeous old city of Valletta after the
defeat of the Ottomans.  Valletta was to be, decreed La Vallette &quot;a city
built by gentlemen, for gentlemen.&quot;  Valletta, considered the world's first
planned community, was heavily fortified, its stone ramparts rise sternly from
the water. A sightseeing cruise of the Grand Harbor and tributaries offers a
vivid impression of the seriousness of the walled city's intent. 
</P>
<P>These days Valletta is a popular cruise port and holiday spot, mostly for
Brits, who still have a sentimental connection with Malta --the last British
troops shipped out in 1979.  Europeans also flock to Sliema, St. Julian's and
Paceville, touristy beachfront suburbs of Valletta, though Malta's beaches are
not nearly as glistening as those in other Mediterranean spots.  
</P>
<P>While America has yet to discover Malta, we are being targeted to take
notice. Paul Galea, director of marketing for the National Tourist Organization
of Malta says that while it is unlikely Americans would travel such a distance
for beaches far less attractive than those in the Caribbean, the abundance of
historic sites puts the nation in competition for tourists with Prague, Paris
and Venice.  The Malta National Tourist Office, once part of the United Nations
mission, became freestanding last June and has offices in New York City. While
there are no direct flights from here to there -- Air Malta flies daily from
London and Rome, less often from other European cities -- Joseph Paolino, Jr,
American ambassador to Malta, said that instating direct flights between Malta
and J.F.K  International Airport is a priority for him.  &quot;As Americans,
we're used to just getting on a plane and going,&quot; says Galea. 
</P>
<P>A likely appeal for Americans is language -- their own, that is. Malta has
two official languages, Maltese and English, which is a leftover of about 160
years of British rule.  Maltese, whose closest cousins are Lebanese and classic
Arabic, has in the written form an abundance of consonants and makes liberal use
of the letter X. Italian, too, is widely spoken, particularly on the television,
much of which comes from nearby Italy.  And, a boon in a nation where tourism is
the top industry, the Maltese people have a courteous and welcoming way about
them.  &quot;We don't make any special efforts, it just comes out naturally,&quot;
said professional guide Anna Muscat. At celebrations for the Feast of St. Paul
in February, locals happily related their history to visitors as a parade
passed. A restaurateur accepted dollars from a group of American tourists who
hadn't had a chance to change money, drawing the line only when one tourist
tried to charge a shared salad.  &quot;Madame,&quot; he said gently. &quot;I
cannot put half a salad on a credit card.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Malta could be part of a European tour or visited during a Mediterranean
cruise. Valletta is an ideal cruise port. It's a small, walkable city, its
narrow and sometimes steep streets thick with European-style palaces and
churches, easily visited in an afternoon.   Near the city's main gate is what
little is left of the Opera House, once an ornate affair designed by E.M. Barry,
architect of London's Royal Opera House, but  bombed to near  smithereens in
1942.  Fortunately, not all Malta's sites suffered so. Once Malta recovered
economically from the war, &quot;Then, thank God, we realized we have to start
taking care of our national heritage,&quot; said Anna. 
</P>
<P>Take in the stirring view of the Grand Harbor from Barraca Gardens, a
slightly ragged oasis of arches, palms, flowers and statuary originally built
for the pleasure of the Italian knights. The Grand Masters Palace is suitably
impressive for those exalted personages with two courtyards, a tapestry room
with hangings depicting fanciful scenes of the West Indies, a throne room; and
an armory in the former stable. The Manoel Theater is a gilded bauble still in
use, fashioned after Italy's Palermo theater and dating to 1731.  And the
premier sight is the vast, baroque St. John's Co-Cathedral, with its floor of
369 inlaid marble tombstones and a painting by Carravagio in the oratory.
Dedicated to the knights' patron saint, St. John the Baptist -- whose life is
depicted in a painting around the enormous vault -- the church embodied the
wealth and power of the knights without subtlety. 
</P>
<P>Within St. John's Co-Cathedral, each of the knights' nationalities had a
chapel: the Chapel of France contains the mausoleum of Vicomte de Beaujolais,
brother of King Louis Phillipe, sculpted as a languid, lounging youth. The
Chapel of Castile is the most rococo according to the taste of Grand Master
Manoel De Vilhena, which was, sniffs Anna, &quot;very bombastic.&quot; 
</P>
<P>One of city's the most impressive restorations is the prosaic-sounding
Mediterranean Conference Center in Valletta, built as a hospital in the 1500s
and elegantly restored to practical use. The wards -- great sweeping halls with
vaulted ceilings and marble floors -- now are exhibition areas and a modern
theater has been added. Here, too, you may see the Malta Experience, an
audio-visual presentation about Malta's complicated past. 
</P>
<P>A few days' visit is enough time to see the island's other sights. The ruins
of  Hagar Qim are among the most imposing of the country's 30 prehistoric sites
(only about a half dozen are open to the public), which date from about 3600 to
3200 BC. Ggantija, two prehistoric temples on the island of Gozo, a short ferry
ride away, are among the oldest freestanding structures in the world and also
may easily be visited in the course of a weeklong tour. The whys, hows and whats
of these sites, with their great stone portals and various altars, are still
just being guessed at, though prehistoric man is believed to have worshipped
goddesses of fertility within their thick walls. 
</P>
<P>All over the country, Malta's riches are represented by its churches, the
center of Maltese life, focal point of the nation's many festas, or festivals. 
&quot;They are not just museums,&quot; said Anna. &quot;They are lived in.&quot;
  
</P>
<P>St. Mary's Church in Mosta is one of the largest in Europe. It has a
glorious, airy blue, gold and white dome and its own miracle: On April 9, 1942
at 4:40 p.m., with 300 people in the church, a bomb crashed through the dome but
did not explode. A replica of the bomb is displayed in the sacristy.  In Rabat
is the small, dank grotto in which St. Paul recovered from the trauma of his
shipwreck mishap; and the House of Publius, considered the first church in Malta
because it was here Roman governor Publius brought St. Paul to preach his
gospel. Virtually all of underground Rabat is a catacombs, an eerie maze of
rocks and tunnels from which all remains have been removed, though one's
imagination might be excused for picturing them in their stony resting places. 
</P>
<P>Mdina, called the silent city, is a fusty aristocrat set high on a hill in
the island's center. It was first a Roman town, then Arabic, then Norman, each
group wiping out traces of the last until what remains is an elegant walled
medieval town. Mdina (pronounced em-deena) was home to Maltese nobility during
the knights' reign. Never deemed worthy of being invited into the Order, the
nobility retired to Mdina under autonomous rule while the knights lived in
Valletta.  Mdina is in a state of both picturesque decay and rebirth, as moneyed
Maltese move in, restoring and renovating. Only residents' cars are allowed
within city walls, so it is pleasant to stroll the quiet narrow, twisting
streets. Bona-fide &quot;sights&quot; are limited. The walk-through Medieval
Times offers a glimpse of medieval life in Malta. For those with a taste for the
grotesque, there is the graphic Museum of Torture. Better yet, simply linger
over a cup of coffee and a sweet at the Fontanella atop the ramparts and enjoy a
view of nearly all of the island and lots of deep blue sea. 
</P>
<P>There are not many places that can be viewed in almost its entirety while
sitting over a cup of coffee -- or in a week's sightseeing. But don't think you
know it all yet. With 6,000 years of history, Malta has much more to teach you
than you can learn in a week. 
</P>
<P>Still, it's a start.  &#164;

<P><BR></P>
<P><I><B>Getting there</B></I></P>
<P>Air Malta flies daily from London and Rome, less frequently from other
cities, including Milan, Barcelona, Paris, Cairo and many others. There also are
ferries between Malta and Sicily, a trip of about eight hours.</P>
<P><BR></P>
<P><I><B>Climate
</B></I></P>
<P>Malta bakes in summer, winters are mild but can be wet. The sirocco -- a
hot, dry wind from North Africa -- blows May and September.  Money The lira (LM)
divides into 100 cents. These days, one lira equals about $2.75. Most
attractions charge about one lira admission. Prices, by European standards, are
not bad -- one can dine well for about $30, not including drinks.</P>
<P><BR></P>
<P><I><B>Food</B></I></P>
<P>
Happily, Malta's cuisine has much in common with Italy's. It's hard to go wrong
with fish -- ask your server what's good. The bread is heavenly, and be sure to
try the local snack, the pastizzi, a buttery little meat- or cheese-filled
pastry. Traditional Maltese food (they particularly like rabbit) isn't easy to
come by, but you can find it at the Palazzo Constanzo Restaurant in Mdina. La
Cave in the Castile Hotel in Valletta, serves good pizzas and pastas in a
wonderful, dark, stone cellar. Gesther is a cozy spot for lunch in Xaghra on
Gozo.</P>
<P><I>Ed. Note: See also <B>Dining in Malta</B>, below</I></P>
<P><BR></P>
<P><I><B>Gozo</B></I></P>
<P>The ferry to Gozo takes about 20 minutes and is free going, about $4
returning. A helicopter offers a great view and costs about $38 one-way. Among
Gozo's sights are the Citadel in Victoria (visit the Folklore Museum, a
hodgepodge of interesting artifacts); the Azure Window, a natural stone arch;
and the prehistoric ruins of Ggantija. Gozo is slower-paced and more rural than
Malta and a popular getaway for well-heeled European. 
</P>
<P><BR></P>
<P><I><B>Packages</B></I></P>
<P>Malta's tourism is heavily geared towards package tours. Among the operators
offering Malta tours:</P>

<H2>Dining in Malta</H2>
<P><I>by Myra Cummock</I></P>
<HR>
<P>In Malta there are lots of good restaurants and cafes, but if you are on a
budget, restaurants which display Tourist Menus offer great value for money.  A
typical three course Tourist Menu dinner is made up of soup, egg-mayonnaise or
fruit juice, sirloin steaks, pork chops, or omelet, all served with french fries
and salad then either ice cream or tea or coffee, all for about L2M ($5.70)
including a glass of wine.  Most restaurants and cafes also offer a full cooked
breakfast including tea or coffee and toast for around L1M. 
</P>
<P>If you wish to try Maltese food, the local fish Lampuki is popular, as is
bragiolli (beef olives) or rabbit done in a wine sauce.  If you're staying in
the Bugibba area, Granny's Restaurant at the Square is by far the most popular
-- but get there early or be prepared to wait. Another great place is the San
Paolo cafe, where homemade burgers are a meal in themselves at 40cents each, and
the quick wit of the owner and his wife make eating there a pleasure.</P>

<P><BR></P>
<P>My first home exchange took some work and organization, but it was more than
the effort.<BR></P>
<P>Starting a home exchange is simple:  I placed a listing on my home in a
publication called Trading Homes International.  They publish a new book
approximately every quarter; your home is listed in the newest book following
your membership and payment (about $60.00 annually).  Upon joining, you&#146;ll
receive the most recent copy and you can start looking through all of the
listings.  There&#146;s a brief description of a home, the area and the owners. 
They range from basic apartments to luxurious villas, from New York to San
Francisco, from Paris to London and in between.  The listing also tells you
where the owners would like to trade, and what time of the year they&#146;d like
to do it.  Some are open to all areas; others are very specific.   
<BR></P>
<P>I got excited about all of the possibilities and wrote to a dozen different
listings in England, France, Spain and Portugal.  I wrote a very descriptive and
friendly letter, telling about my home itself, my town and the surrounding areas
and cities.  I pointed out all of the reasons why they would want to come stay
in my home!  I also included the driving distances to interesting areas a little
further away.  (I pointed out that I live about two hours from Vail and four
hours from Aspen, etc.).  I listed all of the recreational activities, as well
as lots of cultural, historical and other interesting highlights about the
region I live in.  I also included a colorful brochure that my Chamber of
Commerce puts out on my town.  I live in a very nice home, but it is rather
suburban and only two years old, so I emphasized the region as opposed to the
home itself; but I did give a detailed description of the home so that they
could see if it suited their needs.   I sent off my inquiries and waited for my
listing to appear in the next issue. 
<BR></P>
<P>I received my first response within a matter of weeks; however, they
pleasantly turned down my offer.  As did the next, and the next and the next. 
They were polite to send such nice rejection letters, but I was getting very
discouraged.  About a month later, a larger envelope arrived in the mail for me;
and sure enough, it was a response from a woman in England who had placed a
listing for her farmhouse in France.  She was very interested in doing an
exchange!  As France was tops on my list, I was excited to say the least.  I
immediately wrote to her with more details about my plans.  Within a few days
she had called to chat and we hit it off immediately.   
<BR></P>
<P>This part of the exchange is the most time-consuming and takes the most
effort, but it is absolutely necessary to take time for careful planning. 
Planning everything in advance is essential when it comes to a successful
exchange.  I was lucky because her home was vacant most of the time; she had
bought it as a vacation home.  This made planning of dates much easier for us. 
We talked back and forth, and wrote a few times as well, before we actually
agreed to an exchange.  We sent pictures of our homes and described our
respective areas in more detail.  Her home was in an area of France called the
Charente, an area which at first glance seemed isolated, and which no one I
talked with had ever visited.  She wanted to visit Denver, while my home was
actually 25 minutes from the city, on the outskirts of Boulder instead.  But as
we talked more often, it became apparent that with a home exchange everything is
not going to be perfect; some compromise and flexibility is necessary from both
parties.  Before long we were confirming dates and times, and within a few
months of our first contact, I had purchased my plane ticket.  I had a house
named Bassinaud to go to in France! 
<BR></P>
<P>Meanwhile the listing for my home appeared in the next issue of the Home
Exchange book, and I began receiving offers for exchanges from England, France
and other parts of the U.S.  I received about a dozen offers, all of which
seemed worthwhile and a few spectacular.  But since I had already planned my
exchange, I had to send off my own rejection letters&#151;with difficulty as I
was very happy with the response, and would&#146;ve loved to take all of the
offers!   
<BR></P>
<P>Before my departure for France, I had some home exchange details to attend
to.  Since there was to be somebody staying in my home during my absence, the
planning was slightly different than that of a regular trip.  The home had to be
in &#147;user friendly&#148; condition for my guest.  This meant a long letter
explaining all of the idiosyncrasies of my home, like how to work the stereo
system, the VCR, the thermostat, the door locks, the answering machine, the
microwave, the porta-phone, the jacuzzi and the little deely-bobber that you
have to wiggle for the sprinkler system.  This is in addition to the
instructions on watering the houseplants, the potted outdoor plants and the
flower beds.   We had also agreed that she would be using one of my cars, so
that had its own set of details to be written down.  Throw in directions to
everything, restaurant recommendations, suggestions, hints, comments, and
suggestions, and soon I had pages of information for her.  (I never knew how
many words it took to describe the everyday stuff around my house!).  I&#146;d 
checked in with my insurance company (it was fine), my neighbors (ready and
excited to help her out), and my friends (who were watching my dogs at their
home while I was gone).   I also left her local emergency numbers (they&#146;re
different in Europe), those of my local friends and neighbor, plus the closest
hospitals, grocery stores, gas stations and other conveniences.  It definitely
took some more preparation than I was used to!  I  left a key hidden in a
strategic place, and one with the neighbor just in case.   When I finally drove
away to the airport, I took a deep breath and just hoped for the best. 
<BR></P>
<P>I  arrived in France, rented a car and headed towards my French farmhouse. 
She had already sent me detailed directions to the house (as I&#146;d done for
her).  During the drive southwards through France, my anticipation was growing
daily.  I stopped in wonderful, beautiful places along the way, falling madly in
love with the country in a matter of days.  Would the home I was heading to live
up to my high expectations?  I started to think I was crazy, taking a gamble
like this.  It could end up being anything, anywhere!  I was to arrive at the
house on my fourth day in France.  It was located in a tiny village called
Juignac; I could only locate it on the detailed regional Michelin map; it was
too small for the other maps I&#146;d found.  As I drove into the area, passing
through the city of  Angouleme,  I breathed a huge sigh of relief.  I only had
about twenty miles to go, and the region was stunning; farmlands and vineyards
interspersed with wooded areas, small villages and hills rolling off into the
distance.  I turned off the highway at the ancient town of Montmoreau, and
passed over a stone bridge onto a winding road.  It led through a small village
called St. Amand&#146;s, where the old men were playing a mysterious game with
croquet-like balls in the tiny town square with its stone fountain.  In a few
very rural miles, I reached the road which was my destination.  It was lined
with tall, lacy trees, giving it almost a forest feel; the first turnoff had a
small sign pointing down a winding driveway: Bassinaud.  I drove a few hundred
yards, emerged from the trees, and there was my 17th-century farmhouse.     
<BR></P>
<P>Situated on a small bluff, it sat by itself surrounded by meadows; there
were views in every direction of the rolling hills and farmlands, complete with
grazing sheep and cows.  The only other structure in sight was an old barn,
built into the hill directly across the small valley on which the house sat. 
The inside was also wonderful: thick whitewashed walls, terra cotta tiled
floors, old exposed ceiling beams, heavy wooden doors.  The kitchen, dining and
living areas were all just one big room, anchored by a huge wood burning stove. 
All of the windows were tall and multi-paned, curtained with very French looking
and yellow fabric.  Further in, I found the two pretty bedrooms and the
bathroom, which had been modernized and was good sized.  (There was also a newer
dishwasher, clothes washer and small refrigerator, all very useful in the coming
days).  Many of the furnishings were antique, some original to the house and
going back hundreds of years.  The whole effect was immediate on me&#151;none of
it was fancy; all of it charming.  
<BR></P>
<P>I spent three weeks in the farmhouse.  I frequented the nearby outdoor
markets on market days and brought back goat cheese, chicken, duck, five
different kinds of asparagus, eggs and eggplant, all locally raised or grown.  I
drank delicious $2.00 bottles of local wine and had warm bread to go with it.  I
sat in small cafes and patisseries and drank coffee and watched and chatted with
the local people; visited stunning chateaux and quaint villages and incredible
cities with endless shops; saw barking deer, strange birds and wild turkeys.  I
traveled all over the region, driving for hours through stunning countryside and
never encountered any American tourists.  I had the best vacation of my life and
stayed in my new favorite place in the world&#151;without paying a dime for
lodging. 
<BR></P>
<P>Obviously my home exchange in France worked out wonderfully; that&#146;s why
I like to share my experience with other travelers.  I&#146;ve since become
great friends with the owner of the house; she has visited me more than once,
and I plan to return again to her place in France this spring for another three
week stay.  You must look into a home exchange!  That is what I&#146;ve been
saying (shouting!) since I returned from my own.  Gambling on the combination of
my first home exchange with my first trip to France added up to a perfectly
wonderful trip of a lifetime for me.  It could work for you, too. &#164;

<P>Whenever I eat a Greek olive or see a massive stone column on a public
building do I think of the Acropolis or of the wonders of Delphi?  No, I am
reminded of a railway on the north side of the Peloponnese of Greece.  Railfans
that you are, I am sure you will understand.<BR></P>
<P>In 1991, while on a visit to this ancient land and after absorbing so many
ruins that our minds could appreciate no more, my wife and I found our way to a
most fascinating and beautiful valley with a cog railway line.  Talking
(English/German) one morning with a rail worker in a Grecian town, where
monasteries and nunneries are seemingly glued to the very tops of stone
mountains, I was told of a very interesting railway.  One that, I was assured,
seldom sees tourists and very few Greeks.  That was the clue that I needed.<BR></P>
<P>Leaving Athens at 8:30 one morning we were forced to ride a special bus west
for one hour as far as Corinth due to track work on the meter gauge line.  This
did, however, give us a different view of the railway bridge over the Corinth
Canal.  At the Corinth station the &quot;only Inter-City  meter gauge train&quot;
was waiting and we departed behind a diesel-electric engine.  (Apologies may be
due here to the RhB and others  for this Greek claim).  A couple of hours later,
after continuing west along the very beautiful shoreline of the Guff of Corinth
toward Patras, we arrived at Diakofto.  On the south side of the station was a
2-foot gauge track waiting for the 12:15 train to Kalavrita to terminate and
then depart.  It was about an  hour late but its turnaround time was minimal
because it had only two cars, with what looked like a very large commercial air
compressor coupled in between.  Very definitely a unit train, the &quot;locomotive&quot;
 seemed to pull and push at the same time whatever the direction.  The weather
was hot so the side panels were largely off the engine to allow better cooling. 
In fact the &quot;engine&quot; was just a diesel-powered generator.  Motored
trucks resided in each of the two passenger cars.  The bogies carried side rods
to couple the wheels for the necessary flatland adhesion and, of course, the cog
assembly was in the middle of each powered truck.<BR></P>
<P>We captured a front seat and the climb started south up to the mouth of a
granite river canyon that had never been pierced by more than this little
railway.  In later years a road was attempted through the rocks but to no avail.
 The Vouraikos river commands all but the track bed, which in places is laid
through partial and complete tunnels and over iron and rock bridges.  A road was
finally established some miles to  the east.  Topping out of the deepest part of
the valley, after running most of the time on the rack, the  train arrived at
our destination:  a village called Zahlorou.  Zahlorou, at 2086 feet elevation,
is maybe half-way to the southern terminal of Kalavrita, fourteen miles from the
Gulf of Corinth.<BR></P>
<P>Terming Zahlorou a village is a bit generous but it is a place to
appreciate.  The trains make their noise as they pass through but when they
leave, only the river music takes over the audio entertainment.  There are two
or three buildings by the station, one of which was our hotel.  The track passes
directly through the area between the kitchen and the dining tables and
continues over a bridge to the remaining portion of the settlement.  On the
other side of the river is a very small store, possibly a bakery, ouzo supplier
and a handful of houses.  A one-lane dirt road allows motor vehicles into
Zahlorou from Kalavrita but not into our part of town.  How peaceful!<BR></P>
<P>The best reason for this station stop is that for many years it served the
lower end of a steep donkey trail that rose to Mega Spileon, a monastery built
over 3000 feet above sea level by Orthodox Byzantine monks in 362ad.  Access now
is available by using the aforementioned road that would not fit into the river
canyon.  A hike up the mountain trail was worth the effort, if only for views of
the beautiful scenery.  The eight-story monastery itself was very fascinating. 
It had been secured to the side of a vertical granite mountain peak, a
construction site that seems to have been popular in ancient Greece.  Hard to
believe this could have been done over fifteen hundred years ago -- or even
today!<BR></P>
<P>Zahlorou has one of the few passing tracks on this line and therefore is a &quot;hotspot&quot;
of railroad activity.  No CTC here, so the crew throws a switch if needed. 
Occasionally, due to a relaxed schedule, trains do meet here but there are
usually only two units in operation each day.  As I recall, each of the two made
two round trips a day.  The passenger service accommodates the local residents
with mail and incidental drop-offs.<BR></P>
<P>I could never really find out when freight service ended, but steam engines
were said to have been phased out in the late 1950s.  The line was built for
mining about the turn of the century and two of the old steamers are on display
at the terminals along with an ancient wooden passenger coach at Kalavrita. 
There are a few box cars and hoppers available for maintenance work.  The forty
year old diesel-electric passenger units are repaired at the main shop in
Diakolto, but are occasionally shipped to Austria for major rebuilding.  Spare
generator cars are switched in and out frequently I was told.<BR></P>
<P>We took a ride up to Kalavrita on the second day of our visit.  While the
size of a good small town, it has little to offer except the Helmos skiing slope
in the winter and historical monuments and religious structures the year long. 
Frankly, we stayed only an hour or two until the next down train.  Lunch at the
station was good but not spectacular.  The most noted story about Kalavrita is
told about a horrible crime against humanity that happened during World War II. 
Greeks had the courage to resist the Nazi forces that controlled that area, and
late in 1943 the invaders decided that they would teach a lesson to the patriots
who were giving them trouble.  So they gunned down and shoved all 1,400 male
residents, men and boys alike, off cliffs.  The females, young and old, were
closed in a school across from the rail station and then the whole town was set
on fire.  The hands of the church clock in the center of town are now fixed at
2:34 to remind everyone of the infamous act.  It must be said that many visitors
to Kalavrita today are German citizens who come to show their shame of the Nazi
action.<BR></P>
<P>In closing, I would be remiss if I did not mention the hotel and food
service in the little hotel &quot;Romantzo&quot; in Zahlorou.  This hotel would
be hard pressed to gain a Michelin listing of even the minimum.  It had only
five or six rooms, a bit threadbare, but perfectly clean.  Our room, with
balcony, would have allowed us to drop a water balloon on the train roof had we
wished.  The view of the station was prima -- and that was important.  The open
air library and dining room of the hotel was seven paces across the track from 
the front door and close to the river.  The food was the best that we had on our
two week Greek tour and on  the cruise ship that followed.  Admittedly, not as
fancy, but the hotel owner/waiter and his wife and  mother served food, plain,
but to die for.  We also had  help-yourself service from the freezer and bar. 
Both  of us would urge any railfan or just people searching for beauty and
tranquillity, if in or near Greece, to consider a visit to this wonderful area. 
It was a bit expensive however.  Our stay of two nights, with all our meals and
service included, was a drachma or two over $52.00.   &#164; <BR></P>

<P><!--On the Rhone Part 1 by M. Johnston--><BR></P>
<P>To a winemaker, professional or amateur, the tart, yeasty aroma of freshly
crushed fermenting grapes in the crisp autumn air is one of life&#146;s supreme
delights.  And there are few places in the world where the eager enophile can
savor this experience in greater measure than in the tiny village of
Chateauneuf-du-Pape at grape harvest time.
<BR></P>
<P>	&#147;Like a pastry freak in the world&#146;s largest bakery,&#148; I
suggested to my wife as we strolled leisurely past a  succession of street-front
wineries toward the town square. 	&#147;Or a 5-year-old loose in F. A. O.
Schwartz,&#148; she replied, as Small Son ran his toy racing car along the
pitted stone walls behind which fermenting grapes gurgled contentedly in
concrete cells.
<BR>	&#147;Just think, Son&#151;some of the best wines in the world are made
right here.&#148; 	Arne looked up at me with big eyes. <BR> &#147;Are they
better than yours?&#148;<BR> &#147;Well....&#148; 	&#147;They&#146;re
different,&#148; my wife explained. 	&#147;Right.  And we&#146;re here to find
out what makes them different, so maybe we can&#151;&#148;<BR>&#147;Look at
that big tractor!&#148; Arne pointed as another wagonload of grapes from a
nearby vineyard was  towed through the arched entrance of a winery just ahead of
us.  &#147;Daddy, what&#146;s French for &#145;tractor&#146;?&#148; 	<BR>&#147;Uh....&#148;
reaching for the well-thumbed Larousse in my back pocket. 	<BR>&#147;<I>Tracteur</I>,&#148;
my wife supplied, and Arne echoed &#147;Trac-TOOR!&#148; 
</P>
<P>We reached the wide port where the tractor had entered.  Inside the spacious
room, two men in tanktops were lifting a metal lid from a raised portion of the
stone floor.  	&#147;They&#146;re going to dump the grapes into  that big hole,&#148;
I pointed.  &#147;Stems and all, notice -- remember the big machine they used in
Bordeaux to take the stems off?&#148; 	<BR>&#147;What&#146;s French for &#145;stem&#146;?&#148;
Arne wanted to know as the pulpy, purple mass was shoveled into the gaping hole.
	<BR>&#147;Stem...&#148; flipping through pages of Larousse. 	<BR>&#147;<I>Tige</I>,&#148;
Emily replied. 	<BR>&#147;Right.  They leave the tiges on here to add character
and tannin.&#148; 	<BR>&#147;Some of those grapes are white,&#148; Emily noted.
&#147;Or are they just unripe?&#148; 	<BR>&#147;Good question.  We&#146;ll have
to ask the Brunels.&#148; 	<BR>&#147;Speaking of whom,&#148; looking at her
watch, &#147;we told them we&#146;d arrive by four, and it&#146;s already half
past.  We&#146;d better start looking for their house.&#148; 	<BR>&#147;I guess
so.&#148;  A last deep breath. &#147;Boy, does that smell good.  Take a whiff of
that, Arne.&#148; 	Small Son tried valiantly, but produced only a muffled
wheeze. &#147;I can&#146;t smell anything.  My nose is full of gunk.&#148;  He
frowned, &#147;What&#146;s French for &#145;gunk&#146;?&#148; 	Emily produced a
Kleenex.  &#147;Blow.&#148;<BR></P>
<P><B>Anne and Andre Brunel are the proprietors of the Cailloux vineyards of
Chateauneuf-du-Pape.</B>  They were among a half-dozen vineyard owners from the
major wine-producing districts of France who had responded to our inquiries
about the possibility of a working visit during the Fall harvest.  We planned a
three-week tour of the wine country, and it was our hope to spend a week or so
learning what we could about local vineyard management and winemaking
techniques.  
<BR></P>
<P>Our interest went back several years, during which we had stocked a fairly
respectable cellar, made our own wine from local grapes, and were now starting a
small vineyard in northern Maryland.  We knew that harvest time was a busy one
in these areas, which would leave little time for social amenities.  But we 
hoped that by offering to help with the picking of the grapes, we would have an
opportunity to learn first hand while being useful instead of just in the way. 
We made it clear in our inquiries that we did not expect to be paid for our help
(local pickers can earn decent wages by being in the right place at the right
time during the harvest), although some assistance with accommodations would be
appreciated.  Most of the people we wrote to replied and expressed interest in
the arrangement.  The Brunels&#146; response had been the most cordial, and
that, combined with our long-standing fondness for Rhone wines, was the reason
for our choice. 
<BR></P>
<P>Unlike Bordeaux, where the winery, vineyard and owner&#146;s residence are
frequently part of the same  complex called a chateau, the facilities in
Burgundy and Rhone are often widely separated.  In Chateauneuf-du-Pape, the
vineyards are distributed over a wide area surrounding the town, but the
harvested grapes are brought into town to the cuveries&#151;garage-size
buildings with crushers and presses&#151;for processing.  Most of the owners
live elsewhere in the village, or in neighboring towns like Orange and Avignon.

<BR></P>
<P>We found the Brunels&#146; residence from the directions they had sent&#151;one
of several three-story row houses a block from the square.  The houses are
mostly stone or stucco, with shuttered windows, heavy doors, and an occasional
wrought-iron balustraded balcony lined with flower pots.   A number of cars were
parked  with two wheels up on the narrow sidewalk which separates the house
fronts from the steep, winding  street.  A tawny cat was sitting in one of the
open doorways, washing a white paw, and a spotted basset hound was sprawled
asleep at the base of a wide set of concrete steps snaking up between two
buildings. 
<BR></P>
<P>The Brunels had not yet returned from the day&#146;s activities in their
vineyard.  We tacked a note on their  door and, leaving our rented car half on
the sidewalk with the others, strolled back down to the town square to wait.  We
called it a &#145;square&#146;, since most French towns we had visited were
situated around a plot  of ground in the centre ville with a fountain or an
arrangement of colorful flowers.  The square in Chateauneuf-du-Pape is little
more than an intersection of five narrow roads, with a tree-shaded fountain  off
to one side and a cafe/bar with a cluster of outdoor tables across the street. 
A tourist information center (no English), hotel, and bakery were situated on
the other corners.  We sat at one of the tables at  the cafe and ordered a
carafe of the local white and a Coke for Arne.<BR></P>
<P><B>The major entertainment of the town quickly became apparent.</B>  The
amount of traffic which surges  through the square defies reality; huge trucks,
tractors and tourist buses, many seemingly wider than the streets themselves,
all descend upon the tiny intersection and somehow manage to emerge unscathed on
 the opposite side.  There are no traffic lights&#151;only a few white stripes
painted on the crosswalks.  Add to this a steady parade of pedestrians, animals,
bicycles and mopeds, and the real wonder is that there aren&#146;t any
accidents.  Not even a close call.<BR></P>
<P>The square became even more lively near six o&#146;clock as the rest of the
town&#146;s population began returning  from the vineyards.  Our hosts were
among them, and had no trouble picking us out of the crowd. 	</P>
<P>&#147;You&#146;re dressed for travel,&#148; Anne Brunel told us after
introductions, &#147;and everyone else is dressed for  work.&#148;  Anne and
Andre Brunel complement each other perfectly. She is animated and talkative, and
he is quiet  and reserved.  Both are young and attractive&#151;Anne is slim,
freckled, with reddish hair usually bound up  under a silk head scarf; Andre is
blond and sturdy in a James Dean sort of way, a resemblance enhanced  by jeans,
boots and a cowboy hat.  Both speak excellent English. 
<BR></P>
<P>Our welcome was warm but necessarily brief&#151;work still remained to be
done transferring the last load of  grapes to the fermentation tanks.  Andre
excused himself to see to this task while Anne escorted us to a  charming
two-story stucco house on a cul-de-sac a few blocks away, the residence of Andre&#146;s
parents  where we would be staying during our visit.  In spite of its proximity
to the town square, the setting here was tranquil and quiet, with no sign of
traffic.    Across the road a green blanket of vines sloped gently outward
toward a range of low hills, behind which  lay the Rhone River.  In the other
direction, a patchwork of red barrel-tile roofs could be seen clustered  around
the base of a steep hill.  The top of the hill was dominated by the towering
shell of the Pope&#146;s  Castle, after which the town is named.  Only two
ancient and crumbling walls remain, but they are still a  vivid reminder of the
vast scale on which the 14th-century Roman inhabitants of this region thought
and built. 
<BR></P>
<P>We were to occupy the ground floor of the house; Andre&#146;s parents live
upstairs.  Inside we found a  comfortable bedroom with twin beds and a floor
mattress for Arne.  A large picture window with heavy wooden shutters provided a
scenic view of the vineyards and hills.  Next to the bedroom was a bathroom
without a bidet (&#147;A shame,&#148; Emily remarked. &#147;No place to soak
tired feet.&#148;), and across the hall was a kitchen with fridge, stove, dishes
and silverware.  The rest of the downstairs was essentially a storeroom,  and
contained a very welcome washing machine. 
<BR></P>
<P>Outside, a wide gravel driveway separated the house from a tree-lined garden
of roses, yellow daisies,  begonias and potted geraniums, all in full bloom. 
Arne immediately busied himself creating roads and hills in the driveway pebbles
for his travel toys, while Anne filled Emily and me in on life in Chateauneuf-
du-Pape. 	<BR>&#147;It isn&#146;t always this hectic,&#148; she assured us,
removing the scarf from her head, &#147;only during the  vendage, when all the
grapes must be picked within the specified period of time.&#148; 	<BR>&#147;Specified?&#148;
	<BR>&#147;By law.  Regulations here are very strict, to protect the reputation
of our wines.  For example, one cannot  begin picking before the authorized date
without specific written permission.  Only certain kinds of grapes can be grown
in our vineyards, and the boundaries are strictly defined.&#148; 	<BR>&#147;I
know that your wine is normally a blend of a lot of different varieties.  Is
there any regulation on the  proportions used?&#148; 	<BR>She shook her head. &#147;That
is strictly up to the individual, as long as the grapes are among the 13 
recognized varieties.  But usually it is simply a matter of what kind of grapes
happen to be growing in a particular vineyard&#151;the owner will use it all
anyway, as long as it doesn&#146;t exceed the allowed maximum.&#148;       
<BR>&#147;That&#146;s regulated too?&#148; 	&#147;Oh yes.  Forty-four
hectoliters per hectare.  That&#146;s ... let&#146;s see, less than 400 gallons
per acre.&#148; 
<BR>	&#147;When did the harvest officially begin this year?&#148; Emily asked
as she unpacked our suitcases on the bed.  	<BR>&#147;We started over a week
ago.  There&#146;s another week or so of work left to be done.&#148; 	<BR>&#147;And
how does the quality look this year?&#148;  	<BR>&#147;Very good.  The weather
has been hot and the alcohol will average well over 13%.  But because of very
bad weather last spring the harvest will be small.&#148; 	<BR>There go the
prices again, I thought. 	<BR>Anne looked at her watch. &#147;I must get back. 
When do you plan to join us for the picking?&#148;  	<BR>&#147;Right away,&#148;
I said.  &#147;I&#146;ll go with you tomorrow morning while Emily does some
shopping, then she&#146;ll  join us.&#148; 	<BR>&#147;Fine.  We work from 7:30
to 11:30, then resume from two till six.&#148;  	<BR>&#147;I think I&#146;m
beginning to appreciate the long lunch hours here in France,&#148; I told her. 
<BR>She grinned. &#147;You&#146;ll appreciate them even more after you&#146;ve
spent four hours stooping to pick grapes.&#148;  She gathered her gloves, scarf
and shears.  &#147;We leave from in front of our winery, just up the block on
the main street into town.  Meet me there at 7:15.&#148;  &#164;

<H2>Venice: Views and Venues</H2>
<P><I>by Nathalie Zeidman</I></P>
<P><BR></P>
<P><B>Years ago I was standing in a crowded vaporetto</B> chugging along
Venice's Grand Canal when a young American near me pointed to a deteriorating
palazzo and said loud enough for everyone to hear:   &quot;Back home we'd call
that a slum.&quot; To this day I regret not telling him off.  &quot;Sure,&quot;
I might have said, &quot;Venice's marble palazzos need  cleaning, repairing and
propping up.  They've been around for centuries, providing home base to more
than a few interesting people:  Marco Polo, Othello and his crew; Byron,
Browning and Ruskin; Peggy Guggenheim.&quot;  And I envy them all, I might have
added, though I'm not sure I'd want to live here year-round; with winds off the
Adriatic, winters are cold and damp, summers humid and mosquito infested. 
Spring and fall are ideal.  I prefer fall and that's when I usually go to
Venice.<BR></P>
<P>No matter how often I've been there, like all tourists, I head straight for
St. Mark's.  It's reassuring to find every landmark on the Square in place: the
Renaissance Doge's Palace, the celebrated Bridge of Sighs, the Prison (Casanova
slept here); the simple Campanile and elaborate Clock towers; dazzling St.
Mark's Basilica itself.  The church's rooftop statues, in particular the larger
than life gilded bronze horses, are standouts among golden spires and Byzantine
domes.  I love those horses as much for their history as for their massive
grace.  Created in 4th Century  B.C. Greece, they were liberated almost a 1000
years later by Emperor Constantine and brought to the Byzantium he conquered and
renamed for himself.  In the 13th century the horses were again liberated -- by
the crusaders this time -- and carted of f to Venice, where they have been
sitting on the portico's roof ever since.  (Today the portico horses are a
reasonable facsimile -- the original was moved several decades ago to the
Basilica's museum.)    If the exterior of St. Mark's Basilica dazzles, the
interior overwhelms with decorative marble,  porphyry, mosaics depicting scenes
from the New Testament and a gold altar piece enameled and bejeweled in
Constantinople a millennium ago.  But all this imported art doesn't deflect from
Venice's native artists; Tintoretto, for one. Il Scuelo di San Rocco, a gorgeous
Renaissance building with Baroque woodwork, showcases a series of 56 canvases by
the master.  Other Tintorettos are in the churches of Santa Maria della Salute
and San Georgio.  The Franciscan Gothic Santa Maria dei Fran, largest church in
Venice, has a number of Titians and a Bellini Madonna.<BR></P>
<P>Another collection is housed in a former convent-church, now the Academia
Delle Belle Arti.  Okay -- the Academy of Fine Arts.  I have a penchant for
using Italian names; I love the language even in my fractured phrasing.  I'll
seize any opportunity to say,  &quot;Bon journo,&quot; &quot;Scusi,&quot; &quot;Palazzo
Rezzonico.&quot;  I'm crazy about the Palazzo Rezzonico not so much for its
elegant Venetian Baroque furniture as for the view from its balcony of the Grand
Canal and aging palazzos.  I'm fond of Peggy Guggenheim's palace just because it
is a palace, a palace a rich American bought and lived in surrounded by her
collection of modern and contemporary art.  Tintorettos and Canelettos
notwithstanding, the masterpiece of the Adriatic is Venice herself, all 117
Islands, 150 canals and 400 bridges.  To detour along a ribbon of canal shaded
by a row of modest palazzos and suddenly find myself in a sun-drenched square
with tables and chairs, potted plants, and a menu posted on the wall is to come
upon an unexpected treasure.  After six visits I still can't speak Italian but I
can eat it &quot;Con gusto.&quot;  I can hardly go wrong with a plate of recis e
bisi, a bowl of risotto, a platter of frito misto, a glass of wine. 
Valpolicella or Soave will do nicely.<BR></P>
<P>When I've eaten too well several days in a row I like to take lunch at the
outdoor market at the foot of the Grand Canal's famed Rialto Bridge.  Crowded
with shops and shoppers, the bridge, as old as The Merchant of Venice, curves
high enough to allow an armed galley to pass under.  At the bottom of the Rialto
steps large carts filled with produce and cheese from the country and  local
pastas do a thriving business.  In the fall pears from Lombardy and grapes from
the Po are bountiful and pyramids of flame, celedon and jet tilt the carts
precariously.  Along with fruit I like chunks of assorted cheeses and a. half
kilo of pasta pudding studded with citron.  Although there are benches at the
Rialto boat landing I prefer to enjoy my snack sitting on the stone steps.  It's
a good place to follow the canal traffic.  Families coming to the market by
motor boat, gondola or vaporetto get off empty-handed, and back on with string
bags bulging.  Concessionaires deliver wholesale quantities of food;  I once saw
a motor boat with nothing but crates of live pigeons.<BR></P>
<P>On a warm day I like to board vaporetto no.6 from St. Mark's to the Lido, a
resort island in the  Venetian lagoon.  No longer the haunt of the literati, the
Lido still attracts visitors.  Several smart beach-front hotels rent cabanas to
sun-deprived northern Europeans, and a public casino, nothing as snooty as Monte
Carlo's, offers &quot;the big chance.&quot;  A walk on the sand, lunch on the
terrace of the Hotel des Bains are all I need to be reminded of one of my
favorite novellas, <I>Death in Venice</I>.<BR></P>
<P>On the other side of the lagoon lie three other islands dear to me:  Murano,
Burano and  Torcello.  At least once on every visit I must go to all three. 
Getting there is half the fun.  At the back of St. Mark's Square, among the
souvenir shops, cafes and money exchanges is a modest arch.  Through the arch a
mysterious passageway winds along a canal one could almost leap  across, and
passes dark palazzos converted to apartments like so many on the Grand Canal. 
Turning a corner I always expect to stumble on a masked figure or two left over
from carnival.  Instead I'm in the open at a long strip of dock, the Fondamente
Nuove.  Vaporettos leave from here every half hour, give or take, for the
islands.<BR></P>
<P>Murano, the largest of the three, is famous for its blown glass.  Colors and
shapes can be  exquisite or, as in recent years, garish.  My soul isn't mated to
Disney monsters in startling hues, and the more conventional pieces are
expensive, but I enjoy watching the craftsmen at work, blowing bubbles that may
last forever.  Another ten-minute steamer ride and I'm in Burano, a fishing
village known for its lace. Venetian lace, in my grandmother's day called &quot;Pointe
Venise&quot;, is celebrated so I spend a little time at the stalls.  Just
looking -- some of what's sold in Burano, I've heard, is made in China.  One
would have to be an expert to tell the difference.<BR></P>
<P>Mainly what I like to do on Burano is walk the narrow streets, look at the
small cottages in shades of henna, blue and gold and greet the women and
children:  &quot;Bon journo, signorina; bon journo, bambini.&quot;<BR></P>
<P>Two steamer whistles and a chug-a-lug bring me from Burano to Torcello.  I
spend most of my  day in Torcello.  There is no industry here.  The village
square is overgrown with grass and both  the church and the cathedral, each
dating from at least the 11th century, are in disrepair.  But the cathedral's
Byzantine mosaics, jeweled portraits of the Madonna and The Last Judgment are 
exceptional.  What I like best about Torcello besides its mosaics is the Locanda
Ciprini.  Set in a  grape arbor, this locanda or country inn looks out upon the
sea,   How relaxing it is to idle along  an arbor path, circle the locanda and
wind up at one of the little wrought iron tables for a  Campari and soda.  After
a while I'm ready to move to a properly set dinner table.  At the Locanda
Cipriani my soup, salad and dessert may vary.  As long as I start my meal with
gnocchi, tiny potato or semolina dumplings in a light sauce, I'm happy.  The
Locanda's gnocchi is as  delicate as Burano lace, as light as Murano glass.  Do
I exaggerate?  Ask some people who come to Torcello just to eat that gnocchi.<BR></P>
<P>The Locanda Cipriani is well patronized yet I always feel my little party is
the only party in the  arbor.  No doubt this sense of privacy accounts for
Hemingway having spent days there at work at one novel or another. The family
that owns Torcello's Locando owns Harry's New York Bar and the new Hotel
Cipriani, both beyond my means.  The Locanda is not and I've thought of spending
a night or two in one of its feather-bedded rooms.  But grape arbors and
seaviews notwithstanding, in Venice I like my breakfast coffee and rolls in
front of a window that overlooks a canal, a bridge, a palazzo.  If that Venice
scene is a slum, I'll take it anytime.  &#164;

<HR>
<P><B>Getting There:</B> Alitalia flies from key North American cities to
Venice via Rome.  From the Marco Polo Airport, boats take visitors to a terminal
near the Piazza san Marco, and from there a vaporetto will take you to your
hotel (or close to it).  Travel lightly when coming to Venice to save the hassle
and expense of porters.  Many international <B>trains</B> arrive at Venice,
including night trains from Paris, Brussels, Vienna, and Budapest; refer to the
Thomas Cook European Timetable for timings.  (When you're looking it up,
remember that within the European rail system, Venice is referred to as &quot;Venezia.&quot;)
 Trains may stop at Venezia Mestre, an inland station, at Venezia SMN (the main
station), or both; if the former, you must disembark and board a local train for
the short ride to Venice &quot;proper&quot;.  If you're <B>driving</B>, you'll
have to leave your car at a carpark on the mainland.  Spaces are limited and can
be costly in high season; if you're staying long, you may save by leaving your
vehicle with a garage in Vicenza or Padua and buying a 2nd class rail ticket to
Venice.<BR></P>
<P><B>Staying There:</B>  Venice has a great variety of hotels, from the
fabulous (and fabulously expensive) to small, economical pensiones.  Hotel rates
in Venice are much affected by season: if you want to go during the famous
Carnival (takes place in early spring), reserve far in advance and be prepared
to pay.  Take care when you see a terrific hotel deal &quot;in Venice&quot; that
it's not located in Venice Mestre, the city's relatively unattractive, and quite
canal-less, mainland suburb.

<H2>The Visit of the Northern Counts</H2>
<P><B><I>An 18th-Century Extravaganza Is Planned for the Venetian Carnival</I></B><BR></P>
<P><B>Been there, you say?  Done that?</B>  If you're looking for something
very unsual -- and you've been stuffing it away in the old mattress -- you'll be
interested in a unique and spectacular tourism event being planned for next
year's Venetian Carnival by Hello America, a tour operator based in California. 
Casting travelers themselves as both audience and costumed, choreographed
participants, the company will orchestrate the re-enactment of an actual event
which took place in 1782, the historic visit of Nicholas Petrovic (heir to the
Russian throne and son of Catherine the Great) to the high and mighty nobles of
the opulent, powerful Republic of Venice.  The Tzarevich was accompanied by his
wife Maria Feodorvna, her brother Prince Frederick von Wurttemberg, and a large
retinue of nobles and courtiers. Venice greeted the wealthy &quot;Northern
Counts&quot; with all the pomp and grandiose splendor for which the time and
place were deservedly noted.<BR></P>
<P>Participants may choose their own roles in advance, selecting from a long
list of specific historic individuals including not only the royalty, nobles and
dignitaries of the Russian court and retinue, but also exotic ambassadors from
the many countries which paid court to the Republic of Venice at that time. The
Venetian nobility will be represented by authentic descendents of local noblemen
and noblewomen, and the many receptions, balls, and banquets that marked the
18th-century extravaganza will be played out over a seven-day period in some of
Venice's most beautiful and historic private palaces.<BR></P>
<P>This elaborate, breathtakingly deluxe program includes lodging in the most
refined hotels that Venice has to offer, including the Hotel Gritti, the Luna
Baglioni, the Bauer Grunwald, and the Monaco &amp; Grand Canal.  Catering will
be in the hands of world famous companies such as Dino Boscarato and Harry's Bar
and will represent the very best of Venetian cuisine.  All participants will be
fitted with Domino cloaks, &quot;Bauta&quot; masks, and &quot;Zendalo&quot;
veils, along with authentic period costumes of precious brocades, silks, laces
and gold embroidery; the costumes are designed and provided by Stefano Nicolao,
the famous Oscar nominated designer of the film Farinelli.  (We are not talking
paper hats for dinner at &quot;Medieval Times&quot; -- according to the
organizer, individual costumes range in value as high as $12,000.)  Prior to re
enactments the participants will receive instruction on court etiquette by a
professional Master of Ceremonies, and lessons in 18th century dances by
professional choreographers.  The program will also feature appearances from
prominent Venetian personalities and writers, and for at least one dinner a
private orchestra is hired.  Some events will be filmed with copies available at
the close of the week.<BR></P>
<P>As one might expect such an extravagant experience does not come cheap. 
Costs depend on the importance of the personality one chooses to portray, and
range from $33,500 to portray Maharani, wife of the Indian Maharajah, to $57,000
for the haughty soul who chooses to be Tzarevich Nicholas Petrovic himself. 
(Reflecting the elaborate nature of the production, the costlier and more
prominent roles include six extra nights in Venice &quot;for necessary
rehearsals with our choreographer.&quot;) <BR> </P>

<H2>Fabulous Wimbledon</H2>
<P><I>By Walker Jackson</I><BR></P>
<P><B>Walker Joe, you backpacked to the Wimbledon Tournament?</B> Yes!  Not
once, but four straight years starting in 1989. Why would anyone backpack to
Wimbledon?  To get the fabulous reserved tickets the All England Tennis Club
saves for the public; to save money; and to enjoy the challenge.  The tickets
are limited;  if you want a regularly priced ticket, you have to line up (or
queue) by eight the night before and sleep there. Otherwise, a Centre Court or
Court 1 ticket, where the best players are scheduled to play, can cost $200 if
bought from a scalper. 
<BR></P>
<P>I've enjoyed twenty fabulous days at Wimbledon and, if I had to pick one day
to tell about, it would be the second Thursday in 1991. Why?  I got to sleep in
a soft, warm bed the night before, after three nights on Somerset Road; take a
lovely hot shower, eat a sumptuous breakfast, and purchase an unbelievable
ticket at a ridiculously cheap price.  Only a tight wad would enjoy sleeping on
a road?  Well... I resemble that remark.<BR></P>
<P>The day, July 4,  1991, started at my bed and breakfast.  The night had been
strangely quiet: no fireworks.  Mrs. Jackie Dodd -- you knew she was Irish the
moment she smiled -- served me  orange juice, coffee, eggs, bacon, toast, jam,
and I paid her &#163;22 ($38) for the amenities.  Wimbledon's ticket windows
would be open at 10:30, and I wanted one more shot at getting a ticket. I had no
idea what to expect.  &quot;Wimbledon is like a box of cho-co-lates.&quot;<BR></P>
<P>After thanking Mrs. Dodd, I sprang to my feet, hoisted my backpack, and was
off to the kingdom of tennis one more time.  The 4th was a gorgeous day, and I
walked and whistled. Blue skies and the sun were smiling back at me. Wimbledon
had been marvelously different this year due to the incessant rains of the first
week  (Rain delays caused more tennis to be played on courts each day to catch
up).  I walked briskly for twenty minutes to reach the `Wimbledon Special,' a
double-decker bus near Southfield Station, where London fans leave the train. 
The fare was 40 pence (70 cents) and there were only a few passengers on board.
This was an encouraging sign.  No queue materialized along Church Road as the
bus headed for the `Big W,' and my insides churned with excitement, realizing I
might luck out and get an excellent ticket to view some spectacular tennis
action. Bringing along my rabbit foot and four-leaf clover was paying off.<BR></P>
<P>Reaching the ticket gate I asked the pretty lady, &quot;Got any tickets,
luv?'&quot;   &quot;Yes, sir, we have Court 1 tickets for &#163;18 ($30),&quot;
she replied with a friendly smile.  &quot;Who's playing, luv?&quot;   &quot;The
first match is Edberg against Champion followed by Becker and Forget,&quot; she
replied in an anxious manner. A line was forming.  I couldn't believe my ears. 
She was offering a ticket to watch the No.1 and 2 seeds play the French
connection, in a quarter-final match, for a measly $30.  These Quarter- final
matches are normally played on Wednesday and the price would have been $55.  
Furthermore, I would've had to queue all night to get it.  My luck was
wonderful, but uncanny.  I knew for sure Somebody up there was watching over me.
Without hesitation, I passed the price of the ticket to the patient lady and was
off to Left Luggage to park my backpack.<BR></P>
<P>Play was scheduled to start at noon, two hours earlier than usual.  There
was little time to dilly-dally about, so I headed for Gangway 4 in the southwest
corner.  I reached Row U, Seat 012, after a 10-minute journey.  I could have
made it in about seven minutes, but I detoured by the Long Bar for a pint of
bitters.  (Man does not live by tennis alone.)  I brought the pint along in a
tall cup, being careful not to spill a drop.  The seat was one tier up, a great
location with a grassy view.  A party of middle-aged English ladies were to my
right, and on my left were Kaye and Roger Bacon from Houston, Texas.  I never go
anywhere that I don't run into a few saddle whipped Texans.  The English ladies
played tennis regularly at their club;  Kaye was a player too and she was
excited.  This was her first Wimbledon.  They had been very lucky to get these
seats, but were unaware of this fact.<BR></P>
<P>Roger was a golfer, and he looked more link-whipped than saddle-whipped.  He
had knocked himself out playing golf in Scotland, where the couple had visited
before coming to London.  Roger was so excited, he napped frequently.   The roar
of the crowd, welcoming Stefan Edberg and Thierry Champion, woke Mr. Bacon and
he managed to stay awake until the warm-up was over.  Edberg served and volleyed
brilliantly to take the first two sets, but in the third set, the momentum
shifted to Champion.  Champion hung tough and was leading 5-4. He had won the
first two points of Edberg's serve, when `the machine' opened his throttle and
won three games in a row, dashing the Frenchman's hopes.  Scores were 6-3, 6-2,
and 7-5. Edberg played some solid tennis.  So, what's new.  It's Stefan's
consistency coupled with his intense desire that makes him the great champion he
is.  Mr. Cool seldom beats himself.  (He's hanging it up after 1996.  I'm
saddened.)<BR></P>
<P>Boris `Red' Becker and Guy `Peacock' Forget, another Frenchman, whom I'd
never seen play, entered the arena, took chairs separated by the tall chair,
selected weapons, and started their warm-up. Shortly, the umpire shouted play,
and the game began.  `Red' was lucky the `Peacock' didn't strut all over his
posterior.  Forget had many chances to get on top and stay there, but he kept
choking on the critical points.  Who better than I knew how he felt?  Guy played
brilliantly, except for about three points and that was enough for his downfall.
Four times in the tantalizing fourth set tie-break, Forget had a chance to take
the match to a fifth set, but could not convert .  . not once. I believe Becker
was pulled from the jaws of the whale many times by divine guidance.  I'd
cheered very hard for the Frenchman and felt that Forget let me down. He should
have won the match. The scores were 6-7, 7-6, 6-2, 7-6. Such a super match with
the wrong outcome.  I do not dislike Becker, who, for some reason, I want to
call `Red.'  It's my nature to pull for the underdog.<BR></P>
<P>These two quarter-final matches had been sensational and priced right; all
made possible by the many rain delays of the first week. What a great finale to
another fabulous trip. Every chocolate had a nut in it.  &#164;
</P>
<HR>
<P><B>More Information:</B> I have over 40,000 words written describing my
four trips to Wimbledon, and some helpful suggestion about how to do it without
spending your life's savings.  Fabulous Wimbledon for the Hardy is an
interesting and witty account that includes much more than tennis.  For a 3.5&quot;
disk in ASCII format, send a $4 money order to Walker Jackson, 8432 Pine Glen
Road, Sebring, FL  33870.  The Wimbledon area is a charming and safe place with
many friendly pubs and shops. Bed and breakfast places are readily available at
reasonable prices.  London is only a thirty minute ride on the underground
(train), which is convenient and cheap. A backpacker will love the queue and a
day in the grounds.  It's one very exciting place to be during the tournament. 
If you play the game, treat yourself to one Wimbledon. Yes! I figured my 1991
expenses:  Airline ticket $670 purchased several months in advance, during an
airline price war; food $140, 2 bed and breakfast accommodations $75,
transportation $40, 1 Centre Court ticket and 3 Court 1 tickets $170,
entertainment and miscellaneous $85. Are four fabulous days at Wimbledon worth
$1180? Does the sun shine in Florida?<BR></P>
<P><I>Walker Jackson,  retired engineer and avid  tennis player, is planing
his next Wimbledon for his 100th birthday -- or maybe a bit sooner.</I>

<H2>My Favorite English Pubs</H2>
<P><I>By Andrew J. Gnoza</I><BR></P>
<P>My wife and I enjoy staying in out of the way places when we travel.   On a
spring 1996 trip to England we opted to overnight at country pubs.  We did our
sightseeing of cities by day and off to the country for meals, grog and bedding.
 Pubs offer you the luxury of parking your car for the day, taking a stroll
before dinner, having a few pints, eating, having a nightcap and going to bed
all in one place at very economical prices.    Some of our pubs were really
tough to find and a good Ordnance map of the area you are in will help you
immensely in finding these jewels.  One pub owner told us that we were the third
set of Americans to find his pub in the 17 years he has owned it. <BR> </P>
<P>Which pubs to stay at?  We purchased several pub guides here in the states
before we left to locate places we thought would be nice to stay at.  Do your
self a favor and wait to you get to England to buy your tour guide books.  We
found the 1995 edition of one Pub Guide at a large book retailer the day we left
and bought it.  In England the 1996 version was on the shelf.  Do your research
at home using library books and maps, buy your books over there.  There is also
a wealth of information for travelers on the internet, both in new groups and
world wide web pages.    
<BR></P>
<P>We started our trip by visiting friends in Canterbury, Kent and traveled to
some quaint villages and towns, our favorite being Sandwich.  Our favorite pub
in this area was the Duke William Inn located in the village of Ickham, near
Littlebourne, Telephone 01227-721308..  The solarium dining area was bright and
warm and we enjoyed delicious steak and kidney pies for lunch.  Excellent bar
and food can be found at this pub.  However no over night accommodations are
available.   
<BR></P>
<P>Leaving Canterbury our next overnight stay took us to The Hurdlemakers, East
Dean, Chichester, West Sussex, telephone 01243-811318.  A warm and friendly
welcome awaits you as you enter this pub.  The Hurdlemakers captures the
atmosphere of an old village pub where you can relax over a pint or choose
something from their extensive menu.  The accommodations are provided in a
separate building -- the sheep stables that have been converted into three
separate bedrooms.  The main sitting area also serves as a TV room and breakfast
eating area for overnight guests. 
<BR></P>
<P>Another stop for just food, no accommodations, took us to The Sailor's
Return in East Chaldon, Dorchester, telephone 01305-853847.  The views over the
rolling hills along with the excellent home cooked meals is reason enough to
track down this establishment.  Originally an 18th century thatched roof
cottage, it has been enlarged to include a beautiful bar and dining room.   
<BR></P>
<P>Off to Coleford, Crediton, Devon to The New Inn, telephone 01363-85044.  
This 13th century thatched roof inn sits on the banks of the Cole River.  Out in
the middle of no where this quaint pub offers overnight lodging in newly
refinished bedrooms.  Excellent food at this stop, a must if you are in the
area. 
<BR></P>
<P>For those times we were sightseeing in the cities our all time favorite city
pub was The Wykeham Arms at 75 Kingsgate Street in Winchester, Hampshire,
telephone 01962-853834.  Located behind Winchester Cathedral this public house
was built in 1755 and renovated by the new owners to include excellent overnight
accommodations.  The pub is very traditional serving real ales and excellent pub
grub.  There were three roaring fires going the rainy day we went in for lunch. 
A friendly crowd and no rush to get you out of there.  Excellent pub grub for
lunch.   
<BR></P>
<P>The Rose and Crown Country Inn and Restaurant ( fancy name for a pub ) is
another favorite spot of ours.  Located in Woodhill, Stoke St. Gregory, Taunton,
Somerset, telephone 01823-490296.  This gem is located in an area for nature
walks, bird watching and visiting the local basket makers village.  Fresh meat
and vegetables from local farms and large portions of food are the things that
bring people back to this pub.  The pork chops were the best I have ever eaten!<BR>
</P>
<P>Overnight accommodations are available in the 17th century pub building or
in Sedgemoor Cottage, a restored 250 year old cottage next door.  The cottage is
also available for families year round for self catering holidays. 
<BR></P>
<P>The Fishermans Cot is the one country hotel we stayed in this year.  Located
on the banks of the River Exe, next to the 14th century Bickleigh Bridge in
Bickleigh, Tiverton, Devon, telephone 0884-855237.  The ideal touring base for
north and south  Devon coasts, Exmoor and Dartmoor.  The local town of Tiverton
and Exeter City Centre are a few minutes drive away.  The accommodations are
very comfortable, all have bathrooms en-suite, excellent pub and dining area and
of course a full English breakfast is provided.  This hotel is one of the nicest
county settings we have ever found.  Hope to see you in England.  Go during low
season from November 1st to March 31st and you'll have the entire country to
yourself.   It's another reason to buy some fine sweaters from England and
Scotland.   &#164;

<H2>Paris <I>on the Cheap</I></H2>
<P><BR><I>by Susan Milligan</I></P>
<P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">Yes, It Can Still Be Done -- If You're Very
Very Careful</FONT></I></B>
<BR>
<B>Paris. Glorious, romantic, inspiring.</B>  But why should it cost you? 
Never known as one of Europe's big bargains, Paris is pricier than ever, so
expensive that the tourist thinks he is making a mathematical error when
calculating French francs to the dollars, deutchmarks or schillings he brought
for the trip. No, that's not a mistake: it really is $3.00 for a can of Coke
sold outside the Eiffel Tower.  Worse, it seems everything costs, wherever you
go. Museums charge as much as Ff40 (eight bucks) to get in, hardly a price meant
to accommodate the starving artist. Le Metro costs about $1.75  for one ride
(though less if you buy a pack of tickets or a day pass).  There are no free
bathroom facilities, it seems, anywhere.  But Paris can be done on a budget.  If
you are very, very careful, you can see Paris on about $75 a day. Here's how to
save:  
<BR></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">Transportation:</FONT> It's hard to get around this
one. You have to get there, after all, and unless you own a private jet - and if
you do, why are you reading this? - you're going to have to pay some airline to
fly you there. Some tips: Take Icelandair, which often has inexpensive flights
to Luxembourg, which is not too far from Paris. If you can a cheap flight to
London, grab it&#151;then go overland to Paris. 
<BR></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">Lodging:</FONT>  Don't even think about the George V,
or other luxurious accommodations. You're in Paris, a living, breathing museum&#151;what
are you doing spending all that time in your room, anyway?  There are many small
pensions tucked away in Paris that will be much easier on your wallet.  A good
bet is Hotel Studia (51 Blvd. Saint-Germain, 75005 Paris, Tel: 43-26-81-00).  A
single with the bath down the hall is perfectly adequate and inexpensive at
Ff229 (about $45), including breakfast.  It's also in one of the best
neighborhoods in Paris&#151;near St. Michel, the Notre Dame and the Pantheon.  
In another good neighborhood (near the Champs-Elysees) is the two-star Hotel des
Deux Avenues (38 Rue Poncelet, 75017 Paris, Tel: 42-27-44-35 or 47-66-76-71.
Fax: 47-63-95-48). Rates run at Ff220 for a single, and Ff250 for a double.  For
those of you (and you know who you are) who have always wanted to sleep next to
Jim Morrison, there's always the Hotel a la Renaissance, at #28 Blvd.
Menilmontant.  It's just a stone's throw away from the Pere Lachaise Cemetery,
where the rock legend is buried.  Singles with a shower are a paltry Ff150 - 
though the neighborhood is a bit dicey.  Another option is the Hotel Clauzel, at
33 rue des Martyrs. Conveniently located between the Opera and the Sacre Couer, 
Hotel Clauzel offers rooms starting at Ff200.  
<BR></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">Food: </FONT> You've got to eat, and it's not as easy
as it used to be to dine frugally in Paris. Some hints:  get a pension that
serves breakfast, and eat there. Forget any romantic notion of skipping the free
baguette, jam and coffee to have cafe creme on the Left Bank - unless you're
willing to pay as much as $5-6 for the coffee alone.  Don't eat lunch in a
restaurant; instead, get a baguette, cheese, fruit and wine at a grocery&#151;or
a quiche at a bakery&#151;and eat in one of Paris's lovely public parks.  It's
much, much cheaper and more fun as well.  Plus, it's hard to get a bad meal at a
bakery in Paris.  For an afternoon snack, try one of the made-on-the-spot,
filled crepes sold at stands throughout the city.  For dinner, you're best off
staying away from the heavily-touristed areas, and heading to some of Paris's
interesting, but somewhat less trafficked, neighborhoods, such as Les Marais or
the area around Luxembourg Gardens.  <BR></P>
<P>To really save money, don't eat French food. Go ethnic; in Paris, this means
eating Greek, Mexican or Asian food. The restaurants are good quality, but less
expensive that the local cuisine.  Still want to feel like you're actually in
France? Go for the tourist menu - always cheaper than ordering a la carte,
though the menus now rarely include wine.  Some recommendations: Au Clos
Saint-Germain, at 90 Blvd. St.-Germain.  The menu, plus the house wine, is less
than Ff100 (about $20).  Bistrot Beaubourg, on rue de la Reynie, a block away
from the Pompidou Center, offers a decent steak for Ff52, and an absolutely
delicious charlotte chocolat for dessert, for just Ff25.  Troll the area around
Saint Michel, on rue St. Andres des Arts. There are a number of reasonably
priced bistros, and the neighborhood is eclectic.
<BR></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">Shopping:</FONT>  Forget it; you can't afford it. 
But if you want to bring back something French, splurge on some perfume. At
Paris's cut-rate scent shops, it's cheaper than duty-free, and a fraction of the
cost in Budapest, where duties and sales tax make buying perfume a real luxury. 
Two favorites: Parfums de France, 104 Avenue Champs-Elysees (Tel: 42-25-12-97),
and Dany Parfums (13 throughout the city; try the one at 140 Ave. du Gal
Leclerc, near the Orleans m&eacute;tro stop). These places have the best
perfumes and skin care products, for at least 30% off the recommended price. 
For other items, wander the Rue de Rivoli on the Right Bank, or the small
streets off the tony Champs-Elysees.   
<BR></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">Sightseeing:</FONT>  Buy a museum pass; the most
useful one is the three-day, 140-franc option. This gives you free admittance to
dozens of museums and monuments in Paris, including the Arc de Triomphe. It
sounds expensive, but you would be appalled at how quickly those museum tickets
add up. Another benefit: no waiting at the Louvre - you can walk right in, ahead
of all those people forced to wait by the I. M. Pei pyramid.  The museum pass
also takes away the temptation to see the Louvre all in one day&#151;it's too
much for one visit. Go a few times.  Finally, if you have an ATM card, use it in
Paris instead of traveler's checks.  You won't pay a commission, and you'll get
the best rate irrespective of what time of day or night you take out money.<BR></P>
<P>Something you'll want to be doing as seldom as possible.  &#164;</P>
<HR>
<H2><I><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">Paris by Commute</FONT></I></H2>
<P><BR></P>
<P><I>Is your &quot;comfort zone&quot; crying out for first-class lodging&#151;or
at the very least a private bath&#151;but your budget whimpering too?  One way
to live well without central Paris' steep hotel rates, and without enduring its
sometimes cheerless, industrial-grade suburbs, is to ask your travel agent to
move you further out into the Ile de France (the province surrounding Paris). 
The region's excellent transportation network puts you within an easy train ride
of the city's attractions, while you bed down in interesting but less costly
environs.   Some possibilities: 
</I><BR></P>
<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">Marne-la-Val&eacute;e</FONT></B>, home to
EuroDisney, is just ten minutes from Paris' centrally located St-Michel M&eacute;tro
Station via the RER &quot;A&quot; line.  You needn't be interested in Mickey &amp;
Donald &aacute; la Fran&ccedil;ais to take advantage of visitor-hungry,
reasonably priced hotels clustered near the theme park; try the Ibis with
doubles from Ff340 ($71).  
<BR></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><B>Fontainebleau</B></FONT> features the splendid
estate where Louis XIV hung out when Versailles got boring; about 40 minutes
from Paris' Gare du Lyon, with frequent service throughout the day.  The Quality
Hotel la Napoleon, near the royal digs, offers doubles from Ff490 ($102).  
<BR></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><B>Beauvais</B></FONT>, further afield, offers an
historic cathedral and a small-town feel, with the commute to Paris Gare du Nord
just short of 90 minutes.  The longer ride can get you a much shorter hotel
bill, with doubles from around Ff290 ($60).  <BR></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><B>Chartres</B></FONT> makes a wonderful &quot;home
base&quot; because it's such a worthwhile visit in itself; it also has (of
course) a famous cathedral, and you can be at Paris' Gare du Nord in a little
over an hour.  Because Chartres draws so many visitors from Paris, it's also
rich in restaurants &amp; shops.  You'll find doubles in the Ff350 ($73) to
Ff450 ($105) range.  <BR></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><B>Versailles</B></FONT>, which like Marne-la-Val&eacute;e
is on the RER &quot;A&quot; line from St-Michel (but in the other direction), is
perhaps better known for its deluxe hotels than for bargains; but there are a
few exceptions.  Again try the Ibis chain's offering with doubles from Ff370
($77); or the Bellevue Hotel from Ff360 ($75).  Versailles is a lovely little
town for just walking about, and the legendary Palace can easily earn more than
one day's visit.  
<BR></P>

<H1>Report from St. Petersburg</H1>
<P><I>by Bob Koff</I></P>
<HR>
<H2><I>Dancing at the Masquerade Ball</I></H2>
<P><BR></P>
<P>It's been an exciting 24 hours in St. Petersburg, with plenty to reflect on.
 Saturday evening was the Masquerade Ball at Anichkov Palace, held to benefit a
hospice in town. The palace was built in 1741 by Empress Elizabeth for her
lover, and serves as a great party spot for activities such as this.  My wife
Pat and I had gone for our costume fitting a week earlier, at the building which
houses Lenfilms -- once the center of Russian moviemaking, but now in financial
straits like most of the arts in Russia.<BR></P>
<P>We arrrived two hours early for the 9PM party, in order to get our costumes
on and have our hair done by makeup artists.  My Marquis de Sade outfit was
great, and I ended up with a dandy curly grey wig expertly pinned to my head 
The hairdressers were meticulous with those lucky enough to have arrived early,
spending up to thirty minutes per person to achieve just the right look for a
party of nobility.  However, once the line of clients backed up around 8:30 or
so, the emphasis shifted to speed and the five-minute makeover became the rule.<BR></P>
<P>The costumes looked smashing though, and after visiting any number of the
half dozen well-stocked open bars, appearances took on less importance.  It was
a grand way to celebrate, and I was even asked to pose with a few women for a
photo opportunity. I lost a trouser button in the melee and had to visit the
seamstress on call to repair my embarrassing front flap.  I declined to offer an
explanation as to the nature of my loss.<BR></P>
<P>The food and especially the desserts were wonderful, and it was a glimpse
into the lives of those fortunate enough to wander the halls of Czars 200 years
ago. In the half dozen rooms the ball encompassed there was entertainment
ranging from a string quartet with waltzing couples to a pianist and an opera
singer.  Classical music gave way to Russian/American rock around midnight, and
we danced the night away until fatigue overcame desire. After changing back to
our mortal clothes of hiking boots and ski jacket -- and a rabbit-fur hat
purchased recently to deal with the legendary cold -- we walked home along the
Nevsky at 3AM. It's the main drag in town, packed with people shopping for goods
and services during the day, but much quieter at this hour for the 15 minute
walk to our apartment.<BR></P>
<P>Lauren thankfully slept until 7:30 on Sunday, and we felt semi-rested at
least when we rolled out of bed at 8. Our overnight sitter, Maria, joined us for
breakfast, and was out the door for tennis by 9. We decided to try a new museum,
and I called a friend with two little boys who agreed to join us at the
zoological museum.  Peter is a diplomat with the consulate, and his 2- and
8-year-old sons needed some purpose while their mom Linda was visiting sights in
Moscow for the weekend.<BR></P>
<P>We rely on public transportation most of the time to get around, and bundled
up for a non-heated bus ride to the museum in five-degree weather.  We got on
the #7 trolley bus with no problem, and pulled two tickets out of our pocket for
the fare.  Since most Russians have passes, the ticket punch is often
well-hidden, and we didn't have a chance to find it and verify our intentions to
use a ticket; soon a badge-waving bus marshall, overhearing our English and
targeting us as foreigners who didn't know the rules, asked us for our tickets. 
Seeing they hadn't been punched, he demanded a 20,000 Ruble fine (about $4.00),
which is 20 times the fare. But before I could figure out how to say &quot;kiss
off&quot; in Russian, the collective anger of our bus-riding neighbors surfaced.
 Everyone recognized our honorable intentions, and we found we had a dozen new
friends browbeating the marshall with a string of invectives and expletives.  At
the next stop he departed the bus in a huff, having been denied the opportunity
to line his pockets by a crowd no longer willing to accept bureaucratic
bullying. I felt we had just played a microcosmic part in the performance of the
fall of communism.<BR></P>
<P>The museum was a pleasant surprise, with thousands of displays of preserved
animals from all over the world. The mammoths from the frozen lands to the north
were especially interesting, and the adults were as entertained as the kids, who
ran around shouting for our attention to see this 12-foot crocodile or that
40-pound lobster. Lunch was at Carrol's, a McDonald's clone from Finland that is
convienently located around the corner from our apartment. It's a wonderfully
clean and efficient restaurant, and we dined happily on burgers and fries before
retreating to our apartment. Everyone was ready for a well deserved nap.  &#164;</P>

<H1>The Thames at London</H1>
<P><I>by Jerri Clark Kirby</I></P> 
<P>The Thames is the chief river of England.  It is 215 miles long. It begins
as four streams - the Thames or Isis, the Churn, the Coln, and the Leach. All
rise in the Cotswold Hills. They join and the Thames flows east and south across
central England, through London and empties into the North Sea. Before it
reaches London, the Thames flows through a farming region that was the first
part of England to be settled.<BR></P>
<P>The Thames is one of the busiest rivers in the world.  Barges carry goods
along much of its length. Canals join the Thames with other rivers, making it a
great network of waterways that covers much of England.<BR></P>
<P>The City of London is on both sides of the Thames. Ships from all over the
world sail up the Thames to dock at London.  Fifteen bridges cross the Thames at
London. Famous ones are London Bridge, Westminster Bridge, Waterloo Bridge, and
Tower Bridge.  Near each bridge is a place to enjoy yet another aspect of
London's multi-faceted cultural menu.  Some are well-known; others less
publicized. The following menu offers up just a few of the many choices the
curious tourist may select.  Starting with Chelsea Bridge to the west and moving
to the eastern Thames Barrier, you can spend days on end exploring these
attractions.<BR></P>
<P><B>Chelsea</B> <B>Bridge:</B>  First opened in 1858, the present
suspension bridge opened in 1937. At the southwest corner sits the Japanese
Peace Pagoda, presented in 1985 by the Nipponzan Sect of British Monks who are
planning to ring the world with similar temples. It's a pleasant place to sit
and contemplate the busy world around you.   Across the street, southeast of the
bridge, is the Battersea Power Station.  Opened in 1940, its 337 foot (103
meters) high chimneys create a well-known landmark.  Not being in service since
1981, it remains preserved as an imposing  building of architectural interest.
<BR></P>
<P><B>Vauxhall Bridge:</B>  Built in 1906, it was the first of London's
bridges to carry trams. Bronze figures at each corner represent Agriculture,
Architecture, Engineering, Education, Pottery, Fine Arts, Local Government and
the Sciences.  Worthy of a leisurely look.<BR></P>
<P><B>Lambeth Bridge:</B>  The pineapples over each end of the bridge are a
tribute to John Tradescant, personal gardener to Charles I.  He was the first
man to succeed in growing a pineapple in England.  Of course, north of the
bridge visit the Houses of Parliament.  Several buildings have stood here; the
present one was designed by Sir Charles Barry and dates from 1852. The Clock
Tower (Big Ben), is 320 feet (97.5 meters) high. &quot;Big Ben&quot; is actually
the hour bell, (13.5 tons), named after Sir Benjamin Hall, First Commissioner of
Works at the time it was hung.  Southeast of the Lambeth Bridge is Lambeth
Palace, which has always been the London residence of the Archbishops of
Canterbury.  While it has been reconstructed in places, its earliest parts date
back to 1245.<BR></P>
<P><B>Westminster Bridge:</B>  The second bridge built across the Thames, this
original stone bridge was finished in 1750, later replaced in 1862 by the bridge
designed by Thomas Page.  Southeast of this bridge is the Old County Hall, the
administrative center for Greater London until recent years.  The foundation
stone was laid in 1912 by King George V.  The Greater London Council was
abolished in 1986 and administrative responsibilities are spread throughout 610
square miles within 32 local London Borough Councils.<BR> </P>
<P><B>Hungerford Bridge:</B>  Charing Cross station was built in 1863 on the
site of Hungerford Market, (from which the bridge takes its name); the cross is
the last of the thirteen crosses erected by King Edward I, one at each point
where the body of his wife Eleanor rested on the way from Nottingham to
Westminster for burial in 1290.  At the southeast end of the bridge stands the
Royal Festival Hall (at the South Bank Centre).  It opened in 1951 during the
Festival of Britain. The concert hall seats 2,930 people and claims some of the
best acoustics in Europe.  This complex also houses other recital rooms,
National Film Theatre and the Museum of the Moving Image (opened in 1988), which
traces the history of movies and television.  Open 10am-5pm Phone (0171)
401-2636 for 24-hour recorded info.<BR></P>
<P><B>Waterloo Bridge</B> is magnificent to behold.  It has five spans, each
230 feet (70 meters). Designed by Giles Gilbert Scott, it officially opened in
1943. Constructed of reinforced concrete, faced with self-cleaning Portland
Stone, it was finally completed by women during World War II.  Just north is
Cleopatra's Needle, a granite obelisk first erected in Egypt around 1500 BC and
presented to the British people in 1819 by Mohammed Ali.  It represents the
Egyptian appreciation for the help given by British naval forces, under Admiral
Lord Nelson at the Battle of the Nile.   Just across the way is Somerset House
which houses the Courtauld Institute Galleries. Built in 1786, it was the
General Registry Office for all births, deaths and marriages.  South of this
bridge stands the South Bank Complex, housing three theaters in one, since it
opened in 1976 and the Oxo Building, said to have been erected in 1932 to defy
regulations on outdoor advertising by incorporating its logo into the building.<BR></P>
<P><B>Blackfriars Bridge</B>, built in 1869, features stone pulpits between
iron arches. These commemorate the 13th Century Dominican Monastery which gave
its name to Blackfriars. Just at the north end is the Unilever House, built in
1932 and housing the London offices of the Unilever Trading Organisation.
Straight north is St.Paul's Cathedral, which took Sir Christopher Wren 35 years
to build.  The 365 foot (100 meters) high dome is second in size only to St.
Peters in Rome. Open 8:30am-4:00pm, galleries 9:45am to 4:15pm Mon-Sat)  Phone
(0171) 248-2705.  The Sea Shell Restaurant, nearby, has excellent food - (0171)
606-9415. Try the daily special.<BR></P>
<P><B>Southwark Bridge</B>, finished in 1921, is the least used of London's
bridges.  Just southwest is Sam Wanamaker's replica of the Globe Theatre, built
on the site of the original Elizabethan theatre.  On the south bank is Southwark
Cathedral, the third largest church in London.  It dates back to the 12th
century; John Harvard, who founded Harvard University, was christened here in
1607.<BR></P>
<P><B>London Bridge</B> was first constructed in Roman times. The present
bridge was opened in 1973 and at 107 feet (33 meters) is London's widest road
bridge.  On the northern side is Fishmonger's Hall,  Livery Hall of the
Fishmongers Company.  Annigani's portrait of Queen Elizabeth II, painted in 1955
and reproduced on British and Commonwealth postage stamps and bank notes, is
displayed here.   Just east is The Monument, completed in 1677 to commemorate
the Great Fire of London of 1666.  The Tower of London is in this area.  Parts
were built back as far as 1078; it has been a fortress, the Royal residence, a
state prison, a mint, an observatory and a zoo.  It is the home of the Crown
Jewels, and the Ceremony of the Keys takes place here daily.  Open 9-6 daily
(10am Sunday), phone (0171) 709-0765 for info.  Clink Prison, at 1 Clink Street
on London Bridge, used to be in the notorious red light district.  These days,
it hosts private parties and corporate functions. Phone (0171) 403 6515.  
Across the river sits the HMS Belfast. Built in 1939, weighing 11,500 tons, it
last saw action in the Korean Campaign in 1952.  You can investigate gun
turrets, mess decks and various other areas of the ship daily 10am-4:30pm or
5:50pm, depending on the season.  Phone (0171) 407 6434.<BR></P>
<P><B>Tower Bridge</B> was constructed in 1894 by Sir John Wolfe Barry.  The
two towers house the machinery for the lifting of the bascules, each one
weighing 1000 tons; each can be raised within 90 seconds.  The Tower Bridge
Museum is reached through the third level of the north tower of the bridge. 
Animatronic characters from the bridge's past bring to life the story of this
unique bridge, told through a series of multi-media presentations inside the
structure.  Kids of all ages really enjoy this.  Opens 10am, closes 4:45pm to
6:30pm depending on the season.  Open 7 days. (0171) 378-1928 for details.
Bramah Tea &amp; Coffee Museum is at Butler's Wharf on Tower Bridge.  A unique
collection of pictures, silver and ceramics illustrate the two great Oriental
trades of tea and coffee which brought romance to the ports of London and a new
social life to Europe.  Open 10am-6pm; phone: (0171) 378-0222 (phone is in the
comfortable cafe which offers great tea, biscuits, crumpets and a basic menu).  
East of the north end of the bridge is St. Katharines, built by Thomas Telford
in 1826 and originally designed to handle valuable cargoes such as ivory, tea
and silver. Presently, it is a commercial, residential and recreational area.
Across the river is the Design Museum, a part of the Butlers Wharf development.
It is a research and resource center for design students, professional designers
and the public. Open: Tuesday-Sunday 11:30am-6:30pm. Closed Mondays. The &quot;Collection&quot;
section contains 20th Century exhibits; the &quot;Review&quot; section contains
plans and prototypes.  The Mayflower is moored just east of here. Captain
Christopher Jones and many of the crew were Rotherhithe men and the  pub here is
named after the ship.  Following along the south side of the river in this area,
one comes upon the Surrey Dock, known as &quot;dead man's dock&quot; because,
during the plague of 1665, this area was used as a mass burial ground.  The
human remains came to light during excavations of this area in 1860.  Just east
rests the Gypsy Moth, a 53 foot yacht.   At age 65, Sir Francis Chichester
sailed her around the world by himself -- a first -- in 1966/67.  The Cutty
Sark, magnificently restored and maintained and last of the great tea clippers,
rests here at Greenwich Pier.  It was completed in 1869 in Scotland.  Open
daily; phone (0181) 858 3445.  The National Maritime Museum is to the  east. 
This was formerly the Royal Hospital School but is now the largest maritime
museum in the world.  Among the exhibits is the coat which Admiral Lord Nelson
wore when he was killed at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805.  Open 10am-6pm
Mon-Sat &amp; 12-6pm Sun. Phone (0181) 858 4422.   Also here is the Old Royal
Observatory where the Meridian line, which divides the Western and Eastern
hemispheres, runs across the courtyard and out into a park.  Nearby is the Royal
Naval College.  The ceiling of the Painted Hall is something not to be missed. 
It was painted by John Thornhill, who took 20 years to complete this
masterpiece.<BR></P>
<P>Back across the river, east of the Tower Bridge, is Prospect of Whitby,
built in 1520.  Charles Dickens often painted from the veranda; and it was
frequented by many other artists of his time.  The Canary Wharf , just a little
farther east, is easily seen because it is the UK's tallest building at 850 feet
(259 meters) high.  It is a part of a recent Docklands redevelopment project.
Nearby, at the waterfront, is Island Gardens.  It is a small park opened in 1895
to commemorate the spot which Sir Christopher Wren considered had the best view
of Greenwich Palace.  East is Trinity Buoy Wharf, originally built for Trinity
House as workshops for the maintenance of equipment associated with lighthouses,
buoys and beacons.  Look out from here to see the Thames Barrier, moveable gates
that can be raised within 30 minutes to hold back floodwaters.  Begun in 1974,
they first became operational in November 1982; they were first used to
safeguard London in February 1983 and have saved London from flooding over 20
times.  The Thames Barrier Visitor Centre is a 10-year old structure housing
exhibitions, media shows, shops, a riverside walkway, a children's play area,
and a cafeteria. Phone: (0181) 854 1373. A good way to visit is via boat.<BR></P>
<P>Some of London's most famous buildings, finest mansions  and fascinating
sites are along the banks of the Thames.  &#164;</P>

<P><B>Expedia, Microsoft's big-time launch into the travel business, is now
online at <A HREF="http://expedia.msn.com/">http://expedia.msn.com</A>.   
Airfares, car rentals, and more than 25,000 hotels worldwide can now be booked
directly through the software giant's brand-new online travel agency.  The site
also has informational pages with general notes and a calendar of events for
hundreds of cities; the information is not exceptionally deep, but it is easy to
navigate and covers a wide range of destinations. 
</B><BR></P>
<P>To use the airfare finder, car rental module, or hotel locator, you need to
register.  This is a fairly quick process in which you provide name, email
address, a login ID and a password (but no credit card&#151;you only need to
provide payment information if &amp; when you actually want to make a booking).
If you are already a registered user of Microsoft Network (MSN) you can skip the
registration step and just use your MSN login and password. 
<BR></P>
<P>The airfare finder, which taps into the <B>Worldspan</B> CRS, is easy to
use and came up with a reasonable set of fares for our usual benchmark, a
Seattle-London roundtrip (from $511 on United).  It was however very slow; about
three minutes to come back with a list of a dozen or so fares, sorted from the
cheapest on up.  On another request, in which we specified a particular airline,
it never came back at all&#151;they may have some database access bugs to work
out yet.  We also tried a Seattle-Milano itinerary, coming up with a reasonable
fare of $849 on TWA.  On this one, however, we were curious about an apparent
bug: clicking on &quot;Flight Details&quot; brought up detailed information on
each segment, including equipment and meal service&#151;but it showed &quot;No
Meals&quot; for all segments, even the transatlantic flights.  We know the
airlines are cutting corners, but it's not that bad yet!  We'll pack a lunch
just in case...<BR> 
</P>
<P>Turning to hotels, we asked to see a general selection (all price ranges)
for hotels in <B>Milano</B>.  Expedia quickly offered up a surprisingly
generous list of choices&#151;many more than we have come to expect from web
sites of this type.  The quantity was boosted considerable by their inclusion of
Utell-represented properties in addition to the usual major chains (Holiday Inn,
Hilton, etc.).  <B>Utell</B>, one of the largest hotel booking agencies in the
world, represents thousands of smaller, non-chain hotels in Europe (see link
below) and is one of the few reliable ways to book budget-priced digs in
advance.  Another independent rep, <B>Steigenberger Reservation Service</B>
(SRS)&#151;specialists in reasonably priced, upscale properties&#151;also
appeared here and there, adding even more depth to the Expedia options.  
<BR></P>
<P>Each of the hotels can be clicked on for a full page of information,
including general room rates and amenities; a few have small pictures, which you
can click on to see larger images if you have the patience for it.  For some
listings you can also view clear, compact city locator maps to get an idea of
where the hotel is in relation to train stations, attractions, etc.  We tend to
put a <I>very</I> high premium on location when choosing a hotel, and were
impressed with this feature&#151;too many Internet hotel sites, and even printed
brochures, fail to give you a clue as to where exactly the property is located. 
Unfortunately, coverage of this feature was uneven: for some reason most Paris
hotels included maps, while most Milano hotels did not.  It may be that this is
a work in progress and they'll provide more complete mapping as the site
matures.  On our wish list, we also think it'd be nice to be able to pull up one
large map with all of the hotels for a city, shown by numbered dots; then you
could start by browsing hotels in your preferred location, rather than having to
go through the list one by one, waiting a few seconds each time for a map to
load.  Somewhat to our surprise, running a search for hotels in Paris with the &quot;$75
and under&quot; option specified actually turned up a short list&#151;mostly
<B>Ibis</B> chain motels and mostly in the suburbs, but given the skyrocketing
costs of a room in Paris these days, finding anything at all in this price range
is remarkable. 
<BR></P>
<P>A major omission in Expedia is that so far they carry nothing about <B>European
rail</B>.  There are no options that we could find for buying railpasses or
making train reservations; unless you plan to fly or drive everywhere, you won't
be able to put together a complete European itinerary here.  Perhaps this will
be added later. 
<BR></P>
<P>We'll keep an eye on Expedia.  Since it comes from Microsoft, rather than
one of the big travel companies, they may be willing to be a bit more innovative
than some of the mega-sites we've seen on the Web so far.  (And of course, since
it comes from Microsoft, one can expect it to be a lot better by the third
revision. :-)  They're off to a good start, and this may well end up being one
of the better one-stop online travel shops.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+2"><B><I>Fodor's Customized Mini-Guides:</I></B></FONT>  A
particularly nifty feature found at <A HREF="http://www.quinwell.com/">Quinwell</A>
(among other places) is the <B>Fodor Online MiniGuide</B> program.  This <I>interactive
online travel planning aide</I> lets you specify a destination, a few key facts
about your tastes, budget, and interests, and then goes to work assembling your
own personal guide from Fodor's vast store of travel info.  The process is
quick, and when it's done your guide appears as a single customized Web page
suitable for saving, printing, or copying.  The <I>Calendar of Events</I> in
our London version was particularly impressive, as was the <I>Neighborhood

<H2>Two New CompuServe Offerings</H2>
<P><BR><B>TransWorld Airlines</B> has a new spot on <B>CompuServe</B> called
<I>Trans World Access</I>, offering access to worldwide TWA fares and flight
schedules along with extensive information on their frequent flyer program.  If
you're a TWA FFB member, you can earn a bonus of 500 points for booking a flight
here; you can also check out your account status and browse through the FFB
award offerings.  Information on TWA Ambassador Clubs in airports around the
world can be found here too.  Their goal is to put &quot;everything you need to
know&quot; about the airline in one spot.  To take a look, log into CompuServe
and <B>GO TWA</B>.<BR></P>
<P>Another new perk for <B>CompuServe</B> subscribers is on its way, as
travel-information moguls <B>Worldview</B> have announced plans to put their
database at the disposal of the online service's users.  Worldview, providers of
travel data to the massive <I>Travelocity</I> site on the Web, will post
extensive information on attractions, acitivities, restaurants, sports, and much
more for destinations worldwide.  Unlike  <I>Travelocity</I>, however, online
booking will not be offered, at least for a while.

</A></P>
<P>Absolutely top-notch online guide for this romantic city -- stacks and
stacks of information.  Our only gripe was that (at least on our machine, maybe
not on yours) the text was entirely unreadable against a dreadfully garish
background.  We almost left; then changed the browser setting to force a neutral
background, and found ourselves at a real winner of a Web site.  Don't miss it
if you're Buda and Pest bound.<BR></P>
<P><A HREF="http://www.hungary.com/tourinform">www.hungary.com/tourinform</A></P>

<P><B>Rothenburg ob der Tauber:</B>
<A HREF="http://www.rothenburg.de/WelcomeE.html">www.rothenburg.de/WelcomeE.html</A></P>
<P>A well-organized site with a good deal of information about Rothenburg,
including a virtual walking tour and a very detailed hotel &amp; pension listing
with prices.  There are a number of links to individual hotel home pages as
well, some of which you can reserve online.  A map of Rothenburg is available
for viewing, though it is a bit too small to be as useful as one would like. 
They also have a special section on the Goethe Institute.

<P><B>Brussels:</B>
<A HREF="http://concord.dcbru.be/brussels.htm">http://concord.dcbru.be/brussels.htm</A></P>
<P>This page offers a mixed bag of listings for the Belgian capital.  Some of
the pages are pretty useless&#151;lists of names and addresses only&#151;though
the Pubs page at least offers brief one-line reviews.  There's a link to the
Brussels Exhibition Center home page (http://www.ib.be/peb/e/index.html) if you

<HR>
<P><B>Flanders:</B><A HREF="http://www.FlandersCoast.be/">www.FlandersCoast.be
</A></P>
<P>An entire site devoted to the towns along the Belgian coast, from &quot;singing
and swinging&quot; Blankenberge to Zeebrugge.  Accommodations info is uneven;
selecting Brugge as a sample brought up a very long list of hotels, but clicking
on particular properties produces fancy but not very informative pages.  The &quot;Prices:&quot;
entry was blank on every one we checked.  (Hey&#151;maybe they're all <B>free</B>!
Or maybe not.)  There is a lengthy list of museum exhibitions and special
sections on kids' activities in Flanders.

<P><B>The French Connection:</B><A HREF="http://www.webconnection.co.uk/">www.webconnection.co.uk</A>
</P>
<P><B>A terrific find!</B>  This UK-based site presents an enormous amount of
information for visiting the neighbors across the Channel.  Particularly
impressive are the extensive &amp; detailed accommodation listings&#151;farmhouses,
cottages, apartments, chateaux, and more.  The listings, which are easily
navigated by region, offer brief summaries &amp; locations; click on one for a
full description of the property (with photo), instructions on how to get there,
and points of interest in the area, along with seasonal prices.  Most that we
looked at had such extensive write-ups, you could build a whole vacation around
each one.  Booking arrangements vary by listing, with most offering a UK
telephone and/or fax number, and an e-mail contact for some.  Good as they are,
the accommodation pages are just part of what's here&#151;this is one of those
Web sites that seems to get better and better the more you dig into it.  We
found everything from mouthwatering descriptions of &quot;the three famous Prove&ccedil;ale
soups&quot; to a lengthy table of autoroute tolls around France...with separate
columns for car, car &amp; trailer, or motorbike!  The French Connection is a
definite must-stop if you're on your way to France&#151;and if you aren't, after
an hour or so here you might be.

<P>We read that Travel Wiz offered booking for more than 80 hotel chains

for fancy graphics and spending too long filling out a search form&#151;which
had to be completely started over for each query&#151; it offered one hotel in
Paris, one  in London, and zero  in Venice.  Perhaps they don't really intend to
cover Europe, we  thought, so we tried New York just to be fair: three hotels. 
Not sure what they're trying to do here, but they sure aren't doing much.

<H2>The Online Traveler</H2>
<P><BR></P>
<P>News Brief:  The Lindner Congress Hotel in Frankfurt claims to be the first
to offer computer terminals with Internet access in every room.  The hotel's 315
chambers also offer voice mail, modems, and fax machines.<BR></P>
<P><I><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">European Travel on the Internet</FONT></B></I><BR></P>
<P>The Internet continues to explode with more and more travel offerings.  You
can literally spend days browsing and not begin to cover it all.  Some of the
interesting sites we've run across lately are listed below.  The addresses were
current as of October 20, 1996.  We're finding some unusually good web pages out
there that deserve special recognition, and these are indicated below in
<FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">yellow text</FONT>..  We welcome your own Internet picks
as well:  please write to us at eurodata@nas.com to share your online
observations with fellow travelers.   
</P>
<HR>
<P><B>Hotel &amp; Travel Index Online:</B><A
HREF="http://www.traveler.net/htio/">www.traveler.net/htio/</A></P>
<P>Part of Travel Weekly's extensive offerings, this site provides information
on hundreds of hotels worldwide, in various price ranges.  They are beginning to
add detailed reviews for many; these pages come up quickly and have the info you
need, including location and room prices expressed both in local currency and
US$.  We did run into a very high rate of &quot;File Not Found&quot; errors when
picking hotels from the lists that didn't have the &quot;OHG Review&quot;
symbol; these are just links to other hotel listing sites on the Web, or to the
hotel's own page, and many apparently are out of date.  The site is well worth a
visit, however, if you stick to the reviewed listings. 
<BR></P>
<P><B>Perrillo Tours:</B>
<A HREF="http://www.perillotours.com/Web_pages/contents.html">www.perillotours.com/Web_pages/contents.html</A></P>
<P>This experienced tour operator is celebrating their 51st with some excellent
off-season specials to Italy.  Detailed information on this and other escorted
tours, including dates and prices into next spring, can be found here. 
<BR></P>
<P><B>4th Dimension Tours:</B>
<A HREF="http://www.4thdimension.com/europe.htm">www.4thdimension.com/europe.htm</A></P>
<P>Extensive information on rental cars, package tours, hotel vouchers, and
more.  Includes a listing of Posadas in Portugal that they can book for you. (
See a profile of 4th Dimensions shopping tours on page pp.) 
<BR></P>
<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">Specialty Travel Index :</FONT></B> 
<A HREF="http://www.spectrav.com/">www.spectrav.com</A></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">Their semi-annual print catalog has long been a great
resource for information about special interest tours and travel packages
worldwide.  Now Specialy Travel Index has gone online with their info; you can
browse through hundreds of listings, arranged by country &amp; by category, from
golf tours to beer festivals.  Each one points to a page or so of general
description, with 800 numbers and/or addresses  for contacting individual tour
operators for more information.  (They also offer links when the operator has a
Web page of their own.)  Comprehensive and well organized.</FONT><BR> 
</P>
<P><B>Golfing Scotland:</B>
<A HREF="http://www.spectravel.com/atkins/">www.spectravel.com/atkins/</A></P>
<P>Frances Atkins' Golf Packages are detailed here; one example, &quot;Country
Houses and Castles,&quot; includes ten nights and eight rounds of golf -- both
the lodgings and the links sound fascinating.  They quote both golfer and
non-golfer prices for this and other packages.  If you're a fisherperson, be
sure to check out their 6-day Scottish angling trip. 
<BR></P>
<P><B>Rentals in Italy (and Elsewhere!):</B>
<A HREF="http://www.travelsource.com/europe/italy.html">www.travelsource.com/europe/italy.html</A></P>
<P>If the handful of samples they offer is any indication, this outfit's villa-
and apartment-rental catalogs are well worth the $3-$15 they charge.  Most
delightful-sounding is the &quot;Cabianca&quot; ($1324 per week), an apartment
on the top floor of a Venetian palazzo.  They have a half-dozen catalogs for a
variety of European locations; contact them by phone (800-726-6702), fax
(805-482-7976), or email (76413.713@compuserve.com) for more info.

including &quot;Greece, the Greek Islands, and Gay &amp; Lesbian Cruises&quot;

<P><B>American International Homestays:</B>
<A HREF="http://www.spectravel.com/homes/">www.spectravel.com/homes/</A></P>

Not a great deal of information on the Web, but they do give a brief overview, a
list of countries where they provide services (most!), and contact information.
<BR></P>

<A HREF="http://www.traveleurope.it%2F/">www.traveleurope.it/</A></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">A fancy site which emphasizes Italy, but has links to
many other Web travel spots.  They have a very good hotel search feature which
lets you specify city and one or more keywords, such as &quot;train station,&quot;
&quot;historic,&quot;  &quot;luxury,&quot; etc.  Comes back with worthwhile
detail on the hotels it finds, too, including rates (in Lira). 
<BR></FONT></P>
<P><B>AESU Travel:</B>
<A HREF="http://www.aesu.com/">www.aesu.com</A></P>
<P>If you're a student traveler 18 to 35, or just want to find some of the
cheapest travel offers around, stop by here.  They boast &quot;seven days on a
beach&quot; in the Greek islands for $289; 6 days in Paris, including airfare
and hotel, as low as $916; and other bargains.  Easy-to-use low-fare browser
shows an attractive $502 r/t to London from the West Coast.  Some of these may
have expired by the time you read this, but check for what's new ( the
off-season should be even cheaper). 
<BR></P>
<P><B>STA Travel:</B>
<A HREF="http://www.sta-travel.com/">www.sta-travel.com</A></P>
<P>Another student-oriented travel organization, with discount airfares, chat

the world.&quot; 
<BR></P>
<P><B>Shoestring Travel:</B>
<A HREF="http://www.stratpub.com/shoe1.html">www.stratpub.com/shoe1.html</A></P>
<P>This is a very nicely done online 'zine focused on getting by cheaply.  Only
parts of it deal with Europe, but don't miss the extensive list of bargain
accommodations along the backroads of France.  The Webmaster gathers lots of the
best reader-written recommendations and advice from travel newsgroups and posts
it here, which makes for convenient browsing.

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">We have to thank Shoestring Travel's great links page
(see above) for steering us to this one.  A funny and irreverent look at
Amsterdam from a group of people who run a cafe &amp; adjacent theatrical
escapade called &quot;The Boom Chicago Comedy Show.&quot;  If you're wondering
about the title, go visit.  Go visit even if you aren't.

<P><B>Camping in Holland:</B>
<A HREF="http://www.katjeskelder.nl/kkgbhome.html">www.katjeskelder.nl/kkgbhome.html</A></P>
<P>A site devoted to De Katjeskelder Campsite &amp; Bungalowpark, in
Oosterhout, Netherlands.  Campsites, trailer slots, bungalows, and more.  Can be
viewed in several languages and the lingo in English is endearing -- travelers'
campgrounds are offered up as &quot;touristic pitches.&quot;  Doesn't mention,
unfortunately, just where Oosterhout is in relation to anything else &#151;such
as Amsterdam&#151; and we can't find it on the map.  Anybody know? 
<BR></P>
<P><B>Travel Channel:</B>
<A HREF="http://www.travelchannel.com/">www.travelchannel.com</A></P>
<P>Besides information on the cable channel's upcoming programming and special

<BR></P>
<P><B>Swiss Ski and Snowboard Bulletin:</B>
<A HREF="http://www.rs.ch/www/snow/">www.rs.ch/www/snow/</A></P>
<P>If you're planning to ski Switzerland this season, make this site your
friend.  Offers updates, posted daily at 9:00am, on  precise snow conditions and
number of runs open at hundreds &amp; hundreds of ski spots, sorted by region. 
</P>
<P><B>Lisbon Pages:</B>
<A HREF="http://www.puug.pt/Lisboa">www.puug.pt/Lisboa</A></P>
<P>A labor of love from an obvious Lisbon fan.  Good descriptive &amp;
historical information.  Unfortunately a bit slow with more banner graphics than
seem necessary.  Nice long museum list, with bus numbers given but no hours. 
Many of the museums in the list appear to have pointers to Web pages of their
own;  sadly all of these were dead links when we tried them.

<P><B>Portugal Hotel Guide:</B>
<A HREF="http://shiva.di.uminho.pt/~esteves/turismo/portugal-ing.html">http://shiva.di.uminho.pt/~esteves/turismo/portugal-ing.html</A></P>
<P>The online version of a printed guide to Portuguese lodging (ordering
information available).  Good detail, rates, and online booking for some
properties, but the annoying frames setup makes it difficult to navigate, or get
back to where you were when you click on a link that turns out  to be a dud.

and Budget&quot; and has published a book called &quot;The Backpacker Journal.&quot;
  Besides info on the book, this site offers of tips on backpacking abroad and a
good list of budget travel publications available free from various tourist
agencies.  The focus is worldwide so there's only bits and pieces for Europe,
but it's worth a look.

<P><B>Frankfurt:</B>
<A HREF="http://www.city.net/countries/germany/frankfurt_am_main">www.city.net/countries/germany/frankfurt_am_main</A></P>
<P>Excite's City Net has a &quot;resident&quot; Frankfurt site, but it's pretty
shallow.  The Hotels page (actually a jump to a Eurohotels' page) is one of
those that always baffles us -- what on earth is meant to be accomplished by
long lists of hotel names, accompanied  by nothing more informative than address
and phone number?  I suppose if you're wandering the streets and can't find a
phonebook (but can somehow log in to the Web) it would be mighty handy.  Or you
could print it out to take along, just in case Frankfurt doesn't have
phonebooks.  Whatever...

<P>This smaller carrier is among those drumming up business on the Internet via
online seat auctions.  In a recent auction, minimum bid for an October roundtrip
between New York and a host of European destinations&#151;including London,
Glasgow, and Copenhagen&#151;was just $150.  Check out the Web page to see
what's up for bid next. 
<BR></P>
<P><B>Online Air Reservations:</B>
<A HREF="http://www.reservations.com/">www.reservations.com</A></P>

<H2>Prague</H2>
<P><BR><I><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00" SIZE="+2">Circling the Square in
Europe's Perfect Little City</FONT></B></I></P>
<P><BR>
<I>by Nathalie Zeidman</I><BR></P>
<P><B>It's fashionable these days to label Prague the Paris or New York of the
nineties.</B>  If I want Paris or New York, I'll fly into Charles de Gaule or
JFK.  On the other hand, if I'm looking for Baroque town squares, a Gothic
synagogue, a theater that saw the premier of Mozart's Don Giovanni and a castle
immortalized by Franz Kafka, I'll take Prague. 
</P>
<P>I'll get my money's worth too, considering that Prague is more than one
city.  Rather it's a patchwork of small towns:  Old Town, New Town, Lesser Town,
each with its own town square.  These town squares are among the most endearing
of Prague's charms.  Not Hollywood but Old Town Square and its Tyle Theater,
both hardly changed since Mozart's day, served as sets for the smash film
Amadeus.  Today tourists crowd the center of the Square waiting for the
fifteenth century astronomical clock in the Town Hall Tower to do its hourly
thing:  ring Christ and the Apostles out of the tower on one side, in on the
other.  After this hallowed parade the crowd melts and it's easier to poke
around.  That's when we discovered the towers of the late Gothic Tyn Church. 
Tyn School is also Gothic but with gables reminiscent of Venetian Renaissance;
for an outstanding example of Prague Baroque, there's the Church of St.
Nicholas.  Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque: that's Prague anywhere you turn.   
<BR></P>
<P>After hours of craning at red-tiled roofs, Gothic spires, Baroque gables and
Rococo lintels we need a caf&eacute;.  A glass of Pilsner (the prince of Beers)
and a ham sandwich (Prague's ham is the best) will see us through the next round
of sightseeing.  Not far from Old Town, adjacent to the Square of the Knights of
the Cross, is the Clementinum.  Originally a Jesuit college, it now houses
Czechoslovakia's state libraries.  Doors along cloistered walks arouse our
curiosity; the doorkeeper gave his approval for us to enter one of them.  Beyond
the door, the periodicals room blends past and present.  Walls soaring to some
forty-feet, book-lined balcony, faded ceiling mural, total quiet, all recall the
library's monastic roots.  A porcelain stove curving in Baroque grace reflects a
more opulent time.  Researchers in blue jeans are as contemporary as tomorrow. 
What a place to be a scholar! 
<BR></P>
<P>In the winter of `89-'90, scholars poured out of Charles University and
Clementinum to join demonstrators on Wenceslas Square.   Every night for weeks,
TV news made that Prague thoroughfare as familiar as Times Square on New Year's
Eve&#151;but in name only.   For all the television exposure we never saw the
Square itself.  With a change in government, Wenceslas Square is once again the
fashionable center of this vibrant old city.   And that's how we saw it when we
emerged from the metro at the National Museum Station, not as a square but a
long broad boulevard sweeping down from the larger-than-life statue of Good King
Wenceslas.  The Square that bears his name is Prague's Fifth Avenue and
pedestrian traffic is heavy along its wide sidewalks; it's a great place for
window shopping.  I fell in love with everything:  garnets mined in
Czechoslovakia; porcelain, its shapes and patterns exquisite; ruby-red and
cobalt-blue Bohemian glass.  Half way down the boulevard we settled in for lunch
at the Jalta Hotel, recently renovated but still full of old world charm and
still serving old world dumplings.  Had we wanted something light, Koruna, a
stand-up buffet at the bottom of the Square, is popular with shoppers; or we
might have tried sausage snacks at window counters all along the boulevard. 
<BR></P>
<P>Back at the National museum, having circled the Square, we wandered through
the science exhibits; the mineralogy collection is world famous.   But is was
the assortment of hand puppets going back to the eighteenth century that most
delighted us.   I could picture a small table on a street corner or in a town
square with Punch and Judy going at each other to the delight of the crowd.  A
few blocks up from the museum is the Smetana Theater.  We were lucky to get
seats for that evening's performance and a table for dinner at the Esplanade
Hotel across the street.  Fish, duck and goose are standard fare at the
Esplanade, its sauerkraut as special as Alsatian.  For dessert, palachenken&#151;fruit,
nut or chocolate-filled crepes&#151;is a Czech specialty.  We had a choice of
Moravian red wine and Pilsner; we settled on the wine and didn't regret it. 
<BR></P>
<P>It was our first Medea and Carmen as ballets.   Like the rest of the packed
house we were mesmerized, almost as much by the theater as the performance. 
Recently renovated, the Smetana is a Baroque gem with huge dimpled cupids
holding up the middle tier of boxes.  Not far from Wenceslas Square, down toward
the river, the National Theater has also been restored to its former glory, all
marble, wood paneling and red velvet.  Although the house was sold out, the last
minute we were able to get box seats for Prokofieff's Romeo and Juliet.  For a
tourist to see two great ballets companies two nights in a row is not unusual in
a city where art is a way of life and moving from Neo-Renaissance to Gothic to
Baroque is just a matter of crossing a square.   
<BR></P>
<P>Nowhere is the architectural mix more prominent than in the six-block area
whose buildings were once part of the Jewish ghetto and now comprise the State
Jewish Museum. There are six surviving synagogues, the most impressive, the
small old-New Synagogue.  Built as an early double nave with  vaulted arches and
ceilings, it has an intimacy not normally associated with Gothic.  Services are
still held here.   
<BR></P>
<P>Across the street the High synagogue shares a building with the former
Jewish Town nail.   Essentially sixteenth century but rebuilt in the Rococo
style two-hundred years later, its instantly recognized by the six-pointed star
atop its spire and the clocks in its steeple:  one with hands that move
counterclockwise, the other with Hebrew letters.  Next door, the Maisel
Synagogue has a fine collection of Judaica, antique ceremonial objects and
robes.  Pictures painted by children at concentration camps hang on the wall of
Klaus Synagogue.  Row upon row of names cover the wails of the Pinchas
Synagogue, names of men, women and children liquidated by the Nazis.  At the end
of the street is the Jewish cemetery built in the fifteenth century and used for
three-hundred years.  With limited space, graves are piled upon graves, twelve
deep: tombstones angle every which way.  We looked for the headstone of Rabbi
Yehuda Low, who, according to legend, was the creator of the Golem, a clay
figure that miraculously came to life.  We didn't find it.  
<BR></P>
<P>Like the Golem, the oversized centuries-old statues lining both sides of the
Charles Bridge, seem poised to speak.   Spanning the viatava (Moldau), the
Charles Bridge is the old link -- there's a subway now -- between Old Town and
Lessor Town with Hradcany castle sitting above both, an empress on her throne. 

<BR></P>
<P>It's uphill all the way from the bridge, past old mansions housing foreign
embassies, cutting through small squares and larger ones including the one that
fronts the stunning St. Nicholas cathedral.   Finally a steep flight of stone
steps leads to the magnificent Baroque castle gate.  Not until we passed into
the first courtyard did we realize that Hradcany is a complex of palaces&#151;one
of them presidential.  we'd never have found our way around the castle grounds
without a map to guide us to art galleries and museums, convents and
monasteries, famed St. Vitus cathedral, even a pleasant restaurant in landscaped
gardens.  No wonder Kafka's protagonist kept writing to the Castle and never got
a satisfactory answer.  Kafka himself lived for a time in one of the tiny houses
along Golden Lane which breeches the back wall of the castle's fortifications.  
Centuries before, goldsmiths lived there. Today it's a mecca for tourists and,
yes, artists, who see Prague as the kind of creative center that once was Paris
and New York.   <BR></P>
<P>I take a simpler view.   For me, Prague is only the most perfect little city
in the Europe.  &#164;

<H2>Hearing the Puppets Sing</H2>
<P></P>
<P><B><I><FONT SIZE="+2" COLOR="#FFFF00">Czech Puppet Theatres</FONT></I></B></P>
<P><I>by Andrea Kirkby</I><BR></P>
<P><B>Most of us probably think of puppets as nice things for kids.</B>  Fun,
but not serious; not things an adult would want to watch.  Certainly, not art. 
But in the Czech Republic, things are different. There, puppetteering is a
university subject!  It also has a long history.  Prague has at least a dozen
marionette theatres, numerous puppet-buskers, and no less than two puppet
operas.   
<BR></P>
<P>The music, in case you're wondering, is provided by recordings&#151;good
ones, too.  Don Giovanni was the first puppet opera I saw.  Even entering the
theatre, you notice that the experience is subtly different from real opera: the
theatre is miniature.  The stage is too small for a human being, let alone a
chorus.  Even the seats seem smaller.  The second strange feature of the
experience is evident as soon as the overture begins.  Czech puppet theatre
never takes the text for granted.  It searches for subtexts as eagerly as any
Czech novelist.  The subtext here is taken from  Amadeus; an energetic little
Mozart-puppet arrives to conduct the unruly (and unseen, except for the tips of
a few bows) orchestra.  Pretty soon the folio pages of his music are flying
around as he loses patience, and later on in the opera, the musicians have
driven him to drink.  
<BR></P>
<P>Humor  is also a trademark of the puppet theatre.  One marvelous sight that
will stay with me for the rest of my life is a naked, wooden-jointed Don
Giovanni relaxing in the bathtub as Leporello scrubs his back.  Johannes
Schaaf's dark view of the opera as a drama about power, or Jouve's view of the
Don incarnating the seductive appeal of death, would hardly be served by such
knockabout duels and snide jokes at Don Ottavio's expense; but what the heck,
it's all good fun.  Part of the humor&#151;also, sometimes, part of the serious
point&#151;is a contrast of scale.  Leporello, as befits a servant, is smaller
than Don Giovanni.  Donna Elvira seems slightly bigger; no wonder the Don
decides to avoid her!  I wondered how they would treat the Commendatore, who
like most ghosts is difficult to stage without giving rise to unwanted laughter
from the audience. Enter, quite unexpected, a huge and evidently human
puppeteer, clad in mud-covered dungarees, whose face is hidden by the proscenium
arch.  Though they try to escape&#151;in Leporello's case almost successfully&#151;the
puppetmaster hangs each one of them up on the back wall of the stage, in a
fitting and rather dark end to the comedy.  (For those who know the opera well,
it's also an interesting way of coping with the problematic final chorus.) 
<BR></P>
<P>My second puppet opera was Gluck's Orfeo, billed as an experience of the
magic world of baroque theatre invention.  This time the stage was not the
traditional proscenium arch, but a complete building isolated in the middle of
the acting space.  Throughout the production, there was no attempt at
illusionistic theatre; we could see the puppeteers&#151;in fact, the
stringpullers for Orfeo and Euridice were having a tempestuous affair of their
own.  The two pipe-smoking  professors observed the proceedings with
affectionate humor, as well as attempting (sometimes without success) to work
the baroque stage machines.  There was humor enough in this production, too. 
Orfeo's lyre grows wings, and flies away from him.  As he sings to the animals,
a little crocodile swims on to the scene, then begins to cry.  (Crocodile tears,
of course.)  Blindfolded by the god of love, Orfeo bumps into the scenery.  But
the humor only points up the tragedy of the lovers' separation.  The
bigger-than-lifesize head of Orfeo looks for his Euridice as she remains a
doll-like, tiny puppet at the back of the stage; or two Orfeos appear, searching
fruitlessly. 
<BR></P>
<P>The magical theatre of the baroque was everything it had promised.  The
waves of the sea rose and fell, represented by the spiral wave machine, or by
zigzag strips pulling one and then the other way.  The thunderclap machine was
proudly demonstrated; the Furies and the beasts of hell appeared, complemented
by the more modern use of dry ice.  Rainbows sprang from the stage-sky, and at
the very end the God of Love, a little Cupid with arrows pointing down at Orfeo,
was lowered from the top of the stage&#151; truly a deus ex machina. 
<BR></P>
<P>I happen to love opera; but Prague has puppets for every taste.  Surrealist,
soap opera, grand opera, comedy&#151;it's even rumored there's porno puppets,
though I've seen no sign of them.  And of course Prague has its main opera
house, the Estates Theatre; but then, I can see the opera anywhere.  Only in
Prague can I hear the puppets sing.  &#164;

<P><!--Seasons of Auvergne by Douglas Walters--><BR></P>
<P><B>Auvergne is a remote, mountainous highland in central France,</B> famous
for its grass-roots culture and extinct volcanoes.  Everyone who goes there
loves it.  Here's why I do. 
</P>
<P><I>I love winter in Auvergne</I>&#151;especially out in the barn, amidst
the rhythmic sounds of the milking machines.  Snowflakes drift down out of the
evening darkness through the roof vents which run down the center of the long
barn.  Small mounds of snow pile up on the hay-covered floor in front of the
cows.  The tethered beasts are lined up in their stalls, loudly munching hay,
patiently waiting their turn while the farmer bucket-feeds the calves.  This is
a special blend of sound and smell which no combination of electronic
synthesizers can equal. 
</P>
<P>The dogs know the routine.  They've finished licking up the milk, and
they've already burrowed into the hay for the night.  The farmer takes a final
look at his herd, then a last drag of his rolled cigarette before he cuts the
power.  Everything suddenly falls dark and silent.  Outside it's dark.  The snow
has let up, at least for awhile.  The moon shines brightly, even as it slides
behind the rushing clouds of the next approaching snow squall.  Pine trees
swooshing in the wind and the snow dripping off the barn make the only noise as
the farmer walks back to the house. The next morning dawns sunny but, as milking
begins, so does the snow.  Down come the flakes; big wet ones through the small
roof vents.  They're more numerous than the night before, so the farmer looks
outside.  It's snowing heavily, and the house, 50 meters away, is barely
visible.  Everything&#151;the tractor, the cows' backs, the pines&#151;is
turning white. It's a winter wonderland, and it's only November.  At this rate
there could be a foot by the end of the day.  The sun returns at mid-morning
while the farmer walks back to the house for his sausage and wine break&#151;le
casse croute.  The squall moves off into the next valley.  It's almost an hour
before the next one blows in.</P>
<P>Towards Christmas the wind gets colder, and the snow squalls more frequent. 
The snow begins to pile up.  Christmas Eve.  Outside, it's a mixture of snow,
wind, and moon.  Inside the warm kitchen the smoke from the Gauloises mingle
with the roasting sanglier.  First up is the morel mushroom pie; the farmer
picked the tender mushrooms up on the plateau back in October.  He has been
harvesting the same fungal vein for most of his life.   La fete winds down
around early morning with some &quot;cinquante chevaux.&quot; In theory, &quot;50
horsepower&quot; is a digestif.  In actual fact, it's an acquired taste which
lives up to its name.  It's best tested in small quantities.  If you don't drink
it you can use it as fuel additive.  Fortunately everyone lives close to le
Perou, a tiny bourg of a dozen traditional rock buildings on the other side of
the valley.  During the casse croute on New Year's Morning, a baby avalanche
rumbles down from the plateau.  Later they'll increase in number as the days
grow warmer and longer. 
</P>
<P><I>I love springtime In Auvergne.</I>  It comes slowly.  The March snows
give way to April giboulees.  These are weird storms:  towering, isolated
cumulonimbus clouds which drop enormous puffs of round, soft sleet.  They bounce
off hard surfaces like tennis balls.  The fields, however, are wet and spongy
with fresh shoots of grass and clover which the farmer turns his anxious herd
back out to eat.  The cows' hooves sink deep into the black mud making cold
squishing sounds wherever they go. 
</P>
<P>Life is returning to the plateaus around le Perou.  The nut trees are
budding out slowly on the slopes, and the small, colorful songbirds are staking
claims.  One lonely-hearted male keeps attacking himself. He smashes headlong
into the kitchen's glass door which overlooks the valley.  Even the lazy,
overfed tomcat inside on the sofa seems to be shaking his head sympathetically. 
From the other side of the narrow valley even the cuckoo sounds happy.  The
small stream separating he and le Perou from the farm runs clear and cold.   
</P>
<P>In the distance, Auvergne's renowned puys rise up above the plateaus. These
steep, extinct volcanoes are gradually taking on their familiar green velvety
appearance.  But in the sunlight between giboulees it's still cool up on the
plateau.  Late in the day the farmer walks up and squashes across the soggy
pastures.  He scares up pairs of partridges.  Like the pheasants down in the
valleys, they manage to disappear behind single blades of grass.  Then night
falls, and the clouds and the giboulees vanish, too.  One or two lights from le
Perou are the only other signs of civilization.  But it's never really dark. 
Although the sun has left no trace of its own presence, its countless cousins
are everywhere.  Every minute or so a cosmic flash reminds us of our place in
the Universe.  And the days grow longer. 
</P>
<P><I>I love summertime in Auvergne.</I>  It's late July, and the farmer (he
calls himself a paysan)  has started cutting his wheat in the hot sun. As he
drives the tractor home through the cool darkness, a fat badger waddles across
the road.  The sunflowers are still only chest high. There are dozens of
shooting stars every hour.  They seem to chase the daylight away, but it must be
a struggle:  In this beautiful, far-off place, nobody wants to see the sun go
down...until it goes down and the curtain goes up on the Milky Way.  There are
no crass, neon reminders of the city around le Perou.  Here the Milky Way is a
cosmic carpet.  She unwinds silently overhead, pouring forth her eternal light
and making daylight out of darkness.  It bounces off the small stream down in
the valley.  What could make us feel more mortal... Sunflowers? 
</P>
<P>Now it's August.  The wheat and barley are in.  But there are vast fields of
sunflowers on the steep slopes.  They run right up to the narrow lane-and-a-half
roads which thread their way throughout the hills.  Just a few weeks ago the
sunflowers were bright, youthful maidens looking ambitiously skyward.  Now they
seemed to be thinking about the past, too .  They're bowed, brown heads are dry
and shriveled.  They seem to be praying as they await the reaper.  
</P>
<P><I>I love autumn in Auvergne</I>, because it usually comes with little
warning.  A clear, warm afternoon in late August suddenly clouds over.  A cold
gust front hits the plateaus around le Perou.  Low, churning clouds spill over
the hilltops at the far end of the valley. They rush forward like an invading
army, firing out a wall of rain and sleet.   
</P>
<P>The thunderstorm works itself into a 15-minute fury, and then summer is
gone.  The sun will come back out tomorrow in a cool west wind, but last week's
heat won't return.  Tonight the hearths in le Perou are working.  Soon it's All
Saints week; the air is clean and crisp, and on Monday winter suddenly returns. 
The livestock has long since grown shaggy.  There's still some green in the
fields, but the morning rain is cold, and some white is mixing in.  The farmer
keeps the cows in the field for as long as possible.  In the barn, he says, the
dust from the hay is bad for their respiration.  Two weeks later he decides it's
time to keep them in the barn, and they come home for the winter.  They don't
seem to mind much.  
</P>
<P>During an evening milking the farmer looks up in front of the lined-up cows
and sees snowflakes drifting down out of the evening darkness through the roof
vents.  The cows go on eating.  Small mounds of snow pile up on the hay-covered
floor.  &#164;

<H2>Prague</H2>
<P><BR><I><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00" SIZE="+2">Circling the Square in
Europe's Perfect Little City</FONT></B></I></P>
<P><BR>
<I>by Nathalie Zeidman</I><BR></P>
<P><B>It's fashionable these days to label Prague the Paris or New York of the
nineties.</B>  If I want Paris or New York, I'll fly into Charles de Gaule or
JFK.  On the other hand, if I'm looking for Baroque town squares, a Gothic
synagogue, a theater that saw the premier of Mozart's Don Giovanni and a castle
immortalized by Franz Kafka, I'll take Prague. 
</P>
<P>I'll get my money's worth too, considering that Prague is more than one
city.  Rather it's a patchwork of small towns:  Old Town, New Town, Lesser Town,
each with its own town square.  These town squares are among the most endearing
of Prague's charms.  Not Hollywood but Old Town Square and its Tyle Theater,
both hardly changed since Mozart's day, served as sets for the smash film
Amadeus.  Today tourists crowd the center of the Square waiting for the
fifteenth century astronomical clock in the Town Hall Tower to do its hourly
thing:  ring Christ and the Apostles out of the tower on one side, in on the
other.  After this hallowed parade the crowd melts and it's easier to poke
around.  That's when we discovered the towers of the late Gothic Tyn Church. 
Tyn School is also Gothic but with gables reminiscent of Venetian Renaissance;
for an outstanding example of Prague Baroque, there's the Church of St.
Nicholas.  Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque: that's Prague anywhere you turn.   
<BR></P>
<P>After hours of craning at red-tiled roofs, Gothic spires, Baroque gables and
Rococo lintels we need a caf&eacute;.  A glass of Pilsner (the prince of Beers)
and a ham sandwich (Prague's ham is the best) will see us through the next round
of sightseeing.  Not far from Old Town, adjacent to the Square of the Knights of
the Cross, is the Clementinum.  Originally a Jesuit college, it now houses
Czechoslovakia's state libraries.  Doors along cloistered walks arouse our
curiosity; the doorkeeper gave his approval for us to enter one of them.  Beyond
the door, the periodicals room blends past and present.  Walls soaring to some
forty-feet, book-lined balcony, faded ceiling mural, total quiet, all recall the
library's monastic roots.  A porcelain stove curving in Baroque grace reflects a
more opulent time.  Researchers in blue jeans are as contemporary as tomorrow. 
What a place to be a scholar! 
<BR></P>
<P>In the winter of `89-'90, scholars poured out of Charles University and
Clementinum to join demonstrators on Wenceslas Square.   Every night for weeks,
TV news made that Prague thoroughfare as familiar as Times Square on New Year's
Eve&#151;but in name only.   For all the television exposure we never saw the
Square itself.  With a change in government, Wenceslas Square is once again the
fashionable center of this vibrant old city.   And that's how we saw it when we
emerged from the metro at the National Museum Station, not as a square but a
long broad boulevard sweeping down from the larger-than-life statue of Good King
Wenceslas.  The Square that bears his name is Prague's Fifth Avenue and
pedestrian traffic is heavy along its wide sidewalks; it's a great place for
window shopping.  I fell in love with everything:  garnets mined in
Czechoslovakia; porcelain, its shapes and patterns exquisite; ruby-red and
cobalt-blue Bohemian glass.  Half way down the boulevard we settled in for lunch
at the Jalta Hotel, recently renovated but still full of old world charm and
still serving old world dumplings.  Had we wanted something light, Koruna, a
stand-up buffet at the bottom of the Square, is popular with shoppers; or we
might have tried sausage snacks at window counters all along the boulevard. 
<BR></P>
<P>Back at the National museum, having circled the Square, we wandered through
the science exhibits; the mineralogy collection is world famous.   But is was
the assortment of hand puppets going back to the eighteenth century that most
delighted us.   I could picture a small table on a street corner or in a town
square with Punch and Judy going at each other to the delight of the crowd.  A
few blocks up from the museum is the Smetana Theater.  We were lucky to get
seats for that evening's performance and a table for dinner at the Esplanade
Hotel across the street.  Fish, duck and goose are standard fare at the
Esplanade, its sauerkraut as special as Alsatian.  For dessert, palachenken&#151;fruit,
nut or chocolate-filled crepes&#151;is a Czech specialty.  We had a choice of
Moravian red wine and Pilsner; we settled on the wine and didn't regret it. 
<BR></P>
<P>It was our first Medea and Carmen as ballets.   Like the rest of the packed
house we were mesmerized, almost as much by the theater as the performance. 
Recently renovated, the Smetana is a Baroque gem with huge dimpled cupids
holding up the middle tier of boxes.  Not far from Wenceslas Square, down toward
the river, the National Theater has also been restored to its former glory, all
marble, wood paneling and red velvet.  Although the house was sold out, the last
minute we were able to get box seats for Prokofieff's Romeo and Juliet.  For a
tourist to see two great ballets companies two nights in a row is not unusual in
a city where art is a way of life and moving from Neo-Renaissance to Gothic to
Baroque is just a matter of crossing a square.   
<BR></P>
<P>Nowhere is the architectural mix more prominent than in the six-block area
whose buildings were once part of the Jewish ghetto and now comprise the State
Jewish Museum. There are six surviving synagogues, the most impressive, the
small old-New Synagogue.  Built as an early double nave with  vaulted arches and
ceilings, it has an intimacy not normally associated with Gothic.  Services are
still held here.   
<BR></P>
<P>Across the street the High synagogue shares a building with the former
Jewish Town nail.   Essentially sixteenth century but rebuilt in the Rococo
style two-hundred years later, its instantly recognized by the six-pointed star
atop its spire and the clocks in its steeple:  one with hands that move
counterclockwise, the other with Hebrew letters.  Next door, the Maisel
Synagogue has a fine collection of Judaica, antique ceremonial objects and
robes.  Pictures painted by children at concentration camps hang on the wall of
Klaus Synagogue.  Row upon row of names cover the wails of the Pinchas
Synagogue, names of men, women and children liquidated by the Nazis.  At the end
of the street is the Jewish cemetery built in the fifteenth century and used for
three-hundred years.  With limited space, graves are piled upon graves, twelve
deep: tombstones angle every which way.  We looked for the headstone of Rabbi
Yehuda Low, who, according to legend, was the creator of the Golem, a clay
figure that miraculously came to life.  We didn't find it.  
<BR></P>
<P>Like the Golem, the oversized centuries-old statues lining both sides of the
Charles Bridge, seem poised to speak.   Spanning the viatava (Moldau), the
Charles Bridge is the old link -- there's a subway now -- between Old Town and
Lessor Town with Hradcany castle sitting above both, an empress on her throne. 

<BR></P>
<P>It's uphill all the way from the bridge, past old mansions housing foreign
embassies, cutting through small squares and larger ones including the one that
fronts the stunning St. Nicholas cathedral.   Finally a steep flight of stone
steps leads to the magnificent Baroque castle gate.  Not until we passed into
the first courtyard did we realize that Hradcany is a complex of palaces&#151;one
of them presidential.  we'd never have found our way around the castle grounds
without a map to guide us to art galleries and museums, convents and
monasteries, famed St. Vitus cathedral, even a pleasant restaurant in landscaped
gardens.  No wonder Kafka's protagonist kept writing to the Castle and never got
a satisfactory answer.  Kafka himself lived for a time in one of the tiny houses
along Golden Lane which breeches the back wall of the castle's fortifications.  
Centuries before, goldsmiths lived there. Today it's a mecca for tourists and,
yes, artists, who see Prague as the kind of creative center that once was Paris
and New York.   <BR></P>
<P>I take a simpler view.   For me, Prague is only the most perfect little city
in the Europe.  &#164;
<BR></P>
<P><I><B>Cedok</B>, once the state-run travel agency of the Czech Republic&#151;now
privatized and eager for your business&#151;offers many flexible arrangements
for visiting Prague; contact them at 800-800-8891.  If you're traveling by
Eurail pass, ask your rail agent about the <B>Prague Excursion Pass</B>, which
offers a $49 roundtrip from any Czech border point to the capital.</I></P>

<H2>Hearing the Puppets Sing</H2>
<P></P>
<P><B><I><FONT SIZE="+2" COLOR="#FFFF00">Czech Puppet Theatres</FONT></I></B></P>
<P><I>by Andrea Kirkby</I><BR></P>
<P><B>Most of us probably think of puppets as nice things for kids.</B>  Fun,
but not serious; not things an adult would want to watch.  Certainly, not art. 
But in the Czech Republic, things are different. There, puppetteering is a
university subject!  It also has a long history.  Prague has at least a dozen
marionette theatres, numerous puppet-buskers, and no less than two puppet
operas.   
<BR></P>
<P>The music, in case you're wondering, is provided by recordings&#151;good
ones, too.  Don Giovanni was the first puppet opera I saw.  Even entering the
theatre, you notice that the experience is subtly different from real opera: the
theatre is miniature.  The stage is too small for a human being, let alone a
chorus.  Even the seats seem smaller.  The second strange feature of the
experience is evident as soon as the overture begins.  Czech puppet theatre
never takes the text for granted.  It searches for subtexts as eagerly as any
Czech novelist.  The subtext here is taken from  Amadeus; an energetic little
Mozart-puppet arrives to conduct the unruly (and unseen, except for the tips of
a few bows) orchestra.  Pretty soon the folio pages of his music are flying
around as he loses patience, and later on in the opera, the musicians have
driven him to drink.  
<BR></P>
<P>Humor  is also a trademark of the puppet theatre.  One marvelous sight that
will stay with me for the rest of my life is a naked, wooden-jointed Don
Giovanni relaxing in the bathtub as Leporello scrubs his back.  Johannes
Schaaf's dark view of the opera as a drama about power, or Jouve's view of the
Don incarnating the seductive appeal of death, would hardly be served by such
knockabout duels and snide jokes at Don Ottavio's expense; but what the heck,
it's all good fun.  Part of the humor&#151;also, sometimes, part of the serious
point&#151;is a contrast of scale.  Leporello, as befits a servant, is smaller
than Don Giovanni.  Donna Elvira seems slightly bigger; no wonder the Don
decides to avoid her!  I wondered how they would treat the Commendatore, who
like most ghosts is difficult to stage without giving rise to unwanted laughter
from the audience. Enter, quite unexpected, a huge and evidently human
puppeteer, clad in mud-covered dungarees, whose face is hidden by the proscenium
arch.  Though they try to escape&#151;in Leporello's case almost successfully&#151;the
puppetmaster hangs each one of them up on the back wall of the stage, in a
fitting and rather dark end to the comedy.  (For those who know the opera well,
it's also an interesting way of coping with the problematic final chorus.) 
<BR></P>
<P>My second puppet opera was Gluck's Orfeo, billed as an experience of the
magic world of baroque theatre invention.  This time the stage was not the
traditional proscenium arch, but a complete building isolated in the middle of
the acting space.  Throughout the production, there was no attempt at
illusionistic theatre; we could see the puppeteers&#151;in fact, the
stringpullers for Orfeo and Euridice were having a tempestuous affair of their
own.  The two pipe-smoking  professors observed the proceedings with
affectionate humor, as well as attempting (sometimes without success) to work
the baroque stage machines.  There was humor enough in this production, too. 
Orfeo's lyre grows wings, and flies away from him.  As he sings to the animals,
a little crocodile swims on to the scene, then begins to cry.  (Crocodile tears,
of course.)  Blindfolded by the god of love, Orfeo bumps into the scenery.  But
the humor only points up the tragedy of the lovers' separation.  The
bigger-than-lifesize head of Orfeo looks for his Euridice as she remains a
doll-like, tiny puppet at the back of the stage; or two Orfeos appear, searching
fruitlessly. 
<BR></P>
<P>The magical theatre of the baroque was everything it had promised.  The
waves of the sea rose and fell, represented by the spiral wave machine, or by
zigzag strips pulling one and then the other way.  The thunderclap machine was
proudly demonstrated; the Furies and the beasts of hell appeared, complemented
by the more modern use of dry ice.  Rainbows sprang from the stage-sky, and at
the very end the God of Love, a little Cupid with arrows pointing down at Orfeo,
was lowered from the top of the stage&#151; truly a deus ex machina. 
<BR></P>
<P>I happen to love opera; but Prague has puppets for every taste.  Surrealist,
soap opera, grand opera, comedy&#151;it's even rumored there's porno puppets,
though I've seen no sign of them.  And of course Prague has its main opera
house, the Estates Theatre; but then, I can see the opera anywhere.  Only in
Prague can I hear the puppets sing.  &#164;

<P><B> News Briefs:</B></P>
<UL>
<LI>The ICTA (Institute of Certified Travel Agents) will launch a new Web page
in September listing travel agents across the country in a database keyed to
destination specialties.  The agencies listed will be those that have completed
special educational programs on travel to particular areas, helping customers
better identify the agent most likely to be able to address the traveler's
interests.  The site's address is <A HREF="http://www.icta.com/">www.icta.com</A><BR><BR></LI>
<LI>The recent airfare frenzy -- sparked by Southwest's temporary $25 domestic
fares -- also brought the first real &quot;boom&quot; in Internet bookings,
according to news reports.  Apparently eager customers encountered so much
difficulty reaching swamped travel agents by phone, they turned <I>en masse</I>
to the Web.  Preview, an online agency in San Fransisco, reached a record
$300,000 a day in online ticketing, while Travelocity, one of the biggest online
travel sites, reported a 500% increase in bookings on their site at
<A HREF="http://www.travelocity.com/">www.travelocity.com</A>.  Other travel
companies with Internet booking capabilities -- including Southwest themselves
-- experienced a similar surge.  </LI></UL>

we're finding some unusually good web pages out there that deserve special
recognition, and these are indicated in the following pages with our European
Visits &quot;#1&quot; ribbon.  We welcome your own Internet picks and pans as
well:  please write to us at eurodata@nas.com to share your online observations

<P><B><I>Booking Air Reservations Online -- EV Tries Three Top Sites</I></B><BR></P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Internet Travel Network:</B>  <A HREF="http://www.itn.net/">www.itn.net</A>
 <BR>An elaborate travel-booking site, which you must register to use (no
cost).  Frankly, if this is the future of travel booking, I'd hang on to my list
of 800 numbers.  It takes an awfully long time to get anything done, there's no
apparent way to start over if you enter something wrong, and after a half-hour
of effort, it came up with a &quot;lowest fare&quot; for Seattle to London and
back -- in coach -- of $3,510.  We'll allow that we probably did something wrong
to get that, but the Byzantine interface makes it hard to figure out what.  We
moved on.<BR><BR></LI>
<LI><B>PC Travel:</B>  <A HREF="http://www.pctravel.com/">www.pctravel.com/</A><BR>Another
elaborate air &amp; hotel booking site, which also requires a no-fee
registration; somewhat easier to use than www.itn.net (though not much -- and
you can't start over here, either).  But at least we could actually afford to
go, as it came up with a Seattle/London fare on BA of $469.55.
<BR><BR></LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI><B>TravelWeb:</B>  <A HREF="http://www.travelweb.com/plane.html">www.travelweb.com/plane.html</A><BR>The
pioneer of online hotel booking has expanded into airline reservations; tickets
are issued by a Seattle travel agency, which sends them out by mail and also
provides a 24-hour customer service number.  Online car rentals through Hertz
are expected soon.  Here, our Seattle/London test turned up a $485.53 fare on
TWA; it was by far the most straightforward of the three sites we tried for
finding an airfare.<BR><BR></LI></UL>
<P><I>Editor's Note: We think all of these folks have a bit to learn about
dealing directly with travelers.  We had been puzzled that the first two sites
ignored our entered preference for TWA, only returning info for other airlines;
then when TravelWeb kicked back our first request with &quot;No available
flights,&quot; we realized that we'd been picking London Heathrow (LHR) as a
destination --  and TWA only flies to London Gatwick (LGW).  But how many folks
would know that if they're scoping out a first trip to Europe?  Ah, well.. it's
a fledgling industry.  They'll get better.</I></P>

<P><B>Forsyth Travel Library</B> is now on the Internet with information on
the full line of rail passes and publications they offer.  Located in Shawnee
Mission, Kansas, Forsyth Travel Library is the US distributor of the <I>Thomas
Cook European Timetable</I> and holds a long-time reputation as one of the
country's leading experts in European rail travel.  They are also authorized
agents for Rail Europe and can provide you with virtually any type of railpass
you require, along with point-to-point tickets, sleeper reservations,
International Youth Hostel memberships, and a good selection of maps and
guidebooks.  The site is still a-building but promises to be interesting.  Visit
them at <A HREF="http://www.forsyth.com./">www.forsyth.com.</A><BR></P>
<P><B>Rick Steves</B>, author of <I>Europe Through the Back Door</I>, can now
be found on <B>America Online</B>.  The well-known guru of off-the-beaten-track
travel hosts a number of online pages which focus both on independent travel and
Steves' own group tours.  Just click on <B>Travel</B> from the AOL Main Menu

<P><B>Trav<I>elocity</I></B>'s enormous Internet site at
<A HREF="http://www.travelocity.com/">www.travelocity.com</A> is open for
business.  There's more travel stuff than you can shake a modem at -- reportedly
200,000 pages all told -- though it suffers somewhat from the &quot;mile wide
and inch deep&quot; syndrome; you can find information about almost everything,
but not very <I>much</I> information about anything.  And they need to fix an
annoying quirk that makes you re-select your destination -- starting at the
continent level and working your way down -- each time you change information
category.  The best parts are found in the descriptions of sights and
attractions and general travel advice, which come from travel info pioneers
Worldview.  Not much for hotels as yet, with lots of listings but only name,
address, and phone offered.  They're taking online reservations for some things
(including air travel) and hold 'live' chat sessions with travel personalities.<BR></P>
<P><IMG SRC="http://www.eurodata.com/elysees.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></P>
<P><B>Rail Pass Express</B> has added a chat room, the <B>Caf&eacute; Elsys&eacute;es</B>,
to their Web site at <A HREF="http://www.eurail.com/">www.eurail.com</A>.  The
online Caf&eacute; was was featured recently at the Internet World confab in San
Fransisco.  Come on in, pour an espresso, and talk travel.  Rail Pass Express is
also in the process of adding a <B>Britain by Britrail</B> site to go with
their excellent <B>Europe by Eurail</B> pages.<BR></P>
<P><B>Travelogix</B>, the worldwide airline, car rental, &amp; hotel
electronic booking service, is going to add an Internet gateway to widen their
market reach.  Currently, you have to use their proprietary software and
dedicated phone lines to use the service, which is $9.95 per month.  No URL

<P><B>The very upscale hotel-and-restaurant group has its own Web page now
with information on properties around the United Kingdom and Europe.  They will
take reservation requests for hotels via e-mail.  (In a side note, they have
also begun taking advance reservations through travel agents for the top-rated,
often hard-to-book restaurants.  But show up -- there's a $60 no-show fee if you
don't.)</B><BR></P>
<H3>Diner's Grapevine</H3>
<P><A HREF="http://www.dinersgrapevine.com/">www.dinersgrapevine.com</A></P>
<P><B>If your budget is less lofty, this site includes quite a few restaurants
in the UK.  We checked it out because they've gotten a pile of awards, but after
a look we're not sure why.  They spend a lot of your bandwidth bragging about
themselves, and when you finally get a restaurant on-screen it tells you very
little.  (Sample description for The Actors' Retreat in London: &quot;Italian.&quot;)</B><BR></P>

<P><A HREF="http://www.dcs.ex.ac.uk/wcol/food_and_acc/trench.html">www.dcs.ex.ac.uk/wcol/food_and_acc/trench.html</A></P>
<P><B>A far more detailed listing of restaurants in England's West Country can
be found here.  They have details of each individual eatery (including pictures
of the proprietors on some).  This is part of the extensive collection of West
Country pages, many of which are very informative.  They do have a tendency to
use overlarge graphics so it's a bit slow going, but often worth the wait.</B></P>

<H3><B>Web Guides</B></H3>
<P><A HREF="http://www.wwwebguides.com/">www.wwwebguides.com</A></P>
<P><IMG SRC="http://www.eurodata.com/gspot2.gif" ALIGN="MIDDLE"><BR><B><I>This
set of pages on England and the UK is a real winner.  (See the sidebar to this
issue's <A HREF="http://www.eurodata.com/thames.htm">article on the Thames</A>,
which was reprinted by permission from a nifty page on the Web Guides site.) 
They've even got a complete Cadogan City Guide, &quot;London&quot; by Andrew
Gumbel, published online.  The entire text of the book is available and is
excellent reading.  You could spend a couple of hours looking at everything
they've put together here.</I></B></P>

<H3>Walking in Britain</H3>
<P><A HREF="http://www.gorp.com/gorp/activity/europe/britain.htm">www.gorp.com/gorp/activity/europe/britain.htm</A></P>
<P><B>&quot;There is an extensive network of local paths throughout the
country, with rights of way extending for some 140,000 miles...&quot;  Thus
begins this page on hoofing it through Britain, and the page extends quite a
ways itself as it imparts a stack of detailed knowledge on the subject. 
National Trails are covered along with less formal routes, and there are plenty
of  specifics on rules of the road and what to watch out for.  A &quot;must read&quot;
if you're planning an English hiking jaunt.  Also a  pleasantly non-commercial
site, though they do advise on the best places to buy maps &amp; gear.</B><BR></P>
<H3>Book-Browsing for the Adventure Traveler</H3>
<P><A HREF="http://www.gorp.com/waisdata/atbook/atsrch.htm">www.gorp.com/waisdata/atbook/atsrch.htm</A></P>
<P><B>You wouldn't believe how many books there are about traveling until you
spend some time here.  A relative of the Walking Britain page cited above, this
site lets you search by keywords for books on various flavors of adventurous
travel worldwide.  Punching in &quot;Europe&quot; brought up a bevy of unusual
titles, including Rock Climbing Guide to Europe, Slovenia Travel Survival Kit,
and Walking in the Black Forest.  Clicking on individual titles gets you a
synopsis, reviews, price, and online ordering information.</B><BR></P>
<H3>Internet Emporium</H3>
<P><A HREF="http://www.emporium.co.uk/hotguide/index.html">www.emporium.co.uk/hotguide/index.html</A></P>
<P><B>This site includes a hefty number of English hotels sorted by city or
county.  Information is limited except for a few &quot;featured&quot; hotels,
but there are a lot of names &amp; UK phone numbers if you're building a list of
possible stopping points.  Pages for the featured hotels are quite detailed,
down to rates and driving maps.<BR></B></P>
<H3>Affordable London</H3>
<P><A HREF="http://www.bynet.co.uk/afldn/index.htm">www.bynet.co.uk/afldn/index.htm</A></P>
<P><B>They offer apartment rentals by the week from $506, and apparently take

<H3>Sisley Garden Tours</H3>
<P><A HREF="http://www.u-net.com/tka/sisley/">www.u-net.com/tka/sisley/</A></P>
<P><B>This user-friendly tour operator offers garden tours in the UK and
France.  Detailed itineraries, booking information, and even a gardening
crossword puzzle are online at this site.  Unfortunately, we've just been
e-mailed that the '96 tours are all filled.  But check it out anyway and think
'97.</B><BR></P>
<H3>Russian National Tourist Office</H3>
<P><A HREF="http://www.interknowledge.com/russia">www.interknowledge.com/russia</A></P>
<P><B>The official site of the Russian National Tourist Office, and very
impressively done.  For Moscow there's a Calendar of Events, Accommodations
Guide, museum hours, and quite a lot more.  St. Petersburg is also covered in
detail.  A must-stop site if you're going to Russia, though hotel information is
limited to names &amp; addresses.  Lots of good pictures which load quickly. 
Linguists only: If you want to test your Cyrillic reading skills, try
www.eurorussia.com.  (You'll need to download special fonts which they have on
hand.)  We have no clue what the site's about, but it certainly looks exotic.</B><BR></P>

<A HREF="http://www.usair.com/">www.usair.com</A></P>

extensive guide to &quot;good value overnight accommodation&quot; in Britain and
Ireland, with B&amp;B rooms averaging &#163;16 per night.  They don't take
reservations (or commissions) but provide you with all the contact information
you need to make your own arrangements.  Very detailed and very comprehensive;
if you've ever wondered where you'd stay in Woolacombe, Devon, they've got three
or four choices for you -- and a pub list to boot.  Exceptionally well-done site
with point-and-click maps, fast graphics, and neat search tools.  You can even 
find inns by such categories as &quot;Converted Barns&quot;, &quot;Older Houses

<P><B>For some quick fun you can do a trace on family roots in Scotland here
-- just type in your surname and click.  The info comes back suspiciously fast,
however, and in pretty short order they want to sell you a mug with &quot;your&quot;
family crest on it.  If you want to look for yourself, they also offer apartment

<P><B>For a more serious take on ancestor-hunting, start out here.  They
provide a full course on how to get started, where to look, and what to look
for.  Then, for Ireland and the United Kingdom, they'll take you into as much
detail as you can handle, on regions, archives, family names, and more.  As far
as we can tell, they won't try to sell you anything at all -- it's run by
genealogical society members who just want to help.</B><BR></P>

<P><B>A home page for the &quot;ideal holiday island&quot; off the coast of

<H2><I><B>A Note from the Editor</B></I></H2>
<P><BR></P>
<P>Quite a few years back, I was astonished to read that the third most popular
activity for American visitors to Europe was &quot;shopping.&quot;  Of course,
in those days I was mostly a hitchhiking, hostel-sleeping,
Europe-on-no-money-a-day traveler, and what shopping I did involved tracking the
cheapest sausage vendors on the Messenplatz.  But still, I thought, even if one
could afford it this seemed an odd way to spend precious days in Europe; one
could shop anywhere.
<BR></P>
<P>Now that I have a few more trips behind me, and have by sheer longevity
acquired a bit more affluence (or at least more credit cards), I must admit to
being seduced now and then by the pure fun of Buying Things.  There is the
wooden bowl from the Ponte St Angelo in Rome; I'm sure I overpaid by a factor of
five&#151;I avoid noticing the same thing at Pier 1 for $2.99&#151;but it was
worth it to hear the hawker's entertainingly presented tale of woe.  There's the
cast-iron bell from Prague, which I watched the craftsman make with charcoal and
bellows; and the coffee tin from Salzburg, after a decade still vaguely holding
the scent, at least in my imagination, of the B&auml;ckerei am Markt where I
lingered over melange on a chilly morning by the River Salzach.  None of these
is important for what it is&#151;despite earnest effort, I have yet to find a 
need for a cast-iron bell&#151;but for the where, and when, and how-it-smelled
and how-it-sounded of the day I bought them.  Even more fun, in a way, are the
practical items for which there was a sudden need abroad, and which remain on
the job long after returning home:  the sturdy shoes I bought in Paris the day
my ancient, beloved hiking boots finally gave out; a razor I picked up at the
Stockholm railway station, and still use daily (well, okay, on days that I
actually leave the house).  Even though such items are no different from what I
might buy in town, I know the difference, and when I take them in hand or put
them on my feet, they smile to me in a way that K-Mart never will. 
<BR></P>
<P>We have a great overview of European shopping this issue, courtesy of Diane
Marshall; a tip on getting your VAT back; and a profile by Sophia Dembling of
some fascinating little shops in Amsterdam.  If you're going over for the
holidays, Jerri Clark Kirby has notes on Christmas in France, England, and
Germany (plus recipes, if you're staying home).  She also advises us on how to
keep your wallet in Rome, while Susan Milligan suggests ways to enjoy Paris
without much in it.   All this and Portugal, Prague, Frankfurt, and much more. 
Our gifts to you under the EV tree&#151;hope you like them.<BR></P>

<P>&#164; <B>Thank you</B>, and thank you for no photos [in the Internet
edition].  I waste so much time and money with graphics and those of us
interested in travel probably have spent a lot of time looking at beautiful
pictures previously.   The Albanian article was concise, informative and just
what I have been looking for for years.  When we moved to Chicago in 1979, an
ultra-left group was plastering the city with handbills asking us to join the
revolutionary Albanian movement.   There is an Albanian community here I believe&#151;the
Belushi family is sometimes mentioned as part of it&#151;but these folks were
coming from somewhere else!  Thanks for a real life look at this newly available
country.  	<BR>-- Carroll
</P>
<P><B>&#164; I'm visiting your site for the first time today</B> and enjoying
it immensely.  The articles are not only informative but extremely well written.
I am a specialty travel planner for upscale, leisure travel.  I can never have
too many resources!  Thanks!  										<BR>--Carolyn Patterson</P>
<P><B>&#164; I do enjoy your magazine</B>&#151;it's the most informative one
I've found online for places I have visited and plan to visit.  The article on
London and the area along the Thames was excellent. I printed it out and used it
while I was in London. It was accurate and I appreciate the information supplied
by the author, Jerri Clark Kirby.  Keep up the good work!   			<BR>	--Jim

<H1>Athens, Eye of Greece</H1>
<P><I>by Jerri Clark Kirby</I></P>
<HR>
<P><B>&quot;Athens, the eye of Greece, Mother of Arts</B></P>
<P>   <B> And eloquence.&quot;</B> -  <I>Paradise Regained,  John Milton</I></P>
<P></P>
<P>Look at a map of Europe; you'll realize that Greece has survived the
centuries in isolated splendor, separated from the rest of Europe by rugged
mountains to the north, its jagged coastline wrapped by three beautiful, deep
blue seas. Aside from the peninsula, which includes its venerable capital
Athens, there are some 14,000 sun-drenched islands, as inviting to travelers
today as they were to the earliest sailing explorers. 
</P>
<P>Entry procedures through Athens Passport Control and Customs are efficient
and fairly quick. From plane to customs' clearance took us less than 20 minutes.
 A quick stop to purchase drachmas at an airport bank (always open), and we were
off to explore ancient and new Athens.  Taxi cabs in Athens are cheap:  a 15
minute ride from the airport to our hotel was about 1300 drachmas, or
approximately $5.50; to the center of town would cost about 2000 drachmas, or
around $8.50.  Presently there are about 235 drachmas in one dollar.  Remember
that you can negotiate a price to your destination, but do so before you get
into the taxi.  Given the relatively low cost of Athens' hotels, we decided to
pamper ourselves at the five-star Ledra Marriott.   Among the outstanding
features of this particular hotel are non-smoking rooms, terry cloth
dressing-gowns in each room, complimentary newspapers each morning, a regular
shuttle bus to and from the center of town and -- most important to us -- a
flexible check-out time with no extra charge for staying a little longer.  This
courtesy is allowed guests except at the highest peak tourist times; all you
need do is make your wishes known at the desk.</P>
<P>A Greek businessman on our flight to Athens recommended the Kona Kai
restaurant at the Marriott as one of the best in town, and this Polynesian/
Japanese style restaurant has our vote. Food and service are splendid. There are
three restaurants and a roof-top lounge in the Ledra Marriott, all worthy of at
least one visit.  We elected to take our own leisurely walking tour the first
day. Since this was a return trip for us, the walk was designed to get the kinks
out and  re-acquaint us with one of our favorite cities.  Wearing comfortable
shoes and armed with a map and walking tour suggestions, we started out from
Syntagma Square (Constitution Square -- so named because it was here in 1843
that Athenians gathered and refused to leave until their first constitution was
completed, signed and sealed).</P>
<P>The Palace, with its impressive Greek columns and built by King Othonos in
1832, dominates the square.  It stands protectively over the tomb of the Unknown
Soldier, which is guarded by the elite skirted Evzone troops.  We watched the
colorful changing of the guard, executed with military precision by young men
who must be at least six feet tall to qualify for membership.  Throughout the
square, fat, healthy pigeons -- whose feeding is provided for by an official act
of Parliament --  are willing subjects for pictures, asking only a small fee of
peanuts (sold by nearby vendors).</P>
<P>About 100 yards from Syntagma Square are the National (formerly Royal)
Gardens, containing plant life from all over the Mediterranean.  Well-tended,
the Gardens produce a new pleasure at every turn.  Ancient and new statuary, a
small zoo, a duck pond, beautiful landscaping, lovely fountains and birds are
all there to delight you; or you may sit on one of the plentiful, clean benches
and watch the Greek world go by.  If you wish, you may also share your lunch
with one of Athens' uncountable cats, who like the pigeons are healthy and
well-fed. Quite regal, these Athens cats have always been a part of Greek
history and background scenery, and like the Greek people they are warm and
friendly.</P>
<P>Zappeion Park adjoins the Gardens and offers more serenity and calmness in
the midst of a bustling, crowded city.   We walked by the Royal Palace, now a
residence for visiting state dignitaries; the stadium, built in 1895 for the
modern version of the Olympic games; the Temple of Zeus, the largest of the
area's ancient temples, which was begun in the 6th century BC and took over 700
years to build; and Hadrian's Arch, built for a regal entry into the city by the
Roman Emperor.  We spent our day wandering happily through a few more monuments
to Athens' colorful history before finally arriving at the foot of the
Acropolis.  Here, for about $2.00, you can wander around the Parthenon, take
pictures, visit the small but complete archaeological museum, and view a
breathtaking Athens from the Sacred Rock (understandably referred to as the &quot;Crown
of Athens.&quot;) 	
</P>
<P>American Express, along with many other large &amp; small travel
organizations, offers half-day and full-day bus tours year round.  Buses are
modern, comfortable and air-conditioned.  Prices are designed for every budget
and guides speak fluent English, as well as many other languages. Tourist
information is available everywhere and native Greeks, who all seem to speak
English, are friendly and helpful.  From half-day bus tours of Athens to week
long cruises of the Greek Isles, an abundance of offerings guarantee your
enjoyment of Greece. You may elect to make all your arrangements before you
leave home, but personally I would recommend that you wait until you reach
Athens. On your own, you may explore on foot, by taxi, bus, train, rented car,
row boat or yacht. Whatever your needs and preferences, they are readily met.
</P>
<P>Shopping in Athens is still a bargain and you truly have not been to Athens
without at least a day spent in the Plaka and a meal in one of the famous Greek
tavernas, where food is delicious and cheap.  The Plaka is known world-wide for
its shops which offer virtually everything for sale, from linen kitchen towels
imprinted with Greek recipes to the finest furs and leather goods.  Film is the
exception; it is very expensive here and I suggest that you bring your own ample
supply, because you will find a picture at every step.  Bargaining is acceptable
in some shops and stalls, although it is done a little more quietly, and with a
little more reserve, than in the market places of the Middle East.</P>
<P>Adjoining the Plaka is the internationally known Flea Market, where it is
said that one can buy absolutely anything, new or used, at a reasonable or even
exceptionally low price.  Good antiques can be found here and the knowledgeable
can acquire them for marvelously low prices. Bargaining is more serious and less
subdued than in the Plaka.  Whatever you buy, it will be a bargain and your
drachmas will have purchased a souvenir of an unforgettable journey.  Coffee and
tea are regularly offered to customers in the shops and stalls of the Plaka and
the Flea Market. To refuse a shopkeeper's hospitality is to deny yourself a
pleasant social interlude with a warm, vital human being whose love for his
country and its long and colorful history is apparent and abundant, and whose
hospitality and friendship are genuine.</P>
<P>One shopkeeper, who immediately remembered us from previous visits, is
George Spiliopoulos on Filotheis Street in the Plaka. His store, A.Spiliopoulos
&amp; Sons, was founded by his father Athanasios and has been in the same
location for 65 years.   Handbags, shoes, sandals, boots and other leather
accessories are all hand-made by the family.  Athanasios Spiliopoulos, a
sprightly 96 years old, still hand-sews sandals and belts in the store. He
visits with customers and drinks lots of coffee for energy.  Prices here are the
best we have found in the Plaka for leather goods; anyone who shops the Plaka in
Athens is likely to remember this store.  
</P>
<P>Allow yourself plenty of time in Athens. Mingle with the friendly Greek
people, absorb the past, and enjoy the delicious Greek food and wine. Athens is
a magnetic place. You'll probably return.   &#164;

<H1>When the Danube is Blue</H1>
<P><I>by Nathalie Zeidman</I></P>
<HR>
<P><BR></P>
<P>Even if its &quot;Beautiful Blue Danube&quot; isn't really blue, Budapest
will be true to your fondest imaginations.  There are always the spas and the
Gypsy music; and of course, there is the food.  In Budapest, every meal is a
feast -- even breakfast!  The Gallert Hotel's forty-foot buffet starts with
yogurt and kefir, continues with salads, cold meats, and local cheeses, and goes
on and on with eggs and sausage, fruit and sweets.</P>
<P>One food tourists can count on is red peppers, both sweet and hot like the
Hungarian temperament.  At breakfast this lipstick fruit is served pickled,
stewed, or scrambled with eggs; for lunch or dinner, stuffed with ground meat;
at any meal, baked and dressed with olive oil as salad.  Not to forget peppers
dried, finely ground into powder, and sprinkled as paprika on everything but
strudel.</P>
<P>Gulyas (goulash), a rich soup thick with meat and vegetables, is also
standard on the menu.  For something more delicate, try the Gundel Restaurant's
cold strawberry soup floating a dab of sour cream.  Catering to gourmets since
the days of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Gundel, through cold wars and hot, has
scarcely deviated in its presentation and quality.  Besides Gundel's, there's
Hungaria, Karpatia, and Alabardos, among the best in a string of first-rate
restaurants.  Most big hotels also serve good food, along with Gypsy violins and
Magyar dancers.  In Budapest, no one just eats; everyone dines, whether it's on
the Buda or the Pest side of the Danube.</P>
<P>But don't worry about the figure -- what's put on at Gundel's can come off
(maybe) at the Thermal or Gellert Spas.  Spas have been a way of life ever since
the Romans encamped at Aquincum on the outskirts of Obuda (Old Buda) and
discovered the thermal waters.  Mosaic floors and remains of public baths (on
most tours) attest to the Romans' pleasure in a soak, a sweat, and a swim. 
Today's Budapest still provides those pleasures.  Gellert's Spa, for one, sports
more therapy baths and specialized massages than even the most decadent
Westerner has time for. 
</P>
<P>Budapest's newest is the Thermal Spa-Hotel on Margaret Island, an extensive
recreational parkland encircled by two branches of the Danube and reached by
launch, bus, or car.  The Thermal has the latest in medical equipment --
laboratory, x-ray, EKG -- in addition to its thermal pools, swimming pools,
saunas, mudpacks, water jet massages, curative gymnastics, electro-therapy, and
much more.  The Spa claims that its mineral water effectively treats a number of
chronic diseases, including osteoarthritis.  I have a friend who's been taking
the Thermal's cure since the hotel opened in 1979.  I think she's also been
taken at the Thermal's casino.</P>
<P>The Hilton, high on Castle Hill, also has a casino but no spa.  It's
magnificent views are curative, and the way it enfolds the remains of a
beautifully preserved 13th-century Dominican church into its contemporary
structure makes it the most unusual hotel in the Hilton chain.  On the Pest side
of the Danube, the Duna Inter-Continental, the Atrium-Hyatt, and the Forum line
up along the river, all within walking distance of interesting restaurants.</P>
<P>In Budapest, however, neither man nor woman lives by goulash alone; not with
a museum on almost every corner.  The exhibits at the National Museum include a
library from the country estate of a nobleman -- complete with original
paneling, fireplace, and hunting trophies -- and the rug-laden tent of a Turkish
general.  The Museum of Fine Arts displays a modest collection of old masters. 
As an added bonus, chamber music is often played in this museum's acoustically
perfect court. 
</P>
<P>The Castle, built by Empress Marie Therese high on a Buda hill overlooking
the Danube, houses several museums.  In one wing the National Gallery shows the
work of Hungarian artists spanning the centuries.  In another, archeological
digs reveal the ruins of a Gothic castle under the present one.  In some ways,
the view from the Castle Terrace is the Castle's premiere exhibit; on the
terrace, Prince Eugene of Savoy, astride his larger-than-life bronze horse,
surveys all of Pest.  It's a grand opera set, with  the stunning Neo-Gothic
Parliament Building at center stage.  If the Prince could turn his head north,
Margaret Island, the Buda Hills, and the Danube Bend would come into focus;
south, the impressive Chain Bridge.  Be warned: your arrival at the Castle
Terrace is not a good time to run out of film! 
</P>
<P>It's a comfortable walk from the Castle to Matthias Church, Budapest's
13th-century coronation basilica.  Around the corner from Matthias Square are
two of the city's most patronized pastry shops, noted for the nut torta, the
Korona and the Ruswurm.  The ultimate sweet experience is at Gerbaud's on
Vorosmarty Square; whether served in the red-damasked shop or on the terrace,
its strudel flakes at a sigh, and the dobestorta -- a multi-layered cake held
together with apricot preserve and glazed with burnt sugar -- is beyond compare.

</P>
<P>Gerbaud's is conveniently centered among Budapest's most fashionable shops,
selling everything from Herend china (a bargain) to peasant embroidery (pricey)
to couturier fashions at K-mart prices.  But before cashing that last traveler's
cheque for an Yves Saint Laurent look-alike, plan a Danube Bend trip by boat or
bus.  A typical tour includes the medieval fortress of Visegrad, the oldest
church in Hungary at Eztergom, Margit Kovacs Museum in Szentendre, as well as
lunch and wine-tasting.  Make it a priority! 
</P>
<P>When the end of the day finds you museumed- and toured-out, get pampered at
a spa, then plan an evening of theater.  Don't be put off by the 7:30pm curtain,
just when restaurants are opening their doors; during intermissions a buffet
laden with open-faced caviar and crabmeat sandwiches, pastries, ice cream, and
wine and coffee, is available.  Budapest is the city of List and Lehar, Bartok
and Kodaly.  The Erkel Theater and the State Opera House, both recently restored
to their former gilded luster, host local and visiting orchestras, ensembles,
and opera companies.  But the music everyone loves to love is Tzigane music; in
every restaurant, Gypsy violins move from table to table, singling, crying,
flirting, and turning a routine dinner into a second honeymoon (or thoughts of
one).  Later, throbbing melodies escape into the night, gracing the river with a
final touch of magic.  Under the spell of Gypsy fiddles, the Danube is blue.   &#164;</P>

<H1>Discovering The Effects of a Turkish Bath</H1>
<P><I>by Jerri Clark Kirby</I></P>
<HR>
<H2><B><I>The Pleasure Known As &quot;Hamam&quot;</I></B></H2>
<P><BR></P>
<P>Overlooked far too often by visitors to Turkey is one of their most
rewarding cultural exports. The Turkish bath, known as <I>hamam</I> in Turkish,
serves as much more than a place to take a bath: in Turkey, it is a place to
meet old and new friends.  Unfortunately,  the original purpose of the hamam is
becoming less important, resulting in fewer hamams. Yet Turkish people do still
go there to socialize.<BR></P>
<P>I had heard from worldly friends of the great after-effects of a Turkish
bath and wanted to go.  Having finally convinced my thoroughly western companion
that she would not come to some horrible end, we learned from a
tourist-guide-turned-friend that the Galatasaray Hamam, in an older part of
Istanbul was a good place to go.  So, off we went!<BR></P>
<P>I must confess that I was not without concern since I knew nothing of what
to expect.  My imagination had images of both of us suffocating in 500&#186;
steam, with old women removing at least three layers of skin with sand paper...
we would change back into our street clothes only to find that we had each
shrunk by half a foot.   My friend Jane was thinking much along the same lines. 
With good timing, we came to the mutual conclusion that we were being foolish
just as we arrived, and bravely marched into the women's door.  (Men's and
women's hamams are separate.)<BR></P>
<P>My apprehension diminished when I saw, not the 200-pound woman with a club
that I had imagined, but a very pleasant lady -- obviously experienced in
dealing with amateurs like ourselves.  She took our entrance fee, about 
US$2.50; for a little more, you can also have a massage.  This grandmotherly
lady said something in Turkish, to which we nodded uncomprehending and went into
the indicated room to change. Jane and I, both unused to changing in locker room
conditions, hesitated at first, looking for curtains to draw, shades to pull or
a door to hide behind. There was only one other lady, in the changing room
opposite. She was putting on her street clothes and her departure left the hamam
virtually empty.<BR></P>
<P>I quickly changed and draped the huge towel around me; Jane did likewise and
we looked at each other with &quot;what do we do now?&quot; looks.  The same
nice lady who had shown us in magically reappeared.  She managed to convey to us
that we needed to buy a bar of soap.  The cost was the equivalent of about 9 or
ten cents in U.S. money. (You can avoid the confusion by bringing your own
soap.)  Now the real terror surfaced: we stepped through the door to...the
hamam.<BR></P>
<P>But of course, there was nothing to be terrified about. The high-ceiling,
humid room was square.  Small sinks lined four walls.  A mysterious, large
marble slab was in the middle of the room.  Every so often, a drop of cold water
would plink down from the ceiling where the humidity had condensed.  The
grandmotherly woman, who was by now a friend, turned on one of the spigots and
hot water gushed out.   Soon it overflowed the small marble sink and spilled
onto the floor.  She gave us each a plastic bowl and, after we hung up our
towels, she started pouring hot water over us and chatting, still in Turkish. 
Then, she left us -- the only ones there -- to figure out what to do next.<BR></P>
<P>After a little indecision, we decided to lather up and rinse off.  Now what?
 We were stumped again until I remembered that my worldly friends had mentioned
something about &quot;lying on a marble slab.&quot;  We put cautious hands on
the marble first, just to make sure we wouldn't be fried.  The marble was
lukewarm and, as we became more confident, we moved towards the center of the
slab which became consistently warmer. So, we decided to relax on the slab --
and relaxing it was.<BR></P>
<P>Then a very tall, even older lady walked in, flashing us an incomplete but
reassuring smile. I tried to hide my relief as she claimed Jane as her first
victim.   &quot;It won't be all that bad,&quot; I reassured.  (Easy for me to
say!)  But any fears were again unnecessary.  All the nice lady did was
thoroughly scrub Jane with a soft washcloth and small shavings of soap, flip her
over like a fish, and do the reverse side.  Then she motioned for Jane to rinse
off and did the same for me before starting on Jane again, this time with
serious scrubbing in mind and a rougher scrubbing cloth, a <I>kese</I>, in
hand.  It was not sandpaper but was rough; to my grateful surprise, when my turn
arrived no skin scraped off and I actually felt all the things I was supposed to
feel:  rejuvenated, energetic and, above all, immensely clean.<BR></P>
<P>By now, we were completely at ease with our scrubbing friend, who sat down
near a sink and motioned for Jane to come and sit in front of her.  Then she
poured half the contents of a plastic vial into her hands.  It was shampoo and
she began to vigorously scrub Jane's hair and head. (When you reach this point,
remember to keep your mouth and eyes closed as she will probably scrub your
face, too.  Poor Jane, being first, wound up with a mouth full of lather.) 
After she finished, we rinsed off and went to change. Hair dryers were provided
and tips are expected after you change; the equivalent of a quarter to each lady
is eagerly appreciated.  We emerged spanking clean, with wide open pores ready
to soak in all the pollution of the big city.<BR></P>
<P>Hamans are usually less crowded at midday. However, at the end of a long day
of sightseeing, we went again and, overcoming our shyness, we shared the hamam
with other ladies, all of whom were Turkish. Once again we left feeling clean
and refreshed.<BR></P>
<P>Don't be afraid; going to a hamam is fun. Limited knowledge of the language
won't deter you from enjoying Galatasaray or any of the other reputable hamams
in Istanbul.  Reliable hotel people or tour guides can steer you in the right
direction for an experience that both business travelers and tourists will
enjoy. There is one warning, however. Beware of drinking alcoholic beverages
right after a trip to the hamam.  The alcohol goes through your system like a
bolt of lighting and, I am told, a new dimension in hangovers is born. Instead,
try a fresh fruit juice at the juice bar in your hamam or the juice stand just
outside.  Never will it have tasted so good!  &#164;</P>

<H1>Roman Baths</H1>
<P><I>by James M. Dorsey</I></P>
<P><BR></P>
<P>The ancient Romans in Asia Minor certainly knew how to take a bath. 
Elaborate bath houses have been unearthed on Turkey's southern coast at the
ancient cities of Ephesus and Pergamon, showing elaborate heating and plumbing
systems.   But the luxury of the Roman bath is demonstrated nowhere better than
further inland at Pamukkale and the nearby ancient city of Heirapolis.<BR></P>
<P>About 20km from the Turkish city of Denizli, Pamukkale sits atop a set of
spectacular white cliffs covered in calcium.  Bubbling hot water from volcanic
springs has formed a series of shallow pools atop the cliffs.  The water
trickling down the cliffs over thousands of years has left a wedding-cake like
icing of white across the whole  mountainside.  Ailing Romans from all over the
empire once flocked to the site  and the purpose-built bath house to enjoy the
natural springs in  the hope of finding a miracle cure in the boiling mineral
waters.<BR></P>
<P>Now the site is a haven for modern tourists who can enjoy the luxury spring
baths from their hotel accommodation.  With the water a natural 48 degrees
Celsius, large communal  baths at Pamakkule give tourists a taste of old roman
luxury and  take the Turkish bath experience to a new level.  Signs in hotels,
signed by a Professor Dr. Nurten Ozer, detail  the health and mineral properties
of the waters.  According to the University of Istanbul's &quot;Medical Ecology
and  Hydro Climatology Search Application Centre&quot;, the waters can  relieve
a range of ills including rheumatoid disease, circulatory  system  disorders and
&quot;syndromes with peripheral vessel spasms&quot;.  So popular were the waters
among elderly and frail Romans that the city of Hierapolis was built here from
190 BC.<BR></P>
<P>The ruins, including the old bath house and 15,000 seat  amphitheater,
remain remarkably well preserved despite about 2000 years of earthquake
activity.  But the spectacular remains of the Necropolis, or cemetery,  attest
to the fact the waters did not do all the old Romans had  hoped.  St. Philip the
Apostle once visited, but the waters did him no  good. He was stoned to death
here while suspended upside-down on a  crucifix. A small church marks the place
of his martyrdom.<BR></P>
<P>At Ephesus, the magnificent ruins on the Aegean coast about  300km west, the
Romans proved their expertise with plumbing and water supplies.  The bath house,
an important meeting place in the centre of  town, was given to the city by the
most prominent woman citizen,  Scholastica the brothel owner.  The bath house
had four main bathing rooms. The heated water was pumped through each with the
water temperature regulated to  gradually cool as it passed from room to room. 
The hottest water also was pumped through vertical wall pipes to heat the
building.  Down the street, the used bath water provided a steady flow  through
the cisterns under the public toilets, which housed up to  40 customers a time
in an open room.  Here again the hotter water was pumped through pipes to
provide  warmth for the cold stone seats.  Today, visitors to the site can sit
on the old toilet seats, and marvel at the talents of the Roman plumbers.  &#164;</P>

<H2>A NOTE FROM THE EDITOR</H2>
<HR>
<P>Britain remains far and away the most popular destination for Americans
going abroad.  Beyond the links of our common (more or less) language and shared
history, the attractions of &quot;this realm, this England&quot; are many and
varied.  London is one of the world's most vibrant and interesting cities, and
one of the most visitor-friendly.  From its earliest days as a Roman port, to
the world-leading days of Empire, to the courageous stand against tyranny in
World War II, London has also been a uniquely important player in the tale of
Western civilization, and its history is worn proudly in its natural and
man-made landmarks, its rich culture, and its diverse population.  Any trip to
Europe that begins with an arrival in London is well-begun indeed.<BR></P>
<P>One of the great things about the debut of the &quot;Chunnel&quot; train is
that it makes starting your trip this way much easier than it has been in the
past.  No longer must you set aside precious days merely to negotiate the
ferries, hovercrafts, customs points, coaches, airports, and inevitable long
queues that separated island from continent.  Now it's just another train ride;
in this issue of <B><I>EV</I></B>, which is largely focused on England, new
contributor <B>Bosley</B> <B>Wilder</B> gives us a passenger-eye view of this
swift EuroStar service on its run from Paris' Gare du Nord station to London's
Waterloo.  And in London, writer <B>Jerri Clark Kirby</B> returns to <B><I>EV</I></B>
to take us on a ride down the Thames, with glances at the numerous  riverside
points of interest.<BR></P>
<P>Of course there's a lot more to England than its capital, and in other
articles our writers offer views of Plymouth, Chester, Ambleside and the Lakes
District, and Chichester.  We're also honored to present a guest appearance from
renowned travel writers <B>George and LaVerne Ferguson</B>, who have kindly
shared with us an excerpt on royal Windsor from their popular <B><I>Britain by
Britrail</I></B> guide.  Another guest writer is a rather unusual one:  we've
come across a book called <I><B>A Satchel Guide for the Vacation Tourist in
Europe</B></I>, published in Boston in 1880, and in this issue we offer the
anonymous writer's long-ago observations on the historic cathedral at York. 
We'll be revisiting the <I>Satchel Guide</I> regularly in future issues, both
for excerpts of its timeless (and quite good) travel writing, and for some
fascinating glimpses at the European traveler's world of a century past.<BR></P>
<P>We do branch out from Merrie Old England to present a few other European
views:  <B>Bob</B> <B>Koff</B>, an expat living in St. Petersburg, gives us a
tour of his weekend; <B>Joyce Gregory Wyels</B> makes her first appearance in
EV to review some wonderful French eateries; and we get two looks at Turkish
baths, with a first-hand account from the prolific <B>Jerri Kirby</B> and a bit
of historical perspective courtesy of <B>James M. Dorsey</B>.  Finally, we have
several interesting short essays from Londoner
<B>David Whitehouse</B> under our <B>Europe Writes..</B> heading; and a
whopping five pages of buys and bargains in this issue's <B>Check It Out</B>
section.<BR></P>
<P>Hope you enjoy every bit of it.  As always, please don't hesitate to write
or <A HREF="mailto:72677.3722@compuserve.com">email</A> if you have
suggestions, gripes, or (best of all) tales of your own to tell.<BR></P>

<H2><I>About the cover...  </I></H2>
<P>The unusual cover art on our print edition this issue comes from <I>Image
Europa</I>, a computer-graphics studio specializing in images of European scenes
and landmarks.  In addition to being rather pretty, their illustrations -- which
are created from computer-enhanced photographs -- offer an opportunity for <B><I>EV</I></B>
to hold its own brand of &quot;Where Are You?&quot; contest.  Can you identify

<H1><FONT COLOR="#004080">A Note from the Editor</FONT></H1>
<HR>
<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF0080">Welcome to the third issue of European Visits.</FONT></B>
 In this issue we take a look at some of the ways of getting around Europe:
bicycle, foot, motorcoach, narrow guage train -- even horse-drawn wagon. 
Although personally I remain partial to the comfortable pleasures of EC rail, I
have to admit our writers have offered some intriguing and tempting
alternatives.<BR></P>
<P>There are a few conveyances we didn't cover, only because we couldn't find
articles to print:  travel by river and canal, for example, is something we'd
very much like to explore with our readers.  Anyone out there have a tale to
tell?  Taken a self-drive boat or a luxury hotel barge?  Or, have you loaded
your rental car aboard a car/sleeper train?  Barreled down the Alps on inline
skates?  Ridden a packmule through Estonia?  Pull together your notes or
recollections and send us a story.  You can take a look at the contributor
guidelines <A HREF="http://www.eurodata.com/submit.htm">here</A>.<BR></P>
<P>Of course, if you're getting around you're also getting <I>somewhere</I>. 
So we've covered a few of our favorite <I>somewheres</I> in this issue too,
with fine articles on Vienna and Edinburgh.  We also have our usual eclectic
glances at Europe and European travel with more <I>Notes from London </I>from
David Whitehouse, and a new column  -- <I>Miss Elainey's Notes</I> -- offering
bits and pieces of news and gossip from Over There. And as usual, we have pages
jam-packed with items of interest for European travelers in our <I>Check It Out</I>
and <I>Online Traveler</I> sections. <BR></P>
<P>We've gone a bit more <FONT COLOR="#FF0080">colorful</FONT> in the online
edition this time, but we're still foregoing graphics and pictures for the most
part.  It isn't that we're anti-illustration; we just aren't convinced that very
many of the jpegs and gifs on the Net are worth the time it takes to receive
them.  Some of our contributors have accompanied their articles with gorgeous
glossy photos, but we tend to think that the place for gorgeous glossy photos is
in gorgeous glossy magazines, and there are plenty of those on the news stand. 
The online edition of <I><B>European Visits</B></I> was originally conceived
as a way to put informative text about European travel &amp; destinations in a
format that users of our <B>EuroData&reg;</B> itinerary-planning program could
download for use in their travel plans; though it has since evolved into
something a bit more elaborate, we still think that thoughtful travelers value
the written word, and that words are the best way to convey most information. 
What's your opinion?  So far, we've received four letters on the graphics vs.
no-graphics topic -- all four were &quot;thank you&quot; notes for keeping our
pages fast and simple.  (We did get one missive from a &quot;reader&quot; who
informed us that we desperately needed some Java animation to liven things up;
on further discussion, it proved that the correspondent was a consultant
specializing in developing Java animations.  Hmm.)<BR></P>
<P>Finally, we received a number of guesses on last issue's cover contest, but
nobody got it right except the editor's mother, and we couldn't give her the
prize.  The answer?  Our #2 cover illustration was created from a photograph of
the vividly colorful, beautifully proportioned rear staircase at <B>London's
Victoria &amp; Albert Museum</B>.  We'll do another contest soon -- and we'll
try not to make it so hard next time!<BR></P>
<P>I hope you enjoy the issue.  As always, your letters and comments are more
than welcome: just e-mail us at <A HREF="mailto:eurodata@nas.com">eurodata@nas.com</A>
and let us know what you think.<BR></P>

<P><STRONG><EM><FONT COLOR="#FF0080">Tips for Traveling Awheel</FONT></EM></STRONG><BR></P>
<P>One of the best ways of exploring the locale when on a tour or holiday is by
bicycle.  It is slow enough to allow you to blend into the pace of life and mix
with the people, while still allowing you to travel reasonable distances and see
some diversity in a limited time.  However, potential cycle-tourists have many
questions:  How far can I expect to travel in a day if I haven't ridden a bike
for twenty years?  How do I transport the bike from one country to another? 
What about my luggage?  Can I avoid busy highways?......and so on.   So, if you
are tempted by travel awheel, with the breeze in your hair and the birds
singing, here are a few answers to get you going.<BR></P>
<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF0080">Hiring:</FONT></B>  The hiring of a bike is
possible in just about every country in Europe.  In the Netherlands a basic
three-speed machine can be hired easily from most rail stations or bike shops
for about $5 a day and perhaps a deposit or passport details. These are
generally well maintained and perfectly adequate for the terrain. (You will find
that everyone else is riding one very similar.)  Other countries where hiring is
easy and widespread include Belgium, Northern Germany, France (SNCF rail
stations) and Denmark.  In France it is possible to hire a basic bike at one
station and then leave it at another.  In mountainous areas there are often
mountain bike hire centres that have grown around climbing and hiking centres. 
Chamonix in the French Alps was one of the first and has some of the best
off-road terrain available, though it is only for the fit.  In countries where
the general public does not cycle so readily, the availability of cycles for
hire is less evident; however, the local tourist information office can usually
find at least one hire centre for you.<BR></P>
<P>If you bring your own cycle to Europe, you may wonder how to transport it
from one area of interest to another without riding the intervening miles. Well,
there are a number of alternatives.<BR></P>
<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF0080">Air:</FONT></B>  To bring your trusty steed from
North America in the first place you will by all likelihood have flown across
the Atlantic with it.  (Unless you can afford to ship it separately, or come
over on the QE2!)  Flying trans-Atlantic is probably the easiest flight to make
with a bicycle as the standard luggage allowances are that much higher on these
flights  (two pieces of luggage, each not to exceed 32kg as opposed to a 20kg
maximum on other flights).  Some tips, though:  make sure you confirm that the
airline knows that you are bringing a bicycle and check their packing
requirements.  If they do not require the bike to be boxed then turn the
handlebars sideways and remove the pedals and other extremities.  I do not box
my bike if I don't have to, because at least an unboxed cycle is obvious to
baggage handlers as a reasonably fragile item, unlike a cardboard box which may
end up at the bottom of a luggage container.<BR> </P>
<P>In Europe luggage restrictions on flights are often limiting, but one trick
is to take the bike as one piece of luggage, then put all the other bags into a
sack and make that the other piece whilst placing any heavy objects into your
hand luggage. Some airlines charge for carrying a bike.  Shop around, if
possible, for the more cycle-friendly airlines. <BR></P>
<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF0080">Train:</FONT></B>  There is some disparity among
rail operators and their cycle carrying policies. I have known a bike to be sent
on a day ahead in Spain, only to arrive two days after the owner.  Quite a few
rail services carry bikes on separate services to the rider, but charge quite
highly for it.   On British rail services there is a booking system and a $4.50
fee to take a bike on Inter-city services and a first-come, first-served system
on local services off-peak.  In France bikes travel separately on most long
distance services.  Channel tunnel services were supposed to be carrying
bicycles from the onset, and even had the carrying hooks fitted, but there were
some problems early on, so it is best to check for current policies.  Another
service that was to be introduced prior to the summer of '96 was a ride-on
service between the Chunnel terminals, to compete with the cross-Channel
ferries.  With so much disparity between services in different countries, the
best advice with is to check with the national tourist bureaus of the countries
you intend to visit.<BR></P>
<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF0080">Ferry:</FONT></B>  Most ferry services in Europe
do not charge to carry a bicycle (or other human-powered vehicles -- e.g.
tandems, trikes etc.) and only charge the rider a foot-passenger fee. One
exception seems to be Scandinavian Seaways who charge a few dollars for the bike
per single crossing.  On most services a place can be obtained on the day of
sailing; if the service is particularly infrequent, it may pay to book a few
days in advance.  Bicycles enter the car deck with the other vehicles, so take
care on the decks and watch for oily patches that are slippery.  Crew members
will direct you to a corner where your machine can be left (locked).  Remember
to take all you will need for the voyage from the bike, as you cannot return to
the car-deck while the ship is at sea.  This is particularly important to
remember on the longer sailings!  Personally I find ferries a wonderful way to
travel and a useful source of inexpensive overnight accommodation -- it's almost
like a mini-cruise.</P>
<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF0080">Bus:</FONT></B>  Long-distance buses used to be
totally against carrying bikes, but now some operators have seen the light and
allow boxed bikes to be carried at an additional fee.  A scheme started by the
Dutch, and now operated by a UK company as well, runs a regular bus service
through France, Italy and possibly Spain from various pick-up points in Northern
Europe with dropping-off points along the route.  Bikes are kept in a trailer
behind the bus and the service is operated through the summer like any other,
except that is exclusively for cyclists.  (See also <I>Organized Holidays</I>,
below.)<BR></P>
<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF0080">Cycle routes:</FONT></B>  The network of cycle
dedicated routes throughout Europe grows annually.  In 1993 the Danish
government alone opened 2000 km of new national cycle routes, and a grant of &#163;40
million in the UK to the Sustrans organization will enable construction of a
good part of the national network, including part of the Atlantic Arc project. 
In the Netherlands it is possible to undertake a full national tour and hardly
come close to a motor vehicle.  The bicycle is at home in Northern Europe:  I
have been reliably informed that it is possible to ride from Amsterdam to Vienna
on cycle routes of one form or another.  A useful guide available from the
Danish tourist authorities is &quot;Cykel Guide: Denmark rundt pa cykel.&quot; 
The main text is in Danish but there is an English summary, and maps of all the
national cycle routes.  These routes link every part of the country and are well
sign-posted, making Denmark ideal for both the beginning and experienced
cycle-tourist.<BR></P>
<P>The &quot;Atlantic Arc&quot; route is a project undertaken to link the
western-most nations with a coastal cycle route from Cadiz in Spain to Skye in
Scotland through Portugal, France, England, Wales and Ireland.  Its is based on
the now famous riverside routes along the Rhine and Danube, which utilize
country lanes, riverside promenades and specially-built cycle routes.  With a
little careful preparation, a bicycle tour of Europe can be a largely
traffic-free experience.  Remember that in some countries  using cycle paths is
obligatory, and the police will stop you from riding on the roads if there is a
dedicated path.  (In most countries these are signed with a white cycle on a
circular blue background.)<BR></P>
<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF0080">Organized Holidays:</FONT></B>  There is a large
and growing number of companies who organize cycle tours in Europe, ranging from
those who will carry your luggage, provide a bike and mechanic, and book your
luxury hotel accommodations, to those who only suggest routes for you to
undertake on your own.  Whatever your tastes, abilities, or budget there is an
organized tour for you in any number of countries.  Wine-tasting your way around
the Chateaux of France, mud-plugging the mountain trails of mid-Wales, or
sauntering from one beach to another in Greece, bicycling can offer maximum
freedom to explore and view at leisure.<BR></P>
<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF0080">More Information:</FONT></B>  One excellent
source of information is the Cyclists Touring Club (CTC), who can give all
manner of advice including information sheets on every country and many regions.
 They also organize and advertise tours regularly, can supply suitable
insurance, and offer other services for an annual fee of &#163;25.  Contact CTC

<H1>Row Upon Row</H1>
<P><I>by Nathalie Zeidman</I></P>
<HR>
<H2><I>Chester, A Town Comfortable With Present &amp; Past</I><BR></H2>
<P>I have this thing about walled cities. That's what brought me to Chester in
the first place.  But it's the Rows that held me there.  Picture streets of
stunning town houses, all black and white Tudor like a flock of magpies; from
the ground floor to the third floor, levels of shops.  To the rear of the
balcony, still more shops, sometimes a block deep.  Malls, it seems, are not the
invention of some Dallas or Los Angeles developer. <BR> </P>
<P>Actually, shopping malls have been hiding in Chester, behind a facade of
black timber and white stucco mullioned windows and gabled roofs, since the
1300s.  Inside, however, the Rows have gone twentieth century:  escalators move
you up and down, plastic charge cards move you in and out.  My own plastic
didn't get much use in the Row, despite  temptations like the Welsh cupboard. 
But as my husband Jerry said, &quot;Shipping's never worked for us.  How are we
going to carry it?  And more to the point, where would we put it once we're
home?&quot;   So I passed up the cupboard and the Waterford and Crown Derby to
go in it, the Liberty cotton by the yard, the Laura Ashley frock and Burberry
raincoat.  We almost succumbed to a counter snack of pizza sloshed down with a
diet cola, but opted instead for a proper tea at The Gallery in sprawling St.
Michael's Row. The Gallery serves freshly baked scones and those dainty chicken
and cucumber sandwiches for which the English are noted, and for which they
charge what a deli in Santa Monica might for a hero or submarine.<BR></P>
<P>Not that the Brits don't have their own version of a grossed-out sandwich. 
For under two dollars you can get a gargantuan baked potato stuffed with every
imaginable filling, from potted, pickled and preserved meats to vegetarian
concoctions.  A fast food chain with the fetching name of  &quot;Spud U Like&quot;
franchises a cubbyhole in Bridge Street Row, but it wasn't their gourmet treats
that lured us there: one floor below the eatery are the remains of a
2000-year-old Roman bath.<BR></P>
<P>Little remains of the wall the Romans built to keep out the Celts and other
uncivilized invaders. The walls we walked, solid chunks of mellowed sandstone
pink in the sun, were built in the Middle Ages. Prom these walls we looked
outward to the lazy River Dee, a scene waiting to be immortalized on canvas by a
latter day Constable or Turner.   Further on, the grassy oval of Roodee spread
out before us; horses have been racing there since fifteen-something. The other
side of the wall gave us a seagull's view of the enclosed town.<BR></P>
<P>Charles I could see it all from his tower:  the town, the river, the
racetrack and the heartbreaking rout of his forces of his forces by
Parliamentary troops.  Today the King Charles Tower is a mini-museum, filled
with momentos of the siege during England's bloody Civil War, when the town was
a Royalist stronghold and Cromwell did it in.  From the tower we had a close
view of the Chester Canal, one of the many that were cut to join English towns
when highways were unpaved and treacherous.  During the summer, the museum
attendant told us, a horse-drawn barge takes visitors on various trips,
including one to Chester's famous zoo. <BR></P>
<P>We started and ended our two mile circuit of the walls at Eastgate, the
easiest gate in Chester to find:  just look for the lacy wrought-iron clock,
faced with coral and turquoise enamel, that stands above the gateway like an
oversized birdcage.  This Victorian gem, erected in honor of the widowed queen's
Diamond Jubilee, is the second most photographed clock in the UK.  In our album
it's numero uno.  We snapped it from the street and from the wall, at a distance
and up close.  Like the Rows, the Jubilee Clock is uniquely Chester.   Around
the corner from the Eastgate is the Chester Cathedral.  We were advised to enter
the grounds via the medieval gateway, across the street from the town hall. 
That put us in Abbey Square, an enclave of handsome Georgian town houses where
once the cue to the loo was  &quot;I'm going to the garden to pluck a rose.&quot;
 Credit modern plumbing with taking the  poetry out of everyday life. <BR></P>
<P>Intimate is not a word usually associated with cathedrals but it suits
Chester's, thanks no doubt to its days as a Benedictine Monastery, when monks
walked enclosed cloisters and abbotts prayed in narrow stalls.  We had a 'cuppa'
and a bun in the refractory, then sat in the choir at evensong.  What better way
to end a day of poking around the Rows, scaling the walls, and viewing all
things old, strange and beautiful.<BR></P>
<P>Poking around on our own was no problem.  How could we miss?   Everything
within the walls and much without is special.  But just to be sure, we bought a
booklet describing self-guided walks at the Chester Heritage Center.  At the
Center, an  audio-visual program uses rare woodcuts and drawings to bring the
town's past to life.  It's a program guaranteed to arouse even the most
reluctant tourist's sense of adventure.   The self-guided walks were easy enough
but we wanted something more personal, so we joined one of the small groups that
 leaves twice a day from the Information Center.  Volunteer guides are history
buffs loaded with titillating tidbits of  centuries-old gossip:  like the one
about the monk who was entertaining his mistress when the Abbott unexpectedly 
showed up.  Did she jump out of the window on her own or did her clerical
boyfriend give her a little shove?  As for eavesdropping, our guide pointed to a
row of seventeenth century houses.  &quot;Notice how the second floor eaves
project  beyond the first?  Linger under an open window and you're guilty of
eavesdropping.&quot;<BR> </P>
<P>Today radio talk shows have replaced &quot;eavesdropping.&quot;  A switch of
the dial and you can hear how proud Mrs. Burton is of  her newborn grandson
James.  &quot;A plush teddy for you, Mrs. B., for that precious little bundle.
And for Mrs. Merchant, a &#163;20 supermarket shopping spree for your correct
answer to the morning puzzle. Radio Shropshire, here!&quot;  A more cheerful
sort of  Shropshire Lad than Houseman's, that announcer.<BR></P>
<P>No wonder I fell in love with Chester and didn't want to leave.  Here is a
town comfortable in its present and its past.  Escalators glide above the Roman
baths; first-class restaurants hide in every Row.  One restaurant we were
particularly impressed with was La Boheme in Watergate Street Row.  Valerie
Bellis, ebullient owner of the Chester Town House, the  B&amp;B where we stayed,
recommended it.  In the background at the bistro, mellow jazz; on the table,
simple superb French:  mushroom soup, fresh poached salmon and creme brulee.  A
bottle of Mouton Cadet and our bill was still under forty dollars. <BR></P>
<P>Slow Boat, on the second floor of a new building just outside the walls, was
another of Valerie's suggestions.  An extensive Cantonese menu featuring prawns
in all sorts of sauces, a view of the town walls, and moderate prices make Slow
Boat a  good trip.  A free booklet, &quot;Eating Out In The Chester Area.&quot;,
lists other choices; while &quot;What's On In Chester,&quot;  another give-away,
sent us to the Gateway Theater to see Caryll Churchill's brilliantly performed
<I>Serious Money</I>, a  clever satire of insider trading on the New York and
London Stock Exchanges.  &quot;What's On&quot; also listed a variety of
concerts, from jazz to philharmonic, including a military tattoo; day and night
cruises on the River Dee, with and without  barbecues and music; day trips by
coach to Northern Wales; and local museums.  The Fifteenth Annual Chester Folk
Festival  was scheduled for the Spring Break Holiday Weekend, but we were back
in London by then, thinking about James Boswell.  In his diary, the eighteenth
century biographer wrote: &quot;Chester pleases my fancy more than any other
town I ever saw.&quot;  <BR></P>
<P>Mr. Boswell, my sentiments exactly!  &#164;<BR></P>

<P><!--In Pursuit of Gezellig   Amsterdamland in Winter By Sophia Dembling-->It
was cold when we arrived in Amsterdam.  Very, very cold.  Even the locals
complained as they huddled in their winter clothes, necks pulled into their
mufflers like turtles, shoulders hunched against a biting wind that whirled the
snow.  The sky was steel gray, the sun&#146;s halfhearted blue light barely
penetrated the clouds.  But the apartment we&#146;d rented had doilies on the
tables, lace curtains on the windows, and Napoleon and Josephine&#146;s
portraits painted on the lamps that graced the mantle.  As  soon as the
apartment&#146;s owner had shown us around and given us keys and maps, we
cranked up the gas heaters, made tea, and curled up on the couches to plan the
weeklong visit ahead.  Madness, perhaps, to head north in the dead of winter.
But then, is there any place cozier than Amsterdam, with its sweet little
streets and dollhouse-size buildings?  The Dutch word for cozy is gezellig, and
that was what I sought this blustery January week.
<BR>
</P>
<P>Amsterdam is pure <I>gezellig</I>, even wearing winter gray.  My companion
called it  <I>Amsterdamland</I>&#151;a theme park version of a European city,
with canals and streets so picturesque it is difficult for a photo-taking
tourist to get anywhere.  Every turn presents a photogenic display: bicycles
leaning against iron railings, narrow gabled buildings, church steeples
presiding over canals.  There are none of the grand spaces and monuments of
Paris, but many small beauties, like a divine and intricate needlework.  Each
one must be admired, photographed, then photographed again.   
<BR></P>
<P>Our little apartment was a few blocks from the Heineken brewery, within easy
walking distance of the Rijksmuseum. For $60 a night, we had two bedrooms,
kitchen, living  room, cable TV,  telephone (though we couldn&#146;t make
outgoing calls), bathroom with a  shower, and enough gezellig to sustain us
through the cold.  A tasteful Dutch friend declared, without admiration, the
apartment&#146;s decor &#147;very Dutch&#148; with its doilies, fussy
chandeliers, scenic lampshades and bric-a-brac clutter.  My companion and I,
however, were charmed.  And undaunted:  after warming ourselves a bit that first
night, we set out into the cold again for a bite to eat at the Cafecox, around
the corner from the City Theatre and a hangout for Amsterdam&#146;s theater
crowd.  Afterwards, shivering in the wind, we decided the best place to be on
such an eve was indoors, so we headed to the Tuchinsky cinema, a beloved,
beautifully preserved  over-the-top art deco confection that drew throngs of
locals in out of the cold. 
<BR></P>
<P>The theater has six movie screens; the big downstairs theater remains at its
art deco best.  We saw a James Bond movie in a smaller, upstairs auditorium.
Dutch is a peculiar,  difficult language (is it really wise to use so many
letters per word?) but Dutch people are  gracious about this and speak English
fluently. Rather than being dubbed, English-language movies are subtitled in
Dutch, which was pleasant, though it would have been  fun to see Dutch coming
out of Pierce Brosnan&#146;s mouth.  Other than that first evening, the coldness
outside and the gezellig inside the little apartment discouraged me from going
out much at night. However, the days warmed  slightly over the week, the sun
grew braver and the city sparkled in its wintry rays.  Each day after breakfast
(we stocked the kitchen with bread, bananas, coffee and other  breakfastables),
I set out exploring, not to return until after dinner at restaurants chosen
wholly for their gezellig&#151;for it is when the blue light fades to gray and
the thermometer starts its night-time descent that I most need such things. 
<BR></P>
<P>Despite the cold, Amsterdammers simply went about their business, bustling
around the city, jingling bicycle bells at hapless pedestrians, filling cafes
with cigarette smoke and conversation. And on this visit, there was an
additional and unusual charm to the city:  the  canals had frozen hard enough to
ice skate on&#151;an occurrence of once every six years or so.  Amsterdammers
enthusiastically enjoyed the novelty with hockey sticks, big dogs, toddlers and
friends. It was like a holiday, and those not trying the ice lingered along the
canals and enjoyed the show.  
<BR></P>
<P>The city bustled with tourists, too.  The Anne Frank Haus manages to be
evocative even  when solid with people, though it is difficult to imagine the
loneliness of a child when you  you can&#146;t turn around for the crowd.  The
Rembrandhuis, Rembrandt&#146;s one-time home in  the city&#146;s Jewish quarter,
was less crowded and I spent a couple of hours sighing over his engravings.   
<BR></P>
<P>The Rijksmuseum is so vast it is difficult to feel crowded there, and I
whiled away a pleasant afternoon wandering its galleries.  The Van Gogh Museum,
spacious, modern and bright, basked in the sunshine of Arles and color.  On a
chilly morning, the red light  district was particularly bleak, but it is there
the enchanting Museum Amsetlkring is  tucked.  This was the canalside home of a
wealthy 17th-century merchant, and it is a wonderful Escher-like maze of rooms
and staircases.  Most astonishing is the ornate  Catholic church in the attic, a
legacy of the Calvinist movement that turned the nation Protestant and forced
Catholicism underground, in a manner of speaking.  Most gezellig is the
17th-century kitchen that fairly begs one to pull up a chair and have a cup of
coffee.<BR></P>
<P>In the wintertime, Amsterdam&#146;s cafes fold up their umbrellas and bring
business inside, where you can sit by a window and  watch the serene scenes
outside. My companion and I went several times to a little brown cafe near the
Rijksmuseum, the Hans en Greitje.  Touristy, perhaps, and the walls were painted
brown rather than stained by years of tobacco smoke as the name brown cafe
implies, but it was genial and gezellig, the food was tasty and it seemed to
attract nearly as many locals as tourists.   
<BR></P>
<P>We found other spots,  too&#151;a quiet, sunny cafe on the Leidsplein where
we had breakfast a couple of mornings and could easily have idled the day away;
Bojo, a kitschy Indonesian restaurant with delicious inexpensive meals; Cafe
Berkhout, a comfortable Amsteryuppie hangout where we ate Dutch comfort food.   

<BR></P>
<P>In Amsterdam&#146;s 17th-century golden age, when much of the city was
built, your tax bill was determined by how wide your building was, which is why
buildings are tall and  narrow.  Restaurants, for the most part, are small and
thickly cluttered with chairs, tables  and clientele.  Putting on coats, hats
and mufflers in such spaces requires a complicated,  restrained wriggle and if
can result in your smacking one patron with your coat sleeve while trailing a
muffler in someone else&#146;s coffee.  
<BR></P>
<P>But there was only one real hardship&#151;at least for me&#151;to a winter
visit. Blessed with no  sense of direction at all, I frequently get lost when I
travel. Ordinarily, I am happy to  totter about until I find my way, but my
pleasure in such wandering decreases with every  degree the temperature falls
below freezing. On a couple of occasions I found myself  wandering confusing
straats and pleins stupidly, peering at my map and struggling with 
unpronounceable street names while darkness fell and the wind sliced through my
coat.  I  didn&#146;t dare get on a bus or trolley for fear it would take me
someplace unfamiliar from  which I might never return. 
<BR></P>
<P>But of course, sooner or later I would be climbing the narrow stairs to the
gezellig little apartment again, to sip tea in front of the heater and plan the
next day&#146;s wanderings.  &#164;</P>

<P><I><B>Getting there:</B> You can find good off-season deals to Amsterdam
in the winter. Check consolidators&#146; prices. Among the airlines flying to
Amsterdam are American Airlines, British Airways, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines,
United Airlines, TWA, and Lufthansa. 
</I><BR></P>
<P><I><B>Money:</B>  There are approximately 1.60 gilders (also called
florin, and abbreviated fl) to $1; fl1 = $0.62.<BR><B>Accommodations:</B> 
Renting an apartment is a particularly delightful and economical way to visit a 
city. We found ours in a magazine. KoVerlaan, Gaaspstraat 69, 1079-VD 
Amsterdam, Netherlands; 011-31-20-642-5190. It was small&#151;one bedroom was
closet-sized with a lumpy twin bed&#151;but suited our purposes perfectly. 
Another company that rents apartments and houseboats is Amsterdam House B.V.,
Willemina J.I. Visser, Amstel  176a, 1017 AE Amsterdam, Netherlands.

<P><I><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">Shopping Amsterdam</FONT></B></I></P>
<P><BR><I>by Sophia Dembling</I></P>
<P><B> First, there was shopping.</B>  In the 17th century, Amsterdam was the
commercial capital of Europe. It was trading that brought the prosperity from
which  grew the Netherlands' Golden Age, when art and culture flourished.  In a
way, we can thank shopping for Rembrandt. That gives it some extra dignity,
doesn't it?   And consumer zeal still flourishes in Amsterdam; a shopaholic's
willpower is sorely tried by hundreds of specialty shops that take trivialities
and with sheer quantity, variety and dramatic flourishes of display, raise them
to high, irresistible art.  How can anyone resist a room lined with buttons?  A
wall dripping tassels?  Beads arrayed like brightly colored sweets?  A
smorgasbord of toothbrushes?  Shopping in Amsterdam is a sensual delight. <BR><BR></P>

<P>If you're feeling particularly pretentious and need a lorgnette to complete
your look (or slightly less pretentious, and would settle for a pince nez) visit
<B>Donald E. Jongejans</B>, which sells nothing but antique, never-worn,
eyeglasses. The small, somewhat  grungy shop has a huge selection of frames
dating from the 1800s to the 1970s. Find cat glasses, mod glasses, Jackie O.
glasses,  Buddy Holly glasses. Some are non-prescription sunglasses, most can be
fitted with prescription lenses by your own  optometrist. This is the shop that
supplied the spectacles for the movie The Last Emperor. Prices start at about
$18.  <I>Donald E.  Jongejans, Noorderkerstraat 18.
</I> 
<BR></P><IMG SRC="http://www.eurodata.com/package.gif" WIDTH="27" HEIGHT="23">
<P>You might be tempted to dance with your mop in a kitchen all tricked out
with the frivolity sold at <B>Kitsch Kitchen</B>.  The shop is  an explosion of
color and kicky plastic gewgaws, imported mostly from Africa, Latin America and
China. Even dishwashing is  less dreary if you do it in rubber gloves trimmed
with ruffles and flowers, and a rainbow colored scrub brush might make 
scrubbing the floor less of a chore. (Or maybe not.) Plastic tablecloth fabric
in bright colors and fruit and floral prints is sold by  the meter. Prices start
at about $2. <I>Kitsch Kitchen, Eerste Bloemdwarsstraat, 21.</I><BR></P><IMG

<P>It's not that <B>Dorothea de Boer</B> has a particular thing for buttons. 
It's just that she took a look around and &quot;I noticed there wasn't any
button shop,&quot; she said.  So she opened Knopenwinkel. And a fine button shop
it is, from its giant button door handle to its more than 14,000 different
buttons (not counting different sizes of some styles) from all over the world. 
With parquet floor and shiny wood and marble fixtures, the setting is suitable
for fine jewelry -- and these buttons are more than just something to keep your
pants on .  There are handmade rhinestone and silk-wrapped buttons, polished
seashells and mother-of-pearl, coral, nut, leather, water buffalo horn, Czech
glass, plastic and much, much more.  Prices start at under $1.  <I>Knopenwinkel,
Wolvenstraat 14.  </I>
<BR></P><IMG SRC="http://www.eurodata.com/package.gif" WIDTH="27" HEIGHT="23">
<P>Who knew dental care could be fun?  <B>de Witte Tanden Winkel</B> is
devoted entirely to teeth and with a splurge here, you could brush after every
meal for a week and never use the same brush twice.  The array includes
toothbrushes with handles filled with floating shells or, better yet, little
plastic veggies.  There are a pair of brushes built like Adam and Eve,
Danish-modern wooden brushes, Hello Kitty brushes, a selection of electric
toothbrushes and, for the truly meticulous, interdental brushes, for brushing
between the teeth.  Prices start at about $3.  <I>de Witte Tanden Winkel,
Runstraat 5.  </I><BR></P><IMG
SRC="http://www.eurodata.com/package.gif" WIDTH="27" HEIGHT="23">
<P> Where you decide to hang your tassels is none of our business, but you're
sure to walk out with at least a couple if you walk into <B>H.J. van de Kerkhof</B>,
which has been selling trimmings for 60 years.  Gerda van de Kerkhof says all
tassels are handmade -- a better tassel-making machine has yet to be built. 
Sizes range from itty-bitty to bigger than your head, some are lanky, some
pudgy, some are tassels made of tassels.  Dangle them from your ears, hang one
around your neck, tie a couple around your waist.  Or whatever.  Prices start at
about $1.50.<I> H.J. van de Kerkhof, Wolvenstraat 9-11.  
</I><BR></P><IMG
SRC="http://www.eurodata.com/package.gif" WIDTH="27" HEIGHT="23">
<P>When the sun streams into <B>Coppenhagen 1001 kralen</B>, it illuminates a
rainbow of 5,000 beads displayed in glass jars in the spacious shelf-lined shop.
 Beads range from basic to kicky to exquisite.  Perhaps a glass peanut, a red
Cupid, a green cat?  Or maybe Venetian glass, millefiori, or antique African? 
Buy a handful, buy a necklace, buy one perfect bead.  Prices start at under $1.
 <I>Coppenhagen 1001 kralen, Rozengracht 54.  
</I><BR></P><IMG
SRC="http://www.eurodata.com/package.gif" WIDTH="27" HEIGHT="23">
<P><B>Hester van Eeghen</B>'s small leather goods have an architectural
quality to them -- she points out echoes of classic step-gabled Dutch houses in
some of her designs.  &quot;I don't have the intention to make souvenirs,&quot;
she said, but there is that possibility.  All of Ms. van Eeghen's innovative
pieces are made in Italy, including a portfolio based on a 17th century closet,
with all sorts of fascinating doors and hidey-holes; and a clever reversible
briefcase, black on one side, purple on the other.  Prices start at about $30
for a wallet.  <I>Hester van Eeghen, Hartenstraat 1.  </I><BR></P><IMG
SRC="http://www.eurodata.com/package.gif" WIDTH="27" HEIGHT="23">
<P>When you think about it, a baby hammock makes perfect sense.  It cradles
gently, holds firmly, and rocks soothingly.  And you can buy a hammock for baby,
or anyone else, at <B>Maranon</B>, which sells nothing but.  The striking
two-room store by the flower market has white walls, terra cotta floors, and
rows of hammocks on wooden displays.  Many of the hammocks are handmade and
natural died and styles range from simple open weaves to more elaborate weaves,
stripes and trims.  Prices start at about $23 for an infant hammock.  <I>Maranon,
Singel 488-490.</I>  
<BR></P><IMG SRC="http://www.eurodata.com/package.gif" WIDTH="27" HEIGHT="23">
<P>In the exquisitely sparse <B>Hoeden M/V</B>, the high-style hat displays
are the show. Hats by about 20 international designers stand on stalks, perch
like puff pastries behind glass, sprout from a mantelpiece under a crystal
chandelier.  Patricia Underwood's fetching mink affair, at nearly $1,000, is the
priciest item in the shop; the hats of Philip Treacy's bridal collection are
whipped-cream concoctions; or try one of Dutch designer Miriam Nuver's
complicated canvas numbers.  &quot;They are very shapey,&quot; said the
saleswoman, smacking one into submission.  There's also a large selection of
men's traditional Borsalinos. Hat shapes can be tweaked to suit your style, if
need be. <I>Hoeden M/V, Herengracht 422.  
</I><BR></P><IMG
SRC="http://www.eurodata.com/package.gif" WIDTH="27" HEIGHT="23">
<P><B>Peter Doeswijk</B> is an artist-dilettante who buys phones from the
phone company and paints them with cow prints, angels, zebra stripes, and other
bold patterns.  He makes as many as he feels like, sells as many as he can.  Ask
nicely and he'll take you upstairs to show you the wacky furniture he makes
also, from recycled materials such as crates and tin cans.  He made a coffee
table from a desk chair so it can raise and lower, a whimsical off-kilter liquor
cabinet, and his lamps have tin can shades.  (But what he really wants to do is
produce -- he's currently working on a documentary about lullabies around the
world.)  Prices start at about $30.  <I>Peter Doeswijk, Vijzelgracht 11.</I>  
<BR></P><IMG SRC="http://www.eurodata.com/package.gif" WIDTH="27" HEIGHT="23">
<P>It's impossible to resist poking your nose into <B>'t Winkeltje</B>, curio
shop extraordinaire. There's something about the building itself, with its row
of colorful masks above the windows, the boxes full of junk outside the door,
the display windows packed with tin toys, glass knickknacks and candles,
snowstorm balls, teapots, dolls, piggy banks and plates.  &quot;It all looks
old, but it's new,&quot; says owner Carla Aarsman.  Everything but the shop
itself, which is 40 years old, and the original cash register, which can ring up
sales only as high as 9 guilders, 99 1/2 cents, about $6 by today's exchange
rate.  Prices start at about 20 cents (for a small plastic baby, should you need
one). <I>'t Winkeltje, Prinsengracht 228.  
</I><BR></P><IMG
SRC="http://www.eurodata.com/package.gif" WIDTH="27" HEIGHT="23">
<P>Sometimes a gal's just got to color-coordinate.  When the urge strikes,
<B>Palette</B> can help.  Palette has selection of shoes and handbags they will
dye to match anything, or choose one of two pump styles for a fabric wrap in one
or two fabrics.  Trimmings also are available.  Dying takes about a week and
fabric wraps about two weeks, but they're happy to ship the shoes home to you. 
Prices start at about $100.  <I>Palette, N.Z. Voorburgwal 125.</I><BR></P>
<P><B>Note to serious shoppers:</B> When in Amsterdam, pick up a hot pink book
titled De <I>'96 Amsterdam Original &amp; Gun-Shopping Gids</I>. [CQ]  This
book is so well designed -- with maps, photos, phone numbers, addresses and
opening hours for some of the coolest shops in town -- that the fact it's
written entirely in Dutch is only a small obstacle to its usefulness.  &#164;</P>

<H1>A Day Excursion to Windsor</H1>
<P><I>by George &amp; LaVerne Ferguson</I></P>
<P>Historic Windsor Castle is the official home of English royalty.  William
the Conqueror built the first structure on this site, a wooden fort that doubled
as a royal hunting lodge.  Other English kings added to the castle during their
reigns, but despite the multiplicity of royalty and architects, the castle has
managed to retain a unity of style all its own.  It's the largest inhabited
castle in the world.<BR></P>
<P>The present queen, Elizabeth II, uses the castle far more than any of her
predecessors.  For this reason, it is wise to inquire if the queen is in
official residence before going to Windsor.  When she is, which is usually
during the months of April, June, and December, the state apartments will be
closed to the public.  There will still be many areas of Windsor Castle open to
the public; however, you will miss seeing the splendor of the various rooms
contained within the state apartments.  Chances of seeing Her Majesty, should be
in residence, will be rather slim.  Nevertheless, during that time you may find
Prince Philip watching his son Charles, the Prince of Wales, and his polo team
bashing about the Great Windsor Park.  Again, it may be difficult to find the
princes, for although the castle itself occupies a mere thirteen acres, the park
stretches over 4,000 acres below the battlements of the castle.<BR></P>
<P>You have a choice of two rail routes from London to Windsor.  For the
schedule given here, we have selected the route from Waterloo Station in London
to Windsor Riverside Station.  This line does not require changing trains en
route.  The alternate route, which departs Paddington Station in London,
requires a change at Slough to a shuttle train before arriving at Windsor
Central Station.  If you take the Paddington-Slough route, the shuttle train
arrives and departs in Slough from track 1.  Either route gives you a
magnificent view approaching Windsor Castle.  On either train, sit on the
left-hand side (outbound) to take full advantage of the scenery.<BR></P>
<P>The tourist information center is at No. 24 High Street.  Signs with the
traditional &quot;i&quot; will lead the way from either arrival point.  The
grounds of Windsor Castle are immediately across the street from the tourist
information center.  The center operates 0930-1800 in summer and 0930-1600 in
winter.  Be sure to purchase an illustrated guidebook on Windsor Castle.  It
will become a fond reminder of your visit.<BR></P>
<P>Rare state occasions such as the investiture of the Garter, when the queen
proceeds down the walks of Windsor Castle accompanied by a full entourage of
castle guards and Knights of the Garter, are difficult for the general public to
view.  The changing of the castle guard, however, is an event conducted in a
manner in which the general public can participate.  The new guard leaves
Victoria Barracks precisely at 1055, then marches along High Street to the
castle.  The guard changing takes place at 1100 and the old guard returns by the
same route at 1130.  By positioning yourself along High Street or Castle Hill,
you will have a good view of the pageantry as it unfolds.<BR></P>
<P>From the battlements of Windsor Castle, you may look down and across from
the stately River Thames onto the playing fields of Eton College, where &quot;how
the game is played&quot; has always been more important than the final score. 
The importance of Eton lies less in what it is than in what it stands for.  The
school yard and cloisters are open 1400-1630 except during school holidays, when
they are open 1030-1630 April to September.<BR></P>
<P>Your initial entry into the town of Eton may be a bit frightening at first,
for you will probably find yourself surrounded by a group of young gentlemen
uniformed in pin-striped trousers, white bow ties, and formal black coats with
tails.  You have not been thrust among a flock of penguins.  What you are
surrounded by are the students of Eton College, one of Britain's most exclusive
educational institutions and a strong reminder that the British on occasion can
cling fiercely to their traditions.<BR></P>
<P>A respite from pageantry and tradition during your visit to Windsor may be
taken by cruising on the River Thames.  At the bottom of High Street, at its
intersection with Barry Avenue, the Windsor Boat Pier offers two cruises.  The
first is a thirty-five minute trip upstream and the other is a full two-hour
trip with light refreshments and a licensed bar aboard.<BR></P>
<P>If you have not yet been introduced to the British public house, there is no
better time than now.  The Royal Oak, directly across the street from Windsor
Riverside Station, is highly recommended.  No more prim a pub can you find in
all of England.  Its impeccable oaken interior matches the high quality of its
food and service.  The inn was constructed as an ale house in 1736 and restored
in 1937.  Should we meet you there, we'll buy the first round!  &#164;</P>

<H2>Norway&#146;s Lofoten Islands<BR></H2>
<P><B><I>&quot;Part scream, part roar, and so powerful that not even the
Niagara falls can raise their voice higher to the heavens.&quot;   - E A Poe</I></B><BR></P>
<P><I>by Nick Gregory</I><BR></P>
<P><B>Arriving on the ferry from Bodo the islands emerge from the ocean like a
huge wall of rock</B>, the entire archipelago blended together to form a row of
impenetrable sharks teeth rising up as if to tear at the blue fabric of the sky.
 Lofoten is the archipelago that juts out into the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans
north of the Arctic circle in Norway, between the 67th and 68th parallels. 
There are seven principle islands famed for their beauty and ruggedness,
white-capped mountain peaks to white sandy beaches and attractive fishing
villages.  The seas around Lofoten are unique too, home to cod from the freezing
arctic and whales the warm waters flow from the south to give the islands a
milder climate than areas at a similar latitude like Alaska and Greenland.  The
two most south westerly islands of the archipelago, Rost and V&aelig;roy, are
famed for their bird colonies with Rost alone believed to have a colony
containing a quarter of the sea birds in Norway, as many as 2.5 million.<BR></P>
<P>Both these islands are linked by a daily ferry in the summer to Bodo on the
mainland and Moskenes.  On the ferry from V&aelig;roy to Moskenes the route
crosses the Moskenes Maelstrom, one of the worlds fiercest and an inspiration to
both Edgar Allen Poe and Jules Verne.  On Moskenes island the fishing villages
lie one after another like jewels in a necklace.  Red-painted wooden huts stand
stilted over the sheltered harbour waters backed by the huge cliffs of the dark
mountains.  Racks of fish left to cure in the cool air leave a distinctive
aroma.  From &Aring; at the south-western tip and the end of the Kong Olavs Veg
(King Olavs road) through Sorv&aring;gen, the site of the worlds second wireless
telegraph station built in 1906 and now home to a permanent exhibition in
connection with the village's unique telecommunications history.<BR></P>
<P>&Aring; itself is home to the Norwegian fishing village museum where one can
appreciate the atmosphere of a genuine traditional village including boat
houses, forge, steam processing plant for cod-liver oil and fishermans huts, all
of which blend with the surrounding village to take the visitor back in time. 
There is also the Stockfish museum where you can learn about the thousand year
old Stockfish industry and how it is used still as a trade commodity and where
it is exported.  On through Moskenes where ferrys to the mainland and southern
islands can be taken as well as excursions in the summer to the &quot;outside &quot;
of the islands including the Kollhellaren Cave.  Take a guided tour to see the
3000 year old cave paintings.  There is also the chance to hire a skippered
fishing boat for a day and try out your skills at deep sea angling or even
experience life on a working boat.<BR></P>
<P>A few minutes from Moskenes by road, after a few rises and dips along the
coast, a superb view of Reine meets the traveller.  The speckling of red against
the blues and greens of nature in a scene that fills the senses.  Snow still
lingering on the higher peaks and shimmering turquoise sea below.  Take the boat
trip along the fjord, one of Norway's most beautiful and then a walk to the far
end to enjoy the enormity of the suroundings.  A half hours journey by bus will
take you through Hamnoy and across the bridge to the adjoining island of
Flakstad.  To the left, the road to Fredvang leaps over humped bridges from
islet to islet like a giant concrete sea-serpent.  From Fredvang, a fishing
village on the outside of Moskenes island, there are numerous hiking trails
leading to remote areas of the Yttersida (the outside) as well as cabins for
hikers and an excellent bakery.  Stay on the bus past the Fredvang exit to
Ramberg, the islands' administrative centre located next to a white sandy beach
overlooking the Arctic Ocean and a great place to camp and watch the Midnight
sun<BR></P>
<P>Just outside the village is the beautiful wooden church with its
characteristic onion-shaped cupola built in 1780.  Inside the altar pre-dates
the rest of the church and the pulpit was painted by the master painter Godtfred
Ezechiel.  Away from the Kong Olavs Veg, on the Vestfjord coast, lie the fishing
villages of Sund and Nusfjord famous for the sculptured representations of the
Sund smith and Nusfjord protected as one of the original construction custom
projects during the European Architecture Conservation Year in 1975.  Today
Nusfjord is one of the representative scenes of Norway that can be found around
the World.<BR></P>
<P>For the outdoors-minded, there's the Flakstad trail, a footpath leading from
Napp past the Storb&aring;thallaren, a stone age settlement, to the abandoned
fishing village of Ostre Nesland; it is a ghostly way when the mists are rolling
in off the sea.  By tunnel from Napp to the island of Vestv&aring;goy, here it
not far to the town of Leknes and one of the two airports on the Lofotens.  On
the south coast route from Leknes you'll come to Stamsund and one of the two
calling ports for the Hurtigruten  coastal steamer service.  Nearby is the
tourist office and youth hostel as well as the Nordland Puppet theatre and a
number of local handicraft shops.  There is also some alpine skiing available in
the winter with superb views over the sea on clear days.   Also along the south
coast are a number of fine white sandy beaches that slip into turquoise waters,
giving the impression of a tropical paradise, although only hardy creatures
actually enter the water!<BR></P>
<P>Back on the KOV from Leknes is the village of Borg, site of the biggest
Viking chieftans homestead to be excavated in Scandinavia, here you can see
reconstructions of Viking life and exhibitions of archaeological finds from the
area.  Exhibits include the ship &quot;Lofotr&quot; and the authentic boathouse
replica.   Back in the present and headed east over the small island of Gimsoy
and onto V&aelig;gan the road moves back to the south coast and a short
diversion leads to the &quot;Venice of Lofoten&quot; at Henningsv&aelig;r, a
large fishing village and centre of the famous Lofoten art community, with a
number of galleries and exhibitions including the Karl Erik Harr and a
photographic exhibition by the celebrated artist Wilse.  Around the town of
Kabelv&aring;g and into Svolv&aelig;r, the capital of Lofoten and regional
centre with transport links to the mainland.  High above the town of some 4120
inhabitants is the Svolv&aelig;rgeita or &quot;Svolv&aelig;r Goat&quot;, an
unusually shaped rock pinnacle that is renowned as a challenge to climbers and
only summited for the first time in 1910.  The small town harbour atmosphere of
Svolv&aelig;r makes it a great place to use as a tour base for those with their
own transport.  It too has a number of celebrated galleries in its own right
that include works by artists such as Gunnar Berg.<BR></P>
<P>From the harbour take a tour up the famous Trollfjorden by boat, its steep
cliff faces rising high above the Raftsundet strait or the express boat to
Stokmarknes that takes this route north.  By road from Svolv&aelig;r you head
north to the ferry at Fiskebol and onto the Vester&aring;lens, or perhaps take a
detour from the main route through Laukvik on the north coast and another
excellent view of the open Arctic Ocean and Midnight sun in summer.  Arriving in
Melbu on the ferry from the Lofotens look back, and maybe there'll be a huge
rainbow rising from the fjord and spanning the mountains of the archipelago in
the grandeur that they deserve.   &#164; </P>

office of the Norwegian Tourist Board in your home country.<BR></P>
<P><B>Getting there by air:</B> There are flights to Leknes, Svolv&aelig;r and
the two outlying islands of V&aelig;roy and Rost.  All flights to these airports
seem to go via Bodo with SAS, Braathens and Wideroe and there are connections
from Oslo, Stockholm and Bergen amongst others.   Ask about the limited number
of 'bargain' seats available to foreigners on internal flights.  I took one with
Braathens from Narvik to Oslo for 550Nkr as compared to the normal one-way fare
of over 2200Nkr.  Look for the booklet Flyruter i Norge for all internal flights
info.   For those with a little more spending money, try Lofotfly who hire
seaplanes to explore the region.  tel.  948 50547<BR></P>
<P><B>Rail:</B> The nearest railheads are at Bodo and Narvik.  There are two
trains a day from Trondheim to Bodo on the Norwegian Nordlandsbanen.  For those
on a budget the overnight train in the summer affords views of the scenery lit
by the Midnight sun and arrives at about 10am to connect with bus services.  The
day train leaves Trondheim at 0830 and arrives in Bodo at 1828.   The Narvik
train is run in co-operation with the Swedish railways and there are two trains
from Stockholm and one from Gothenburg daily, although only one from Stockholm
is direct.<BR></P>
<P><B>Sea:</B> From Bodo there is a car-ferry to Moskenes with five departures
daily in the summer, one of which calls at the islands of V&aelig;roy and Rost
(1500 from Bodo).  Sailing time for the direct services is approx 4 hours.  
Cost is 102 Nkr (US$15) for adult foot passenger and cars from 375Nkr one -way
including driver and dependant on vehicle length.   There is also the Hurtigrute
coastal steamer which calls at Bodo and then Stamsund and Svolv&aelig;r in both
directions on its journey from Bergen to the Russian border (Daily).   Express
boat from Bodo and Narvik to Svolv r.  Foot passengers only.   Car-ferry from
Skutvik (mid-way between Bodo and Narvik) to Svolv&aelig;r with two or three
departures a day in each direction.  Adult foot passengers 50Nkr and cars from
174 Nkr.<BR></P>
<P><B>Bus:</B> There are fast buses from all the local airports and they link
the larger towns of the region.  Pay as you board and ask about alighting at
smaller villages, it is quite possible.  There is also a good bus service the
length of the Lofotens and linking Harstad and Tromso to the north.  Car rental:
In Svolv&aelig;r, see Avis (tel 760 71140), Budget (760 70000), Europecar (760
71255) and Hertz (760 70720).<BR></P>

Norway, Dronningengst.  26, N-0154 Oslo;  Tel 22421410, Fax 22424476.<BR></P>
<P><B>Camping:</B> Whilst there are numerous good campgrounds (lists available
from the tourist offices) on the islands it is perfectly legal and acceptable to
camp on open ground away from habitation for a couple of nights, but remember to
leave everything as you found it and open fires are not allowed from April to
September due to fire risk.   Ask for the Norwegian Camping Guide which has a
list of campgrounds nationally and a free map.  Also try the NAF (like AAA in
the US) at Postboks 494 Sentrum, 0105 Oslo, tel 22341500 fax 22341420, for their
free list and map.  A list of hotels, motels and pensions can be obtained from
the tourist offices free of charge.  The Midnight sun is visible from 27th May
to the 17th July on the Lofotens.  The best view points are on the open sections
of the northern coast.<BR></P>

<H1>Albania</H1>
<P><EM>By Susan Milligan</EM></P>
<HR>
<P><STRONG><EM><FONT COLOR="#FF0080">A Country Being Created Before Your
Eyes</FONT></EM></STRONG><BR></P>
<P>The border guard surveyed our American passports and peered curiously at us
as we stood at the security station dividing Serbia and Macedonia.  &quot;Why do
you want to go to Albania?&quot; he asked, when we explained that we were
planning merely to pass through Macedonia en route to Tirana.   At first, we
took the question as a mini-interrogation; after all, there had been a war on in
the Balkans, and to him we could be smugglers. But in fact he was genuinely
baffled.  Albania?  For vacation?<BR></P>
<P>Though it is not yet a vacation site for the traditional tourist, Albania is
heading in that direction, anxious to pump up its fledgling market economy with
tourist trade.  But for the adventuresome and the curious, newly-opened Albania
is utter fascination.  Today the foreign traveler is heartily welcomed by the
Albanian people, who are just as anxious to see what outsiders are like as the
travelers are to meet the Albanians.</P>
<P></P>
<P>There is much to see in Albania, but this is almost beside the point.  You
will want to see Albania for the same reason you rushed to an R-rated movie when
you turned 17:  you couldn't do it before.  Albania is one of the few places
left in the world where you can watch a country being created in front of your
eyes -- sometimes, it appears, from scratch.  After 48 years as the most
hermetically-sealed of the former Soviet bloc nations, Albania  is awakening
with a start.  Everything is in flux here:  the economy, the political system,
and the popular culture.  The streets are a bizarre mix of old and new:  just
five years ago, there were no private cars in Tirana.  Now, the chaotic streets
are clogged with Mercedes-Benzes, competing for road space with pedestrians,
horses pulling carts, bicyclists and the ubiquitous begging Gypsy child. 
Walking the neighborhoods of Tirana can be dangerous; not for reasons of street
crime or violence, but because the Albanians aren't used to sharing the road. 
Barely used to being behind the wheel of their own cars, drivers here look like
16-year-olds with learner's permits.  They gleefully keep their hands pressed to
the car horns, appearing to delight in almost running pedestrians off the road.<BR></P>
<P>Where would a local of Albania, the poorest nation in Europe, get a
Mercedes?  &quot;Stolen,&quot; said a local police officer, with a shrug, as he
watched the scene from the sidewalk.  &quot;Yes, absolutely, stolen,&quot;
agreed one of the hordes of illegal money-changers who clog the city's main
square, standing undisturbed next the policeman as he calculated the daily rate
of exchange between the dollar and the leke.  Along the side roads, many of them
still dirt and gravel, novice entrepreneurs sell odd auto parts.  Passing by are
old men in tattered suits, walking their goats on leashes.  Sheep graze and
children play among the thousands of dome-shaped, cement bunkers scattered
throughout the country -- bunkers which once symbolized Soviet-controlled
Albania's isolation and hostility to the outside world.  The houses are still in
poor shape, and Albanians are still among Europe's poorest citizens, but many
apartments now have TV satellite dishes.  There were no private phones in
Albania until three years ago, and most locals still have no phones, or  for
that matter flush toilets.<BR></P>
<P>That didn't stop an Italian firm from opening a luxury hotel in March, with
a restaurant and a planned business center and shopping arcade.  It's quite a
switch from the days when the city's single, communist-run hotel occasionally
closed because it had no food to serve.  &quot;It's really a developing country
and a developing environment,&quot; said Cameron Pippitt, an official for the
United States Agency for International Development, which is helping Tirana move
toward the modern world.  &quot;A few years ago, there were no cafes, no kiosks,
no private restaurants,&quot; Pippitt said.  Now the busy avenues of Tirana are
loaded with charming coffee bars and well-run Italian restaurants.  Most of
these establishments are filled with men -- women in substantially Muslim
Albania tend to stay home, tending house and children -- and female travelers
should be prepared for verbal harassment on the street.  But the new restaurants
are of good quality and are still inexpensive for the foreigner.<BR></P>
<P>Much of the foreign influence in Albania comes from Italy, which has a
long-time historic connection to its across-the-sea neighbor.  American firms
are reluctant to invest in Albania because the infrastructure is still fairly
primitive, officials say.  The upside for the tourist is that Western influence
is displayed in charming espresso bars, not (as in other parts of Eastern
Europe) fast-food joints erected next to dilapidated housing.<BR></P>
<P>This is not to say that Albanians are hostile to Americans -- quite the
opposite.  A number of Albanians have relatives in the States, and see the U.S.
as a friend and an escape from an earlier life.  &quot;You are German?&quot; a
cafe owner asks curiously.  &quot;No, American,&quot; was the response.  He
threw up his hands and grinned; then refused to accept payment for an ice-cream
cone.  Vendors at a crude market near Tirana's aged-looking train station were
also excited to receive American visitors, forcing apples into our hands.  There
is a remarkable spirit and optimism among Albanians, even the older citizens who
lived for so long in such a repressive environment.  At the central market on
Boulevard Deshmorit e Kombit, Tirana's main drag, an elderly man in clothes that
appeared to pre-date his own birth was tearing out the pages of a book.  He
rolled up the pages to create makeshift containers for the peanuts he was
selling.  Other pages he threw onto the burned-out grass.  &quot;Enver Hoxha,&quot;
he explained, invoking the hated name of Albania's onetime dictator and pointing
to the book -- apparently about Hoxha or written by him.  The man pointed to the
pages, then ripped them out gleefully.  &quot;Enver Hoxha,&quot; he said again.<BR></P>
<P>In nearby Durres, Albania's main port, locals are capitalizing on the change
in the country and the economy.  Boats go frequently between Durres and Italy,
carrying goods and travelers.  A shopping mall is also in the works for the
beach town, a development that would have been unthinkable five years ago.  The
beachside villa that Hoxha stayed in on vacations is now empty, opened
occasionally for visiting dignitaries.  Vacationers can enjoy Durres's sandy
shores, which are pleasant and conveniently close to Tirana, though not as
popular as Albania's southern beaches.  &quot;All Albania has changed,&quot;
said Durres cafe-owner Avni Beojri.  &quot;Before, the regime made it very
difficult, because if I spoke about the government, I would be in prison.&quot; 
Beojri's children, like many young Albanians, hope to move elsewhere in Europe
or to the States, where they see more opportunity.  &quot;Jobs are a very big
problem because of the new economy.  After three or four years, it will work,
but now, it's difficult, because wages are small,&quot; Beojri said.<BR></P>
<P>But Beojri wants to stay in his hometown of Durres, the nation's main port. 
&quot;For me, the life is in our land,&quot; he said.  For the visitor, life is
also easier now.  There are reasonably-priced as well as luxury hotels, complete
with the indoor plumbing, electricity and other amenities lacking in many
Albanian homes.  Notably, some hotels charge more for foreigners than they do
for Albanians, but the price is still cheap.<BR></P>
<P>Getting to Albania is getting easier as well.  Until 1988 the number of
tourists was tightly controlled, and those few were permitted the see the
country only with a government escort, said Ilir Toci, a travel consultant with
Albtourist.  In 1988 the state began bringing tourists from Dubrovnik, a coastal
Croatian (then Yugoslav) town.   In 1989 more tourists were allowed in, and the
door was opened completely in 1991.  Last year Albtourist alone handled 8,000
clients, including day-trippers from the nearby Greek island of Corfu. <BR></P>
<P>The boat from Italy is the easiest route.   Twelve airlines fly into Tirana
airport -- although you may, like tourist Mary Agocs,  have to wait for workers
to clear the runway of goats before landing.  The longest, but perhaps most
visually spectacular way to arrive in Tirana is by bus from Skopje, Macedonia
(for political reasons, you cannot come directly from Serbia). The nine-hour bus
ride provides a breath-taking vista of the country, including peaceful,
ultra-blue Lake Ohrid, a favorite new vacation spot for Albanians and
Macedonians, who share the border lake.  The bus winds precariously around
mountains, stopping for the occasional goat or donkey before dropping travelers
off near Tirana's bustling Scanderbeg Square.<BR></P>
<P>For the tourist, Albania's advantages are also its disadvantages.  Only a
few hotels and restaurants are up to Western standards.  But the prices are
cheap and the nation's tourist agencies make up in enthusiasm and effort what
they lack in services.  Albania Travel and Tours offers one-to-fourteen-day
excursions to other areas of tourist interest in Albania, including several
archeological sites and small, traditional villages in the north of Albania. 
Trekking and hunting trips are also available, as are trips to Lake Ohrid.
Prices in Albania are low for the foreigner, with the most expensive, 2-week
excursion trip adding up to $540 per person, including lodging and most meals. 
But Albania's greatest tourist hope is its unspoiled southern coast, with its
sandy beaches along the blue Ionian Sea.  In the coastal town of Dhermi,
visitors can stay at a hotel that was once reserved by the communists as an
incentive vacation spot for workers.  Still, Albania's fledgling tourist
industry cannot yet offer the variety, number and quality of accommodations
available, for example, in neighboring Italy.<BR></P>
<P>The Albanian government is quickly moving to improve standards, government
officials say.  They also are working to open several old military airports for
commercial use, making trips beyond Tirana more convenient.  &quot;For people
who want to see something unusual, this is a curiosity,&quot; said Ilir Toci, a
travel consultant.  &quot;And services get better every day.&quot;  &#164;<BR></P>

in the Countryside</FONT></STRONG><BR></P>
<P>Two new business-class hotels have opened in the Albanian capital of Tirana
to cater to the country's growing Western tourism, according to recent articles
in Travel Weekly.  The Tirana International, centrally located on Scanderbeg
Square, was extensively refurbished in its conversion from a state-run high-rise
to a 161-room, superior first-class hotel, and reopened in March 1995 for
operation by Italian-based Turin Hotels International.  The <B>Europark Hotel</B>,
a more deluxe 138-room property managed by the Austrian firm Rogner
International, is newly built and opened in August 1995.  Both hotels feature
rooms with private bath, direct-dial telephones, satellite TV, air conditioning,
and minibars, with the Europark additionally offering swimming, tennis, and
conference facilities.  Rates at the Tirana International are $120 single, $140
double, and $180 for suites; the Europark charges $150 single, $190 double, and
$220 for suites.  With Albanian tourism still in an early stage of development
the hotels have largely been occupied by businesspersons to date, but their
managers are eager to welcome leisure travelers as well.  Bookings at either
property can be made directly or through travel agents; contact Utell
International, <B>800-44-UTELL</B>.<BR></P>
<P><I>Travel Weekly</I> also reports that <B>Ecotourism Ltd</B>., a British
tour operator, will be organizing a village tourism project this summer which
will allow travelers to book stays in converted private homes in the village of
Upper Qeparo, which overlooks the Ionian seacoast from atop a 1,000 foot rocky
cliff.  Although the project will have only four rooms available this summer,
they hope to expand to fourteen by next year.  The room rentals will be located
in three refurbished houses, which are being brought up to modern interior
standards while keeping their original stone exteriors; each twin room will
offer private bath and access to a shared swimming pool. Ecotourism Ltd. plans
to organize complete itineraries for travelers that combine a week in Corfu with
a week in southern Albania, and will include transport by ferry and automobile
from Corfu to Upper Qeparo.  Ecotourism Ltd. specializes in creating
environmentally-friendly tour programs, with an emphasis on demonstrating that
development of tourism can co-exist with maintaining local heritage,
architecture, and tradition.  For further information, contact <B>Ecotourism
Ltd., 4 the Lancasters, 162-164 Fulham Palace Road, London W6 9ER, United

<P><!--An Authentic Old Mask  Germanys Rothenburg ob der Tauber by M.J. Terry--><B>For
many Americans,</B> the most compelling of Europe's many attractions is the
tangible connection to history that it offers.  Living as we do in a nation
where nearly half of &quot;the past&quot; has been photographed&#151;and more
than a tenth of it <I>televised</I>&#151;we feel a special fascination in
meeting, in person, the walls and cobblestones that tell a much older part of
the story.  And while American diversity today has its roots and origins all
over the world, to a great extent the characters and settings of Europe remain
(to borrow a  Hollywood term) our &quot;prequel.&quot; 
<BR></P>
<P>History is everywhere and inescapable in Europe&#151;they've had quite a lot
of it, after all&#151;but there are a few places which by a mix of luck and
restoration, and a keen sense of their own value, have made it particularly
their business to cater to the time-traveler.  Brugge in Belgium and Carcassone
in France come to mind; even though Brugge, undeniably pretty, has the flaw of
being scrubbed cleaner than anything in the time of Charles V might reasonably
have been; and even though Carcassone, itself something of a Hollywood prequel,
is largely the invention of a 19th-century medievalist's imagination.  It's the
thought that counts.  And the thought is, <I>this is what it looked like.  This
is how it felt.   
</I><BR></P>
<P>Of all the reconstructions and survivals, the unquestioned jewel is
Rothenburg.  Nestled high above the Tauber River valley in Bavaria, it boasts of
being the only walled city in Germany without a single modern construction;
nothing breaks the mood set by moats, half-timbered houses, and narrow winding
lanes.  Like Brugge&#151;where a silted-up harbor caused the town to stagnate,
just as the wrecking ball of the Industrial Revolution began swinging everywhere
else&#151;Rothenburg owes its architectural preservation to economic failure. 
After thriving in its medieval heyday along a lucrative trade route, it became a
ghost town when the trade moved elsewhere; for centuries nothing was built,
nothing torn down, nothing changed.  Only in the 1800s, when it was rediscovered
by the same forces of romance and tourism that were building stage sets in
Carcassone, did Rothenburg again begin to do business.  Its product, then and
today, is its past.    
<BR></P>
<P>The complaint is sometimes voiced that Rothenburg wears its past as a frozen
mask, with no face behind it&#151;that there is no there there, just a stylized
performance piece for the entertainment of visitors and the extraction of their
coins.  It's true that the only commerce within these walls today is the tourist
trade, and true again that here (as anywhere) this trade can lack subtlety. 
More well known than is good for it, Rothenburg can be much too cute and much
too crowded, particularly during the summer festivals.  Yet the complaint is
also unfair:  the &quot;real life&quot; of any place is, and has always been,
the life at which it finds it can make a living.  Were the heights of old
Franconian villages suitable for building tennis-shoe factories or steel mills,
someone would have long since torn off Rothenburg's mask to do so&#151;and while
today the town might have a very different life, we'd be unlikely to give it a
second glance.<BR></P>
<P>The mask at least is authentic and genuinely old.  Unlike the carefully
rebuilt &quot;old towns&quot; of nearby Nuremburg and Regensburg, the medieval
face of Rothenburg is the real thing; luck rather than restoration.  The town
has twice avoided destruction&#151;once in the Thirty Years' War <I>(see below)</I>,
and again in World War II, when the frantic efforts of an American history buff
averted a scheduled bombing expedition at the last moment.  Stay in Rothenburg
overnight, so that you can rise at dawn and prowl the narrow lanes, stroll the
high walls, with only the mists of time as your company.  At the right moment,
and with the right set of mind, you will find that instead of a mask you are
face to face with another age.  &#164;

<H2>Der Meistertrunk <I>(The Master-Draught)</I></H2>
<P><BR><B>The festival-play,</B> written by the honorary citizen of
Rothenburg Mr. Adam H&ouml;rber, is founded on the following event:  During the
Thirty Years' War, bands of soldiers also came to the neighborhood of
Rothenburg.  The population held steadfastly to the cause of the Swedes, who had
sent from W&uuml;rzburg as a garrison a detachment of about sixty horsemen,
under the command of Rinkenberg.<BR></P>
<P>The town of Rothenburg itself had 700 well-armed warriors.  Although the van
of Tilly's army, which approached from Aschaffenburg, was erroneously believed
to be only a small pillaging band, all efficient citizens hastened to the
fortifications in defence of the town.<BR></P>
<P>On the second day the assailants made a breach in the wall at the
Henkersturm and climbed up, thinking they had won the day, when the defenders,
aided by women and children, who assisted by fetching stones, succeeded in
repelling the enemy.  About six hundred men lay dead or wounded in the moats. 
About noon, however, Tilly himself arrived with his main force of 30,000 men,
and proceeded at once to attack the town from all sides.  A part had already
entered it at the Johanniterhof, but the citizens succeeded a second time in
driving them back.  The council, assembled in the town hall, inspired the
defenders to the utmost resistance.  At the Klengentor the stock of powder
stored there was blown into the air, and the cries of the wounded made the
others believe that the town was lost.  First singly, then in groups, the
beleaguered left their posts, after having fought at the walls for thirty hours.<BR></P>
<P>Many were killed, most men were wounded, and fresh forces were not
available.  The Swedish officer capitulated, and he was granted an orderly
retreat.  But the citizens were at the mercy of the enemy.  Tilly and his suite,
among whom was Count Pappenheim, made their entrance.  The council of war
demanded the destruction of the town, and the soldiers dispersed in the streets
and houses to plunder.  The women and children implored Tilly's mercy.  The
councillors, however, were sentenced to death.  Burgermeister Bezold himself was
ordered to fetch the executioner.  But the faithful servant refused to perform
the duties of his office, and offered his own head.  The delay caused hereby was
used by the Kellermeister (butler) to offer Fieldmarshal Tilly a cup of welcome,
for which purpose the old imperial goblet was filled with the best wine.  Tilly
was prevailed upon to drink, and his generals, too, relished the drink after the
hot day.  The enemies had humour and Tilly at last promised his pardon, provided
one of the aldermen was able to empty the 3&#189; litre goblet at one draught. 
Burgermeister Nusch accepted the challenge and succeeded in emptying the goblet.
 The messenger of the town council hastened to meet the Burgermseister, and the
lane where he met him is called to this day &quot;Fredeng&auml;ssen&quot; (Lane
of Joy).  The goblet was preserved in the family, and is now in the local
museum.<BR></P>

<H1>Cruising the English Chunnel</H1>
<P><I>By Bosley Wilder</I></P>
<HR>
<H2><I>But Where are the Fish?</I><BR></H2>
<P>Europe's biggest new travel sensation, the splendid engineering feat known
as The Chunnel, finally opened on November 21, 1994, after years of negotiations
and progress, and some $15 billion.<BR></P>
<P>The sophisticated Eurostar, gliding along at up to 186 mph, transports
passengers between Paris and London in three hours.  The London-to-Brussels run
takes fifteen minutes longer.   Twenty minutes of that time are spent in the
tunnel itself beneath the English Channel, a crossing remembered by the more
seasoned travelers among us as a chug-and-splash overnight by train and ferry
between Folkestone and Calais.<BR></P>
<P>Not so improbably, this  international train with its state-of-the-art
trilingual operating system still experiences some glitches.  Adapting to the
various operating conditions of three different national railway designs and the
Tunnel, the system must adjust to three types of electrical power supply, from
the third rail on the southern UK rail system, to new, overhead high-speed lines
in France and Belgium, to the conventional lines north of London.  In the
train's first year and a half of operation, the sleight of hand needed to
perform these shifts has not been perfect -- with the result that taking the
Chunnel to get to a pressing  appointment can occasionally be a bit like playing
roulette, though here the odds are in one's favor.<BR></P>
<P>Eurostar's London head office explains that out of 1,000 runs each month, &quot;one
or two&quot; are apt to be delayed from five minutes to over an hour on entering
or leaving the Tunnel, owing to the  required changeover from electronic to
manual operation at the switchpoints. (A computer-age version of the old
streetcar trolley  conductor having to stop at certain intersections to switch
overhead electric power lines?)  Eurostar has been beset by a few other
problems, like last year's French railroaders' three-week strike. But the
majority of travelers -- and there have been over 3,000,000 on Eurostar since
its initial run -- still find a good journey.<BR></P>
<P>The other day, having lingered over the magnificent vaulted glass ceiling of
that huge and most beautiful of railway stations, Paris' Gare de Nord, I
descended the stairs to board the great Eurostar.   My first view of the sleek,
handsome, yellow, bullet-nosed engine that was about to whiz  us to London in
the coming three hours was reassuring.   A Pierre Balmain-suited hostess helped
me find my seat.  I arranged myself comfortably, and smiled at the seat
companion opposite.  Seats are arranged face-to-face; two on two in tourist
class, two on one in first class.  There is plenty of leg room, with a small
table convenient for snacks or newspapers between the passengers.  The resulting
comfort merits high marks over airplane accomodations.  At 5:02 p.m. the train
slid silently out of the station.  The quiet and efficiency of the train made it
hard to believe one was moving as we rolled through the outskirts of Paris. 
Tall buildings seemed to merge, poplar trees slipped by.  Barely five minutes
out of the station, passengers looked incredulously out of the windows to a
rural scene of cows and pasture.  What happened to the sprawling suburbs of
Paris?  And all those small towns one chugged through  on the old <I>chemin de
fer</I> of the past?  Picardy flashed by in a sort of virtual-visual Doppler
effect.  The <I>zooomssst!</I> of a train passing in the opposite direction
lasted barely a few seconds.  I got up and moved around the train, checking out
the amenities.<BR></P>
<P>Food vendors moved carts through the coaches, with attractive-looking
sandwiches, fresh pastries, and drinks.  In first class, meals are served at the
seats.  The train carries telephones, changing rooms, and two bar cars.  Two
areas of the train are especially available to handicapped passengers, with
narrow wheelchairs provided that can easily navigate the aisles and washrooms. 
About one quarter of the train's 794 seats are reserved for smokers.  Storage
shelves at each end of a coach as well as overhead compartments provide ample
storage space for baggage.<BR></P>
<P>As Eurostar approaches the tunnel, it continues silently over the tracks,
with no sense of that &quot;swoosh&quot; experienced on entering a tunnel by
conventional train; you could be sitting at home playing cards.  We were ten
minutes &quot;into the Tunnel&quot; when a Customs Inspector came through our
coach, and nothing but his words indicated that we had descended to between 30
and 50 meters under the seabed, in a 7.6-meter tube of a tunnel, and that
somewhere out there fish were swimming over our heads!  About ten minutes later,
over the loudspeaker came an amiable British accent:  &quot;This is your Pursar.
 Welcome to Great Britain!&quot;  And we swept into London's ultra-modern
Waterloo International Station, as smoothly, as effortlessly  as a lark.  My
watch read 7:07 p.m.  Taking into account the hour's difference between  France
and England, the train ride between the two of the world's great cities had
taken three hours and two  minutes.  &#164; <BR></P>

<H2>Traveler Information:</H2>
<P>Eurostar's Paris-London run has 11 services daily in each direction (up from
seven, a year ago); the London-Brussels run, six.  The line carries around
40,000 passengers a week.  At the present time, fares on the London-Paris
Eurostar and the London-Brussels runs are identical.  First class is $154
one-way. The first class price includes a four-course airplane-style meal,
complete with champagne and/or other beverage.  Double the fares for all round
trips.  Second class is $123.  Discovery Special, which requires a 14-day
advance and is not refundable, is $75.  Group rates are available. Tel:
800-387-6782.  A good savings suggestion for the traveller wishing to ride the
Chunnel one way and fly one way between London and Paris:  British Midland, the
second largest air carrier in the United Kingdom (and a United Airlines Mileage
Plus partner), offers a special one-way fare of $109 for passengers who are
non-European citizens.  Tickets must be purchased in the U.S. Tel: 800-366-6387.

<H2>Frankfurt</H2>
<P><BR>
<I>by Susan Ladika</I><BR></P>
<P><B>For most Americans, a visit to Frankfurt simply means flying into the
airport</B>, renting a car, and speeding down the Autobahn into the German
countryside.  On first sight, Frankfurt is a city filled with chrome and glass
bank buildings, but dig a little deeper to discover its charms. While it lacks
the beauty of a Vienna or a Munich, this city straddling the Main River has
labored to refurbish or reconstruct its best-known historical landmarks.   
<BR></P>
<P>The Romer, first built in 1305, again houses plush offices of city hall. 
Hauptwache, a guard station erected in 1729, now houses a cafe.  Kaiserdom, its
most imposing cathedral, was renovated in time for the city's 1200th anniversary
celebration in 1994.  More recently, Frankfurt has earned its reputation as the
financial capital of Germany.  The city houses the central banks for both  the
European Union and for Germany, along with more than 400 banks from around the
globe.  The multitude of banks and their towering skyscrapers give rise to the
city's two nicknames:  Bankfurt and Mainhattan.  
<BR></P>
<P>The city's reputation as a modern-day financial center comes as no surprise.
 As early as the 1200s, Frankfurt was gaining  prominence as a site for German
trade fairs.  And even today, the bulk of Frankfurt's visitors come on business
trips.  Nonetheless, Frankfurt keeps an eye to its past.  The key symbol of the
city's history is Romerberg, a square in the heart of the old city.  The
square's most distinctive feature is three pinkish buildings, collectively known
as the Romer, which were built in 1305.  A century later, they became the city
hall.  But a barrage of Allied bombs in 1944 reduced the Romer&#151;along with
much of Frankfurt&#151;to rubble.  Following WW II, Frankfurt had to be rebuilt
almost from the ground up, and many modern buildings were thrown together to
fill the housing gap.  
<BR></P>
<P>But the city took great pains to restore the Romer to its former glory. 
Later, half-timbered houses were constructed on the other side of the square. 
Cafes dishing up traditional German fare fill many of the buildings, and tables
are set outside in summertime for diners to sit out under the warming sun.  Just
off Romerberg is Kaiserdom, built on foundations dating from 852.  Emperors have
been crowned at the pinkish-toned cathedral since the mid-1500s, and visitors
can climb the stairs in the adjacent tower for a bird's-eye view of the city.  
A few blocks from Romerberg is another famous Frankfurt church, Paulskirche. 
It's considered the cradle of German democracy because the first elected
parliament met within its walls in 1848.  Nearby is Goethehaus, a tribute to
Johann Wolfgang Goethe, the country's best-known poet.  The building was
destroyed during World War II, but has been meticulously reconstructed, and
filled with possessions from the poet and his family. 
<BR></P>
<P>Frankfurt also celebrates it culture with a string of museums dotting the
southern bank of the Main River.  Among them is the Stadel Museum, whose
collection contains paintings from most European schools and periods.  The
Museum of Applied Arts houses 30,000 handicrafts produced in Europe and Asia
throughout the centuries.  Frankfurt features an abundance of theater troupes
and concert venues.  The classical Alte Oper, refurbished in 1980, is home not
only to operas, but to rock shows and conferences.  
<BR></P>
<P>For visitors longing for the outdoors after a night in the confines of an
airplane or a day of museums, the city offers the Frankfurt Zoo and the
Palmengarten.  At the zoo, most animals are housed in areas that resemble their
natural habitat.  One section lets visitors view the nocturnal habits of small
animals.  The Palmengarten contains a massive greenhouse full of tropical and
semi-tropical plants, while native European flora dot the grounds.  For that
special beer stein to bring home for  Dad, or the latest in European fashion,
Frankfurt has an abundance of shops.  But plan your excursion early in the day;
shops  generally close at 6pm everyday but Thursday, and by 2pm Saturdays.  On
Schillerstrasse and Goethestrasse, exclusive boutiques like Tiffany and Hermes
hug the sidewalks, while more reasonably priced merchandise (at least by
European  standards) can be found along the Zeil, one of the busiest shopping
streets in Europe.  
<BR></P>
<P>For bargain shoppers, try the flea market in Sachsenhausen on Saturday
morning.  Everything from antiques to junk can be found among the jumble on the
south side of the Main River.   The Sachsenhausen section of the city also is
known for its German gemutlichkeit.  The local apple wine, along with boisterous
conversation, flows freely around the table, accompanying such specialities as
sausage, pretzels and sauerkraut.  
<BR></P>
<P>Frankfurt also is an ideal base for day trips into the countryside.  One of
the area's oldest sites is Saalburg, a fort reconstructed on Roman ruins dating
from the first entury. Ancient Roman artifacts are on display, and visitors can
walk the walls of the ruins.  
<BR></P>
<P>Nearby is Hessenpark, an open-air museum full of buildings from the region. 
If an old, historic structure winds up in the path of the wrecking ball, it is
carefully dismantled, trucked to the park, and reassembled like an over-sized
jigsaw puzzle.  The buildings are grouped together in villages representing
various regions, and drugstores and schools are equipped as they may  have been
in centuries gone by.  More contemporary history can be found in Bad Homburg, a
spa town discovered by the Romans and later developed as a place for European
aristocracy in the 1800s.  As tribute, the King of Siam built a temple in the
town's Kurpark, and Czar Nicholas I constructed a Russian chapel nearby.  Two
complexes offering swimming and a fitness center also are located in the park,
and visitors arrive by the busload to play blackjack, baccarat and roulette at
the casino.   
<BR></P>
<P>Then it's time to get in that rental car and zip off down the Autobahn, to
the next quaint German town.  &#164;  </P>
<HR>
<H2><I>Cologne Cathedral</I></H2>
<P><BR></P>
<P><I><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><B>(Excerpt from &quot;A Satchel Guide to Europe&quot;,
1880)</B></FONT></I><BR></P>
<P><B>Cologne</B>, or <B>K&ouml;ln, </B>is 43 miles by rail from
Aix-la-Chapelle.  This famous city was originally the chief town of the ancient
Ubii, the Oppidum Ubiorum of Tacitus; but it became known as Colonia Agrippina
from A. D 51, when Agrippina, who was born here while her father  Germanicus
held command in the district, induced her husband Claudius to send a colony of
veteran soldiers to the place.  It afterwards became the chief town of Germania
Secunda or Inferior.  The Roman remains consist of what is called the
Pfaffenport, supposed to be the old Porta Claudia, and some fragments of the
walls.  Many statues, sarcophagi, mosaic pavements, etc., have been found in and
about the city. 
<BR></P>
<P>The Cathedral is the glory of the modern city, and when completed will be
the grandest Gothic church in the world.  It was begun in 1248, but the work
went on slowly, and the choir was not consecrated until 1322.  Little more was
accomplished after that date, and nothing from the be ginping of the 16th
century until our own day.  In 1795 the French used the building as a hay
magazine, and stole the lead from the roof.  In 1816 its restoratlon was begun
under the auspices of the King of Prussia, and since then more than &#163;400,000
(or two millions of dollars) has been expended upon it.  The entire structure is
now completed with the exception of the towers, which are to be more than 500
feet high. The interior, according to Baedeker, is 448 feet long and 49 broad,
or 249' through the transepts; and the choir is 49 feet high.  The magnificent
south portal (234 feet high), finished in 1859, cost &#163;105,000, or more than
half a million dollars.  The stained glass in the windows of the north aisle
(1508-9) is much admired.  It may be compared with the Munich glass in the south
aisle, presented by Louis of Bavaria in 1848.
<BR></P>
<P>In the choir the carved stalls and the statues on the pedestals attached to
the pillars are of the 14th century.  The Chapel of the Three Kings contains a
gorgeous shrine of the latter part of the 12th century, enclosing the bones of
the Magi, brought by the Empress Helena from Constantinople to Milan, and
afterwards transferred by Frederick Barbarossa to Cologne.  A fee is charged for
showing this shrine and the treasury, which contains a silver shrine and other
costly relics.  There is a separate fee for admission to the choir and choir
chapels (open without charge at certain hours); also for the choir gallery, the
outer gallery, and central tower.  These  last should be visited for the views
of the interior of the church, and of the city and the surrounding country,
which they afford.  &#164;   
</P>
<P><I>The  piece above continues our occasional excerpts from &quot;A Satchel
Guide to Europe&quot;, a book published in Boston in 1880 for the benefit of
aristocratic Americans embarking on the Grand Tour.  As always with these
excerpts, remember that the writer's words of advice were written over a century
ago, and one or two things may have changed!  The Cathedral, however,  today
completed (and restored from the brutal damage of two wars since the Satchel
Guide writer viewed it), is still quite magnificent.  The Cathedral is almost
immediately adjacent to the main rail station; if your rail plans take you
through Cologne, as many routes do, check the schedules to see if you can stop
over for an hour or so.  It's worth it.

<H2>Europe Writes...</H2>
<P><I>Notes from Paris by David Whitehouse</I><BR></P>
<P><B>Duty Free: The Party&#146;s Over
<BR></B><BR> The European Commission is taking an increasingly hard line on
duty-free purchases made by travelers within the EU, which it believes
constitute a distortion of the European single market.  EU finance ministers
voted in 1992 to phase out the tax concession, but allowed a 6-year transition
period until June 1999.  The single market was created in 1992 to try to create
a level playing field for free trade across the continent.  Mario Monti, the
commissioner for the single market, says the long duty-free transition period
has craeted a situation which is &#147;far from satisfactory.&#148;  Monti said
the removal of frontier controls as a result of the Schengen agreement had made
it harder to monitor the actual level of purchases made.  The current duty-free
ceiling per passenger stands at ECU90 ($115) for journeys between member states.
 Responsibility for enforcing these limits has been passed on to retailers and
travel authorities -- who naturally aim to sell as much as possible. 
</P>
<P>In a recent report unanimously accepted by his fellow commissioners, Monti
argues that duty-free &#147;can produce distortions of competition not only
regarding tax-paid goods, but especially between different means of transport. 
For example, Eurotunnel, which operates the Channel Tunnel, is angry that it may
not offer duty-free goods while competing services can. 
</P>
<P>Monti firmly rejected any extension of duty-free beyond 1999, and criticized
member states as being poorly prepared for the switch.  The International Duty
Free Confederation said it would continue to press for a reprieve.  It argues
that tax-free trade increases employment and means cheaper tickets for
travelers.  But real political capital has been invested in the full
implementation of the single European market, so it looks like travelers should
load up while they have the chance. 
<BR></P>
<P><B>Eurostar in Overdrive<BR><BR></B>  Passenger traffic on the Eurostar
train which links London, Paris, and Brussels has surged by 40% since its
acquisition by the private London and Continental Railways (LCR) consortium in
April.  The service is already close to matching in 1996 the 1995 passenger
total of 3.5 million, and has a final target for this year of 6.5 million. 
Continued rapid progress of this sort is absolutely essential.  The service has
been heavily loss-making since its launch in 12994.  </P>
<P>LCR, which includes the Virgin Group and National Express, must push
passenger traffic to 10 million per year if it is to start making money and
achieve a successful stock flotation of Eurostar.  Eurostar&#146;s early
performance was hurt by overpricing.  Tickets cost &#163;99 when the service was
launched -- too high to achieve genuine mass-market penetration.  Eurostar has
tacitly acknowledged this and the lowest economy fares have gradually come down
to around &#163;50. 
</P>
<P>The Brussels link remains the clear underperformer with trains on average
only 40% full.  The Belgian capital cannot realistically compete with London and
Paris in terms of tourist pull.  But the city enjoys a crucial, and still
growing, role as the capital of the European Union.  The answer may be to more
clearly differentiate the Brussels leg of the network as dedicated to the needs
of the business traveler.<BR></P> 
<P><B>EU Confidence Vote for Emerald Isle<BR><BR></B>  Rapidly escalating
sectarian tensions may be threatening the rebuilding of tourism in Northern
Ireland.  But the European Union Commission has given a vote of confidence to
the Emerald Isle&#146;s tourist assets by approving a package of aid worth &#163;283
million in support of a range of transport and environmental projects south of
the border in the Republic of Ireland.  A grant of &#163;69.1 million is being
set aside to fund the extension of Dublin&#146;s rapid transit rail line, and to
improve track and signaling on the railways.  &#163;93.6 million is to be spend
on five road-building projects in the counties of Kildare, Cork, Louth, and
Wexford.  The aim is to ease traffic congestion and improve the environment. 
Funded conservation projects include the protection of the Lough Ree on the
River Shannon, and the improvement of water quality in the River Suir.  The
extension of the sewer network in Killarney is seen as essential to help cope
with a boom in tourism.<BR></P>

<IMG SRC="http://www.eurodata.com/evline.gif">
<P><!--Can a street be a sight by Rick Steves--><BR></P>
<P><B>Greatness is a matter of contrast.</B>  A warm shower is great after a
cold one.  A noble city is royal after Zurich.  A cozy street is a slow-motion
reunion of lovers when imbedded in the heart of Paris. 
<BR></P>
<P>Calling Paris grand is like calling God smart.  Even the M&eacute;tro stop
for my village home in Paris is grand: it&#146;s Ecole Militaire.  Ascending
from the M&eacute;tro, the French Annapolis, with a front yard made for breaking
in jackboots (1,000 at a  time), is a holler away.  But turn your back on that
and you have Flo&#146;s, a patisserie filled with the kind of food you giftwrap.
 And around the corner is <I>rue Cler</I>. 
<BR></P>
<P>Walking down rue Cler makes me feel like I must have been a poodle in a
previous life.  It&#146;s a cobbled pedestrian street lined with shops run by
people who&#146;ve found their niche...boys who grew up on quiche.  The crepe
man proudly makes crepes like he just figured it out.  Aproned fruit stall
attendants coax doll-like girls into trying their cherries.  Ladies, after a
lifetime of  baguette munching, debate the merits of the street&#146;s rival
boulangeries.  And young girls look chic in just-out-of-bed hair.  
<BR></P>
<P>And proudly sporting its one star, as if that&#146;s all there was, the
Grand Hotel Leveque pries apart a cafe and a cheese stall just  wide enough to
plant its front door.  Hotel Leveque is rand in the sense of grand old days. 
The cackle of Mimi, the  receptionist who is endlessly entertained by her
inability to understand her English-speaking guests and the thin soprano of  the
singing maid (who bicycles to work when city workers, who make double her wage
with no need to sweat, strike in  order to get free parking) waft up the
courtyard that provides air but no view to half the rooms.  After long spirals
of museum-going, sightseers pull ever-heavier knees up spirals or stairs. 
Yesterday&#146;s sheets line the halls  in rumpled white mounds but my bed&#151;straight
and tidy below its Lincoln log pillow&#151;says recline. 
<BR></P>
<P>Surveying Paris from my 4th floor window, Mansart&#146;s town survives. Only
the churches and the Biffel Tower exceed the six  story code.  Buildings fill
the city like waffle mix&#151;done just about right.  Below me is village Paris,
my market street, rue Cler.<BR></P>
<P>Across from Hotel Leveque, above the Boeuf-Cheval-Triperie awning, a golden
horse head surveys the crowds.  He knows  those with day bags, fanny packs and
cameras eat the boeuf.  Those toting baguettes, dogs and baby strollers eat the
horse  and tripe.  Those with less than that wait for the end-of-the-day &#147;food
dump&#148; as shops fill the rue Cler trash cans with no-longer-fresh food.  
<BR></P>
<P>Joining two beefeaters at a cafe, they tell me they conceived their daughter
here two years ago and named her Paris.  Now they&#146;re back, their first time
away from the child, buying souvenirs with their baby&#146;s name on them. 
Connoisseurs of good  living keep rue Cler in business.  Flower shops add a
fragrance to the breeze.  A man with working class hands cradles a  bouquet and
a baguette in his arms.  Another greedily hurries home with his tart.  &#147;Pear
and chocolate&#148; he giggles. &#147;The  <I>vieux Corse</I> cheese can only
be found on rue Cler,&#148; another local brags.  Every shop is jammed save the
health food store. Even bums drink a better wine on rue Cler.  &#164;<BR></P>

<P><BR><I><B>Notes from Paris by David Whitehouse</B></I><BR></P>
<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><I>Fighting for Libert&eacute;</I></FONT>
</B><BR></P>
<P>A fierce battle between Britain and France has broken out over the fate of
Air Libert&eacute;, a private French airline which went into receivership at the
end of September.  British Airways (BA) has set its sights on acquiring the
concern.  BA already has a stake in the French market through its control of the
TAT airline.  Libert&eacute; and TAT together would constitute the largest
airline presence in France after Air France.  BA is not particularly interested
in Libert&eacute;'s equipment or services, but its precious landing slots at
airports are a different proposition.  </P>
<P>If BA is successful, its new group would control almost 25% of the 250,000
slots at Orly Airport.  These plans are a source of concern for the French
government.  They would prefer to see a takeover of Libert&eacute; by the French
regional airline Air d'Outre Mer (AOM).  But there is a big snag.  AOM is owned
by Credit Lyonnais, the struggling French state-owned bank which the government
has bailed out with public money.  Such aid can only be authorized after careful
scrutiny by the European Commission in Brussels; BA argues that conditions
governing the subsidies to Credit Lyonnais will be broken if the bank takes a
private airline under its wing.  An alternative French escape route may be
available.  Jacques Maillot, head of the French travel business Novelles Fronti&egrave;res,
has confirmed that he wants to buy both Libert&eacute; and AOM to forge a new,
privately-owned group.  Maillot also heads the Corsair charter airline. 
</P>
<HR>
<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><I>Breaking the Gridlock</I></FONT></B><BR></P>
<P>The difficulties which tourists encounter in trying to navigate their way
around the car-dominated environment of London are legendary.  An ambitious plan
to route traffic through a series of deep underground tunnels has already been
touted (see <A HREF="http://www.eurodata.com/ewrites4.htm">EV #3, &quot;Europe
Writes...&quot;</A>.   Now, plans to pedestrianize parts of Trafalgar and
Parliament Squares are moving back into the spotlight, with a feasibility study
to receive funding support from the National Lottery, according to a report in
<I>The Independent</I>, a British newspaper.<BR></P>
<P>The most likely schemes include pedestrianizing the north side of Trafalgar
Square, next to the National Gallery, which would create a pedestrian zone
between Leicester Square and Trafalgar Square.  Pedestrianizing the south side
of Parliament Square, next to the Palace of Westminster, is also a possibility. 
The report will also look at improving pedestrian access around Charing Cross
station, and at speeding bus times in the area.
<BR></P>
<P>At peak times in central London, traffic moves no faster than did the horse
and cart, and action is urgently needed.  Sir Jocelyn Stevens, chairman of
English Heritage, says:  &quot;Westminster Abbey, the Palace of Westminster, and
St. Margaret's Church are designated a World Heritage site, but the space
between them is prominently occupied by cars.&quot;  Malcom Haxby, associate
director of planning at Westminster Council, says:  &quot;In the past, schemes
have foundered on the problems of worries about increased traffic jams.  Now we
are looking at it the other way round.  We're going to say, here's a good
scheme, let's implement it, and then sort out what to do with the cars.&quot; 
Lottery funding will provide half the cost of the &#163;250,000 report, which
will take a year to complete and will be called &quot;World Squares for All.&quot;

<HR>
<H1>Plymouth</H1>
<P><I>by Nick Gregory</I></P>
<HR>
<P><BR></P>
<H2><I>A City of Britain's South Devon Coast</I></H2>
<P><BR></P>
<P>Just two minutes' walk from the railway station, the view from North Cross
along the dip and rise of Armada Way, a pedestrian boulevard mosaiced with
rockeries and artificial streams, reveals the heights of the Hoe. The view is
dominated by the candy-striped pinnacle of Smeatons Tower, and the lush green of
the lawns and the flower arrays that lead to it -- for Plymouth is a former
winner of Britains &quot;City in Bloom&quot; competition -- contrast with the
hustle of a city centre on a summer afternoon.<BR></P>
<P>The train journey into the city passes spectacular scenery along the coast
between Dawlish and Teignmouth, where red cliffs tower over the train as
breakers crash onto beaches segregated by the more resistant rocky outcrops. 
These had to be tunneled through by Isambard Kingdom Brunel, as he designed his
Great Western Railway to meet the fast Clippers from the Indies and the East.  A
little further on the route climbs and drops steeply over the banks of the South
Hams, rolling green dairy pasture to the left and the heathered tors of Dartmoor
to the right.  The train continues through the medieval castled town of Totnes,
where steamer trips can be taken down the river Dart to the picturesque harbour
of Dartmouth.  Passing the Plym estuary with its mud flats and wading birds, the
traveler arrives in the city a little under four hours from London's Paddington
station. <BR></P>
<P>The downtown area of Plymouth was completely razed during heavy bombing by
the German Luftwaffe in 1941and thus saw reconstruction during the 1950s and 60s
-- a time when square and concrete seemed like a good idea. Within the past ten
years, however, pedestrianisation of the main commercial areas and some
extensive landscaping has transformed the centre and added considerable
character.  The huge sun-dial at the intersection of Armada Way and New George
Street is a centerpiece to the refurbishment and has become the unofficial
meeting and busking point for the city's inhabitants.  A little farther down,
New George street is the entrance to the covered market, which exudes the
vitality of a trade market with the concern for appearance of a quality flea
market.  Fruit, vegetables, fish, meat and a plethora of other goods can be
found in this glass-domed Aladin's cave.  It is open daily except for Sundays.<BR></P>
<P>Up the hill from the dominating tower of the Civic Centre, past the large
hotels and the anchor from the World War Two aircraft carrier <I>Ark Royal</I>,
open space returns with a commanding view from the Hoe Promenade over Plymouth
Sound, the large natural harbour nestled between headlands at Rame in southeast
Cornwall and Bovisand, which houses fortifications left from the Napoleonic wars
and is now home to a world- renowned diving centre.<BR></P>
<P>The Smeatons lighthouse tower, far and away Plymouth's most photographed
feature, is no longer used for the purpose of guiding shipping away from the
famous &quot;wrecking rocks&quot; of the westcountry; but for a small fee it
serves as an excellent viewing gallery for the surroundings, including (on a
clear day) the Eddystone Rock light, fourteen miles to the south west, and the
former situation for the Smeatons Tower (1759-1882). Directly in front is
Drake's Island (St Nicholas Island), which was used once as a fortification, and
later as an adventure sports centre, before being sold to a private buyer.<BR></P>
<P>Within a few minutes' walk from the Tower is the Plymouth Dome, a visitor
and info centre with interactive displays depicting life in the city through the
ages.  A viewing area offers telescopes for watching the shipping in the port,
with computer screens giving details of the ships present.  Carefully crafted
displays recreate Elizabethan scenes around the viewer and show the old pre-war
city in full sight, sound and smell.<BR></P>
<P>A short walk around the seafront, past the Aquarium and Citadel, is the
Barbican, the city's oldest quarter with many buildings appearing as they would
have been in the times of Drake, Raleigh and the Pilgrim Fathers.  Narrow
cobbled streets criss-cross in front of Sutton pool and the working fish market.
 The Elizabethan houses are filled with curio shops and antiques, and cheap
eating can be had at the many &quot;fish and chip&quot; shops, which are
supplied fresh from the quay.  Elizabethan House, in the rather inappropriately
named New Street, is open to visitors and is furnished as it was four hundred
years ago.<BR></P>
<P>A plaque by some rather ordinary-looking steps commemorates the departure of
the Pilgrim Fathers from this point as they escaped  persecution and sailed for
the New World. These steps are, of course, the &quot;Mayflower Steps.&quot; 
Other famous sailings from the port include Drake's global circumnavigation and
Darwin's travels of evolutionary discovery aboard the Beagle.  A number of good
pubs can be found close by with names reminiscent of such a history.  They
provide an excellent oppurtunity to sit and take in the scenery and atmosphere,
whether it be sunny or blowing a strong prevailing &quot;sou'westerly.&quot; 
<BR></P>
<P>In Southside Street the working Plymouth Gin distillery is still operating
and open as a pub, with the stills visible through clear screens from the
upstairs bar.<BR></P>
<P>Being a port of some history, Plymouth has a famous nightlife.  Although
much tamed these days, it was once compared to Hamburg's Reeperbahn and is still
lively, with numerous clubs and pubs dotted along the eastern end of Union
Street and a nationally renowned theatre on Royal Parade. With the decline of
the naval base, once the largest in Europe, neon signs and thumping music no
longer draw so large a military clientele; so the atmosphere is more up-market. 
The pubs and restaurants of the Barbican area offer an alternative to the gaudy
brilliance of Union Street, though they can become quite crowded on weekends.<BR></P>
<P>For sightseeing, open-topped buses run in the summer around the circuit of
tourist attractions, starting at the info kiosk on the intersection of Armada
Way and Royal Parade.  There are also boat trips from the Barbican and Hoe to
the dockyard, past the art deco swimming pool at Tinside and William of Orange's
victualling yard; longer trips can be taken up the river Tamar to the Royal
Albert Bridge, built by Brunel to take his railway over the river and into
Cornwall, and on up to Calstock and the tin mine attraction at Morwellham Quay. 
These offer a pleasant voyage through some beautiful scenery and a relaxing
break from the city.<BR></P>
<P>One excellent outing on a summers day is to take the foot-passenger ferry
from Stonehouse (near the western end of Union Street) to Cremyll and the Mount
Edgecombe country park.  From there a walk of a few miles through woods and
along the seashore, overlooking the Sound to the fishing village of Cawsand,
leads you to an inexpensive bus back to the ferry.  There are numerous wonderful
spots to stop for a picnic and admire the view, although you must bring your own
food as the supplies available are limited to ice creams and confectionary. The
park contains numerous architectural follies and gazeboes, as well as abandoned
forts built to defend the home of the British Navy from the French.  Farther
around the coast, but beyond walking distance, is the bay at Whitsands and a
large sandy beach at the foot of high cliffs.  To the north of the city is
Dartmoor, with its heathered bleakness dotted with the cracked monoliths of
granite tors.  Shaggy ponies herd by the roadsides in the summer, begging like
wild urchins from the tourists who park to admire the scenery,.  Watch for the
distinctive profile of Brentor to the west, an extinct volcano with a church
built on top.  According to legend, it was constructed to stop the Devil from
emerging from the depths of Hell after his cloven-hoofed form was seen by a
villager.<BR></P>
<P>A bus ride from Plymouth Bretonside bus station can take you to one of
several destinations for hiking on the moors, including Princetown, whose famous
prison that dominates the town.  Those who are up to it and properly equiped
should remember to take an Ordnance Survey map, to follow an excellent walk that
heads south around South Hessary Tor and then east to Burrator and the
reservoir.  From there it is a short distance to Dousland or the prettier
village of Meavy for another bus.  Check out the ford just outside Meavy, but
don't try to drive through it except with the sturdiest of vehicles!<BR></P>
<P>East of the city is the village of Yealmpton, where the reputed thatched
home of  &quot;Ole Mother Hubbard&quot; of nursery-rhyme fame is to be found.  A
a mile or so further along the A379 is the entrance to the National Shire Horse
Centre, where these immense and beautiful animals can be seen in a working
environment, along with other attractions including a traditional blacksmith's
forge.  On the same bus route are the twin villages of Newton Ferrers and Noss
Mayo, which face each other over the steeply sheltered waters of the river Yealm
estuary.  Yachts sit on the calm waters moored where once small fishing boats
were, and the water front cottages are now the abode of the wealthy, but the
scenery is unalterably quaint, and perhaps sums up the South Devon coast in a
single visit -- if that is all you can spare.  &#164;<BR></P>

<P><EM>by Nathalie Zeidman</EM></P>
<HR>
<P><STRONG><EM><FONT COLOR="#FF0080">A Delightful Stop in the Cotswalds</FONT></EM></STRONG><BR></P>
<P>It was one of those happy accidents travelers dream about.  We were watching
Episode One of the BBC's latest dramatic series, &quot;The Choir&quot; -- a tale
of conflict in the cathedral.  Even more intriguing than the conflict was the
cathedral itself.  In the distance, the square tower crowned by four geometric
spires was strangely familiar.  Close-up, the late afternoon sun spilled
stained-glass colors into a corridor we'd seen before.  &quot;Aldminster
Cathedral&quot;, the announcer called it, but when a troupe of schoolboys dashed
along the stone-paved passage, we remembered.  This was no Aldminster; it was
Gloucester Cathedral, and we'd been there.  By accident!<BR></P>
<P>Several years before, my husband Jerry and I were spending the week at the
Queens Hotel in Cheltenham Spa, a Cotswald town known for its formal gardens and
Regency architecture.  The Queens was Regency outside and in, its facade a Roman
temple, its interior formal yet comfortable.  We were so charmed with the decor
we preferred walking the four flights, for views of the lobby from each landing,
to riding the 1830's cage elevator.  As we learned over the iron railing
enclosing the huge square stairwell we pictured the gentry -- Jane Austin types
in high-waisted gowns -- posed on the stairs.  They had  come to the spa to take
the cure; we had come to explore as much of the Cotswalds, particularly its
churches, as lay within a two-or-three-hours' bus ride. <BR></P>
<P>The Cheltenham-Gloucester Omnibus Depot was a short, gorgeous walk from the
hotel.   On the way we passed nothing but terraces and crescents, each lined
with Regency houses, their facades set off by ornate wrought-iron balconies and
porches and Corinthian columns.  Some Regency fronts concealed offices, even
restaurants.  Our first day in Cheltenham we discovered  the Mandarin Inn.  Over
dim sum we drew up two lists of towns to visit:   &quot;absolutely must&quot;
and &quot;if possible.&quot;<BR></P>
<P>Because of its connection with Dickens, Tewkesbury was an &quot;absolutely
must.&quot;  Tewkesbury, my  notes said, is a village filled with Tudor houses
and inns.  At one of these inns, the &quot;Hop Pole,&quot; Dickens sat Mr.
Pickwick by the fire to warm himself after a long day's stagecoach ride.  Though
the day was mild when we bused into town, the fire was lit in the Hop Pole's
dark paneled public room -- a good place, we discovered, for &quot;shepherd's
pie.&quot;  We couldn't remember if that dish was one of Mr. Pickwick's
favorites, but we did remember to toast the gentleman scribbler with a pint.  He
would have approved of both the toast and the pint, we thought.  Pickwick would
also have approved of the way we narrowed our &quot;if possibles&quot; to
intriguing place names:  Stow-on-the-wold, Bourton-on-water and Lower Slaughter.
 Stow-on-the-wold charmed us with its limestone buildings and oversized market
square, where once the most important wool merchants gathered to do business. 
As for Bourton-on-Water, the River Windrush rushes along its main street.  And
despite its sinister name -- <I>Slaughter</I>, from the Saxon <I>Sloh,</I>
means marshy place -- Lower Slaughter is simply a delightful thatched village.
<BR></P>
<P>We saved what we considered the best for last: Ledbury and Great Malvern,
each known for a  remarkable church.  We are in love with church architecture. 
Back home, commercial buildings  like Trump Towers are considered works of art;
in Britain it's churches.  Besides its church, Ledbury is known for cobbled
lanes barely wide enough for two people to walk abreast, top-heavy houses in
black and white, and Ye Old Talbot Inn.  A 16th century coaching inn, the Talbot
is riddled with bullet holes made when Prince Rupert had a skirmish with the
Round-heads.   Ledbury's real treasure, however, is St. Michael's and All Angels
Church.  St.  Michael's was  begun in Norman England, as its curved front
doorway attests.  The rest is Gothic:   sharp angles, pointed arches, tapering
spires, stained glass; a description to fit most English churches.  What makes
St. Michael's a national treasure is its rare separate bell tower, a tower that
wears a splendid spire like the conical headdress of a medieval queen.  There
are only five such detached towers in the whole county.      For all its
antiquity and charm, Ledbury's St. Michael's is a  country church.  Except for
its spire it nestles unobtrusively among the village's half-timbered houses. 
Great Malvern's Priory Church stands on a rise framed by the Malvern hills, a
picture worthy of Constable.     Climbing the steep streets of the Victorian
town we noticed first the  Priory's great central tower, at once massive and
decorative.  It came to us that just that morning, changing buses in Gloucester,
we'd seen another such tower at a distance.   We followed the Malvern tower  to
the Priory, &quot;one of the finest parish churches in England,&quot; according
to <I>The Little Guide  to Malvern Priory</I>.  Inside, we walked up the south
aisle, down the north, poked around the choir stalls, and bent down to try to
figure out the carvings on the monks stalls.  We thought we could trace farmers
weeding and haymaking, a sort of wooden calendar.  It was easier to identify the
Old Testament figures, Adam and Eve and Noah, in the fifteenth-century  stained
glass windows of St. Anne's Chapel.  We moved slowly, careful not to miss a
transept or a clerestory window, a paneled arch, a doorway, a wooden screen.<BR></P>
<P>Exhausted, behind schedule, and facing a layover in Gloucester, we caught
the bus as it was pulling out.  By the time we got to Gloucester we were rested
and the wait of an hour or two didn't seem so daunting.  &quot;Here's a chance
for a closer look at that tower,&quot; we decided.  Close up, the cream-colored
cathedral tower differed from Malvern Priory's not only in size -- it was taller
and broader -- but in its stone lacework and soaring spires.  A side door opened
into a long corridor, almost immediately overrun by schoolboys peeling off dark
jackets as they raced for the choir changing room.<BR></P>
<P>When the processional began there were fewer than a dozen of us scattered
among the pews.  Down the central aisle red-robed choir boys, their faces framed
by white Renaissance ruffs, moved two by two.  Black-robed parish priests and
other church dignitaries followed.  Not an Anglican, I couldn't distinguish
among them, but it didn't matter.  It was the choir, especially the pure high
notes of the boy sopranos, that stayed with us.  And it was the choir that
helped us relive that evensong when we saw the BBC drama on television.  For
whatever reason, for us, no choir before or since has equaled Gloucester's.    
Afterwards we sat in a sweets shop near the cathedral, drinking Earl Grey tea
and munching Mcvittie's digestive biscuits.  A busload of tourists  swarmed in
and even as they were seated began the kind of table conversation people on
tours engage in.  &quot;I can't imagine,&quot; said one,&quot; why Dorothy would
want to move from Des Moines.&quot;  &quot;It isn't as though Duluth has more to
offer,&quot; said another.  My eyes met Jerry's.   I raised an eyebrow with the
look of superiority I've cultivated for just such moments.  Jerry nodded.<BR></P>
<P>&quot;How could anyone this close to Gloucester Cathedral even mention Des
Moines or Duluth?&quot;  I was indignant.  &quot;If this isn't the high point of
any trip to the Cotswalds, what is?&quot;  Then it hit us.  Two hours before,
Gloucester Cathedral wasn't even on our &quot;if possible&quot; list.  We looked
at each other sheepishly, smiled at the company at large, paid our bill and
left.  &#164;</P>

<H2><I>A Mediterranean Medley</I></H2>
<P>For many travelers, lunch or dinner at a fine restaurant can be the
highlight of a trip to the French Riviera.  Here are a quartet of legendary
restaurants on France's C&ocirc;te d'Azur that serve the cuisine for which this
region is famous.  All are upscale establishments that require reservations.</P>
<HR>
<P><I><B>Le Moulin de Mougins</B></I><BR></P>
<P>&quot;To be a chef is to share happiness,&quot; says master chef Roger Verg&egrave;.
 At his Moulin de Mougins, the restaurant where he has honed his prodigious
talents for the past quarter century, Verg&egrave; shares happiness with film
stars from the nearby Cannes Film Festival and food lovers from around the
world.  Verg&egrave; was among the first to bring the natural flavors and
culinary traditions of his native Provence to the world's attention, deftly
adding a soup&ccedil;on  of African influence to create what he calls &quot;Cuisine
de Soleil&quot;  (Cuisine of the Sun).<BR></P>
<P>Since Verg&egrave; creates a new menu each morning, it's impossible to
predict your choices on a given day.  I can only tell you that my perfect dinner
went something like this:  a refreshing peach drink (of the kind that Verg&egrave;'s
esteemed Aunt Celestine preferred); squash blossom with black truffles; loup (a
local fish similar to sea bass) with braised lettuce and Vermouth sauce; venison
with Autumn vegetables; a raspberry pastry sauced with liqueur; and never-ending
sweets--a &quot;light&quot; Cappuccino cookie, petits fours, gourmandises du
moulin  (chocolates).  Superb wines from neighboring Cassis and the C&ocirc;tes
de Provence complemented the menu selections, with a Corsican Muscat finishing
off the meal.<BR></P>
<P>Given Verg&egrave;'s reputation, neither the extraordinary cuisine, the fine
wines nor the original works of art that fill gardens and interior surprised me.
 But I'll admit to being surprised--and charmed--when our host emerged from the
kitchen to greet us and inquire about our meal.  Roger Verg&egrave; infuses le
Moulin with his warm, engaging, unpretentious personality.<BR></P>

<P><B><I>Ch&acirc;teau Eza Hotel-Restaurant</I></B><BR></P>
<P>On a clear day you can see forever, or at least as far as Monaco and St.
Tropez on the fabled C&ocirc;te d'Azur.  Ch&acirc;teau Eza, atop the nearly
vertical medieval village of Eze, offers luxury accommodations for twenty
fortunate travelers and memorable dining experiences for the rest of us.  <BR></P>
<P>Following telephoned directions, my husband and I left our car at the foot
of the village (where donkeys wait to carry guests' luggage up the narrow
cobblestone streets), then hiked up stone steps that may have been cut into this
steep promontory by the Romans.  <BR></P>
<P>Our efforts were well rewarded.  Chef Andr&egrave; Signoret, who once cooked
at Paris' H&ocirc;tel le Crillon, favored us with an exquisite combination of
venison, foie gras and truffles, preceeded by a parmesan risotto with braised
mushroom caps and followed by a tomato-oregano marinated ch&egrave;vre.  Then,
since we had &quot;earned&quot; dessert by virtue of our strenuous climb, we
sampled dessert chef Fran&ccedil;ois Seurin's signature <I>noir-amer</I>,  a
beautifully presented confection secreting a rich coffee liqueur .<BR></P>
<P>Ch&acirc;teau Eza has dinner menus starting at 350 francs.  A lunch menu
that includes wine, tax and service can be had for 250 francs.  Specialties
include lobster with ratatouille and lemon thyme jelly, sauteed Mediterranean
bass with wild baby fennel, and rack of lamb au jus with little stuffed
vegetables--all, of course, accompanied by stunning Mediterranean views from the
glassed-in dining room and adjacent terrace.<BR></P>

<P><B><I>La R&egrave;serve de Beaulieu</I></B><BR></P>
<P>Now an elegant small hotel-cum-restaurant in the pretty town of
Beaulieu-sur-Mer, La R&egrave;serve de Beaulieu began life as a Florentine-style
villa in 1880.  By the turn of the century, transformed into a restaurant that
catered to royalty, La R&egrave;serve called itself &quot;the restaurant of
kings and the king of restaurants.&quot;<BR></P>
<P>Current chef Jean-Paul Bonin still creates dishes fit for a king in the
Dining Room of La R&egrave;serve, offering classic selections as well as a
constantly changing roster of regional specialties.  His roast lamb subtly
flavored with herbs and served with wild mushrooms offers a taste of Provence,
while beef Charolais comes from the white cattle that graze throughout the heart
of France.  Veal cutlet served with polenta, and turbot with gnocchi &quot;alle
verde,&quot; suggest the restaurant's Italian origins as well as the proximity
of the Italian border. <BR></P>
<P>Our dinner featured a rosace (local fish) with r&ocirc;moulade of celery,
accompanied by a Ch&acirc;teau Simone white from Aix-en-Provence, and roast veal
with souffl&egrave;ed apples and a pepper confit, which we enjoyed with one of
Bandol's great reds, Domaine Tempier 1990.  Appetizers range in price from 150
francs to 320 for the lobster carpaccio, main dishes 180-290.<BR></P>
<P>After a digestif,  it's pleasant to stroll along the beach or into the town
of Beaulieu itself.  Midway between Monaco and Nice, it's still one of the best
addresses on the Riviera.<BR> </P>
<P><I>La R&egrave;serve de Beaulieu, 5 Boulevard du G&egrave;n&egrave;ral
Leclerc, 06310 Beaulieu-sur-Mer; Tel. 93 01 00 01, Fax 93 01 28 99</I></P>

<P><B><I>Restaurant de Bacon</I></B><BR></P>
<P>The old town of Antibes, built by the Greeks and fortified by successive
inhabitants over the centuries, welcomed Pablo Picasso to its Grimaldi Palace in
1946.  Picasso responded by creating his masterpiece, &quot;La Joie de Vivre&quot;
plus some fifty other works of art, which today's visitor can view in the same
building, now the Picasso Museum.<BR></P>
<P>The joyful Riviera spirit that inspired Picasso also animates Restaurant
Bacon, probably the best fish restaurant along this stretch of the coast.  Here
the masterpiece is Bouillabaisse; no one does the traditional Mediterranean fish
soup better than Etienne Sordello at Restaurant Bacon.  Large chunks of eel,
rascasse, and other Mediterranean rockfish swim in a saffron-flavored broth,
enhanced by grated cheese and croutons spread with a spicy rouille.  <BR></P>

<H1>Chichester</H1> 
<P><I>by Bosley Wilder</I></P>
<HR>
<H2><I>Tootling In and Out of English History</I></H2>
<P><BR></P>
<P>Webster defines &quot;To tootle&quot; as, &quot;to drive or move along in a
leisurely manner.&quot;  Certainly this is a most enjoyable and practical  way
to arrive at Chichester, the county town of West Sussex, England.  Seventy miles
south of London on the A23, and one of Sir Lawrence Olivier's favorite cities, 
Chichester is an impressive reminder of the Roman occupation.  Its ancient
cathedral dominates this modern, attractive English town between the famed
Sussex Downs and the sea, and one of the most important cultural centers of
southern England.<BR></P>
<P>Who has gone  to Chichester?  Here are some of the famous in whose footsteps
you may follow:  Cogidubnus, the Celtic king who built his grand palace at
Fishbourne;  King Canute, who ordered the tide to retreat (it didn't).  Many,
many Roman soldiers.  Elizabeth I, who really did sleep here at the Royal Arms
Inn.  Queen Victoria, who  sampled the Milk Punch at the Royal Arms, and enjoyed
it so much that the name of the inn was changed to the Old Punch Bowl.  Mahatma
Ghandi, General Eisenhower.  Leonard Bernstein, commissioned to compose the &quot;Chichester
Psalms;&quot; William Blake, whose poem &quot;Jerusalem&quot; was inspired by
views of the South Downs;  Turner, who drew his famous landscape painting &quot;Chichester
Canal;&quot; John Keats, who began writing &quot;The Eve of St. Agnes&quot;
here.<BR></P>
<P>Founded by the Romans, the city retains many sections of its early defensive
walls, built on Roman foundations.  It is possible to walk through sections of
the ancient city that encloses the compact center of the Tudor Market Cross,
where all roads meet.  Not far from the city itself, ruins over the countryside
include the Fishbourne Roman Palace and Museum.  These survivors of antiquity
give one an awesome sense of exploits, culture, and habitations as they existed
two thousand years ago.  Throughout this charming area of West Sussex, the far
and recent pasts combine in nature, and in the variety of museums, stately homes
and gardens, to give the visitor a fascinating experience of a particular spot
on earth.<BR></P>
<P>The West Sussex Downs are among the most beautiful uplands in the entire
world.  Heading south by car from London toward Chichester, tootling along
narrow backroads with the undulating hills defining the landscape pleasures the
eyes and the spirit.  To walk the moors on a sunny or misty day, to take in the
pastoral landscape stretching away for miles, is sheer poetry.  No wonder some
of England's finest writers, from Shakespeare to Shelley,  have sung their
praises.  Along the roads one finds ideal stopping off places:  country pubs;
guest houses and small hotels for overnight stays.<BR></P>
<P>The chalk Downlands and villages north of Chichester enjoy their own
heritage and atmosphere. Many have ancient churches and a pub in which you can
savour the local hospitality.  Throughout the countryside are picnic areas;
horse riding, with a network of bridle paths, and quiet country lanes that offer
opportunity to explore the area by bicycle, getting to know how people live and
work in the countryside.<BR></P>
<P>As one nears Chichester, the Cathedral dominates the landscape.  Dedicated
in 1108, it is a fine example of Norman architecture with stunning Gothic
additions.  The focal point of the city, its spire rising above the Sussex
plain, is a major landmark visible for miles around.  One of the city's
principal cultural attractions is its internationally renowned Festival Theatre,
the darling of Sir Lawrence Olivier, and its annual arts festival, the
Chichester Festivities, which take place in mid-summer.  Throughout the year,
concerts, jazz, opera, thrillers, and other entertainments thrive.  When the
Chichester Theatre was first founded back in the fifties, it was a forerunner of
many of today's theatres,  ahead of  its time with its in-the-round seating and
its extraordinary lighting possibilities.  Today it remains one of England's
most  prestigious modern theatre complexes.<BR></P>
<P>For the many interested in gardens(for which England is justifiably
renowned), the recently restored West Dean Gardens  retains in its walled
tranquillity a delicious ambience of the Edwardian age.  The garden contains
thirteen original  glasshouses dating from the 1890's, including vinerys, fig
and peach houses, and melon and pineapple pits as well as a wide range of floral
displays, cut flowers, herbs and local fruits. A two-and-one-half mile walk
through the park and  arboretum  offers, in addition to the fine walk itself,
splendid views of the local Downland landscape.  The Prince of Wales's Institute
of Architecture has been active in recreating the accoutrements of the Garden.<BR></P>
<P>One must visit the lovely Pallant House, an elegant Queen Anne townhouse,
holding one of the finest collections of porcelain and French furniture of its
time, as well as an interesting museum collection of domestic gadgets from the
beginning of the Industrial Revolution:  a humane mouse trap, a wasp trap, a
clockwork spit at the fireplace; and several labor-saving devices of the time,
newly invented and beginning to be popular, like an apple peeler and corer and a
bottle jack. Upstairs, off the master study, the original owner built a privy
with a veritable privy shaft leading to the basement--rare, indeed, in an age of
chamber pots.  Pallant House was built in 1712, by Henry Peckham, a young,
upcoming wine merchant. It is interesting to note that Pallant House cost 3,000
British pounds to build --extremely expensive at a time when the most costly
town house was worth 500 British pounds. This was a most lavish Queen Anne-style
residence.  Over a door is the owner's motto, <I>Tentanda via est </I>( &quot;The
way is to be tried&quot;), certainly not unsuitable for a rising industrial
tycoon who was to make a fortune selling wine.<BR></P>
<P>The city also boasts a fine new leisure center with two swimming pools,
sauna, squash courts, bowling greens, tennis courts and an archery club.  In the
vicinity one can  find sailing, windsurfing, fishing --even a flying school and
hot air  balloon ascents in the summertime.  What more can a visitor wish for?<BR></P>
<P>A most fascinating adventure is a visit to the Fishbourne Roman Palace and
Museum.  Discovered only in 1960, when a workman digging a trench cut into the
remains of the largest Roman domestic building yet found north of the Alps, it
is  one of this century's most important archaeological finds in Britain.  Part
of the remains appear to be the palace of the  Celtic king, Cogidubnus; the
Roman establishment, initially part of a military base, was established in A.D.
43.  Here are glimpses of a magnificent first century Roman palace, with mosaic
floors, under-floor heating systems and a bath suite.  Through the spring and
summer, the museum offers hands-on activites in mosaic making, and pottery
through the ages,  with special emphasis on the Roman production.  Here is an
exciting look into the past for both adults and children.   Access for disabled
visitors is very good; there are also free tape-guided tours for visually
handicapped visitors. <BR></P>
<P>Tootling about over Roman roads, cruising a route straight as an arrow past
Arundel Castle,  visiting thatched cottages, 11th century chalets and 16th
century manors is quite good fun.  Along the way there is also Pulburough Brooks
Nature  Reserve, with splendid opportunities for bird-watching in its over 400
acres of nature preserve covers and wetlands.   Tagmere Aviation Museum tells
the story of military flying from the earliest days through 1970. <BR></P>
<P>The heirs and owners of many of England's stately homes are today having to
offer public tours of the premises and  gardens, and lectures on their history,
in order to make ends meet.  Many a lord and lady are up against it
economically.  Goodwood House, ancestral home of the Dukes of Norfolk, is a
great repository of art and other cultural treasures.   Family portraits by Van
Dyck and Reynolds among others look down on a fine collection of Sevres
procelain and royal relics as well as Napoleonic booty.  Enjoyable lessons in
history as well as a peek into the the historical &quot;other half.&quot;  I
personally have always envied those high, tapestried, canopied beds and
comforting foot warmers; although certainly NOT any of the pre-twentieth century
plumbing devices. . . <BR></P>
<P>In a country not especially noted for its cuisine,  the Chichester area has
a variety of attractive restaurants with quite edible viands.  English roast
beef can be hard to beat. With a little search, I savoured an up-market
steak-and-kidney pie.  Fish and chips are usually quite good, and are on most
luncheon menus.  My companion and I tend, however, to stick to the pubs for
lunch.  Grandma used to say there's not too much you can do to a ham sandwich;
and the varieties of ales, bocks and lager beers in England are suberb, and
unbeatable anywhere on the Continent.  &#164;</P>

<P><!--Brussels by Esme Voss--><BR></P>
<P><B>I had only three days in Brussels,</B> not really enough time to see
everything I wanted to see, but just enough to eat, shop and yes, overdose on
chocolate.  Many people visit Brussels on a business trip, or even as a brief
stopover to some other place.  If you don&#146;t have much time to spare, you
can still enjoy what must be one of Europe&#146;s most underrated cities. 
Underrated because although there are no famous monuments, such as the Eiffel
Tower, or ancient tourist traps, like Pompeii,  Brussels holds its own by
offering the visitor delights of a different kind: excellent food, good shopping
and Art Deco architecture.  In three days, I managed to lead a decadent life.  I
ate well, picked up my e-mail and surfed the Internet at a Vietnamese cybercaf&eacute;,
shopped, marveled at the beautiful Art Deco buildings and even managed to
squeeze in a visit to a modern art museum. <BR></P>
<P>I picked up a good map and started in the <B>Gran&#146; Place</B>, the
center of Brussels and its biggest tourist attraction.  The Gran&#146; Place was
once Brussels&#146; central marketplace and the names of the narrow, curving
streets reflect that history: Rue des Bouchers (Butchers&#146; Street), Rue Au
Beurre (Butter Street) and Rue des Harengs (Herring Street). Today, many of the
old guildhouses are filled with restaurants, cafes and chocolate shops and
although they look very old, in reality, the guildhouses date back only to the
early 1700s when the square was rebuilt, in the already pass&eacute; Flemish
Baroque style, after it was destroyed by the French.  The Gran&#146; Place is an
excellent place to sit in the sun, drink beer or linger over a cup of
cappuccino.   
<BR></P>
<P>Not far from the Gran&#146; Place is the <B>Rue Neuve</B> which is lined
with discount shops and big department stores.  Here one finds the giant French
bookstore, FNAC, and the Belgian department store, Inno.  There is also a Virgin
Music Store in the Anspach Center on the Boulevard Anspach a few paces from the
Bourse (stock exchange).   For a more eclectic selection, try the shops on the
rue Antoine Dansaert  off the Boulevard Anspach near the Bourse.  This street
has become a mecca for Brussels&#146; hip and funky.  Here one finds the latest
from Belgian designers, such as Dries van Noten and Ann Demeulemeester, as well
as trendy restaurants frequented by trendy PIBs (people in black). 
<BR></P>
<P>For a completely different pace and ambiance, head to the tranquil, leafy
square called the <B>Place du Grand Sablon</B>.  Unlike the Gran&#146; Place,
the Place du Grand Sablon is quiet and dignified.  Designer boutiques (including
the newly opened Emporio Armani), antique shops and the beautiful church of
Notre Dame du Sablon line the periphery of the square.  Actually, I came here to
try the pastries at Wittamer.  Forget your diet.   The choice of pastries is
simply staggering and everything looks so sinful.  I tried a rich chocolate
mousse cake topped with a chunk of dark chocolate.  Other temptations include
napoleons filled with thick layers of cream, cakes soaked in liqueur and topped
with cream and shaved chocolate, and fruit tarts.  If you happen to be in this
area during the lunch hour, stop off at <B>Le Pain Quotidien</B>, which is a
chain of lunch caf&eacute;s that serve inexpensive creative salads and
sandwiches.    
<BR></P>
<P>Not far from the Place du Grand Sablon are the <B>Mus&eacute;es Royaux des
Beaux-Arts</B>, which consist of a modern art museum (Mus&eacute;e d&#146;Art
Moderne), and a more traditional collection (Mus&eacute;e d&#146;Art Ancien)
with paintings of Rubens and Van Dyck.  The modern art museum focuses on Belgian
artists, including Delvaux and Magritte.   
<BR></P>
<P>For hard-core shopping, nothing beats the area around the Avenue Louise,
which intersects the Boulevard Waterloo and Avenue de la Toison d&#146;Or. 
Here, one finds the big-name designers such as Gucci, Louis Vuitton, and Chanel.
 For those on a more earthly budget, indoor shopping centers, such as the
Galerie Louise (on the Avenue Louise) offer a wide range of shoes, bags,
clothes, sportswear and gifts.  My favorite shop is the <B>Galerie Louise is
Y-Enzo</B>, a shoe store that carries Patrick Cox and Prada.  Other shops in the
area that offer good value are <B>Max Mara</B> (women&#146;s clothes), <B>Sergio
Rossi</B> (women&#146;s shoes), <B>Zara</B> (high street, young women&#146;s
and men&#146;s clothes) and <B>College</B> (women&#146;s clothes).   
<BR></P>
<P>Since I was pressed for time, I decided one day to combine two activities:
pick up my e-mail and eat Vietnamese food.  For this, I chose a cybercaf&eacute;
called <B>@Internem</B> which also doubles as a Vietnamese restaurant.  @
Internem is located on the Boulevard General Jacques, just at the border of
Brussels and the suburb of Ixelles, and is accessible via one of the trams that
travels down the Avenue Louise.  I arrived shortly after the lunch hour and
ordered a large steaming bowl of pho (Vietnamese noodle soup with meat and
vegetables).  The restaurant itself is tastefully decorated and the front room
has four computers with large screen (17-inch) monitors.  The owners of the
restaurant are more than willing to assist customers in picking up their e-mail
and doing a bit of surfing on the World Wide Web.   
<BR></P>
<P>The best eating in Brussels is done in the evening.   One could go crazy
trying to figure out where to eat as there is a restaurant to suit just about
everyone and every budget. Sure, there are places where expense account
Eurocrats blow their countries&#146; national budgets, but they aren&#146;t
necessarily the best.  My favorites near the Gran&#146; Place are:  <B>Taverne
du Passage</B>, 30 Galerie de la Reine, which serves excellent, but heavy
Belgian food at reasonable prices in a turn-of-the-century salon with long
tables, mirrors and high ceilings; and <B>&#145;t Kelderke</B>, 15 Gran&#146;
Place, a cellar with long tables and benches, another inexpensive restaurant
that serves Belgian food.  Both places fill up fast though and getting a table,
especially at &#145;t Kelderke at 9 o&#146;clock in the evening is nearly
impossible.   
<BR></P>
<P>If you want to splurge, but not break the bank, <B>La Quincaillerie</B>, 45
rue du Page, near the Horta museum, serves oysters and wonderful French cuisine
in a turn-of-the-century former hardware store that retains original ironwork
railings on its interior balconies. Art Deco lovers, who happen to be around the
area during the day, should not miss the <B>Horta Museum</B> (which used to be
Victor Horta&#146;s house) on 25 rue Americaine (closed Mondays). 
<BR></P>
<P>Finally, what would a trip to Brussels be without sampling the beer?  My
favorite beers are Duvel and Kriek (which has a sweet berry taste).  Be warned:
both have a very high alcohol content.  &#164;</P>
<HR>
<P><I><B>Practical information:</B>  The country code for Belgium is 32 and
the city code for Brussels is 2.  In general, one should make reservations for
dinner.  Restaurants near the Gran&#146; Place tend to be open till late in the
evening, but fill up fast.  Approx. exchange: $1=30 BF (Belgian francs). 
</I><BR></P>
<P><I><B>Hotels</B></I><BR></P>
<UL>
<LI><B>&agrave; Hotel Rembrandt</B>, 42 rue de la Concorde, 1050 Bruxelles
(phone 32-2-512-7139; fax 32-2-511-7136) off Avenue Louise &#151;charming hotel
close to the shopping areas of Avenue Louise and Boulevard Waterloo.  Excellent
location, but the neighborhood is a bit creepy at night because there are very
few people walking around (unlike the Gran&#146; Place).  If you like to stroll
outside in the evening, you are better off staying in one of the hotels off the
Gran&#146; Place.  The only problem is that the Gran&#146; Place can be noisy. 
One night stay at the Rembrandt: 2300 BF. Ask for room 15.  
<BR></LI>
<LI><B>&agrave; Hotel Argus</B>, 6 rue Capitaine Crespel, 1050 Bruxelles
(phone 32-2-514-0770; fax 32-2-514-1222) off Avenue de la Toison d&#146;Or -
modern hotel with very little character and small rooms - that &#147;chain hotel&#148;
feel; more expensive that the Hotel Rembrandt which has more charm and is just a
couple of blocks away.  One night stay: 3200BF.  
<BR></LI>
<LI><B>&agrave; Arlequin</B>, 17 rue de la Fourche, 1000 Bruxelles (phone
32-2-514-1615, fax 32-2-514-2202) off the Gran&#146; Place - very convenient,
but like the Argus, is new and has no charm whatsoever.  The rooms are also very
small, but there is a dining room on the 7th floor where breakfast is served,
with a view across the Gran&#146; Place and its surroundings.  One night stay:
2400 BF.

<P><!--Andorra  The Longest Shopping Mall in the World By Nathalie Zeidman--><BR></P>
<P><B>In the heart of the Pyrenees,</B> halfway between Toulouse in France and
Barcelona in Spain, lies one of the smallest countries in the world&#151;with
one of the world&#146;s longest shopping malls. 
<BR></P>
<P>Andorra, of course, is more than a shopping mall.  It has skiing slopes,
camping facilities, hiking trails; historic caves and medieval architecture;
wild boar and partridge in the mountains, salmon trout in lakes and rivers.  But
in town there are shops.  Lots of shops!  When we arrived in mid-April the
Pyrenees were capped in snow, their slopes wrapped in fir, their meadows
brightened by  daffodils, heather and rhododendron   Spectacular scenery was
lost on us, however, in our eagerness to make Andorra La Vella, the capital,
before dark.  We needed to settle on lodgings, look the town over, and maybe
before dinner do a little shopping in this discount paradise.<BR></P>
<P>Parked in the main square, more sloping oblong than square, we might have
been in southern France&#151;with one difference. Here the traffic cops are
women, all in jeans, red ski jacket, white gloves and peaked cap above a pony
tail.  The officer flagging signals took time to coo over a baby in a buggy and
listen to our bastardized Spanish-French.  The Andorran language is neither; it&#146;s
Catalan.  The McDonald&#146;s sign, in English, reminded us we were hungry but
not McDonald&#146;s hungry.  Since we planned only an overnight in Andorra
anyway, we&#146;d have to spend  the afternoon sightseeing, possibly getting in
a little shopping.  Our Toulouse chocolate bars  would have to do until dinner.

<BR></P>
<P>With a map of Andorra La Vella and its suburbs in hand, we passed shop after
shop on the ground floor of residencias.  Less than half-a-mile and we were at
Casa De La Vail.  Once the home of a noble Andorran family, this rough stone
building, like a medieval fort, exemplifies the sixteenth-century mountain style
characteristic of Andorra.  Today  it houses both the Principality&#146;s seat
of government and its Ministry of Justice.  From kitchen with hanging copper
pots to paneled chapel, and main room where the General Council of Europe&#146;s
oldest Parliament meets the guided tour, it&#146;s a useful introduction to this
miniature country. 
<BR></P>
<P>In the nearby suburb of Ordino the Casa D&#146;Areny De Plandolit is laid
out in much the same military style as the Casa De La Van, except that its stone
is plastered over and wrought-iron balconies decorate the facade.  An interior
lentil is dated 1613, though the house is thought to be older.  Now a museum
bearing the name of a famous Andorran political reformer, it&#146;s worth at
least the two hours we gave it.  In the reception room, side saddles, branding
irons and a bear collar are standouts.  If the wine cellar is a reminder of the
Principality&#146;s former copious wine production, the olive oil cellar with
stone sink bears witness to the care given this precious liquid, once available
only in prosperous households.  In the meat cellar, a variety of typical
preserved Andorran pork products including sausage, trotters, and ears are hung
from rope, out of the reach of  rats.  We weren&#146;t tempted but in the
kitchen we looked longingly at the tinned biscuits and chocolate on the dresser
and the flat and braided breads in the bakery.  We were hungry.  Better to put
off till tomorrow the Meritxell Sanctuary and the shopping binge. 
<BR></P>
<P>In the heart of suburban Santa Coloma, less than a mile from one of the
longest shopping malls in the world is Hotel Garden.  Looking like a Swiss
chalet, the Hotel Garden boasts tennis court and swimming pool but doesn&#146;t
have a garden.  When we arrived dinner was not yet being served, so we crossed
the road to the Parador where it was.  There, against the back wall, quail were
turning on the spit in a slate fireplace; in the center of the room, steaks were
grilling over a propane fire in an iron cauldron.  We had to have the quail
because it was there in front of us.  We  had to have cannelloni to see if
Andorrans could do Italian, paella to see if they could do Spanish, troute a la
Andorrana to see what they&#146;d learned from the French and hare because it 
was on the menu.  A bottle of &#147;Marques de Caceres,&#148; the local version
of a Spanish Rioja, made  us happy to be overeating in this rustic Andorran inn.
 
<BR></P>
<P>We slept well.  Before going down to breakfast we stood on our balcony
blinking at the brilliant sun on snow-white slopes. What a scene to wake up to! 
In the Hotel Garden&#146;s breakfast room jig- saw puzzles, chess sets and
French paperback novels waited for those with more time here than we had.  We
had to be out of Andorra La Vella before lunch and in Barcelona before dinner,
and  still had the last of the sightseeing and the first of the shopping ahead
of us.  
<BR></P>
<P>Twenty-five years ago Meritxell, the sanctuary of the Blessed Virgin,
patroness of the Principality, caught fire and was razed to the ground except
for a few stone arches.  The sanctuary&#146;s replacement designed by
contemporary Spanish architect Richard Bonfill, has the feel of Le  Corbusier;
curves and angles merge with old arches into the hillside   On the same road as
the Sanctuary, ultimate symbol of Andorra&#146;s piety, sits the Magatzens
Pyrenees, ultimate symbol of Andorra&#146;s commerce. Known also as the Casa
Perez, for the family that founded the business in the thirties, the present
four-story block-long structure was built in the sixties.  Shops with discounted
prices may line Andorra La Vella&#146;s main streets; but for convenience,
variety and price the Casa Perez is the Galleries Lafayette, Marks &amp; 
Spencer, and Macy&#146;s all in one.  	<BR>&#147;How are these prices possible?&#146;
we asked Felix Giralt, head of publicity for the company.  	<BR>&#147;Simple,&#148;
said Giralt. &#147;We don&#146;t tax luxury items.&#148; Jewelry, furs,
perfumes, objects d&#146;art, and designer clothes are among those items.  
<BR></P>
<P>The bargains start in the subway (basement) with cameras and photographic
equipment, the best of the name brands; the same for radios, hi-fis, tapes and
discs.  From the subway it&#146;s an easy escalator glide to the main floor and
men&#146;s clothes&#151;Burberry and Cardin, among other top-name designers. 
Rolex watches and Paloma perfumes are prominently displayed.  Gold and precious
stones for men and women wink from velvet boxes.  Sporting and camping equipment
are also on the main floor, as well as designer clothes for women and children. 
Food, the newest department, is on the second floor.  I can&#146;t remember when
I&#146;ve seen such a display of caviar and foie gras&#151;not even in Fortnum &amp;
Mason&#146;s or Fauchon&#146;s.  The top floor is  given over to services:
travel agencies, beauty shops and art galleries. 
<BR></P>
<P>Most items are discounted thirty percent, but by far the biggest bargain is
cigarettes&#151;fifty  percent off.  Giralt explained that by arrangement with
American tobacco companies, Andorra is licensed to make name-brand cigarettes
using half American tobacco and half Andoran.  If either Jerry or I still
smoked, we could have coughed our way through the rest of the trip for
practically nothing.  As for a fur coat, in southern California who needs one? 
I&#146;m allergic to perfume; Jerry&#146;s loyal to his old Pentax.  Several art
books were tempting, but we were on our way to Barcelona where Las Ramblas,
Barcelona&#146;s great shopping/strolling street, is said to be the place for
bargains in art books.  That didn&#146;t prove to be the case; but we had no
regrets.  If we didn&#146;t take advantage of the discounts at one of the
longest shopping malls in the world, at least we&#146;d been there.  &#164;

<P><B>Egon Ronay&#146;s &#147;Inner Circle&#148; to be Watchdog for the Caviar
Traveler; A Tale of Two Concordes 
</B><BR></P>
<P>&#147;British Airways&#146; Concorde service is far superior to that of Air
France,&#148; said Egon Ronay, the famous hotel and restaurant critic, at the
launch of his campaign to raise standards of service to high-spending
international travelers.  Ronay flew Air France from Paris to New York, then on
to London with BA.  The flights were fully paid to ensure objectivity.  &#147;The
BA Concorde oozed luxury, refinement, and a genuine concern for passenger&#146;
well-being,&#148; he concluded.  &#147;The French Concorde should droop its nose
in shame.&#148;<BR></P>
<P>&#147;Where,&#148; asked Ronay, &#147;have all the truffles, caviar, foie
gras gone?  Have the French lost all their taste for luxury?&#148;  He called
Air France&#146;s onboard meal &#147;exceptionally forgettable&#148; and the
Concorde lounge at Charles de Gaulle airport a &#147;disappointing mediocrity.&#148;
<BR></P>
<P>&#147;The service, which was reasonably efficient, lacked the real caring
one should have felt, or sincere friendliness or natural kindliness.  Even its
Concorde lounge was almost tawdry.  The head of cabin staff should be relegated
to the ranks, and the chef relegated to the kitchen sink.&#148;  In contrast, BA&#146;s
lounge at New York&#146;s Kennedy Airport was &#147;palatially spacious,
supremely comfortable, decorated with relaxed taste.  The lounge staff could not
have been bettered.  The flight attendants also seemed truly pleased to see the
passengers, and the amount of attention was almost embarrassing.  The main
course was the best dish I have had on an airline, whereas I have rarely had a
blander tasting dish than the one provided by the French Concorde.&#148; 
<BR></P>
<P>Ronay&#146;s comments came at the recent launch of Egon Ronay Alert, the
Internet-based voice of the Egon Ronay Inner Circle, a new action group that
seeks to force higher standards of service for high-paying international
travelers.  &#147;I am declaring war on poor services,&#148; said Ronay.  &#147;Egon
Ronay Alert will reveal the good and expose the bad.  There is now no hiding
place for those providing sub-standard services, whether they are leading
airlines, 5-star hotels, or multi-starred restaurants with absent chefs.&#148; 
<BR></P>
<P>&#147;Our sophisticated electronic systems ensure that within hours of
getting feedback from Inner Circle members, service providers can be downgraded
or upgraded on our barometers of satisfaction, and that information immediately
broadcast globally.&#148;  Confidential sources within the travel industry and
snap visits by Egon Ronay &#147;inspectors&#148; will complement the feedback. 
Ronay&#146;s move is an imaginative attempt to employ electronic media as a tool
of consumer pressure.  The strength of the name leading the campaign should
produce real results.  Yet the project is confined to the top-end of the market.
 Travelers on more run-of-the-mill budgets have an even greater need for a
similar high-profile initiative.  Over to you...   &#164;</P>
<HR>
<P><I>You can read the full text of Mr. Ronay&#146;s report, &quot;Tale of Two
Concordes&quot;, on the <B>Egon Ronay Alert</B> website at
<A HREF="http://www.egon-ronay.infocomint.com/">http://www.egon-ronay.infocomint.com</A>.
 The site requires visitors to fill out a brief registration form, then allows
free access for 60 days.  After the trial period, an &#147;Inner Circle&#148;
annual membership of $250 is required, which includes two members-only dinners
with Mr. Ronay at luxurious dining establishments (scheduled in January 1997 at
the Dorchester in London, and the Pierre Hotel in New York).    The subscription
fee is not inexpensive, but neither is the class of travel to which Mr. Ronay's
expertise is applied.  If you&#146;re the sort of traveler who needs to know the
latest engagements of Europe&#146;s top chefs, or what&#146;s been done lately
to the lobby of the Savoy, these reports might be just your cup of tea.       &#151;Ed.

<H2>Submission Guidelines</H2>
<HR>
<P>
<B>European Visits</B> seeks article submissions from both experienced travel
writers and ordinary travelers (not to mention extraordinary travelers!). 
Articles accepted as features are paid at a minimum of $.05 per word, with
several accepted per month.  We're  also happy to consider amateur contributions
in any category; these are not paid but  the author receives a byline, a free
print-edition subscription, and one of our <B>&quot;I'd rather be in Europe...&quot;</B>
T-shirts, aprons, jumbo mugs, or mouse pads.</P>
<P><I>Professional writers:</I> <B>PLEASE SPECIFY</B> with submission if you
are submitting for paid consideration only. We recognize that .05/word is not a
great rate and hope to do better in the future as the publication gets on its
feet; in the meantime, if you're an experienced pro feel free to include your
credits, name your price, and we'll do what we can.</P>
<P><B>Subject matter:</B> Our publication is about <I>visiting Europe</I>. 
We'll include material on Israel &amp; other Middle Eastern countries, and also
Iceland, as many travelers combine visits to these places with  stopovers in
Europe.  Turkey, Eastern Europe and Russia are within our range. We can't use 
material on Caribbean, Hawaii, South America, Africa, Asia, India, Australia, or
 North America.  (They're all fascinating places and someone should start online
magazines  about visiting them -- or someone already has.  But we didn't.)  We
are also interested  in good, short pieces about the processes &amp; pitfalls of
travel in general, primarily for  the <I>Travel Tips</I> category, and will use
an occasional piece on nifty or unusual travel gear  in the <I>Reviews</I>
category.</P>
<HR>
<P><B>Categories</B></P>
<P><I>General:</I> Articles of general interest on the subject of European
travel.  Length 500-2500 words.  One or two images are a plus but maps &amp;
sketches are preferred to photos. Previously published work okay provided you
can convey relevant reprint rights.  Review: Share your personal experience with
a hotel, restaurant, nightclub, museum, activity, train route, guided tour, or
whatever, that made a particular impression on you. Length 200-1000 words.
Include the basic what-where-who-how much, and indicate when your own experience
took place.  Negative reviews may occasionally be used though we prefer to focus
on what's good out there.  Multiple short reviews with or without a common theme
can be sent as one submission.  </P>
<P>Note: Reviews is the largest article category in European Visits and  the
easiest for amateur contributors to get into.   Hints for first-timers: Keep it
simple, be  concise, tell what you know.  Be scrupulously honest with your
fellow travelers. 
</P>
<P><I>Travel Tips:</I> Any pearls of wisdom on the overall topic of planning,
enjoying &amp; surviving European travel.  Length: 50-500 words.  EV is largely
intended for veteran travelers, but basic advice can be useful if it's
well-written and has some original angles.</P>
<P><I>Special Interest:</I> Articles focused on European travel as it relates
to specific interests, hobbies, vocations, or lifestyles.  Examples could
include academic or study trips,  cooking-school vacations, language immersion,
gay &amp; lesbian interests, religious pilgrimage, antique hunting, etc. (A very
wide etc!)  Length: 500-1500 words.   
</P>
<P><I>Current Events:</I> Articles offering timely information on what's going
on in European culture or politics.  Length: 150-500 words. Preference given to
articles submitted by European residents.  Also, see Europe Writes...(below). 
</P>
<P><I>Europe Writes:</I> Limited exclusively to articles submitted by native
or expatriate European   residents.  Length: 150-750 words.  Any topic relating
to your local area or country, but keep in mind that you're writing for
visitors.  Articles submitted in your native language with accompanying English
translation are of particular interest (total length of both should fall within
guidelines). 
</P>
<P><I>Destinations:</I> Articles about specific cities, regions, or countries.
 Length: 500-2500 words.   Quality prose is always appreciated, but be
informative as well as poetic.  Write for people who will actually go there and
tell them what they need to know.  (What do you wish  you'd known before you
went?)  Out-of-the-way spots &amp; Eastern European locales are particularly
desired, but don't hesitate to offer more common destinations if you can do them
well. 
</P>
<P><I>Itineraries:</I>  This special category is specifically for itineraries
created with  Personal Programs' EuroData&#174; travel-planning software for
Microsoft Windows (The software  is available for free download from our Web
site at http://www.eurodata.com), or from CompuServe's Travel Forum Library
(Europe Section).   Itinerary submissions should include both a text description
-- tell us why it's a <I>fabulous</I> itinerary -- as well as the EuroData
<TT>.itn</TT> file itself.  Published itineraries, past and present, will be
made available for other EuroData users to download for their own adaptation. 
Text length: 50-150 words.  (Most descriptive text should go in the itinerary's
Daily Notes or Itinerary Notebook sections - be sure to send any <TT>.nt</TT>
files that go along  with the itinerary.)  Maximum itinerary length: 21 days. 
</P>
<P><I>Jokes, cartoons, poetry, fiction:</I> We'd like a sprinkling of these
now &amp; then.  Be careful  with jokes:  if you read it in print or on-line,
it's likely to be copyrighted.  Cartoons should be line art only (2-color depth)
and not over 3k (also see Image Guidelines).  Poetry and fiction can be up to
5,000 words but we only publish &quot;liner notes&quot; (50-100 words) which you
must provide; the actual content is made available to interested readers via an
FTP download.

<H2><FONT COLOR="#FF0080">Tunnels: The Great Escape?</FONT><BR></H2>
<P>Constant traffic congestion and poor public transport hinder many visitors'
enjoyment of the huge variety of attractions offered by London. Whoever is tired
of London is tired of life, observed Dr. Samuel Johnson two centuries ago. But
the difficulties of moving around mean that many are now simply tired of the
capital.<BR></P>
<P>Today, at peak times, the famous black taxis and red double-decker buses
travel no faster than a horse and cart. The 2-km trip from Trafalgar Square to
St Paul's Cathedral can take 45 minutes by cab. In the 1980s it was believed
that congestion would be relieved by a huge new ringroad which now encircles
London. But the British  experience has been that building more roads simply
encourages more traffic. The tube is the world's longest underground rail
network, but is plagued by endless breakdowns. The above-ground rail network is
also appalling. Poor transport infrastructure is a major problem that will have
to be overcome if Greenwich is to successfully host the Millennium celebrations
in the year 2000.<BR></P>
<P>An ambitious plan to reroute traffic underground through a series of deep
tunnels presents at least a glimmer of hope. The scheme, which has been granted
government funding for a feasibility study, was dreamt up by Gabriel Khoury, a
research fellow at Imperial College. A series of double-decker tunnels would be
built from the edge of London into the centre, where the traffic would arrive at
massive new underground car parks. The tunnels would bypass the inner suburbs
and would allow rapid, free-flowing access into the centre of London, which at
present is impossible to achieve. As well as reducing journey times, the tunnels
could improve central London's environment, which at present is disfigured by
the swathes of traffic. Dr. Khoury cites similar plans in Boston, where the aim
is to put 18% of traffic underground, and claims that his strategy for London
could be implemented within the early years of the next decade.<BR></P>
<P>A crucial feature of the propose routes, to be called London Expressways, is
that they would be tolled, probably at a rate of between 40p and 70p per mile.
Britain has yet to break away from its habit of treating roads as a free good.
Massive overuse of roads is the consequence, with the consumer not having to
bear any of the enormous costs that result from blocked highways. Road access,
particularly on a small, crowded island, is a scarce commodity and should be
priced accordingly. Dr. Khoury's tunnels may or may not prove to be a viable
solution in engineering terms. But any transport strategy that allows free road
access into central London to persist will be doing a disservice to the millions
who visit the capital each year.<BR></P>
<H2><FONT COLOR="#FF0080">Air travel: State Aid Junkies</FONT><BR></H2>
<P>Travelers stand to gain from greater competition in the industries that
service them. That applies in air transport as much as in other sectors. But
European Commission policies on state aid often seem designed to hinder rather
than help the development of more competitive services. Financial assistance
from governments for poor quality airlines can have a huge impact in an industry
where margins are thin. The badly managed and uncompetitive are rewarded, and
innovative new entrants are firmly discouraged. <BR></P>
<P>Neil Kinnock, the European Union (EU) transport commissioner, talks tough on
state aid. He says it must be justified by the &quot;market investor&quot;
principle -- financial help can only be approved if a private investor would
reasonably make the same cash injection in expectation of a future profit. Aid,
he argues, should be given on a &quot;first time, only time&quot; basis.  
However, Iberia, the Spanish flag carrier, is a prime example of how EU member
states have been allowed to get away with propping up ailing national airlines
with generous dollops of state aid. A Pta120bn handout for Iberia was approved
in 1992, on condition that there was no further application for help before the
end of 1996. But Iberia was back for more in late 1994, with a request for
clearance of aid worth Pta130bn. After a hugely bureaucratic round of
consultations, approval for part of the aid, worth Pta87bn, was given at the
start of this year. Yet another helping, worth Pta20bn, is to be considered
early next year. Iberia continues to suffer from heavy losses and high service
costs. So much for the market investor principle. The Iberia case has
established a precedent that other state airlines will grasp at as soon as they
run into trouble. TAP and Sabena, respectively the Portuguese and Belgian
national airlines, have also benefited from generous Commission decisions.<BR></P>
<P>National airlines across the EU have been coming under increasing pressure
from low-cost startups. Competition will intensify in April next year with
deregulation of the air industry in Europe. Airlines in EU countries will be
free to undertake domestic flights in other member states, and all players will
be keen to present themselves as eligible alliance partners. But the political
forces which defend the special interests of national carriers may mean that
traveling customers do not reap the full benefits.<BR></P>
<H2><FONT COLOR="#FF0080">Air travel: cut out the middle man</FONT> <BR></H2>
<P>Stelios Haji-Ioannou is not yet 30 but his US-style cut-price airline
easyJet is making inroads into the European air travel market. His bright orange
aircraft have the company telephone number emblazoned in huge digits on the
fuselage. Haji-Ioannou proposes to cut the travel agent out of the equation and
sell you flight tickets for as little as &#163;29 ($45). <BR></P>
<P>Competing entirely on price unfortunately tends to recall the days of
Freddie Laker. But Haji-Ioannou is confident he has a winning formula. EasyJet
started flying between Luton, in southern England, and Scotland, and has now
grown to take in Amsterdam, Nice and Barcelona. 250,000 seats have already been
sold.  Cutting out the travel agent is an essential part of the easyJet recipe. 
&quot;The whole concept of the travel agent is absurd,&quot; says Haji-Ioannou. 
&quot;They appear to be agents of the traveler but are actually agents of the
airlines.&quot;  He argues that traditional ticketing systems add a whole
unnecessary layer of cost and proudly claims never to have paid travel agents a
penny. Direct advertising and telephone sales take their place. Passengers pay
by credit card over the telephone and are sent a receipt with a confirmation
number. They simply present this number along with their identification when
they arrive at the airport. The entire administrative staff of easyJet amounts
to 12; Haji-Ioannou is passionate about abolishing paper and insists that every
document to arrive at the offices is scanned into the computer system before
being thrown away.<BR></P>
<P>Using Luton rather than London is another reason why such low fares are
possible. EasyJet reckons this saves about $15 per passenger. Prices depend on
how far ahead you book as well as how popular the time at which you wish to
travel. A &#163;29 flight to Scotland could turn into &#163;59 if you leave it
too late and want to go on a busy Friday flight. <BR></P>
<P>All too good to be true? The sky is not entirely clear for Haji-Ioannou.
Together with his father he owns the Troodos Maritime shipping line. In 1991,
one of its tankers, the<I> Haven,</I> blew up in Genoa, killing five and
causing a major environmental disaster. Haji-Ioannou and his father still stand
accused of manslaughter. An obsession with safety at easyJet may be one
beneficial by-product of the disaster:  &quot;If you think safety is expensive,
try an accident.&quot;   &#164;<BR></P>

<H2>Floating Currency</H2>
<P><EM><FONT COLOR="#FF0080">From Travel Weekly &quot;Insider&quot;</FONT></EM><BR></P>
<P>Anyone who ever has stood in an overseas bank line, squinting at the red
electronic listing of exchange rates, has yearned for a single currency
standard.  Now the world finally has a new option for a key currency:  the
disposable underwater camera.  A firm selling satellite communications systems
for cruise ships sent a cover letter to <I>Insider</I> saying &quot;at an
affordable $9.50 per minute, a one-minute call costs less than a disposable
underwater camera.&quot;  Statements like that are the main reason <I>Insider</I>
owns a calculator.<BR></P>
<P>By <I>Insider</I>'s calculation, that means a typical ship-to-shore call
costs the equivalent of 4.73 disposable underwater cameras, or &quot;ducs&quot;
(in homage to the European Union's proposed &quot;ecu&quot;).  Therefore, a
seven-day eastern Caribbean cruise aboard Royal Caribbean's Sovereign of the
Seas starts at 73.57 ducs, per person, double occupancy, excluding air.  The
agent commission on that booking, of course, would be 7.3 ducs.  And Royal
Caribbean's six-ship construction program will eventually cost the cruise
company 157,894,736.84 disposable underwater cameras.<BR></P>
<P>That's payable by check, because they just don't make camera bags that big.

<P><!--Historic Flanders by Nick Gregory--><BR></P>
<P>Art nouveau facades face Renaissance facades, across cobbled streets lined
with street cafes serving dark Trappist and sweet beers.  Flowers line the canal
and cascade in colorful window boxes.  Here is found the legacy of the grand
centres of Northern European merchant trade. 
<BR></P>
<P>Lying between Brussels, Amsterdam, Paris and London, the historic towns of
Flanders ring a bell for both the past splendors of merchant trade, and a
strong, stubborn character, which carries with it joviality and a relaxed
atmosphere.  Beer and waffles, canals and castles are all here to be enjoyed,
through narrow cobbled streets and in majestic cathedral squares.  The scene is
marked by a diverse wide range of influences:  Spanish, British, French, Dutch.

<BR></P>
<P>Bruges&#151;&#147;Bruges the Beautiful&#148; as it is often described&#151;is
one of the loveliest towns in Europe.  Having reached the peak of prosperity
under the rule of the House of Burgundy in the 14th and 15th centuries, it
became a centre of artistic excellence, attracting such painters as Van Eyck,
Memling and Van der Groes.  An exceptionally important collection of works can
be viewed at the Groeninge Museum (Municipal Museum of Fine Arts) and at the
Memling Museum.  The best way to see the city and its fine treasures is to take
one of the canal tours, which run from March through October, and on weekends
during December and holiday periods.  They depart from several locations,
leaving for a round trip every 35 minutes.  The canals themselves (known as
Reien) take you through some of the loveliest  parts of the city, which was once
an important maritime port.  Its transcontinental connections were dependent on
its canal network, and linked to the open sea by the Zwin.  The rather
wonderfully named &#147;Lake of Love&#148; or Minnewater was the original
interior port.  
<BR></P>
<P>Just a few minutes walk from the Minnewater is the Princely Beguinage of the
Vine.  Founded in 1245, the tiny white-washed houses are arranged around a
grassy square, and although the Beguines have moved elsewhere there are still
Benedictine nuns living here.  A sense of calm and tranquillity pervades in the
whispered silence. 
<BR></P>
<P>The Burg Square, which contains the ornate Town hall, Old Registry, Palace
of Justice and the Basilica of the Holy Blood (dating back as far as the 12th
century), is most impressive with turreted and steepled roofs and intricate
masonry work forming statues and bas-reliefs on the facade of the 14th century
town hall, depicting biblical and historical scenes.  Inside the Old Registry is
the main tourist information office for the city.  In summer months, the square
also acts as the starting point for horse-drawn carriage tours. 
<BR></P>
<P>Near Burg Square is the Market Square, dominated by the Belfry at its
southern end.  Here is perhaps the place to enjoy one of the city&#146;s fine
beers, a Brugse Tripel or a heavy dark Straffe Hendrik.  But beware&#151;it is a
potent brew if drunk in the afternoon. 
<BR></P>
<P>For those foot weary from slogging around the sights of Europe on a
whistle-stop tour, try hiring a bicycle from the railway station, a bike shop,
or even some of the hotels. There are ubiquitous cycle-lanes away from the
traffic, and priority is more often than not given to cyclists at junctions. 
The terrain is flat and a few minutes of pedaling can soon have you out into the
polderlands, perhaps following a tree-lined canal to the lovely small town of
Damme, only 8km away.  Keep a look out for the picturesque windmills&#151;and
don&#146;t overdo it on the Damme Pralines (chocolate truffles) or Damme Mokke
(blue cheese).  Alternatively, take the paddle-steamer that shuttles to Bruges
and back between April and September. 
<BR></P>
<P>About 50km southeast of Bruges is its twin and for centuries its chief
rival, Gent (also spelled Ghent or Gand).  The ancient capital of the County of
Flanders, the city has a unique atmosphere quite different from the romantic
charms of Bruges.  Artistic refinement and an ancient vitality are strongly
evident.  The church of St Niklaas, which reflects the evolution of the Scheldt
Gothic style through the 13th, 14th and early 15th centuries, is situated
between the bridge of St Michiel, which itself offers superb views of the major
sights in the central area, and the Belfry, which contained the bell (the &#147;Klokke
Roeland&#148;) used to call the citizens of the city to arms.  A small park
below the tower contains its successor, &#147;De Triomfante&#148; cast in 1660. 
<BR></P>
<P>Beyond the Belfry is St Baafs Cathedral, the scene of the baptism of Emperor
Charles in 1500 and the home of the &#147;Adoration of the Mystic Lamb&#148; by
the brothers Van Eyck.  Painted in 1426-32, it portrays the redemption of
humanity and on the reverse are the portraits of the sponsors.  Also on view in
the cathedral is the &#147;Conversion of St Bavo&#148; by Rubens. 
<BR></P>
<P>Some remarkable buildings are to be found along the Graslei and Korenlei,
near the Bridge of St Michiel which were the old trading quays.  These merchant
houses and Guildhalls date from the 12th to 17th centuries in an assortment of
styles, including Romanesque, Gothic, and Renaissance.  Their reflections in the
still waters of the canal make a beautiful sight.  In addition to the
traditional boat tours of the city, those seeking more adventure can hire a
mini-yacht to glide over the canals and the winding river Leie.  Each boat can
take four and booking is compulsory, although experience is not required. 
<BR></P>
<P>Just off the canal system in the city but surrounded by its own moat is the
Castle of the Counts or &#147;Gravensteen&#148; which was built for Philip of
Alsace in the 12th century.  In the style of the Crusader castles in Syria, it
contains a small museum with what are referred to as &#147;instruments of legal
procedure&#148;.  It&#146;s a torture chamber!  A bit more fun is the Gent
Festival, held in mid-July for ten days around the St Jacobs area.  It involves
street theatre, music and dance among other things and tends to turn the place
upside down. 
<BR></P>
<P>In the middle ages, together with Bruges and Gent, Ypres (Leper) was one of
the wealthiest cities in Flanders. However, a series of wars and sieges after
the 13th century led to its gradual decline until the First World War, when as
part of the western salient during the entire 4-year period it was completely
destroyed.  Since that time, the original buildings have been painstakingly
restored to their original plans and the rich heritage of the town and its
tenacious people can be enjoyed again. 
<BR></P>
<P>The entire region of Westhoek is still marked by that conflict.  With
countless cemeteries filled by row upon row of identical white crosses, it is
clear just how many lives were lost.  Every evening, at the Menen Gate, the Last
Post is played by a bugler in commemoration.  About 12 km west of Ypres is the
town of Poperinge, the hops capital of the Belgium, where this vital ingredient
for beer is referred to as &#147;green gold&#148; and is celebrated bi annually
in either the Hops Festival or the National Beer Weekend, which occurs in the
third weekend of September&#151;the only difference being that there is no &#147;Hops
Parade&#148; during odd years.  If you arrive at any other time, there are a
large number of specialty beers available in the local taverns, including the
Watou Witbier (white beer). 
<BR></P>
<P>Traveling north towards the coast some 30km is Veurne (Furnes).  It is often
known as &#147;Spanish Veurne,&#148; because it was under the control of the
Archdukes Alberto and Isabela of Navarre when it reached its peak of prosperity
in the 17th century.  The historical GroteMarkt is surrounded by step-gabled
houses in the Flemish Renaissance style and in the yellow-brick, so typical of
this Westhoek region as well as the blue-stone facade of the town hall.  The
numerous cafes in the square are excellent for trying the Babelutten caramels or
a Slapers bier (sleepers beer). 
<BR></P>
<P>In all, Flanders holds a wealth of variety and history.  &#164;</P>

per hour from Brussels.    There is a bus service from the station to the centre
of the city.  Also large car parks around centre, but do not drive into central
area as chaos will ensue.  Boat excursions on the canals run from March to
October and in December and holidays. Cost is 150 BEF per person.  You can also
become what the tourist office refers to as a &#147;privileged visitor&#148; by
hiring a bicycle; available from the station or one of several hire shops (and
some hotels) for around 275BEF, or 150BEF with a valid rail ticket.  Horse and
buggy rides through the centre are available March to October for 800BEF per

057/33.40.81) after which you may need to involve yourself in the Hops festival
or Beer Weekend on the third weekend of September which is more of a pageant and
connoisseurs event than a binge. In 1997 the Beer weekend will be held and 98
will see the festival. 
<BR></P>
<P><B>Veurne (Furnes)</B>: Situated on the Gent-de Panne route with trains

</P>
<P><IMG
SRC="http://www.eurodata.com/rail6.gif" ALT="(Access by rail)" ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Szekesfehervar</B>
is one of Hungary&#146;s historic towns.  Istvan I founded the royal basilica
here in 1016, and for hundreds of years the kings of Hungary were crowned here. 
Nowadays, though, much of its glory has faded.  The basilica is ruined, and
though you can visit some interesting ruins of it, with a few delicate carvings,
and some odds and ends of stonework, the medieval feeling has gone.  In fact the
only medieval part left is the Gothic Chapel of St Anne.  However, there are
still some pretty houses, and one site definitely worth a visit is the &#145;Black
Eagle&#146; pharmacy museum.  I must admit that pharmacy museums tend to be all
the same&#151;there&#146;s one in Aix, I think I&#146;ve seen one in Krakow&#151;but
if you haven&#146;t seen one, the array of glass jars, earhtenware sarcophagi,
and venerable old counters is a real fairytale.<BR></P>
<P><B>Holloko</B> is a UNESCO world heritage site, and unfortunately places
like this can sometimes feel rather too well preserved. But the site, under a
castle ruin, is characteristic, and the array of beautiful old houses is worth
seeing.  It&#146;s disappointing, though, to note that most of the old people
have decided to sell these pretty, but impractical houses, and move to new&#151;and
architecturally undistinguished&#151;houses elsewhere.  If you can spare the
time, the countryside around this area deserves your investigation. Hungary&#146;s
ranges of hills are not particularly high or scenic compared to Poland&#146;s or
Slovakia&#146;s Tatras, or the Romanian landscape of Transylvania, but they have
a delicate beauty all to themselves.<BR></P>
<P><IMG
SRC="http://www.eurodata.com/rail6.gif" ALT="(Access by rail)" ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Esztergom</B>
is the ecclesiastical capital of Hungary&#151;the home of Hungarian Catholicism.
 Its looks tally with its status; the 1850s classical basilica which dwarfs the
town is reputed to be one of the five biggest churches in the world.  Like many
classical buildings in Hungary it completely ignores landscape and townscape,
but its brooding presence gives Esztergom a special atmosphere.  Don&#146;t
forget to visit the crypt underneath, where the Archbishops rest in a circular &#145;Egyptian&#146;
mausoleum&#151;spectacular and spooky.  If subterranean gloom doesn&#146;t
appeal, you can go up to the dome for a panorama of the Hungarian mountain
ranges, such as they are. 
<BR></P>
<P>One small piece of past glory remains: the red marble Bakocz chapel, a
Renaissance marvel.  Apparently when the basilica was built, this chapel was
taken apart piece by piece, every item numbered, and eventually put back
together again just as it used to be.  Some parts of the Romanesque royal palace
also remain, though they appear to have been heavily restored in some places;
Esztergom, like other Hungarian towns, came in for some battering from the
Turks.  
<BR></P>
<P>If you like <I>Mozartkugeln</I>, <I>gemutlichkeit</I> and Salzburgisch
charm, go straight to Szechenyi ter and the rococo.  The handsome houses and
Town Hall are more fun than wandering around trying to find original Romanesque
fenestration plans&#151;at least they were for my companion, who doesn&#146;t
share my obsession with collecting every piece of Romanesque architecture east
of Vienna. 
<BR></P>
<P><IMG
SRC="http://www.eurodata.com/rail6.gif" ALT="(Access by rail)" ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Visegrad</B>
sits on the best part of the Danube bend, where it runs constrained by narrow
gorges between the Borzsony and Pilis hills.  It was the residence of kings from
the fourteenth century, but its greatest days were the days of Matthias Corvinus&#151;Matyas
&#145;the Crow&#146; (he had one on his coat of arms).  Matyas, Hungary&#146;s
Renaissance king,  led a court the equal of any in Europe in culture and
gracious living. 
<BR></P>
<P>The original fort was built in the mid-thirteenth century, with an immense
hexagonal tower at the centre of the foritfications.  From the fortress, there&#146;s
a view of the entire Danube bend laid out below.  Later, the Visegrad palace
became the focus of struggles between the various kings and claimants&#151;since
the Holy Crown of Hungary was kept here, and only one crowned with this crown
was the rightful king.  But it&#146;s Matyas&#146;s wonderful buildings and rich
cultural heritage that amaze the visitor today. 
<BR></P>
<P>Visegrad&#146;s most recent claim to fame is its hosting of the Visegrad
Accords of 1991, when Arpad Goncz of Hungary, Lech Walesa of Poland and Vaclav
Havel of the Czech Republic sat down to sign an agreement between their three
countries for a post-Communist future.  I certainly hope they enjoyed their
visit to this pleasant place.   
<BR></P>
<P><IMG
SRC="http://www.eurodata.com/rail6.gif" ALT="(Access by rail)" ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Szentendre</B>
was a refuge for the Serbs, fleeing from Turkish invasions in the seventeenth
century. Out of its seven churches, four are Serbian - at least if the
iconostases are anything to go by.  Greeks and Dalmatians also fled here, liking
the culturally tolerant town. Besides the churches - the Catholic parish church
and its Serbian counterpart are isolated on top of the hill, surrounded by a
cobbled market and a little wall - there are some nice baroque houses on the
fine main square (actually a triangle). But the town has become a real tourist
trap with too many tatty folk art shops.<BR></P>
<P><IMG

is a delightful baroque town. It had a bishop as early as the eleventh century,
but it now posseses a classical cathedral in among the other eighteeneth-century
buildings, and has a number of lovely churches. 
<BR></P>
<P><B>Pannonhalma</B>, for those with a spirit of adventure and a car&#151;or
access to one of the coach tours for pilgrims&#151;is a wonderful and very
strange place.  In the whole plain of Pannonia there seems to be only one hill
of any size, and the monastery of Pannonhalma is jammed down right on top of it.
 The monastery goes back to the twelfth century or before, and there&#146;s a
very fine doorway with wonderful carving and glowing red marble, but externally
it now looks very classical. A guided tour will show you round in about half an
hour, but you can easily spend more time here walking in the gardens beneath the
monastery or just looking at the amazing view from the balcony. 
<BR></P>
<P><B>Szambek</B>&#151;or <I>Schambeck</I> should you be a German-speaker&#151;is
an unspoilt little village about half an hour&#146;s drive from Budapest. 
Higgledy-piggledy houses, palisaded farmyards, and above it all a magnificent
ruined Romanesque abbey.  One of my favourite places round Budapest.  On the way
back, I had to stop as a deer and her fawn decided to cross the road in front of
me.  
<BR></P>
<P><I>Other side trips:</I><BR></P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Take a cruise</B> down, or preferably up, the Danube.  The most
interesting places (Esztergom, Visegrad, Szentendre) are all north of Budapest,
whereas the southern stretch is really for nuclear power station lovers. 
Cruises leave from near the Vigado concert house.  If you&#146;re in the mood,
it&#146;s possible to take the not-so-blue Danube all the way to Vienna.<BR></LI>
<LI><B>The Great Plains.</B>  Country-lovers will want to take a trip into the
Nagyalfold to the south of Budapest. It&#146;s an extensive plain, a region
proud of its horses and its horsemanship through the centuries. Rumour has it
that some of the horses here are even better trained, and perform even better
tricks, the the Spanish Riding School&#146;s Lippizaner stallions. The plain is
dotted with little houses, each with its own well - a bucket swung from a pole,
a characteristic construction. Ocsa, a pretty village with thatched houses, is
probably the first place to make for.  &#164;</LI></UL>

<P><!--Of Magic, Fans, and Piaf  Little-Known Museums In and Around Paris A
Book Review-->
<B>So you&#146;ve looked at the Louvre</B> and elevated at the Eiffel.  You&#146;ve
mastered the medieval at Cluny and reviewed the revolution at Carnavalet.  Are
you done with Paris?<BR></P>
<P>Not even close!  It&#146;s possible that no city in Europe, and perhaps in
the world, boasts more unique, eclectic, and obscure museums than does the City
of Lights.  From tools to dolls, place-settings to pottery, magic to money,
Paris offers a dizzying array of special-interest visits to tickle even the most
jaded fancy.  Now, writer <B>Rachel Kaplan</B> has put together an enjoyable
compendium to help you sort through the options.<BR></P>
<P><I><B>Little-Known Museums In and Around Paris</B></I><I> (Henry N.
Abrams, 208pp, $19.95)</I> combines excellent photographs and detailed,
well-written overviews to profile 30 of Paris&#146; most interesting,
off-the-beaten-track museums.  All but eight are within the arrondissments of
the city; the remainder are an easy day trip, and most are accessible by public
transportation.  The book includes detailed M&eacute;tro directions for each
site, with driving or rail information for those further afield, and also
provides information on opening hours and days of operation (important, as they
can be odd and/or few).  Which of them will go on your must-see list depends on
your interests &amp; tastes; among those we find especially intriguing:<BR></P>
<UL>
<LI><I><B>Le Mus&eacute;e de la Curiosit&eacute; et de la Magic (The Museum
of Curiosities and Magic)</B></I>&#151;Open just three days a week in a series
of caves below the Marais district, this museum offers a fascinating look at the
history of magic and optical illusions, from tricks used to dazzle temple
visitors in ancient Egypt to the conjuring routines of minstrels and fools in
Europe&#146;s royal courts.  There are a variety of stage props and &#147;tools
of the trade&#148; on display from many different eras, plus profiles of famous
practitioners&#151;including the &#147;father of modern magic,&#148; one R.
Houdin, a 19th century magician so respected that a talented American would
later honor him with the stage name Harry Houdini.  Museum tours are available
in English, and there is a continuous magic show from 2:30pm until 6:00pm..   
<BR><I>Le Mus&eacute;e de la Curiosit&eacute; et de la Magic, 11 rue Saint
Paul, 75004 Paris; Tel. (01) 42-72-13-26.

<LI><I><B>Le Mus&eacute;e de l&#146;Evantail (The Fan Museum)</B></I>&#151;Devoted
entirely to the &#147;quintessential accessory for the woman of fashion.&#148;
this small showroom features fans of every imaginable design, material, and
history.  The museum&#146;s own space was once the location of a tr&eacute;s
chic fan shop, and today curator Anne Hoguet&#151;herself a professional
fanmaker&#151; recreates both the elegance and the endless variety of this
nearly vanished art.  Open Tuesdays only, in the 10er.  <BR><I>Le Mus&eacute;e

drive some 50km out of Paris, to the curiously-named town of Wy
dit-Joli-Village, will reward you with this homage to the skilled artistry of
farmers, smiths, and craftworkers in devising the implements of their trades
through the ages.  The collected items&#151;more than 3,500 all told&#151;range
from the ancient to the timeless, with curator Claude Pigeared paying special
attention to handcrafts that have largely disappeared in modern times, such as
rope- and nail-making.  The museum is located in the rooms of an excavated Roman
bathhouse, itself a national historic site.  It&#146;s open Sunday afternoons
only, though arrangements can be made for small groups on other days.

</I><BR></LI></UL>
<P>These are just a taste&#151; <I>Little-Known Museums</I> offers
twenty-seven more, each a fascination in its own way.  A number of the museums
are devoted to particular artists &amp; performers (Edith Piaf, Erik Satie, and
Eug&egrave;ne Delacroix, among others) and will be of special interest to their
fans.  In each case Ms. Kaplan&#146;s coverage is both entertaining and thorough&#151;she
even explains the origin of that village name&#151;and you will only wish you
had time to visit each and every one of them.  But even if you must miss a few,
if you&#146;re going to Paris don&#146;t miss this book.  Highly
recommended.																<I>-MJT

<H1>Where the Swiss Go</H1>
<P><I>by Jerri Clark Kirby</I></P>
<HR>
<P><BR></P>
<P>Rapperswil is a charming medieval town situated on the shores of  Lake
Zurich.  Its history goes back to the 13th century, and it is about as perfect a
place to relax as you can imagine. 
</P>
<P>The first buildings were constructed of wood;  they were rebuilt with stone
later in the late 13th and early 14th centuries.  The stone foundations are
massively, though gracefully, in evidence as you stroll through the streets. The
Rapperswil Castle, as old as the town itself, underwent restorations in the late
80's.  It houses a permanent Polish exhibition in memory of the Polish National
Museum, which was established in the same castle from 1870 to 1927 by Polish
emigrants, under the control of Count Ladislaus Plater. 
</P>
<P>You can get a good feel for the history of Rapperswil by merely strolling
through the streets and looking at the many pictures commemorating historical
events, painted on the walls of various homes and buildings.  The castle is the
oldest landmark in this town; the old parish church is the second oldest. These
two buildings dominate the medieval section; fortifications were built around
both buildings until a little over 150 years ago.  Rapperswil belongs to the
Canton (province or tiny state) of Gall and has about 8,500 inhabitants. 
Nicknamed the &quot;town of roses,&quot; Rapperswil boasts around 8,500 rose
bushes -- one for each inhabitant --  in the public gardens near an old Capuchin
monastery.  Impressively, the townspeople have provided a special rose garden
for the blind and disabled, offering special &quot;touch and smell&quot; bushes.
 
</P>
<P>Up on a hill above the public gardens is an open deer park.  Wild deer are
protected here and tame enough, in some cases, to be fed by willing tourists. 
Down by the waterside is an aquarium, stocked with all the known types of fish
found in Lake Zurich.  You can take lake tours, rent rowboats and sailboats, as
well as inner tubes.  Miniature golf and hot air balloon rides are offered,
along with a myriad of lakeside sports activities.  A few small islands, a short
distance from the shore, beckon boat renters who enjoy picnic lunches with the
many birds living there. Several seaside restaurants specialize in lake trout.
The first one we tried had an &quot;all you can eat&quot; menu of local lake
fish for a very reasonable cost. 
</P>
<P>The Knie Children's Zoo is a big draw in the summertime. The zoo is run by
the Swiss National Circus and you might catch a few impromptu circus acts; a
regular dolphin show equals anything I have seen in the U.S. and there are pony
rides, elephant rides and horse-drawn trams.  The monkeys are lots of fun to
watch and there is a petting zoo, which includes llamas.  A huge whale is part
of the Noah's Ark play yard and this is the only zoo in the world I've seen
where you walk through a human silhouette-shaped opening, according to your
size, instead of a gate or door! 
</P>
<P>Friday has traditionally been Market Day since 1415.  Fresh produce, fish,
spices, herbs, bread, cheese -- anything you can imagine that can be sold fresh
-- are available in this morning market.  There is also a shopping mall and
specialty shops where we found the best deal we had ever seen on Swiss cuckoo
clocks, from very small to very extravagant.  Scarves from India, carvings from
Africa, jewelry from the Middle East; the array of international products was
rather amazing and prices extremely reasonable. 
</P>
<P>There are maybe 10 hotels in Rapperswil and a few family hostels. The Swiss
wisely book all major holidays a year in advance; in fact, we saw few foreigners
in Rapperswil. Most were Swiss families enjoying Swiss hospitality.  From
Zurich, there are many ways to get to Rapperswil. You can drive out the Seedamn
Causeway; you can hop a train in Zurich, (which is really the best way), or you
can take a boat.  In any event, do stop in for a leisurely few hours in
Rapperswil.  Tourist information is readily available and, as in all of
Switzerland, English is spoken everywhere.   Now I know where the Swiss go in
the summer and why they keep it to themselves!  &#164;

<H2>Shopping: Europe's Classic Good Luxe</H2>
<P><BR><I>by Diane Marshall</I></P>
<P><B>Nothing quickens a woman's heart</B> --and many a man's -- more than
great shopping.  And nowhere does it come any better than in Europe.  What makes
it special is the European flair for chic styling, masterful design and
attention to detail, all of which are apparent in everything from fashion and
fabrics to crystal and ceramics, from evening wear and eyeglasses to watches and
writing instruments.  Europe entices with thousands of charming boutiques, whose
exquisite window displays tease of the treasures within.  The selection will
astound you.  The personal service, unique merchandise and alluring ambiance of
boutiques scattered throughout diverse neighborhoods affords a distinctive
shopping experience.  There's nothing as grand as Paris's rue de
Faubourg-Saint-Honore district with its ultra chic couture houses or as
sophisticated as London's Saville Road area, home to the world's best tailors. 
And who could imagine a Rome without the Piazza di Spagna, the nucleus for
Italian fashion?  Come, follow us through the far-flung streets of Europe on the
world's best shopping spree. 
<BR></P>
<P><B>Paris</B>:  Both the Right Bank and Left Bank offer a dizzying profusion
of boutiques.  The former radiates luxury and sheer elegance.  Its ne plus
ultra-posh couture salons converge along the tony rue de Faubourg-Saint-Honore,
rue Saint-Honore, avenue Montaigne, Champs-Elysees, place de la Madeleine,
avenue George V and rue Francois 1er.  Even if you're not buying, a day spent
window shopping is a feast for the eyes.  For exclusive crystal, porcelain and
cutlery, shop either side of the Seine.  Big names reside on the rue de Paradis
(Left Bank) and rue Royale (Right Bank).  Likewise, art galleries and antique
shops dot the entire city, but three clusters deserve special attention:  the
Porte de Clignancourt flea market, the area south of the Seine and north of the
rue de l'Universite (Left Bank), and the district around the upper end of the
rue du Faubourg-Saint Honore (Right Bank). 
<BR></P>
<P>The Left Bank represents the pulse of Paris, a district of trends.  It's the
very heart of Parisian shopping.  The look is definitely hip, fashion-forward. 
The area's more avant-garde designers lure a young and savvy crowd that shops
for sophisticated costume jewelry, art books, exotic fragrances, fantasy
footwear and offbeat art.  The broad boulevard St. Germain, center of the
student quarter, bisects the Left Bank.  Though it has its share of trendy
boutiques, the bulk of the shopping is to either side of the boulevard, along
rue Jacob, rue de Seine, rue Bonaparte, rue des Saints-Peres, rue de
Furstenberg, rue de Beaune, rue Saint-Sulpice, rue du Bac and rue des Canettes. 
Fashion-smart women haunt Rue de Grenelle and rue des Saints-Peres (Left Bank)
for innovative shoes and equally forward clothing.  Their next stop might be Rue
d'Alesia, where prices are radically reduced in shops that sell last season's
designer stock and samples, or the rue de la Pompe, whose stores feature
second-hand designer and couture fashions, many worn only once or twice. 
<BR></P>
<P><B>Brussels</B>:  Any serious shopping in Europe's capital begins in the
elegant galleries, covered pedestrian arcades lined with shops, boutiques and
cafes exuding a glossy international theme.  The Galeries Royales de
Saint-Hubert,  the most magnificent of the city's age-old shopping complexes,
was built in 1846, making it the world's first shopping mall.  It exemplifies
Belgian shopping at its most elegant, and is worth a visit just to see its
beautiful design.  Equally refined are the Galerie Louise, Galerie de la Toison
d'Or and their neighboring streets-Avenue Louise, a chestnut-lined boulevard
where soigne ladies stalk the best couture salons, art galleries and interior
decor showrooms; and Avenue de la Toison d'Or, whose trendy cafes, clothing
boutiques and art galleries cater to a youthful, professional clientele.
<BR></P>
<P>The Rue Neuve, a bustling pedestrian district near the Grand Place, may have
less polish, but no fewer places to spend your Belgian francs.  Major chain
stores compete with ready-to-wear boutiques, international toy stores,
department stores and book and souvenir shops.  Search for bargains at the Old
Market (place du Jeu de Balle), the quintessential flea market.  Its highbrow
weekend cousin, at the Place du Grand-Sablon, has better quality antiques. 
Place du Grand-Sablon is the center of Brussels' thriving art and antique trade.

<BR></P>
<P><B>Shannon</B>:  When Shannon Airport launched the world's first duty-free
airport store in 1947, it started a revolution in shopping.  Today there are
many pretenders to the title of best duty-free airport shop, but almost 50 years
later, Shannon remains at the top of many a serious shopper's list. It's a
single complex crammed with more terrific buys.  Names that used to be the
privilege of the jet-set crowd-Dunhill, Rolex, Waterman, Lancome-are now de
rigueur stock at Shannon.  And prices here are as attractive as the selection,
with savings of 20 to 40 percent on Irish sweaters and linens, tweed jackets and
ties, the best Irish and European crystal and china,  woolens, christening
gowns, toys, perfumes and collectible figurines. 
<BR></P>
<P><B>Vienna</B>:  Satirist Karl Kraus remarked that &quot;the streets of
Vienna are surfaced with culture as the streets of other cities are with
asphalt.&quot;  We'd expect nothing less from this city of Habsburg aristocracy.
 The legacy of that era manifests itself today in the exquisite costume jewelry,
toys and tin soldiers, textiles, glass, porcelain and confectionery artfully
displayed in the windows of boutiques and cafes along the city's most
prestigious shopping streets:  Kohlmarkt, Graben Strasse and Kaerntner Strsse. 
In between some of the city's oldest stores, new designers cater to a young,
trendy market.  A number of fashion houses and souvenir shops specialize in
loden garments and other traditional Austrian folk costumes called Tracht.<BR></P>
<P>Mariahilfer Strasse boasts Vienna's two department stores, Herzmansky and
Gerngross, and a number of up market boutiques selling fashions, leather goods
and Austrian souvenirs.  Dorotheum, the 178-year-old auction house, may have
started as a pawn shop, but today it's as prestigious as Christie's and
Sotheby's.  Because it auctions merchandise that varies from bric-a-brac to
authentic Biedermeier, you often can take home a bargain.  Antique dealers and
galleries, many specializing in a single style or period, abound on neighboring
streets, between Spiegelgasse and Braeunerstrasse.  Head for Linke Wienzeile and
its side streets to buy less expensive antiques.  While browsing, admire the
architecture of the apartment buildings that at the turn of the century made
this a prestigious address.  Not far away is the Naschmarkt.  On Saturdays it
hosts a flea market at its southern end. 
<BR></P>
<P><B>Glasgow</B>:  Buchanan Street is a microcosm of Scotland's best.  Myriad
boutiques along the mostly pedestrian street supply shoppers with an exhaustive
selection of high-quality Scottish tartans, tweeds, leather goods, glassware and
ceramics, as well as international fashions, textiles and housewares.  Princes
Square, also on Buchanan Street, is Scotland's premier center of fashion and
design, with many international designers and specialists ranging from
hairdressers to interior design and the Scottish Craft Centre.  If you're short
on time but want the best, head for Frasers, the city's biggest department
store.  The store's luxe interior makes it worth a visit.  Gordon Street is a
veritable stockpile of British designerdom -- Liberty, Burberry, Laura Ashley
and Jaeger among others -- and an easy place to part with your pounds.
<BR></P>
<P>If you adore jewelry, direct yourself to the Argyll Arcade, which has more
jewelers under one roof than anyplace else in Scotland.  One end of the arcade
leads back to Buchanan Street; the other to the St. Enoch Shopping Centre.  Exit
through Debenham's department store onto yet another popular-and
crowded-pedestrian area, Argyle Street, which has a smattering of trendy
clothing and shoe stores and gift houses.  Less formal and expensive shopping
awaits on weekends at The Barras market, whose barrage of collectibles, genuine
antiques and junk will exhaust all but the most obsessive collector.<BR></P>
<P><B>Amsterdam</B>:  New York has Madison Avenue, Amsterdam has P.C.
Hoofstraat.  The fashion mavens of the world meet here, making it the city's
toniest-and priciest-thoroughfare.  Van Baerlestraat crosses P.C. Hoofstraat and
competes with it for smartly turned-out customers, especially the area between
Vossiusstraat and Jan Willem Brouwersstraat.  Kalverstraat has some of the
city's biggest bookstores and an eclectic mix of trendy shoe stores, fashions
and sporting goods.  Well-known ready-to-wear retailers cling together on
Leidsestraat, Heiligeweg and Spiegelgracht. 
<BR></P>
<P>There's a street market for almost everything, including exotic foodstuffs
and fabrics, antiques and carpets.  At the Bloemenmarkt flower vendors sell
their bulbs, plants and dried flowers from floating barges.  Oudemanhuis bustles
with buyers and sellers of books, new and old.  The city's largest open-air
street market, Albert Cuyp Markt, offers bargains on food, clothing, spices,
jewelry and even fresh fish and olives.  Zwarte Markt and Oosterse Markt,
translating to the Black Market and Eastern Market, respectively, boast a bounty
of bargains on new, old and Oriental merchandise.  Search carefully and bargain
hard for the real antiques at Waterlooplein Markt  and Rommelmarkt, two popular
flea markets.  Mondays are blue-and green, yellow, purple, and turquoise-at the
Lapjesmarkt, where you can choose from thousands of fabrics in assorted colors.

<BR></P>
<P><I><FONT COLOR="#FFFF80">(Ed's Note: for more on Amsterdam Shopping, see
<A HREF="http://www.eurodata.com/amster1.htm">Of Lorgnettes and Tassles</A> in
this issue.)</FONT></I><BR></P>
<P><B>Frankfurt</B>:  With a turnover of more than a billion Deutsche marks a
year, Frankfurt's Zeil is one of the busiest shopping streets in the world. 
Mostly large department stores queue along the pedestrian area between the
Konstablerwache and Hauptwache.  Pockets of more exclusive shopping are down the
side streets.  Goethestrasse, with its upscale fashion boutiques, has the
greatest cachet.  Schillerstrasse is a must for the best names in crystal and
china.  Steinweg has smart shoe shops.  Rossmarkt  is frequented for its 
accessories.  Jewelry is the hallmark of Kaiserstrasse. The trendiest boutiques
are located between the Hauptwache and Eschersheimer Gate.  Shop the
Hauptbahnhof center for mid-priced ready-to-wear, cosmetics, home furnishings
and accessories.  Furriers still keep shops along Duesseldorfer Strasse. 
Fressgasse (Eater's Alley) is all about food, glorious food: this popular street
located just off the Hauptwache is dotted with cafes, restaurants and
delicatessens purveying the grandest cheeses, best chocolates and most delicious
wines, to take home or eat on the spot. 
<BR></P>
<P><B>Madrid</B>:  Calle Ortega y Gasset and Calle Serrano, running through
the swish community of Salamanca, host a prestigious gathering of Spanish and
international fashion names.  Prices are high, but so is the quality.  Scattered
among the big names are boutiques showcasing some of Spain's less well-known,
but very talented designers.  Collectors haunt the Calle del Prado and adjacent
streets for period furniture, home furnishings and antique jewelry.  Search for
antique books at the Cuesta de Moyano, a permanent antique book fair.  Calle
Almirante, just off Paseo de Recoletos, showcases the work of Spain's more
avant-garde fashion designers.  The district surrounding Puerta del Sol hosts
department stores, El Corte Ingles and Galerias Preciados-ready-to-wear
retailers, and tourist shops.  Though the Gran Via isn't what it used to be, the
lower end still has many fashionable names and several high-quality crafts
stores. 
<BR></P>
<P>New shopping arcades filled with designer boutiques catering to well-heeled
shoppers have sprung up throughout the city.  Among the best are the elegant
Galeria del Prado, Moda Shopping, the ultramodern La Vaguada and numerous
Multicentros de Madrid center, each catering to a different clientele.  The
Serrano Multicentros has chic designer boutiques, the Princesa location attracts
the younger generation.  The Sunday flea market, El Rastro (Calle de Ribera de
Curtidores), is invariably crowded.  Bargains are to be had, but only by the
wary shopper willing to dicker. 
<BR></P>
<P><B>London</B>:  With its chic shops and funky flea markets where treasures
abound, London has an infinite capacity to surprise.  The best shopping areas
for high fashion and hip, sporty boutiques include Sloane Street and Square,
Beauchamp Place, South Molton Street, Regent and Oxford streets.  The most
sought after bespoke tailors and shoemakers reside along Saville Row, Jermyn
Street and St. James's Street.  Many of the most respected jewelers are based on
Bond Street.  Piccadilly and Knightsbridge are the domain of the best department
stores. 
<BR></P>
<P>You're sure to find indispensable gifts to take home in the museums around
Trafalgar Square and Cromwell Road.  The National Gallery's Sainsbury wing
(Trafalgar Square) has a state-of-the-art emporium with books embracing every
period of art history, poster-sized reproductions of the museum's collection,
post cards, puzzles and address books.  St. Martin-in-the-Fields (Trafalgar
Square) features unusual replicas of medieval carvings, brass rubbings of
reliefs dating back to the 11th century, reproductions of Celtic crosses, and
books on religion, art and music.  The gift shop in the Victoria &amp; Albert
Museum sells reproductions of its extraordinary collection of applied art and
design.  Look for jewelry, coasters and trays based on designs by William
Morris, silk ties with M.C. Escher's graphics, silver-plated pillboxes made from
original 19th-century molds, and cloisonn&eacute; pens.
<BR></P>
<P>The noisy, bustling boutique at the Natural History Museum (Cromwell Road)
focuses on children.  Stuffed lions and tigers and bears range from a few inches
to three feet long.  Prehistoric animals get star billing on posters, puzzles,
post cards and books.  Fossils and gemstones are sure to delight a budding young
archaeologist.  London has markets for antiques, books and prints, crafts,
second-hand goods, food, flowers and even a few that are open only during lunch.
 If your time is limited, put Portobello Market at the top of your list.  It's
really three markets in one:  sections for antiques, fruits and vegetables, and
second-hand goods.  At Camden Markets, another lively group of markets, vendors
sell cheeses, fruits and vegetables, antiques, fashions and jewelry by young
designers, ceramics and knitwear, silver, well-traveled leather luggage,
household goods, old telephones and scores more. 
<BR></P>
<P><B>Rome</B>:  The city's most desirable shopping is in the old center, away
from the hustle and bustle of modern Rome. Here you'll find the celebrities of
Italian fashion, jewelry, shoes and gifts on streets fanning out from the Piazza
di Spagna:  Via Condotti, Via del Corso, Via Borgognona, Via Frattina and a few
others.  Of these, Via Condotti offers the most luxe stores, while your teens
will feel right at home shopping Via del Corso's less-expensive trend-setting
boutiques for fashions and accessories.  When it's a question of home
furnishings and interior decor with Italian design flair-the classics or
hi-tech-Romans head for Via del Babuino.  Unless, of course, it's antique
furniture they're looking for, then they favor the Via dei Coronari and Via
Margutta.  Bookstores, artisan workshops and art shops commingle along Via del
Pellegrino.  Collectors of antique books and prints prefer the Mercato delle
Stampe, where they can browse among the stacks of old maps and literary works
from past ages.
<BR></P>
<P>The Via Cola di Rienzo is dotted with dozens of gourmet shops selling fresh
pates, cheeses and choice dried meats, imported comestibles and Italian
specialties like olive oils, vinegars and condiments.  Simpler fare is sold in
the stalls of Rome's many food markets:  Campo de' Fiori, surrounded by
delicatessen and bread shops; Piazza delle Coppelle, small but colorful; Piazza
San Cosimato, specializing in cheeses and meats; and Mercato di Testaccio, where
butchers, fishmongers and grocers purvey their delicacies.  Rome's other markets
feature a little bit of everything-dried and fresh flowers, antiques,
handicrafts, Italian specialties, gifts and foods.  At Sunday's Porta Portese
Russian vendors sell caviar and ethnic gifts along Via Ippolito Nievo. 
<BR></P>
<P><B>Milan</B>:  Designer Laura Biagiotti, the Queen of Cashmere, and the
other great Italian-and Euro-Japanese-designers hold court here, in Milan,
concentrated on:  Duomo/Vittorio Emanuele II, Corso di Porta Ticinese, Via della
Spiga, Via Montenapoleone, Via Borgopesso  and Via Sant' Andrea.  These streets
bespeak loudly of their chic clientele through dazzling showroom window displays
that highlight a single collection or the season's best.  Well-known names and
up-and-coming designers spill over into regentrified Brera, friendly and
charming with cobblestone streets lined with less expensive shops, trendy
restaurants and cafes, art galleries, artisan workshops and up-to-the-minute
nightclubs.  Concentrate on the main streets, Via Brera and Via Solferino, then
venture onto side streets like Madonnina, Corso Garibaldi, Via Fiori and Via
Fiori Oscuri. Corso Vercelli and Corso Magenta preside over the high-bourgeois
residential refuge of Magenta.   Between stately homes there are smart
restaurants and boutiques-more frequented by impeccably clad residents than
tourists-dotting the wide, tree-lined streets.  Shops sell classic fashions,
fine leather goods, understated jewelry, linens and gifts for the home. 
<BR></P>
<P><B>Zurich</B>:  Thinking Swiss means watches, chocolates, Army knives,
shoes and music boxes, all of which are sold along Zurich's upmarket
Bahnhofstrasse.  While it's no surprise to find major fashion designers and
department stores, it's the numerous specialty stores that sell everything from
luscious chocolate truffles and hand-crafted lace and linens to fashionable
legwear and swank leather goods that promote its reputation for exclusive
shopping.   Make the Bahnhofstrasse your first stop for timepieces ranging from
Swatch to Patek Philippe. 
<BR></P>
<P>Zurich sprawls along both banks of the Limmat River.  The city's second most
important shopping area follows the east side along the Limmatquai and its side
streets.  Foods, fashions, perfumes, lace, needlework, shoes, hats, cotton
undergarments and porcelain are good values in stores along Rennweg and the
smart Storchengasse and Muensterhof.  Langstrasse, between Helvetiaplatz and
Limmatplatz, runs through the heart of a working class neighborhood.  Though the
window displays lack the styling and panache of the boutiques along
Bahnhofstrasse, the stores carry much of the same merchandise...and at lower
prices.  On the east bank, antique shops are concentrated around Neumarkt,
Rindermarkt and Kirchgasse.  On the opposite bank, windows display art nouveau
and art deco collectibles along Rindermarkt and Abraham.  &#164;  <BR></P>
