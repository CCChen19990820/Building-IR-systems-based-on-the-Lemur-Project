the time shall omit such day and include the first business day
thereafter.

<A NAME="r1215"></A>(Adopted April 7, 1978)(Amended February 2,
1979)
<H3>RULE 1215. CONDUCT OF HEARING </H3>

(a) When a hearing is set in accordance with Rule 1201, the District
Board shall determine whether a hearing officer is to hear the
proceeding alone or whether the District Board, or one or more
of its members, is to hear the case with or without a hearing
officer. The District Board shall designate a Presiding Officer
where two or more of its members, without a hearing officer, are
designated to hear a proceeding.
<P>
(b) Any hearing officer appointed pursuant to this rule shall
be an attorney at law, having been admitted to practice before
the courts of this State for at least five years prior to his
appointment.
<P>
(c) The Presiding Officer shall have the authority, within the
District Board's powers and subject to its published rules as
follows:

<OL>
<LI>To regulate the course of hearings, including the scheduling
thereof, and the recessing, reconvening, and adjournment thereof,
unless otherwise provided by the District Board.
<P>
<LI>To take evidence under oath or affirmation.
<P>
<LI>To rule upon offers of proof and receive evidence.
<P>
<LI>To hold appropriate conferences before or during hearings.
<P>
<LI>To dispose of procedural matters but not, before the initial

to dismiss proceedings or other motions which involve final determination
of proceedings.
<P>
<LI>Within the Presiding Officer's discretion, or upon direction
of the District Board, to certify any question to the District
Board for its consideration and disposition.
<P>
<LI>To take any other action necessary or appropriate to the discharge
of the duties vested in the Presiding Officer, consistent with
the statutory or other authorities under which the District Board
functions and with the rules, regulations, and policies of the
District Board or of the District.
</OL>
<P>
(d) It is the duty of the Presiding Officer to conduct a fair
and impartial hearing and to maintain order. Any disregard by
participants or counsel of the Presiding Officer's rulings on
matters of order and procedure shall be noted on the record, and
where the Presiding Officer deems it necessary, shall be made
the subject of a special written report to the District Board.
In the event the participants or counsel should be guilty of disrespectful,
disorderly or contumacious language or conduct in connection with
any hearing, the Presiding Officer immediately may submit to the
District Board his report thereon together with his recommendations,
and in his discretion suspend the hearing.
<P>
(e) Rulings of the Presiding Officer may not be appealed from
during the course of hearings or conferences except in extraordinary
circumstances where prompt decision by the District Board is necessary
to prevent detriment to the public interest as to the orderly
conduct of the hearing. In such instance, the matter shall be
referred forthwith by the Presiding Officer to the District Board
for determination and the Presiding Officer may in his discretion
suspend the hearing until the District Board's determination of
the matter.
<P>
(f) Any offer of proof made in connection with an objection taken
to any ruling of the Presiding Officer rejecting or excluding
proffered oral testimony shall consist of a statement of the substance
of the evidence which counsel contends would be adduced by such
testimony; and if the excluded evidence consists of evidence in
documentary or written form or of reference to documents or records,
a copy of such evidence shall be marked for identification and
shall constitute the offer of proof.
<P>
(g) Unless the District Board acts upon questions referred by
the Presiding Officer to the District Board for determination
or upon appeals taken to the District Board from rulings of the
Presiding Officer within thirty (30) days after referral or filing
of the appeal, whichever is later, such referrals or appeals shall
be deemed to have been denied. The parties to the proceeding shall
be given appropriate notice of the date of the referral or appeal
by the Presiding Officer or the appellant, as the case may be.

<H3>RULE 1217. DISQUALIFICATION OF HEARING OFFICER OR BOARD MEMBER
</H3>

A hearing officer or District Board member shall voluntarily disqualify
himself and withdraw from any case in which he cannot accord a
fair and impartial hearing or consideration. Any party may request
the disqualification of any hearing officer or District Board
member by filing an affidavit, prior to the taking of evidence
at a hearing or as soon as possible after knowledge is obtained
of possible grounds for disqualification, stating with particularity
the grounds upon which it is claimed that a fair and impartial
hearing cannot be accorded. Where the request concerns a District
Board member, the issue shall be determined by the other members
of the District Board. Where the request concerns the hearing
officer, the issue shall be determined by the District Board itself
if the District Board itself hears the case with the hearing officer,
otherwise the issue shall be determined by the hearing officer.
No District Board member shall withdraw voluntarily or be subject
to disqualification if his disqualification would prevent the
existence of a quorum qualified to act in the particular case.

to the merits of the proceeding;
<P>
<LI> No Board member or hearing officer who is or may reasonably
be expected to be involved in the decisional process of the proceeding
shall make or knowingly cause to be made to any interested person
outside the District an ex parte communication relevant to the
merits of the proceeding;
</OL>
<P>
(b) A Board member or hearing officer who is or may reasonably
be expected to be involved in the decision process of such proceeding
who receives, or who makes or knowingly cause to be made, a communication
prohibited by this Rule shall place on the public record of the
proceeding:

<OL>
<LI>all such written communications;

<P>
<LI>all written responses and memoranda stating the substance

</OL>
<P>
(c) Upon receipt of a communication knowingly made or knowingly
caused to be made by a party in violation of this subsection,
the Presiding Officer may, to the extent, consistent with the
interest of justice and the policy underlying this Regulation,
require the party to show cause why his claim or interest in the
proceeding should not be dismissed, denied, disregarded, or otherwise
adversely affected on account of such violation.
<P>
(d) The prohibitions of this Rule shall apply beginning at such
time as the agency may designate, but in no cases shall they begin
to apply later than the time at which a proceeding is noticed
for hearing unless the person responsible for the communication
has knowledge that it will be noticed, in which case the prohibitions
shall apply beginning at the time of his acquisition of such knowledge.

(c) Each party shall have these rights: to call and examine witnesses;
to introduce exhibits; to cross-examine opposing witnesses on
any matters relevant to the issues even though that matter was
not covered in the direct examination; to impeach any witness
regardless of which party first called him to testify; and to
rebut the evidence against him. The taking of evidence and subsequent
proceedings shall proceed with all reasonable diligence and with
the least practicable delay.
<P>
(d) The hearing need not be conducted according to technical rules
relating to evidence and witnesses. Any relevant evidence shall
be admitted if it is the sort of evidence on which responsible
persons are accustomed to rely in the conduct of serious affairs,
regardless of the existence of any common law or statutory rule
which might make improper the admission of such evidence over
objection in civil actions. Hearsay evidence may be used for the
purpose of supplementing or explaining any direct evidence but
shall not be sufficient in itself to support a finding unless
it would be admissible over objection in civil actions. The rules
of privilege shall be effective to the same extent that they are
now, or hereafter may be, recognized in civil actions, and irrelevant
and unduly repetitious evidence shall be excluded.
<P>
(e) The Presiding Officer shall rule on the admissibility of all
evidence. Such rulings may be reviewed by the District Board pursuant
to Rule 1215 in determining the matter on its merits. In extraordinary
circumstances where prompt decision by the District Board is necessary
to promote substantial justice, the Presiding Officer may refer
the matter to the District Board for determination pursuant to
Rule 1215. The number of witnesses to be heard on any issue may
be limited appropriately or the production of further evidence
upon any issue may be called for.
<P>
(f) When objections are made to the admission or exclusion of
evidence, the grounds relied upon shall be stated briefly. Formal
exceptions to rulings are unnecessary and need not be taken.
<P>
(g) If relevant and material matter offered in evidence is embraced
in a document containing other matter, the party offering it shall
designate specifically the matter so offered. If other matter
in the document would unnecessarily encumber the record, the document
will not be received in evidence, but at the discretion of the
Presiding Officer, the relevant and material matter may be read
into the record or copies thereof received as an exhibit. Other
parties shall be afforded opportunity to examine the document
and to offer in evidence other portions thereof believed material
and relevant.
<P>
(h) When exhibits are offered in evidence, the original shall
be furnished to the Clerk of the Board and a copy to the Presiding
Officer, to each Board member hearing the case, to the reporter
and to each party, unless the Presiding Officer directs otherwise.
<P>
(i) Upon any filing of specific documentary evidence as a part
of the record, the Presiding Officer may require the production
of further evidence within a specified time, and shall reserve
exhibit numbers therefore.

<H3>RULE 1220. PREPARED TESTIMONY </H3>

Direct testimony of any witness may be offered as an exhibit,
or as prepared written testimony to be copied into the transcript.
Copies of such proposed exhibit or prepared written testimony
shall be served upon all parties to the proceeding or their attorneys
of record, and staff counsel, or if the hearing is in session,
may be distributed to each party. The Presiding Officer may permit
the introduction of such written testimony after having given
all parties and staff counsel present a reasonable opportunity
to examine it. Whenever in the circumstances of a particular case
it is deemed necessary or desirable, the District Board or the
Presiding Officer may direct that testimony to be given upon direct
examination shall be reduced to exhibit form or to the form of
prepared written testimony and be served and offered in the manner
hereinbefore described, unless it is determined that the public
interest would be better served by allowing the proposed testimony
to be read into the record. A reasonable period of time shall
be allowed for the preparation of such written testimony. All
such prepared written testimony when filed and served shall be
authenticated by an appropriate affidavit of the witness.

1979)
<H3>RULE 1229. DECISIONS </H3>

(a) Where a case is heard before the District Board itself, no
member thereof who did not hear the evidence shall vote on the
decision unless that member certifies on the record that he has
read the record including the transcript, or has listened to tape
recordings of the proceedings.
<P>
(b) I a proceeding is heard by either a hearing officer or member
of the District Board alone, he shall prepare a recommended decision
in such form that it may be adopted as the decision and findings
in the proceeding. If a proceeding is heard by two or more members
of the District Board, but less than a quorum of the Board, then
the Presiding Officer at such hearing shall prepare a recommended
decision, concurred in by a majority of the members of the District
Board who heard such proceeding, in such form that may be adopted
as the decision and findings in the proceeding. A copy of the
recommended decision shall be filed with the District Board as
a public record and a copy of the recommended decision shall be
served by the Clerk of the District Board on each party in the
proceeding and his attorney. The District Board itself may adopt
the recommended decision in its entirety.

(c) If the recommended decision is not adopted as provided in
subdivision (b), the District Board itself either may decide the
proceeding upon the record, including the transcript, with or
without taking additional evidence, or may refer the proceeding
to the same Presiding Officer to take additional evidence. If
the proceeding is so assigned to a Presiding Officer, he shall
prepare a recommended decision as provided in subdivision (b)
upon the additional evidence and the transcript and other papers
which are part of the record of the prior hearing. A copy of such
recommended decision shall be furnished to each party and his
attorney as prescribed in subdivision (b). The District Board
itself shall decide no proceeding provided for in this subdivision
without affording the parties an opportunity to present either
oral or written argument before the District Board itself.
<P>

itself, no District Board member may vote on the decision in the
proceeding unless he has complied with subdivision (a).
<P>
(d) The decision of the District Board pursuant to this Rule shall
be in writing and shall contain findings of fact and a determination
of the issues presented. Copies of such decision shall be delivered
to the parties personally or sent to them by mail in accordance
with Rule 1207.

<P> <I> (Adopted October 11, 1996)</I>
<P>
<P><B>RULE 1605 - Credits For The Voluntary Repair of On-Road Motor Vehicles Identified Through Remote Sensing Devices</B>
<P><B>(a) Purpose</B>
<BR>The purpose of this rule is to provide opportunities to generate VOC, NO<SUB>x</SUB>, and CO mobile source emission reduction credits (MSERCs) that could be used as an alternative means of compliance with District regulations.  These credits would be generated based on voluntary emission reductions created by reducing the emissions of high-emitting vehicles through the repair of emissions related components.  High-emitting vehicles would be identified through the use of remote sensing devices (RSDs).  MSERCs would be based on emission reductions that are surplus to local, state, and federal emission reduction requirements, including the State&#146;s Motor Vehicle Inspection Program and Accelerated Vehicle Retirement Program.
<P><B>(b) Applicability</B>
<BR>This voluntary rule is inoperative 60 days subsequent to a declaration by the Bureau of Automotive Repair (BAR) that the enhanced Inspection and Maintenance Program is operational in the District, and applies to 1966 and newer model-year gasoline-powered passenger cars and light-duty trucks that are registered as operable vehicles in the District by the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV). 
<P><B>(c) Definitions</B>
<BR>For the purpose of this rule, the following definitions shall apply:
<P><OL><LI> BAR90 means the test equipment/procedure implemented since July 1990 by the BAR that is utilized to emission test vehicles as part of the Motor Vehicle Inspection Program.
<P><LI> CARBON MONOXIDE (CO) means a colorless, odorless gas, having a chemical formula of CO, produced by the incomplete combustion of carbonaceous material.

<P><B>(d) Rule 1605 MSERC Program Requirements</B>
<P><OL><LI> In order to generate MSERCs, a program operator shall identify and repair high-emitting vehicles as follows:
<P>(A) The program operator shall use RSDs to initially identify potential high-emitting vehicles using cut points of 4 percent and 0.1 percent for exhaust CO and HC, respectively.  The Executive Officer may approve alternative CO and HC cut points provided that data is submitted by the program operator to the District demonstrating that these alternative cut points are at least as effective in identifying high-emitting vehicles compared to cut points of 4 percent and 0.1 percent for exhaust CO and HC, respectively.
<P>(B) The program operator shall emission test vehicles identified as potential high-emitting vehicles at a Smog Test Station to determine compliance with Motor Vehicle Inspection Program requirements according to BAR90 emission test results.  The program operator shall be responsible for obtaining permission to include a vehicle in the program from the vehicle owner.  The program operator shall ensure that:
<BLOCKQUOTE>(i) the vehicle engine is at its normal operating temperature (i.e., warmed-up) at the beginning of the emission test.
<P>(ii) the vehicle does not use  accessory equipment which would result in an additional load on the vehicle&#146;s engine during the BAR90 emission test, such as the use of air conditioning.
<P>(iii) the BAR90 emission test is conducted by a person authorized by BAR to conduct such tests.
<P>(iv) the emission test procedure includes BAR90 exhaust emission testing and all other procedures specified by BAR to determine compliance with Motor Vehicle Inspection Program requirements.  
<P>(v) the initial pre-repair BAR90 emission test is conducted on the vehicle as received, without any adjustments or modifications to the vehicle that could affect its emissions prior to performing the smog check.  The initial pre-repair emission test shall be conducted with the BAR90 test equipment in manual mode (i.e., without electronic notification of test results to BAR).</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(C) The program operator shall only identify vehicles failing BAR90 2500 rpm emission testing as high-emitting vehicles, and such vehicles shall be eligible for MSERC generation.
<P>(D) The program operator shall ensure the vehicle repairs performed under a Rule 1605 MSERC Program are conducted only by person(s) permitted by BAR to conduct vehicle repairs under the Motor Vehicle Inspection Program.  Repairs shall include all procedures necessary to bring the vehicle into compliance with Motor Vehicle Inspection Program requirements.
<P>(E) The program operator shall have the vehicle retested subsequent to repairs for compliance with Motor Vehicle Inspection Program requirements.  The post-repair emission test shall be conducted with the BAR90 test equipment in certification mode (i.e., with electronic notification of test results to BAR).
<P><LI> The program operator shall not include any gasoline-powered passenger cars and light-duty trucks in the program for MSERC generation if one or more of the following occur:
<P>(A) A smog check has yet to be conducted as required by law or the owner has been notified that a smog check is required as part of the DMV registration renewal process.  
<P>(B) The vehicle is scheduled to be smog checked due to DMV registration renewal requirements, within a three month period subsequent to its identification as a potential high-emitting vehicle.
<P>(C) The vehicle will be scrapped or retired as part of a local or statewide vehicle scrapping program.
<P><LI> For Rule 1605 MSERC programs that utilize more than 10 smog test stations, program operators shall submit notice to the Executive Officer  at least one week prior to emission testing and repairing vehicles at smog test stations, pursuant to paragraph (d)(1), indicating specific locations, dates, and times for emission testing and repair activities.  The notice may be submitted either in writing or electronically.  For Rule 1605 MSERC programs that utilize 10 or fewer smog test stations, the smog test facility or the program operator shall provide the Executive Officer with the projected number of vehicles to be emission tested or repaired for a specific day upon request at any time during that specific day.
<P><LI> Program operators shall comply with all applicable regulations and obtain all necessary permits from applicable agencies with regard to conducting RSD measurements on public roads, and identifying and contacting vehicle owners.</OL>
<P><B>(e) Issuance of MSERCs</B>
<P><OL><LI> Rule 1605 Project Plan
<BR>At least one month prior to initial implementation of a Rule 1605 remote sensing/vehicle repair project, the Program Operator shall submit a Rule 1605 Project Plan.  The Rule 1605 Project Plan shall contain the following specific information:
<P>(A) description of RSD equipment, including HC, CO and NO<SUB>x</SUB> (if available) cut points to be used to identify potential high-emitting vehicles pursuant to subparagraph (d)(1)(A);
<P>(B) proposed RSD test locations and site configurations; and
<P>(C) identification of Smog Test Station(s) to be used to test and repair high-emitting vehicles and proof of BAR certification.
<P><LI> To be eligible for MSERC generation, the Rule 1605 Project Plan must be approved by the Executive Officer prior to implementation of the project.
<P><LI> Rule 1605 MSERC Application
<BR>In order to generate MSERCs, the Program Operator shall submit a Rule 1605 MSERC Application for MSERCs for a vehicle not later than 6 months after a vehicle has been identified for inclusion in the program.

<P><LI> For the purpose of calculating MSERCs pursuant to paragraph (f)(1), a Technical Uncertainty Adjustment Factor (TAF) equal to 1.2 shall be applied.  The Executive Officer  shall perform a semiannual analysis to determine the appropriateness of the TAF to ensure that the MSERCs issued pursuant to paragraph (e)(4) do not exceed the actual emissions reductions generated from Rule 1605 remote sensing/vehicle repair programs, and may recommend revisions to  the TAF based on information obtained from BAR and the California Air Resources Board regarding vehicle repair durability, and the effectiveness of the Motor Vehicle Inspection Program and Accelerated Vehicle Retirement Program.</OL>
<P><B>(g) Use of MSERCs</B>
<P><OL><LI>MSERCs may be used for any of the following applications:
<P>(A) As RECLAIM Trading Credits.  The Executive Officer  shall convert MSERCs to RTCs upon submission of MSERCs by the user.
<P>(B) As an alternative method of compliance with any District regulations which specifically authorize the use of MSERCs.
<P>(C) As an alternative method of compliance with District Regulation XI rules that have future compliance dates.  MSERCs shall not be used to offset emission increases caused by the removal of emission control equipment or replacement of compliant with noncompliant materials subject to Regulation XI.  MSERCs must be in existence and designated as an alternative method of compliance in advance of the compliance date.
<P>(D) As New Source Review (NSR) offsets for emission increases at new or modified facilities that are subject to Rule 1303 (b)(2) in accordance with the provisions of Regulation XIII.  Pursuant to Rule 504, no variance or series of variances, including emergency and interim variances, shall be granted for a period in excess of 90 days from the initial granting of a variance, from a permit condition implementing a Regulation XIII offset requirement if such permit condition is based upon the use of MSERCs.

<TITLE>Rule 430 - Breakdown Provisions</TITLE>

<META NAME="GENERATOR" CONTENT="HTML Transit">
<META NAME="AUTHOR" CONTENT="Jane Powers">
<META NAME="OPERATOR" CONTENT="Rezvan Ramezani">
</HEAD>

<BODY>
<P> (Adopted May 7, 1976)(Amended Oct. 8, 1976)(Amended Dec. 2, 1977)
<BR> (Amended May 5, 1978)(Amended July 12, 1996)
<P> 
<P><B>RULE 430 - BREAKDOWN PROVISIONS</B>
<P><B>(a) Applicability</B>
<P>This rule applies to any breakdown which results in a violation of any rule or permit condition not specified in subparagraph (b)(3)(B).  Malfunctions of continuous emissions monitoring system (CEMS), continuous fuel gas monitoring system (CFGMS), or other equivalent monitoring system, subject to Rules 218, 431.1, and 1135 shall not be considered as a breakdown for the purpose of this rule.
<P><B>(b) Requirements</B>
<P><OL><LI> A person shall report by telephone or other District-approved method, any breakdown which results in a violation of any rule or permit condition not specified in subparagraph (b)(3)(B) to the Executive Officer within one hour of such breakdown or within one hour of the time said person knew or reasonably should have known of its occurrence.  Such report shall identify the time, specific location, equipment involved, responsible party to contact for further information, and to the extent known, the causes of the breakdown, and  the estimated time for repairs.  In the case of emergencies that prevent a person from reporting all required information within the one-hour limit, the Executive Officer may extend the time for the reporting of required information provided such person has notified the Executive Officer of the breakdown within the one-hour limit.

<P><LI>Within seven calendar days after a reported breakdown has been corrected, but no later than thirty calendar days from the initial date of the breakdown, unless an extension has been approved in writing by the Executive Officer, the owner or operator shall submit a written Breakdown Emissions Report to the Executive Officer which includes:

<P>(A) an identification of the equipment involved in causing, or suspected of having caused, or having been affected by the breakdown;

<P>(B) the duration of the breakdown;

<P>(C) the date of correction and information demonstrating that compliance is achieved; 

<P>(D) an identification of the types of emissions, if any, resulting from the breakdown;

<P>(E) a quantification of the excess emissions, if any, resulting from the breakdown and the basis used to quantify the emissions;

<P>(F) information substantiating that the breakdown did not result from operator error, neglect or improper operation or maintenance procedures;

<P>(G) information substantiating that steps were immediately taken to correct the condition causing the breakdown, and to minimize the emissions, if any, resulting from the breakdown; 

<P>(H) a description of the corrective measures undertaken and/or to be undertaken to avoid such a breakdown in the future; and

<P>(I) pictures of the equipment which failed, if available.

<P><LI>Compliance During Breakdown
<P>(A) Any rule or permit condition not specified in subparagraph (b)(3)(B) shall be inapplicable to a violation directly caused by a breakdown, provided that all of the following criteria are met:

<BLOCKQUOTE>(i) the owner or operator meets the reporting requirements specified in paragraph (b)(1) and (b)(2);
<P>(ii) the breakdown did not result from operator error, neglect, or improper operation or maintenance procedures;
<P>(iii) steps are immediately taken to correct conditions leading to the breakdown, and emissions caused by the breakdown are mitigated to the maximum extent feasible; and
<P>(iv) the equipment in violation is shut down by the end of an operating cycle, or within twenty-four hours from the time the owner or operator knew or reasonably should have known of the breakdown, whichever is sooner.
<P>For the purpose of this rule, an operating cycle means a period of time within which a round of regularly recurring events is completed, and can not be stopped without the risk of endangering public safety or health, causing material damage to the equipment or product, or can not be stopped due to technical constraints.  Economic reasons alone will not be sufficient to extend this time period.  The operating cycle includes batch processes that may start and finish several times within a twenty-four hour period, in which case each start to finish interval is considered a complete cycle.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>(B) Subparagraph (b)(3)(A) shall not apply to the following District Regulations, Rules and permit conditions:
<BLOCKQUOTE> (i) Regulations I, IX, X, XIV, XVII, XX, XXX, and XXXI;

<P>(ii) Rules 218, and 402;
<P>(iii) any permit condition which implements any Rule or Regulation specified in clause (i) or (ii).</BLOCKQUOTE></OL>

<P><B>(c) If a violation of any rule or permit condition</B> not specified in subparagraph (b)(3)(B) is likely or suspected as a result of a reported breakdown, the Executive Officer will promptly investigate and determine whether the occurrence constitutes a breakdown in accordance with the criteria set forth in subparagraph (b)(3)(A) of this rule.  If the Executive Officer determines that the occurrence did not constitute a breakdown, no relief shall be granted under subparagraph (b)(3)(A). 

<P><B>(d) Equipment may be operated beyond the time limit</B> in clause (b)(3)(A)(iv), provided that a petition for an emergency variance has been filed with the Clerk of the Hearing Board in accordance with Regulation V.  In the event that the breakdown occurs or the time limit in clause (b)(3)(A)(iv) ends outside of the normal District working hours, the intent to file for an emergency variance shall be transmitted to the District in the manner and form prescribed by the Executive Officer.

</HEAD>

<I>(Adopted October 15, 1993)(Amended March 10, 1995) (Amended December 7, 1995)
<BR>(Amended July 12, 1996)</I>
<P>

<BODY><P>
<P><B>RULE 2002 - ALLOCATIONS FOR OXIDES OF NITROGEN (NO<sub>x</sub> )AND OXIDES OF SULFUR (SO<sub>x</sub>)</B><P>
<P><B>(a) Purpose</B>
<BR>The purpose of this rule is to establish the methodology for calculating facility Allocations for Oxides of Nitrogen (NO<sub>x</sub>) and Oxides of Sulfur (SO<sub>x</sub>).
<P><B>(b) RECLAIM Allocations</B>

<OL><LI>RECLAIM Allocations will begin in 1994.

<P><LI> An annual Allocation will be issued to each facility for each compliance year starting from 1994.

<P><LI> Allocations for each year after 2003 are equal to the facility's ending Allocation,  as determined pursuant to subdivision (e) unless, as part of the AQMP process, and pursuant to Rule 2015 (b)(1), (b)(3), (b)(4), or (c), the District Governing Board determines that additional reductions are necessary to meet air quality standards, taking into consideration the current and projected state of technology available and cost-effectiveness to achieve further emission reductions.

<P><LI>The Facility Permit issued at the beginning of each compliance year, pursuant to Rule 2006 - Permits, shall include allocations determined pursuant to subdivisions (c), (d), (e), and (f) and any RECLAIM Trading Credits (RTC) obtained pursuant to Rule 2007 - Trading Requirements for the next fifteen years thereafter.
</OL>
<P><B>(c) Establishment of Starting Allocations</B>
<P><OL><LI> The starting Allocation for RECLAIM NOx and SOx facilities initially permitted by the District prior to October 15, 1993, shall be determined by the Executive Officer utilizing the following methodology: 
<P> Starting Allocation  =    
<IMG SRC="sum.gif" WIDTH = 31 HEIGHT = 27 ALT="Undisplayed Graphic"> [A X B1]  +  ERCs +  External Offsets, where</P>   

<P> A = the throughput for each NO<SUB>x</SUB> and SO<SUB>x</SUB> source or process unit in the facility for the maximum throughput year from 1989 to 1992, inclusive; and
<P> B<SUB>1</SUB> = the applicable starting emission factor for the subject source or process unit, as specified in Table 1 or Table 2.

<P><LI> (A) Use of 1992 data is subject to verification and revision by the Executive Officer or designee to assure validity and accuracy.

<P>(B) The maximum throughput year will be determined by the Executive Officer or designee from throughput data reported through annual emissions reports submitted pursuant to Rule 301 - Permit Fees, or may be designated by the permit holder prior to issuance of the Facility Permit.

<P>(C) To determine the applicable starting emission factor in Table 1 or Table 2, the Executive Officer or designee will categorize the equipment at each facility based on information relative to hours of operation, equipment size, heating capacity, and permit information submitted pursuant to Rule 201 - Permit to Construct, and other relevant parameters as determined by the Executive Officer or designee.  No information used for purposes of this subparagraph may be inconsistent with any information or statement previously submitted on behalf of the facility to the District, including but not limited to information and statements previously submitted pursuant to Rule 301 - Permit Fees, unless the facility can demonstrate, by clear and convincing documentation, that such information or statement was inaccurate.

<P>(D) Throughput associated with each piece of equipment or NO<SUB>x</SUB> or SO<SUB>x</SUB> source will be multiplied by the starting emission factors specified in Table 1 or Table 2.  If a lower emission factor was utilized for a given piece of equipment or NO<SUB>x</SUB> or SO<SUB>x</SUB> source pursuant to Rule 301 - Permit Fees, than the factor in Table 1 or Table 2, the lower factor will be used for determining that portion of the Allocation.

<P>(E) Fuel heating values may be used to convert throughput records into the appropriate units for determining Allocations based on the emission factors in Table 1 or Table 2.    If a different unit basis than   set forth in Tables 1 and 2 is needed for emissions calculations, the Executive Officer shall use a default heating value to determine source emissions, unless the Facility Permit holder can demonstrate with substantial evidence to the Executive Officer that a different value should be used to determine emissions from that source.

<P><LI> All NO<SUB>x</SUB> and SO<SUB>x</SUB> ERCs held by a RECLAIM Facility Permit holder shall be reissued as RTCs.  RECLAIM facilities will have these RTCs added to their starting Allocations.  RTCs generated from the conversion of ERCs shall have a zero rate of reduction for the year 1994 through the year 2000.  Such RTCs shall have a cumulative rate of reduction for the years 2001, 2002, and 2003, equal to the percentage inventory adjustment factor applied to 2003 Allocations pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of this rule.

<P><LI> Non-RECLAIM facilities may elect to have their ERCs converted to RTCs and listed on the RTC Listing maintained by the Executive Officer or designee pursuant to Rule 2007 - Trading Requirements, so long as the written request is filed before July 1, 1994.  Such RTCs will be assigned to the trading zone in which the generating facility is located.  RTCs generated from the conversion of ERCs shall have a zero rate of reduction for the year 1994 through the year 2000.  Such RTCs shall have a cumulative rate of reduction for the years, 2001, 2002, and 2003, equal to the percentage inventory adjustment factor applied to 2003 Allocations pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of this rule.
<P><LI> External offsets provided pursuant to Regulation XIII - New Source Review, not including any offsets in excess of a 1 to 1 ratio, will be added to the starting Allocation pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) provided:
<P>(A) The offsets were not received from either the Community Bank or the Priority Reserve.
<P>(B) External offsets will only be added to the starting Allocation to the extent that the Facility Permit holder demonstrates that they have not already been included in the starting Allocation or as an ERC.  RTCs issued for external offsets shall not include any offsets in excess of a 1 to 1 ratio required under Regulation XIII - New Source Review.

<P>(C) RTCs generated from the conversion of external offsets shall have a zero rate of reduction for the year 1994 through the year 2000.  These RTCs shall have a cumulative rate of reduction for the years 2001, 2002, and 2003, equal to the percentage inventory adjustment factor applied to 2003 Allocations pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of this rule.

<P>(D) Existing facilities with units that have Permits to Construct issued pursuant to Regulation II - Permits, dated on or after January 1, 1992, or existing facilities which have, between January 1, 1992 and October 15, 1993, installed air pollution control equipment that was exempt from offset requirements pursuant to Rule 1304 (a)(5), shall have their starting Allocations increased by the total external offsets provided, or the amount that would have been offset if the exemption had not applied.

<P>(E) Existing facilities with units whose reported emissions are below capacity due to phased construction, and/or where the Permit to Operate issued pursuant to Regulation II - Permits, was issued after January 1, 1992, shall have their starting Allocations increased by the total external offsets provided.</P><P>

<P><LI> If a Facility Permit holder can demonstrate that its 1994 Allocation is less than the 1992 emissions reported pursuant to Rule 301 - Permit Fees, and that the facility was, in 1992, operating in compliance with all applicable District rules in effect as of December 31, 1993, the facility's starting Allocation will be equal to the 1992 reported emissions.
<P><LI> For new facilities initially totally permitted on or after January 1, 1993 but prior to October 15, 1993, the starting Allocation shall be equal to the external offsets provided by the facility to offset emission increases at the facility pursuant to Regulation XIII - New Source Review, not including any offsets in excess of a 1 to 1 ratio.
<P><LI> The Allocation for new facilities initially totally permitted on and after October 15, 1993, shall be equal to the total RTCs provided by the facility to offset emission increases at the facility pursuant to Rule 2005- New Source Review for RECLAIM.
<P><LI> The starting Allocation for facilities which enter the RECLAIM program pursuant to Rule 2001 - Applicability, shall be determined by the methodology in paragraph (c)(1) of this rule.  The most recent two years reported emission fee data filed pursuant to  Rule 301 - Permit Fees, may be used if 1989 through 1992 emission fee data is not available.  For facilities lacking reported emission fee data, the Allocation shall be equal to the external offsets provided pursuant to Regulation XIII - New Source Review, not including any offsets in excess of a 1 to 1 ratio.  The Allocation shall not include any emission offsets received from either the Community Bank or the Priority Reserve.
<P><LI> A facility may not receive more than one set of Allocations.
<P><LI> A facility that is no longer holding a valid District permit on January 1, 1994 will not receive an Allocation, but may, if authorized by Regulation XIII, apply for ERCs.
<P><LI> Clean Fuel Adjustment to Starting Allocation
<BR> Any refiner who is required to make modifications to comply with CARB Phase II reformulated gasoline production (California Code of Regulations, Title 13, Sections 2250, 2251.5, 2252, 2260, 2261, 2262, 2262.2, 2262.3, 2262.4, 2262.5, 2262.6, 2262.7, 2263, 2264, 2266, 2267, 2268, 2269, 2270, and 2271) or federal requirements (Federal Clean Air Act, Title II, Part A, Section 211; 42 U.S.C. Section 7545) may receive (an) increase(s) in his Allocations except to the extent that there is an increase in maximum rating of the new or modified equipment.  Each facility requesting an increase to Allocations shall submit an application for permit amendment specifying the necessary modifications and tentative schedule for completion.  The Facility Permit holder shall establish the amount of emission increases resulting from the reformulated gasoline modifications for each year in which the increase in Allocations is requested.  The increase to its Allocations will be issued contemporaneously with the modification according to a schedule approved by the Executive Officer or designee (i.e., 1994 through 1997 depending on the refinery).  Each increase to the Allocations shall be equal to the increased emissions resulting from the modifications solely to comply with the state or federal reformulated gasoline requirements at the refinery or facility producing hydrogen for reformulated gasoline production, and shall be established according to present and future compliance limits in current District rules or permits.  Allocation increases for each refiner pursuant to this paragraph, shall not exceed 5 percent of the refiner's total starting Allocation, unless any refiner emits less than 0.0135 tons of NOx per thousand barrels of crude processed, in which case the Allocation increases for such refiner shall not exceed 20 percent of that refiner's starting Allocation.  The emissions per amount of crude processed will be determined on the basis of information reported to the District pursuant to Rule 301 - Permit Fees, for the same calendar year as the facility's peak activity year for their NO<SUB>x</SUB> starting Allocation.</OL>

<P><B>(d) Establishment of Year 2000 Allocations</B>
<P><OL><LI> (A) The year 2000 Allocations for RECLAIM NO<SUB>x</SUB> and SO<SUB>x</SUB> facilities will be determined by the Executive Officer or designee utilizing the following methodology:
<P> Year 2000 Allocation  = <IMG SRC="sum.gif" WIDTH = 31 HEIGHT = 27 ALT="Undisplayed Graphic"> [A X B<SUB>2</SUB>]   +  RTCs created from ERCs  +  External Offsets, where
<P> A = the throughput for each NO<SUB>x</SUB> or SO<SUB>x</SUB> source or process unit in the facility for the maximum throughput year from 1987 to 1992, inclusive, as reported pursuant to Rule 301 - Permit Fees; and
<P> B<SUB>2</SUB> = the applicable Tier I year Allocation emission factor for the subject source or process unit, as specified in Table 1 or Table 2.

<P>(B) The maximum throughput year will be determined by the Executive Officer or designee from throughput data reported through annual emissions reports pursuant to Rule 301 - Permit Fees, or may be designated by the permit holder prior to issuance of the Facility Permit.

<P>(C) To determine the applicable emission factor in Table 1 or Table 2, the Executive Officer or designee will categorize the equipment at each facility based on information on hours of operation, equipment size, heating capacity, and permit information submitted pursuant to Rule 201 - Permit to Construct, and other parameters as determined by the Executive Officer or designee.  No information used for purposes of this subparagraph may be inconsistent with any information or statement previously submitted on behalf of the facility to the District including but not limited to information and statements previously submitted pursuant to Rule 301 - Permit Fees, unless the facility can demonstrate, by clear and convincing documentation, that such information or statement was inaccurate.

<P>(D) Throughput associated with each piece of combustion equipment or NO<SUB>x</SUB> or SO<SUB>x</SUB> source will be multiplied by the Tier I emission factor specified in Table 1 or Table 2.  If a factor lower than the factor in Table 1 or Table 2 was utilized for a given piece of equipment or NO<SUB>x</SUB> or SO<SUB>x</SUB> source pursuant to Rule 301, the lower factor will be used for determining that portion of the Allocation.

<P>(E) The fuel heating value may be considered in determining Allocations and will be set to 1.0 unless the Facility Permit holder demonstrates that it should receive a different value.

<P>(F) The year 2000 Allocation is the sum of the resulting products for each piece of equipment or NO<SUB>x</SUB> or SO<SUB>x</SUB> source multiplied by any inventory adjustment pursuant to paragraph (d)(4) of this rule.

<P><LI> For facilities existing prior to October 15, 1993 which enter RECLAIM after October 15, 1993, the year 2000 Allocation will be determined according to paragraph (d)(1).  The most recent two years reported emission fee data filed pursuant to Rule 301 - Permit Fees, may be used if 1989 through 1992 emission fee data is not available.  For facilities lacking reported emission fee data, the Allocation shall be equal to their external offsets provided pursuant to Regulation XIII - New Source Review, not including any offsets in excess of a 1 to 1 ratio.

<P><LI> No facility shall have a year 2000 Allocation [calculated pursuant to subdivision (d)] greater than the starting Allocation [calculated pursuant to subdivision (c)].

<P><LI> If the sum of all RECLAIM facilities' year 2000 Allocations differs from the year 2000 projected inventory for these sources under the 1991 AQMP, the Executive Officer or designee will establish a percentage inventory adjustment factor that will be applied to adjust each facility's year 2000 Allocation.  The inventory adjustment will not apply to RTCs generated from ERCs or external offsets.</OL>

<P><B>(e) Allocations for the Year 2003</B>
<P><OL><LI> The 2003 Allocations will be determined by the Executive Officer or designee applying a percentage inventory adjustment to reduce each facility's unadjusted year 2000 Allocation so that the sum of all RECLAIM facilities' 2003 Allocations will equal the 1991 AQMP projected inventory for RECLAIM sources for the year 2003, corrected based on actual facility data reviewed for purposes of issuing Facility Permits and to reflect the highest year of actual Basin-wide economic activity for RECLAIM sources considered as a whole during the years 1987 through 1992.
<P><LI> No facility shall have a 2003 Allocation (calculated pursuant this subdivision) greater than the year 2000 Allocation [calculated pursuant to subdivision (d)].</OL>

<P><B>(f) Annual Allocations for NO<SUB>x</SUB> and SO<SUB>x</SUB></B>
<P><OL><LI> Allocations for the years between 1994 and 2000, for RECLAIM NO<SUB>x</SUB> and SO<SUB>x</SUB> facilities shall be determined by a straight line rate of reduction between the starting Allocation and the year 2000 Allocation.  For the years 2001 and 2002, the Allocations shall be determined by a straight line rate of reduction between the year 2000 and year 2003 Allocations.  Allocations for each year after 2003 are equal to the facility's ending Allocation, as determined pursuant to subdivision (e) , unless as part of the AQMP process, and pursuant to Rule 2015 (b)(1), (b)(3), (b)(4), or (c), the District Governing Board determines that additional reductions are necessary to meet air quality standards, taking into consideration the current and projected state of technology available and cost-effectiveness to achieve further emission reductions.

<P><LI> New facilities initially totally permitted, on and after October 15, 1993, shall not have a rate of reduction.  The Facility Permit for such facilities will require the Facility Permit holder to, at the commencement of each compliance year, hold RTCs equal to the amount of RTCs provided as offsets pursuant to Rule 2005.

<P><LI> Increases to Allocations for permits issued for Clean Fuel adjustments pursuant to paragraph (c)(12), shall be added to each year's Allocation.</OL>

<P><B>(g) High Employment/Low Emissions (HILO) Facility</B>
<BR>The Executive Officer or designee will establish a HILO bank funded with the following maximum total annual emission Allocations:
<P><OL><LI> 91 tons per year of NO<SUB>x</SUB>
<P><LI> 91 tons per year of SO<SUB>x</SUB>
<P><LI> After January 1, 1997, new facilities may apply to the HILO bank in order to obtain non-tradeable RTCs.  Requests will be processed on a first-come, first-served basis, pending qualification.
<P><LI> When credits are available, annual Allocations will be granted for the year of application and all subsequent years.
<P><LI> HILO facilities receiving such Allocations from the HILO bank must verify their HILO status on an annual basis through their APEP report.
<P><LI> Failure to qualify will result in all subsequent years' credits being returned to the HILO bank.
<P><LI> Facilities failing to qualify for the HILO bank Allocations may reapply at any time during the next or subsequent compliance year when credits are available.</OL>

<P><B>(h) Non-Tradeable Allocation Credits</B>
<P><OL><LI> Any existing RECLAIM facility with reported emissions pursuant to Rule 301 - Permit Fees, in either 1987, 1988, or 1993, greater than its starting Allocation, shall be assigned non-tradeable credits for the first three years of the program which shall be determined according to the following methodology:
<P> Non-tradeable credit for NO<SUB>x</SUB> and SO<SUB>x</SUB>:
<P>Year 1   =   ( <IMG SRC="sum.gif" WIDTH = 31 HEIGHT = 27 ALT="Undisplayed Graphic"> [A X B<SUB>1</SUB>])  -  1994 Allocation;
<P> Where:
<P> A = the throughput for each NOx or SOx source or process unit in the facility from the single maximum throughput year from 1987, 1988, or 1993; and 
<P> B<SUB>1</SUB> = the applicable starting emission factor, as specified in Table 1 or Table 2.
<P> Year 2 = Year 1 non-tradeable credits X  0.667
<BR> Year 3 = Year 1 non-tradeable credits X  0.333
<BR> Year 4 and subsequent years = Zero non-tradeable credit.

<P><LI> The use of non-tradeable credits shall be subject to the following requirements:
<P>(A) Non-tradeable credits may only be used for an increase in throughput over that used to determine the facility's starting Allocation.  Non-tradeable credits may not be used for emissions increases associated with equipment modifications, change in feedstock or raw materials, or any other changes except increases in throughput.  The Executive Officer or designee may impose Facility Permit conditions necessary to ensure compliance with this subparagraph.
<P>(B) The use of activated non-tradeable credits shall be subject to a non-tradeable RTC mitigation fee, as specified in Rule 301 subdivision (n).
<P>(C) In order to utilize non-tradeable credits, the Facility Permit holder shall submit a request to the Executive Officer or designee in writing, including a demonstration that the use of the non-tradeable credits complies with all requirements of this paragraph, pay any fees required pursuant to Rule 301 - Fees, and have received written approval from the Executive Officer or designee for their use.  The Executive Officer or designee shall deny the request unless the Facility Permit holder demonstrates compliance with all requirements of this paragraph.  The Executive Officer or designee shall, in writing, approve or deny the request within three business days of submittal of a complete request and notify the Facility Permit holder of the decision.  If the request is denied, the Executive Officer or designee will refund the mitigation fee.
<P>(D) In the event that a facility transfers any RTCs for the year in which non-tradeable credits have been issued, the non-tradeable credit Allocation shall be invalid, and is no longer available to the facility.

<P>
(Adopted October 15, 1993)(Amended December 7, 1995)(Amended July
12, 1996)
<P>
<B>RULE 2004. REQUIREMENTS</B>
<P>
(a) Purpose
<P>
The purpose of this rule is to establish the requirements for
operating under the RECLAIM program.  The rule includes provisions
pertaining to permits, Allocations, reporting, variances, and
breakdowns.
<P>
(b) Compliance Period and Certification of Emissions
<P>
<OL>
<LI>The compliance year shall be divided into four quarters for
emission reporting and certification purposes.  The 30 calendar
days after the conclusion of each of the first three quarters
shall be a reconciliation period.  During the reconciliation period,
the Facility Permit holder shall calculate the facility's total
emissions for the quarter, acquire and have credited to the facility,
pursuant to Rule 2007 - Trading Requirements, any RTCs necessary
to reconcile the Allocation to the emissions, and submit to the
Executive Officer a Quarterly Certification of Emissions.
<P>
<LI>The Quarterly Certification of Emissions shall be made in
the manner and form specified by the Executive Officer and shall
be certified for accuracy by the highest ranking management official
with responsibility for operation of equipment subject to the
Facility Permit.  The Quarterly Certification of Emissions shall
be calculated as required by Rules 2011 - Requirements for Monitoring,
Reporting and Recordkeeping for Oxides of Sulfur (SOx) Emissions,
and 2012 - Requirements for Monitoring, Reporting and Recordkeeping
for Oxides of Nitrogen (NOx) Emissions, and Facility Permit conditions
applicable to the facility.
<P>
<LI>Upon receipt of the certified Quarterly Report, the Executive
Officer will debit the RTC Listing for the submitting facility
by the amount certified in the report.
<P>
<LI>The 60 calendar days following the last day of each compliance
year shall be the reconciliation period for the last quarter.
 On or before the last day of such reconciliation period, the
Facility Permit holder shall calculate the facility's total emissions
for the last quarter, acquire and have credited to the facility,
pursuant to Rule 2007, any RTCs necessary to reconcile the Allocations
to the emissions, and submit an Annual Permit Emissions Program
(APEP) report, as prescribed by the Executive Officer, for the
purpose of compliance reporting, permit review, and determination
of fees.  As part of the APEP report, the Facility Permit holder
shall accurately report the information specified in Rule 2015
subparagraph (b)(1)(C), (b)(1)(D), and (b)(1)(H) for the District's
annual audit.
<P>
<LI>Except as provided in subdivision (c), the reconciliation
period following the end of a quarter shall be used to reconcile
the Allocation only with emissions from that quarter.
<P>
</OL>
(c) Correction of Quarterly Certification of Emissions
<P>
<OL>
<LI>The Facility Permit holder may, at any time prior to the end
of the reconciliation period for the last quarter of the compliance
year, make corrections to any quarterly certification of emissions,
provided that the Facility Permit holder demonstrates that:
<P>
(A) emissions were inaccurately certified due to an error caused
by conditions beyond the reasonable control of the Facility Permit
holder; and
<P>
(B) the corrected information is accurate; and
<P>
(C) the Facility Permit holder has made the correction within
thirty days of discovering the error necessitating the correction
or within thirty days of when the error reasonably could have
been discovered, whichever is earlier.
<P>
<LI>If a correction is made to a Quarterly Certification of Emissions:
<P>
 (A) the certification requirements set forth in paragraph (b)(2)
shall apply to the correction; and
<P>
 (B) the RTC Listing will be amended to show the corrected amount.
<P>
 (C) the Facility Permit holder shall, within 30 days of the correction
of the Quarterly Certification of Emission, but no later than
the end of the reconciliation period for the last quarter, acquire
any RTCs necessary to reconcile the Allocation to the revised
certification.
<P>
</OL>
(d) Prohibition of Emissions in Excess of Annual Allocation
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Emissions from a RECLAIM facility from the beginning of a
compliance year through the end of any quarter shall not exceed
the annual emissions Allocation in effect at the end of the applicable
reconciliation period for such quarter.  Except as provided in
paragraph (d)(2), any such emissions in excess of the Allocation
shall constitute a single, separate violation of this rule for
each day of the compliance year (365 days).
<P>
<LI>In the event of a violation of paragraph (d)(1), the Facility
Permit holder may, pursuant to this paragraph, establish a number
of violations less than that set forth in paragraph (d)(1) above.
 The number of violations under this paragraph shall be the number
of days or portion thereof, during which any source of the subject
RECLAIM pollutant operated after the Allocation was exceeded,
plus one violation for each 1,000 pounds, or portion thereof,
emitted in excess of the Allocation.  In order to establish the
number of violations under this paragraph, the Facility Permit
holder shall have the burden of establishing the number of days,
or such lesser period as can be established, that the cumulative
facility emissions were less than the annual emission Allocation.
 If the Facility Permit holder is not able to establish the number
of days or period during which the cumulative facility emissions
were less than the annual emission Allocation, the facility shall
be in violation pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this rule.
<P>
<LI>If the average annual price of RTCs exceeds $8,000 dollars
per ton then for purposes of paragraph (d)(2) of this rule, one
violation per 500 pounds or portion thereof, of excess emissions
shall be used in lieu of one violation per 1,000 pounds or a portion
thereof, of excess emissions.  The average annual price of RTCs
will be the price most recently determined pursuant to Rule 2015
(b)(1)(E).
<P>
<LI>For purposes of this rule, emissions from the facility shall
be determined solely pursuant to methods and procedures specified
in Regulation XX - Regional Clean Air Incentives Market (RECLAIM)
and the Facility Permit, if applicable.
<P>
</OL>
(e) Prohibition of Submission of an Inaccurate Quarterly Certification
of Emissions
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Any Quarterly Certification of Emissions determined by the
Executive Officer to be inaccurate, shall constitute a violation
of this rule, unless the report was corrected by the Facility
Permit holder in accordance with the requirements of paragraph
(c)(1).
<P>
<LI>A violation of this subdivision shall constitute a single,
separate violation of this rule for each day in the quarter.
<P>
</OL>
(f) Permit Requirements
<P>
<OL>
<LI>The Facility Permit holder shall, at all times, comply with
all rules and permit conditions applicable to the facility, as
specified in the Facility Permit.
<P>
<LI>A person shall not build, erect or install a new source or
a modification as defined in Rule 2000 - General, without first
complying with Rule 201 - Permit to Construct.
<P>
</OL>
(g) Emissions in Excess of a Concentration Limit
<P>
<OL>
<LI>In the event emissions exceed a concentration limit, as established
by a source test, the days of violation shall be presumed to include
the date of the source test and each and every day thereafter
until the Facility Permit holder establishes that continuous compliance
has been achieved, except to the extent the Facility Permit holder
can prove that there were intervening days during which no violation
occurred or that the violation was not continuing in nature.
<P>
<LI>In the event emissions exceed a concentration limit, as established
by a source test, the emissions from the source to which the concentration
limit applies shall be calculated using the higher concentration
for purposes of determining compliance with the facility's Allocation
until the Facility Permit holder demonstrates that it is in compliance
with the concentration limit set forth in the Facility Permit.
<P>
</OL>
(h) Federal Requirements for the Use of Clean Fuels or Advanced
Control Technology
<P>
Effective November 15, 1998, each new, modified, and existing
electric utility and industrial and commercial boiler which emits
more than 25 tons per year of Oxides of Nitrogen shall:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>burn as its primary fuel natural gas, methanol, or ethanol
(or a comparably low polluting fuel); or
<P>
<LI>use advanced control technology, such as catalytic control
technology or other comparably effective control methods, for
reduction of emissions of Oxides of Nitrogen.
<P>
For purposes of paragraph (h)(1), the term &quot;primary fuel&quot;
means the fuel which is used 90 percent or more of the operating
time.  This subdivision shall not apply during any natural gas
supply emergency as defined in Title III of the Natural Gas Policy
Act of 1978.
<P>
</OL>
(i) Breakdown Provisions
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Reporting Requirements
<P>
(A) The Facility Permit holder shall report any breakdown which
results<U> </U>in:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
(i) a violation of any rule or permit condition not specified
in subparagraph (i)(2)(B); or
<P>
(ii) a request of excess emissions not be counted in determining
compliance with the RECLAIM facility's annual allocations.
<P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Such breakdown shall be reported by telephone, or other District-approved
method to the Executive Officer within one hour of such breakdown
or within one hour of the time the Facility Permit holder knew
or reasonably should have known of its occurrence.  Such report
shall identify the time, specific location, equipment involved,
responsible party to contact for further information, and to the
extent known, the causes of the breakdown and the estimated time
for repairs.  In the case of emergencies that prevent a person
from reporting all required information within the one-hour limit,
the Executive Officer may extend the time for the reporting of
required information provided such person has notified the  Executive
Officer of the breakdown within the one-hour limit.
<P>
 (B) Within seven (7) calendar days after the breakdown has been
corrected, but no later than thirty (30) calendar days from the
initial date of the breakdown, unless an extension has been approved
in writing by the Executive Officer, the Facility Permit holder
shall submit a Breakdown Emissions Report to the Executive Officer
which contains all of the following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 (i) an identification of the equipment involved in causing or
suspected in having caused or having been affected by the breakdown;
<P>
 (ii) the duration of  the breakdown;
<P>
 (iii) the date of correction and information demonstrating that
compliance is achieved;
<P>
(iv) an identification of the types of emissions, if any, resulting
from the breakdown;
<P>
 (v) a quantification of the emissions in excess of those occurring
under normal operating conditions (&quot;excess emissions&quot;)
, if any, resulting from the breakdown using a District- approved
method consistent with the requirements of Rules 2011 and 2012
and Appendix A for each rule;
<P>
  
<P>
 (vi) information substantiating that the breakdown did not result
from operator error, neglect or improper operation or maintenance
procedures;
<P>
 (vii) information substantiating that steps were immediately
taken to correct the condition causing the breakdown and to minimize
the emissions, if any, resulting from the breakdown; 
<P>
(viii) a description of the corrective measures undertaken and/or
to be undertaken to avoid such a breakdown in the future; and
<P>
(ix) pictures of the equipment which failed, if available.
<P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<LI>Compliance During Breakdown
<P>
(A) Any rule or permit condition not specified in subparagraph
(i)(2)(B) shall be inapplicable to a violation directly caused
by a breakdown, provided that all of the following criteria are
met:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
(i) the Facility Permit holder meets the reporting requirements
specified in paragraph (i)(1);
<P>
(ii) the breakdown did not result from operator error, neglect,
or improper operation or maintenance procedures;
<P>
(iii) steps are immediately taken to correct conditions leading
to the breakdown, and emissions caused by the breakdown are mitigated
to the maximum extent feasible; and
<P>
(iv) the equipment in violation is shut down by the end of an
operating cycle, or within twenty-four hours from the time the
Facility Permit holder knew or reasonably should have known of
the breakdown, whichever is sooner.
<P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
For the purpose of this rule, an operating cycle means a period
of time within which a round of regularly recurring events is
completed, and cannot be stopped without the risk of endangering
public safety or health, causing material damage to the equipment
or product, or cannot be stopped due to technical constraints.
 Economic reasons alone will not be sufficient to extend this
time period.  The operating cycle includes batch processes that
may start and finish several times within a twenty-four hour period,
in which case each start to finish interval is considered a complete

<P>
(Adopted October 15, 1993)(Amended December 7, 1995)
(Amended May 10, 1996)<BR>(Amended July 12, 1996)
<P>

<B>RULE 2005. NEW SOURCE REVIEW FOR RECLAIM</B>
<P>
(a) Purpose
<P>
This rule sets forth pre-construction review requirements for
new facilities subject to the requirements of the RECLAIM program
and for modifications to existing RECLAIM facilities.  The purpose
of this rule is to ensure that the operation of such facilities
does not interfere with progress in attainment of the National
Ambient Air Quality Standards, and that future economic growth
in the South Coast Air Basin is not unnecessarily restricted.
<P>
(b) Requirements for New or Relocated RECLAIM Facilities
<P>
<OL>
<LI>The Executive Officer shall not approve the application for
a Facility Permit to authorize construction or installation of
a new or relocated facility unless the applicant demonstrates
that:
<P>
 (A) Best Available Control Technology will be applied to every
emission source located at the facility; and
<P>
 (B) the operation of any emission source located at the new or
relocated facility will not result in a significant increase in
the air quality concentration for NO2 as specified in Appendix
A.  The applicant shall use the modeling procedures specified
in Appendix A.
<P>
<LI>The Executive Officer shall not approve the application for
a Facility Permit authorizing operation of a new or relocated
facility, unless the applicant demonstrates that:
<P>
 (A) the facility holds sufficient RECLAIM Trading Credits to
offset the total facility emissions for the first year of operation,
at a 1-to-1 ratio; and
<P>
 (B) the RECLAIM Trading Credits procured to comply with the requirements
of subparagraph (b)(2)(A) were obtained pursuant to the requirements
of subdivision (e).
<P>
</OL>
(c) Requirements for Existing RECLAIM Facilities
<P>
<OL>
<LI>The Executive Officer shall not approve an application for
a Facility Permit Amendment to authorize the installation of a
new source or modification of an existing source which results
in an emission increase as defined in subdivision (d), unless
the applicant demonstrates that:
<P>
 (A) Best Available Control Technology will be applied to the
source; and
<P>
 (B) the operation of the source will not result in a significant
increase in the air quality concentration for NO2 as specified
in Appendix A.  The applicant shall use the modeling procedures
specified in Appendix A.
<P>
<LI>The Executive Officer shall not approve an application for
a Facility Permit Amendment to authorize operation of the new
or modified source which results in an emission increase as defined
in subdivision (d), unless the applicant demonstrates that the
facility holds sufficient RECLAIM Trading Credits to offset the
annual emission increase for the first year of operation at a
1-to-1 ratio.
<P>
<LI>The Executive Officer shall not approve an application to
increase an annual Allocation to a level greater than the facility's
starting Allocation plus non-tradable credits, unless the applicant
demonstrates that: 
<P>
 (A) each source which creates an emission increase as defined
in subdivision (d) will:
<P><OL>
(i) apply Best Available Control Technology;
<P>
(ii) not result in a significant increase in the air quality concentration
for NO2 as specified in Appendix A; and
<P>
</OL>
 (B) the facility holds sufficient RECLAIM Trading Credits acquired
pursuant to subdivision (e) to offset the annual increase in the
facility's starting Allocation plus non-tradable credits at a
1-to-1 ratio for a minimum of one year.
<P>
</OL>
(d) Emission Increase
<P>
An increase in emissions occurs if a source's maximum hourly potential
to emit immediately prior to the proposed modification is less
than the source's post-modification maximum hourly potential to
emit.  The amount of emission increase will be determined by comparing
pre-modification and post-modification emissions on an annual
basis by using:  (1) an operating schedule of 24 hours per day,
365 days per year; or (2) a permit condition limiting mass emissions.
<P>
(e) Trading Zones Restrictions
<P>
Any increase in an annual Allocation to a level greater than the
facility's starting plus non-tradable Allocations, and all emissions
from a new or relocated facility must be fully offset by obtaining
RECLAIM Trading Credits originated in one of the two trading zones
as illustrated in the RECLAIM Trading Zones Map.  A facility in
Zone 1 may only obtain RECLAIM Trading Credits from Zone 1.  A
facility in Zone 2 may obtain RECLAIM Trading Credits from either
Zone 1 or 2, or both.
<P>
(f) Offsets
<P>
 Any facility which was required to provide offsets pursuant to
paragraphs (b)(2), (c)(2) or subparagraph (c)(3)(B) shall, at
the commencement of each compliance year, hold RECLAIM Trading
Credits in an amount equal to the amount of such required offsets.
 The Facility Permit holder may reduce the amount of offsets required
pursuant to this subdivision by accepting a permit condition limiting
emissions which shall serve in lieu of the starting Allocation
plus non-tradable credits for purposes of paragraph (c)(3).  Unused
RECLAIM Trading Credits acquired to comply with this subdivision
or with paragraphs (b)(2), (c)(2), or subparagraph (c)(3)(B) may
be sold only during the reconciliation period for the fourth quarter
of the applicable compliance year.  The Facility Permit for a
new or modified facility shall require compliance with this subparagraph,
if applicable.
<P>
(g) Additional Federal Requirements for Major Stationary Sources
<P>
 The Executive Officer shall not approve the application for a
Facility Permit or an Amendment to a Facility Permit for a new,
relocated or modified major stationary source, as defined in the
Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. Section 7511a(e), unless the applicant:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>certifies that all other major stationary sources in the state
which are controlled by the applicant are in compliance or on
a schedule for compliance with all applicable federal emission
limitations or standards (42 U.S.C. Section 7503(a)(3)); and
<P>
<LI>submits an analysis of alternative sites, sizes, production
processes and environmental control techniques for the proposed
source which demonstrates that the benefits of the proposed source
significantly outweigh the environmental and social cost imposed
as a result of its location, construction, or modification (42
U.S.C. Section 7503(a)(5));
<P>
<LI>Compliance Through California Environmental Quality Act 
<P>
 The requirements of paragraph (g)(2) may be met through compliance
with the California Environmental Quality Act in the following
manner.
<P>
 (A) if the proposed project is exempt from California Environmental
Quality Act analysis pursuant to a statutory or categorical exemption
pursuant to Title 14, California Code of Regulations, Sections
15260 to 15329, paragraph (g)(2) shall not apply to that project;
<P>
 (B) if the proposed project qualifies for a negative declaration
pursuant to Title 14 California Code of Regulations, Section 15070,
or a mitigated negative declaration as defined in Public Resources
Code Section 21064.5, paragraph (g)(2) shall not apply to that
project; or
<P>
 (C) if the proposed project has been analyzed by an environmental
impact report pursuant to Public Resources Code Section 21002.1
and Title 14 California Code of Regulations, Section 15080 et
seq., paragraph (g)(2) shall be deemed satisfied.
<P>
<LI>Protection of Visibility
<P>
(A) Conduct a modeling analysis for plume visibility in accordance
with the procedures specified in Appendix B if the net emission
increase from the new or modified source exceeds 40 tons/year<I>

minimum of once every twelve months in order to establish an alternative
emission factor, pursuant to Appendix A, Chapter 4, Subdivision
E.  These source tests shall be conducted every four calendar
quarters after the initial source test.  If a source test is not
conducted within three months after the required date, the facility
shall no longer be considered Super Compliant, unless upon good
cause the Executive Officer has granted a written extension of
time.  The source test results shall, upon approval, constitute
the basis for assigning alternative emission factors which shall
be used for purposes of reporting emissions and determining compliance.
<P>
(ii) The facility's total annual SO<SUB>x</SUB> emissions, as reported in
its APEP report, shall not exceed the facility's adjusted compliance
year 2003 SO<SUB>x</SUB> Allocation.  If there are such exceedances for two
consecutive years or in any three years, the facility shall no
longer be considered Super Compliant.

<P><B>BIAS TEST</B>
</CENTER>
<P>The bias of the data shall be determined based on the relative accuracy (RA) test data sets and the relative accuracy test audit (RATA) data sets for SO<SUB>X</SUB> pollutant concentration monitors, fuel gas sulfur content monitors, flow monitors, and emission rate measurement systems using the procedures outlined below.
<OL>
<LI><P>Calculate the mean of the difference using Equation 2-1 of 40 CFR, Part 60, Appendix B, Performance Specification 2.  To calculate bias for an SO<SUB>X</SUB> pollutant concentration monitor, &quot;d&quot; shall, for each paired data point, be the difference between the SO<SUB>X</SUB> concentration values (in ppmv) obtained from the reference method and the monitor.  To calculate bias for a fuel gas sulfur content monitor, &quot;d&quot; shall, for each paired data point, be the difference between the fuel gas sulfur concentration values (in ppmv) obtained from the reference method and the monitor.  To calculate bias for a flow monitor, &quot;d&quot; shall, for each paired data point, be the difference between the flow rate values (in dscfh) obtained from the reference method and the monitor.  To calculate bias for an emission rate measurement system, &quot;d&quot; shall, for each paired data point, be the difference between the emission rate values (in lb/hr) obtained from the reference method and the monitoring system.
<LI><P>Calculate the standard deviation, Sd, of the data set using Equation 2-2 of 40 CFR, Part 60, Appendix B, Performance Specification 2.
<LI><P>Calculate the confidence coefficient, cc, of the data set using Equation 2-3 of 40 CFR, Part 60, Appendix B, Performance Specification 2.
<LI><P>The monitor passes the bias test if it meets either of the following criteria:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>a. the absolute value of the mean difference is less than |cc|.
<P>b. the absolute value of the mean difference is less than 1 ppmv.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<LI><P>Alternatively, if the monitoring device fails to meet the bias test requirement, the Facility Permit holder may choose to use the bias adjustment procedure as follows:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>a. If the CEMS is biased high relative to the reference method, no correction will be applied.
<P>b. If the CEMS is biased low relative to the reference method, the data shall be corrected for bias using the following procedure:

<P><SUB>CEMi</SUB>adjusted = <SUB>CEMi</SUB>monitored x <SUB>BAF</SUB> (Eq. B-1)
<P> where:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> <SUB>CEMi</SUB>adjusted = Data value adjusted for bias at time i.
<P> <SUB>CEMi</SUB>monitored = Data provided by the <SUB>CEMS</SUB> at time i.
<P> <SUB>BAF</SUB> = Bias Adjustment Factor
<P> <SUB>BAF</SUB> = 1 + (|d|/CEM) (Eq. B-2)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> where:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> d = Arithmetic mean of the difference between the CEMS and the reference method measurements during the determination of the bias.
<P>
<P> <SUB>CEM</SUB> = Mean of the data values provided by the CEMS during the determination of bias.
<P>  If the bias test failed in a multi-level RA or RATA, calculate the BAF for each operating level.  Apply the largest BAF obtained to correct for the CEM data output using equation B-1.  Apply this adjustment to all monitoring data and emission rates from the time and date of the failed bias test until the date and time of a RATA that does not show bias.  These adjusted values shall be used in all forms of missing data computation, and in calculating the mass emission rate.
<P>  The BAF is unique for each CEMS.  If backup CEMS is used, any BAF applied to primary CEMS shall be applied to the backup CEMS unless there are RATA data for the backup CEMS within the previous year.

<P><B>A.</B><B>QUALITY CONTROL PROGRAM</B>

<P>Develop and implement a quality control program for the continuous emission monitoring systems and their components.  As a minimum, include in each quality control program a written plan that describes in detail complete, step-by-step procedures and operations for each of the following activities :
<OL>
<P><B><LI></B><B> </B><B>Calibration Error Test Procedures</B>
<P>Identify calibration error test procedures specific to the CEMS that may require variance from the procedures used during certification (for example, how the gases are to be injected, adjustments of flow rates and pressures, introduction of reference values, length of time for injection of calibration gases, steps for obtaining calibration error, determination of interferences, and when calibration adjustments should be made).

<P><B><LI></B><B> </B><B>Calibration and Linearity Adjustments</B>
<P>Explain how each component of the CEMS shall be adjusted to provide correct responses to calibration gases, reference values, and/or indications of interference both initially and after repairs or corrective action.  Identify equations, conversion factors, assumed moisture content, and other factors affecting calibration of each CEMS.

<P><B><LI></B><B> </B><B>Preventative Maintenance</B>

<P><B><LI></B><B> </B><B>Audit Procedures</B>
<P>Keep copies of  written  reports received from testing firms/laboratories of procedures and details  specific to the installed CEMS that  were to be used by the testing firms/laboratories for relative accuracy test audits, such as sampling and analysis methods.  The testing firms/laboratories shall have received approval from the District by going through the District's laboratory approval program.

<P><B><LI></B><B> </B><B>Record Keeping Procedures</B>
<P>Keep a written record describing procedures that shall be used to implement the record keeping and reporting requirements.
</OL>

<P> Specific provisions of Section A-3 and A-5 above of the quality control programs shall constitute specific guidelines for facility personnel.  However, facilities shall be required to take reasonable steps to monitor and assure implementation of such specific guidelines.  Such reasonable steps may include periodic audits, issuance of periodic reminders, implementing training classes, discipline of employees as necessary, and other appropriate measures.  Steps that a facility commits to take to monitor and assure implementation of the specific guidelines shall be set forth in the written plan and shall be the only elements of Section A-3 and A-5 that constitute enforceable requirements under the written plan, unless other program provisions are independently enforceable pursuant to other requirements of the SO<SUB>X</SUB> protocols or District or federal rules or regulations.


<P><B>B.</B><B> </B><B>FREQUENCY OF TESTING</B>
<P>The frequency at which each quality assurance test must be given is as follows:

<OL>
<P><B><LI></B><B> </B><B>Periodic Assessments</B>
<P>For each monitor or CEMS, perform the following assessments during each day in which the unit combusts any fuel or processes any material (hereafter referred to as a &quot;unit operating day&quot;), or for a monitor or a CEMS on a bypass stack/duct, during each day that emissions pass through the bypass stack or duct.  These requirements are effective as of the date when the monitor or CEMS completes certification testing.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>a. Calibration Error Testing Requirements for Pollutant Concentration Monitors, Fuel Gas Sulfur Content Monitors, and O2 Monitors
<P>Test, record, and compute the calibration error of each SO2 pollutant concentration monitor, fuel gas sulfur content monitor, if applicable, and O2 monitor at least once on each unit operating day, or for monitors or monitoring systems on bypass stacks/ducts on each day that emissions pass through the bypass stack or duct.  Conduct calibration error checks, to the extent practicable, approximately 24 hours apart.  Perform the daily calibration error test according to the procedure in  Chapter 2, Subdivision B, Paragraph 1, Subparagraph a, Clause ii of this Attachment.
<P>For units with more than one span range, perform the daily calibration error test on each scale that has been used since the last calibration error test.  For example, if the emissions concentration or the fuel gas sulfur content has not exceeded the low-scale span range since the previous calendar day, the calibration error test may be performed on the low-scale only.  If, however, the emissions concentration or the fuel gas sulfur content has exceeded the low-scale span range since the previous calibration error test, perform the calibration error test on both the low- and high-scales.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>i. Design Requirements for Calibration Error Testing of SO<SUB>X</SUB> Concentration Monitors, the Fuel Gas Sulfur Content Monitors, and O2 Monitors
<P>Design and equip each SO<SUB>X</SUB> concentration monitor, fuel gas sulfur content monitor, and O2 monitor with a calibration gas injection port that allows a check of the entire measurement system when calibration gases are introduced.  For extractive and dilution type monitors, all monitoring components exposed to the sample gas, (for example, sample lines, filters, scrubbers, conditioners, and as much of the probe as practical) are included in the measurement system.  For in situ type monitors, the calibration must check against the injected gas for the performance of all electronic and optical components (for example, transmitter, receiver, analyzer).
<P>Design and equip each pollutant concentration monitor, fuel gas sulfur content and O2 monitor to allow daily determinations of calibration error (positive or negative) at the zero-level (0 to 20 percent of each span range) and high-level (80 to 100 percent of each span range) concentrations.
<P>ii. Calibration Error Test for SO<SUB>X</SUB> Concentration Monitors, Fuel Gas Sulfur Content Monitors, and O2 Monitors
<P>Measure the calibration error of each SO2 concentration analyzer, fuel gas sulfur analyzer, and O2 monitor once each day according to the following procedures:
<P>If any manual or automatic adjustments to the monitor settings are made, conduct the calibration error test in a way that the magnitude of the adjustments can be determined and recorded.
<P>Perform calibration error tests at two concentrations: (1) zero-level and (2) high level.  Zero level is 0 to 20 percent of each span range, and high level is 80 to 100 percent of each span range.  Use only NIST/EPA-approved certified reference material, standard reference material, or Protocol 1 calibration gases certified by the vendor to be within 2 percent of the label value.
<P>Introduce the calibration gas at the gas injection port as specified above.  Operate each monitor in its normal sampling mode.  For extractive and dilution type monitors, pass the audit gas through all filters, scrubbers, conditioners, and other monitor components used during normal sampling and through as much of the sampling probe as practical.  For in situ type monitors, perform calibration checking on all active electronic and optical components, including the transmitter, receiver, and analyzer.  Challenge the SO<SUB>X</SUB> concentration monitors, the fuel gas sulfur content monitors, and the O2 monitors once with each gas.  Record the monitor response from the data acquisition and handling system.  Use the following equation to determine the calibration error at each concentration once each day:

<P><B>b. Calibration Error Testing Requirements for Stack Flow Monitors</B>
<P>Test, compute, and record the calibration error of each stack flow monitor at least once within every 14 calendar day period during which at anytime emissions flow through the stack; or for monitors or monitoring systems on bypass stacks or ducts, at least once within every 14 calendar day period during which at anytime emissions flow through the bypass stack or duct.  Introduce a zero reference value to the transducer or transmitter. Record flow monitor output from the data acquisition and handling systems before and after any adjustments.  Calculate the calibration error using the following equation :

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>CE = Percentage calibration error based on the span range
<P>R = Zero reference value introduced into the transducer or transmitter.
<P>A = Actual monitoring system response.
<P>S = Span range of the flow monitor.

<P><B>c. Interference Check for Stack Flow Monitors</B>
<P>Perform the daily flow monitor interference checks specified in  Chapter 2, Subdivision B, Paragraph 1, Subparagraph c of this Attachment at least once per operating day (when the unit(s) operate for any part of the day).
<P>Design Requirements for Flow Monitor Interference Checks
<P>Design and equip each flow monitor with a means to ensure that the moisture expected to occur at the monitoring location does not interfere with the proper functioning of the flow monitoring system.  Design and equip each flow monitor with a means to detect, on at least a daily basis, pluggage of each sample line and sensing port, and malfunction of each resistance temperature detector (RTD), transceiver, or equivalent.
<P>Design and equip each differential pressure flow monitor to provide (1) an automatic, periodic backpurging (simultaneously on both sides of the probe) or equivalent method of sufficient force and frequency to keep the probe and lines sufficiently free of obstructions on at least a daily basis to prevent sensing interference, and (2) a means to detecting leaks in the system at least on a quarterly basis (a manual check is acceptable).
<P>Design and equip each thermal flow monitor with a means to ensure on at least a daily basis that the probe remains sufficiently clean to prevent velocity sensing interference.
<P>Design and equip each ultrasonic flow monitor with a means to ensure on at least a daily basis that the transceivers remain sufficiently clean (for example, backpurging the system) to prevent velocity sensing interference.

<P><B>d. Recalibration</B>
<P>Adjust the calibration, at a minimum, whenever the calibration error exceeds the limits of the applicable performance specification for the NO<SUB>X</SUB> monitor, O2 monitor or stack flow monitor to meet such specifications.  Repeat the calibration error test procedure following the adjustment or repair to demonstrate that the corrective actions were effective.  Document the adjustments made. 

<P><B>e. Out-of-Control Period</B>
<P>An out-of-control period occurs when the calibration error of an SO2 concentration monitor or a fuel gas sulfur content monitor exceeds 5.0 percent based upon the span range value, when the calibration error of an O2 monitor exceeds 1.0 percent O2, or when the calibration error of a flow monitor exceeds 6.0 percent based upon the span range value, which is twice the applicable specification.  The out-of-control period begins with the hour of completion of the failed calibration error test and ends with the hour of completion of following an effective recalibration.  Whenever the failed calibration, corrective action, and effective recalibration occur within the same hour, the hour is not out-of-control if 2 or more valid readings are obtained during that hour as required by Chapter 2, Subdivision B, Paragraph 5, Subparagraph a.
<P>An out-of-control period also occurs whenever interference of a flow monitor is identified.  The out-of-control period begins with the hour of the failed interference check and ends with the hour of completion of an interference check that is passed.

<P><B>f. Data Recording</B>
<P>Record and tabulate all calibration error test data according to the month, day, clock-hour, and magnitude in ppm, dscfh, and percent volume.  Program monitors that automatically adjust data  to the calibrated corrected calibration values (for example, microprocessor control) to record either: (1) the unadjusted concentration or flow rate measured in the calibration error test prior to resetting the calibration, or (2) the magnitude of any adjustment.  Record the following applicable flow monitor interference check data: (1) sample line/sensing port pluggage, and (2) malfunction of each RTD, transceiver, or equivalent.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><B><LI></B><B> </B><B>Semi-annual Assessments</B>
<P>For each CEMS, perform the following assessments once semi-annually thereafter, as specified below for the type of test.  These semi-annual assessments shall be completed within six months of the end of the calendar quarter in which the CEMS was last tested for certification purposes (initial and recertification) or within three months of the end of the calendar quarter in which the District sent notice of a provisional approval for a CEMS, whichever is later.  Thereafter, the semi-annual tests shall be completed within six months of the end of the calendar quarter in which the CEMS was last tested. For CEMS on bypass stacks/ducts, the assessments shall be performed once every two successive operating quarters in which the bypass stacks/ducts were operated.  These tests shall be performed after the calendar quarter in which the CEMS was last tested as part of the CEMS certification, as specified below for the type of test.
<P>Relative accuracy tests may be performed on an annual basis rather than on a semi-annual basis if the relative accuracies during the previous audit for the SO<SUB>X</SUB> CEMS are 7.5 percent or less.
<P>For CEMS on any stack or duct through which no emissions have passed in two or more successive quarters, the semi-annual assessments must be performed within 14 operating days after emissions pass through the stack/duct.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>a. Relative Accuracy Test Audit</B>
<P>Perform relative accuracy test audits and bias tests semi-annually and no less than 4 months apart for each S02 pollutant concentration monitor, fuel gas sulfur content monitor,  stack gas volumetric flow measurement systems, and the S02 emission rate measurement system in accordance with Chapter 2, Subdivision B, Paragraphs 10, 11, and 12 and Attachment B of the Protocol for Proposed Rule 2011.  For monitors on bypass stacks/ducts, perform relative accuracy test audits once every two successive bypass operating quarters in accordance with Chapter 2, Subdivision B, Paragraphs 10, 11, and 12 and Attachment B (bias test) of the Draft Protocol for Proposed Rule 2011.

<P><B>b. Out-of-Control Period</B>
<P>An out-of-control period occurs under any of the following conditions: (1) The relative accuracy of an SO2 pollutant concentration monitor, a fuel gas sulfur content monitor, or the S02 emission rate measurement system exceeds 20.0 percent; or (2) the relative accuracy of the flow rate monitor exceeds 15.0 percent.  The out-of-control period begins with the  hour of completion of the failed relative accuracy test audit and ends with the hour of completion of a satisfactory relative accuracy test audit.
<P>Failure of the bias test results in the system or monitor being out-of-control.  The out-of-control period begins with the hour of completion of the failed bias test audit and ends with the hour of completion of a satisfactory bias test.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><B><LI></B><B> </B><B>Calibration of Transducers and Transmitters on Stack Flow Monitors</B>
<P>All transducers and transmitters installed on stack flow monitors must be calibrated every two operating calendar quarters, in which an operating calendar quarter is any calendar quarter during which at anytime emissions flow through the stack.  Calibration must be done in accordance with Executive Officer approved calibration procedures that employ materials and equipment that are NIST traceable. 
<P>When a calibration produces for a transducer and transmitter a percentage accuracy of greater than &#177; 1%, the Facility Permit holder shall calibrate the transducer and transmitter every calendar operating quarter until a subsequent calibration which shows a percentage accuracy of less than &#177; 1% is achieved.  An out-of-control period occurs when the percentage accuracy exceeds &#177;2%.  If an out-of-control period occurs, the Facility Permit holder shall take corrective measures to obtain a percentage accuracy of less than &#177;2% prior to performing the next RATA.  The out-of-control period begins with the hour of completion of the failed calibration error test and ends with the hour of completion of following an effective recalibration.  Whenever the failed calibration, corrective action, and effective recalibration occur within the same hour, the hour is not out-of-control if two or more valid data readings are obtained during that hour as required by Chapter 2, Subdivision B, Paragraph 5, Subparagraph a.

<P><B>B.</B>    <B>Test Definitions, Performance Specifications and Test Procedures</B>
<P>This section explains in detail how each performance requirement is to be conducted.
<P>Low Level Calibration Error
<P>The low level calibration error test is defined as challenging the CEMS (from probe to monitor) with certified calibration gases at three levels in the 0-20 percent full scale span range.  Since stable or certifiable cylinder gas standards (e.g. Protocol 1 or NIST traceable) may not be available at the concentrations required for this test, gas dilution systems may be used, with District approval, if they are used according to either District or EPA protocols for the verification of gas dilution systems in the field.  The CEMS high level calibration gas may be diluted for the purpose of conducting the low level calibration error test. 
<OL>

<P><LI>Performance Specifications
<P>Introduce pollutant concentrations at approximately the 20 percent, 10 percent, and 5 percent of full scale span levels through the normal CEMS calibration system.  No low level calibration error shall exceed 2.5 percent of full scale span.
<P><LI>Testing Procedures
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>a. Perform a standard zero/span check; if zero or span check exceeds 2.5 percent full scale span, adjust monitor and redo zero/span check.
<P>b. After zero/span check allow the CEMS to sample stack gas for at least 15 minutes.
<P>c. Introduce any of the low level calibration error standards through the CEMS calibration system.
<P>d. Read the CEMS response to the calibration gas starting no later than three system response times after introducing the calibration gas; the CEMS response shall be averaged for at least three response times and for no longer than six response times. 
<P>e. After the low level calibration error check allow the CEMS to sample stack gas for at least 15 minutes.
<P>f. Repeat steps c through e until all three low level calibration error checks are complete.
<P>g. Conduct post test calibration and zero checks.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Spike Recovery and Bias Factor Determinations
<P>Spiking is defined as introducing know concentrations of the pollutant of interest and an appropriate non-reactive, non-condensable and non-soluble tracer gas from a single cylinder (Protocol 1 or NIST traceable if no Protocol 1 is available) near the probe and upstream of any sample conditioning systems, at a flow rate not to exceed 10 percent of the total sample gas flow rate.  The purpose of the 10 percent limitation is to ensure that the gas matrix (water, CO<SUB>2</SUB>, particulates, interferences) is essentially the same as the stack gas alone.  The tracer gas is monitored in real time and the ratio of the monitored concentration to the certified concentration in the cylinder is the dilution factor.  The expected pollutant concentration (dilution factor times the certified pollutant concentration in the cylinder) is compared to the monitored pollutant concentration. 
<P><I>High Level Spike Recovery/Bias Factor Determination</I>
<P>The high level spike recovery/bias factor determination is used when the CEMS has not been certified per the standard RECLAIM requirements.  The spiking facility/interface shall be a permanently installed part of the CEMS sample acquisition system and accessible to District staff as well as the Facility Permit holder. 
</OL>
<OL>
<P><LI>Performance Specifications
<P>The CEMS shall demonstrate a RA &lt;/= 20 percent, where the spike value is used in place of the reference method in the normal RA calculation, as described below.  The bias factor, if applicable, shall also be determined according to Attachment B.
<P><LI>Testing Procedures

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>a. Spike the sample to the CEMS with a calibration standard containing the pollutant of interest and CO or other non-soluble, non-reacting alternative tracer gas (alternative tracer gas) at a flow rate not to exceed 10 percent of the CEMS sampling flow rate and of such concentrations as to produce an expected 40-80 percent of full scale span for the pollutant of interest and a quantifiable concentration of CO (or alternative tracer gas) that is at least a factor of 10 higher than expected in the unspiked stack gas.  The calibration standards for both pollutant of interest and CO (or alternative tracer gas) must meet RECLAIM requirements specified in Attachment A.

<P>b. Monitor the CO (or alternative tracer gas) using an appropriate continuous (or semi-continuous if necessary) monitor meeting the requirements of Method 100.1 and all data falling within the 10-95 percent full scale span, and preferably within 30-70 percent full scale span. 

<P>c. Alternate spiked sample gas and unspiked sample gas for a total of nine runs of spiked sample gas and ten runs of unspiked sample gas.  Sampling times should be sufficiently long to mitigate response time and averaging effects. 

<P>d. For each run, the average CEMS reading must be between 40 percent full scale span and 80 percent full scale span.  If not, adjust spiking as necessary and continue runs; but expected spike must represent at least 50 percent of the total pollutant value read by the CEMS. 

<P>e. Calculate the spike recovery for both the pollutant and the CO (or alternative tracer gas) for each run by first averaging the pre- and post-spike values for each run and subtracting that value from the spiked value to yield nine values for recovered spikes.

<P>f. Using the CO (or alternative tracer gas) spike recovery values for each run and the certified CO (or alternative tracer gas) concentration, calculate the dilution ratio for each run.  Multiply the certified pollutant concentration by the dilution factor for each run to determine the expected diluted pollutant concentrations.  Using the expected diluted concentrations as the &quot;reference method&quot; value calculate the Relative Accuracy as specified in Appendix A.  The RA shall be &lt;/= 20 percent.  Determine the bias factor, if applicable, according to Attachment B.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>Low Level Spike Recovery/Bias Factor Determination</I>

<P>The low level spike recovery/bias factor determination is used to determine if a significant bias exists at concentrations near the 10 percent full scale span level. The spiking facility/interface shall be a permanently installed part of the CEMS sample acquisition system and accessible to District staff as well as the Facility Permit holder. 
</OL>
<OL>
<P><LI>Performance Specifications
<P>There are no pass/fail criteria with respect to the magnitude of the percent relative accuracy.  There are performance criteria for the range of concentration on the CEMS and the extent to which the spike must be greater than the background pollutant level.
<P><LI>Testing Procedures
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>a. Spike the sample to the CEMS with a calibration standard containing the pollutant of interest and CO or other non-soluble, non-reacting alternative tracer gas (alternative tracer gas) at a flow rate not to exceed 10 percent of the CEMS sampling flow rate and of such concentrations as to produce an expected 10-25 percent of full scale span for the pollutant of interest and a quantifiable concentration of CO (or alternative tracer gas) that is at least a factor of 10 higher than expected in the unspiked stack gas.  The calibration standards for both pollutant of interest and CO (or alternative tracer gas) must meet RECLAIM requirements specified in Appendix A.

<P>b. Monitor the CO (or alternative tracer gas) using an appropriate continuous (or semi-continuous if necessary) monitor meeting the requirements of Method 100.1 and all data falling within the 10-95 percent full scale span, and preferably within 30-70 percent full scale span.

<P>c. Alternate spiked sample gas and unspiked sample gas for a total of nine runs of spiked sample gas and ten runs of unspiked sample gas.  Sampling times should be sufficiently long to mitigate response time and averaging effects. 

<P>d. For each run, the average CEMS reading must be below 25 percent full scale span and &gt; 10 percent full scale span.  If not, adjust spiking as necessary and continue runs; but expected spike must represent at least 50 percent of the total pollutant value read by the CEMS. 

<P>e. Calculate the spike recovery for both the pollutant and the CO (or alternative tracer gas) for each run by first averaging the pre- and post-spike values for each run and subtracting that value from the spiked value to yield nine values for recovered spikes.

<P>f. Using the CO (or alternative tracer gas) spike recovery values for each run and the certified CO (or 
alternative tracer gas) concentration, .calculate the dilution ratio for each run.  Multiply the certified 
pollutant concentration by the dilution factor for each run to determine the expected diluted pollutant concentrations.  Using the expected diluted concentrations as the &quot;reference method&quot; value calculate the Relative Accuracy as specified in Appendix A.  If the average difference is less than the confidence coefficient then no low level bias factor is applied.  If the average difference is greater than the confidence coefficient and the average expected spike is less than the average CEMS measured spike, then no low level bias factor is applied.  If the average difference is greater than the confidence coefficient and the average expected spike is greater than the average CEMS measured spike, then a low level bias factor equal to the absolute value of the average difference is added to data reported at or below the 10 percent of full scale span.

<P><B>C.</B>   <B>Testing Frequency</B>
<P>For each CEMS, perform the aforementioned performance requirements once semiannually thereafter, as specified below for the type of test.

<P>Process units may share fuel meters if each equipment has the same emission factor.  This chapter also includes the equations describing the methods used to calculate SO<SUB>x</SUB> process unit emissions and the reporting procedures.  The interim reporting period does not apply to process units since existing fuel metering equipment or timers shall be used  starting January 1, 1994 for Cycle 1 facilities and July 1, 1994 for Cycle 2 facilities.
<P><B>A. GENERAL REQUIREMENTS</B>
<P><OL><LI> The equipment-specific or category-specific starting emission factor found in Table 2 of Rule 2002 - Allocations for Oxides of Nitrogen (NO<SUB>x</SUB>) and Oxides of Sulfur (SO<SUB>x</SUB>) shall be used for quantifying quarterly mass emissions for a SO<SUB>x</SUB> process unit.
<P><LI> Instead of using the equipment-specific or category-specific starting emission factor found in Table 2 of Rule 2002, the Facility Permit holder of a process unit may apply to the Executive Officer to use a representative emission factor or alternative emission factor for purposes of calculating SO<SUB>x</SUB> emissions.  The alternative emission factor shall be established by the requirements provided in Chapter 6, Subdivision E.
<P><LI>. The Facility Permit holder of a process unit shall use an emission factor or alternative emission factor to calculate the mass emission according to the methodology specified in Chapter 3, Subdivision B, Paragraph 2. (fuel totalizing meters) or Chapter 3, Subdivision B, Paragraph 3, Subparagraph a (timers).
<P><LI> The Facility Permit holder of each SO<SUB>x</SUB> process unit shall use a totalizing fuel meter or timer as applicable and specified in the Facility Permit for each affected equipment to measure and report the variables listed in Tables 3-A and 3-B, respectively, for each equipment.
<P><LI> The Facility Permit holder of each SO<SUB>x</SUB> process unit shall monitor, report and maintain the following records on a quarterly basis:
<P>a. Type and quantity of fuel burned in units of million standard cubic feet per quarter (mmscf per quarter) for gaseous fuels or thousand gallons per quarter (mgal per quarter) for liquid fuels, expressed with three significant figures minimum;  or
<P>b. Total hours of operation.
<P><LI> The Facility Permit holder of each SO<SUB>x</SUB> process unit shall also provide any other data necessary for calculating the emission rates of oxides of sulfur as determined by the Executive Officer.</OL>
<P><B>B. EMISSION CALCULATIONS FOR REPORTED DATA</B>

<P>a. Pursuant to Rules 2011(d)(3) and 2011(f)(2), starting January 1, 1994 for Cycle 1 facilities, and starting July 1, 1994 for Cycle 2 facilities, the quarterly emission of each process unit shall be calculated and recorded according to:
<Blockquote>   r </Blockquote>
<P> Eip = <IMG SRC="sum.gif" WIDTH = 31 HEIGHT = 27 ALT="Undisplayed Graphic">d<SUB>j </SUB> x  EF<SUB>sj </SUB>                            (Eq.15)

<P>If the SO<SUB>x</SUB> process unit is equipped with a timer , the Facility Permit holder shall estimate the quarterly fuel usage for each affected equipment according to Eq. 17 - Eq. 20 and estimate the quarterly mass emissions according to Eq. 16 - Eq. 20.
<P><B>a. Quarterly Fuel Usage for Each Affected SO<SUB>x</SUB> Process Unit</B>
<P> If the SO<SUB>x</SUB> process unit does not measure  a fuel usage with a fuel meter, the quarterly fuel usage for each affected equipment in a process unit shall be estimated according to:
<P>d = d<SUB>pu</SUB> x (H/H<SUB>pu</SUB>) (Eq.17)
<P>Where:

<BR>   
<BR>H = 5,400 mmBtu/quarter
<BR>   
<BR>H<SUB>pu</SUB> = 27,000 mmBtu/quarter
<BR>   
<BR>d = d<SUB>pu</SUB> x (H/H<SUB>pu</SUB>)
<BR>
<BR>d = 1,587 mmscf/quarter x (5,400 mmBtu/quarter &#150; 27,000     mmBtu/quarter
<BR>   
<BR>d = 317.4 mmscf/quarter
<P>_________________________________________________________________________

<P> The quarterly fuel usage for all SO<SUB>x</SUB> process units at the facility (dpu) shall be calculated according to the following equation:
<P>d<SUB>pu</SUB> = d<SUB>fac</SUB>  -  d<SUB>major </SUB>(Eq.18)
<P>where:
<P> d<SUB>fac </SUB>= The quarterly fuel usage of all major sources and SO<SUB>x</SUB> process units at the facility (mmscf/quarter or mgal/quarter).

<BR>   d<SUB>fac </SUB>= 58 mmscf/quarter
<BR>   d<SUB>major</SUB> = 42 mmscf/quarter
<BR>   d<SUB>pu </SUB>= Ffac  -  F<SUB>major</SUB>
<BR>   d<SUB>pu </SUB>= 58 - 42 
<BR>   d<SUB>pu </SUB>= 16 mmscf/quarter
<P> The quarterly heat input of all SO<SUB>x</SUB> process units at the facility (Hpu) shall be calculated according to:
<P><BLOCKQUOTE> n</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>H<SUB>pu</SUB> = <IMG SRC="sum.gif" WIDTH = 31 HEIGHT = 27 ALT="Undisplayed Graphic">(R<SUB>i</SUB>  x  T<SUB>i</SUB>) (Eq.19)
<P><BLOCKQUOTE> i=1</BLOCKQUOTE> 
<P>where:
<P>R<SUB>i </SUB>= The maximum rated heat input capacity of a SO<SUB>x</SUB> process unit (mmBtu/hr).
<P>T<SUB>i</SUB> = The quarterly accumulated operation hours for a SO<SUB>x</SUB> process unit (hr/quarter).
<P>i = Each process unit
<P>n = The total number of SO<SUB>x</SUB> process units at the facility.

<BR>   H<SUB>pu</SUB> = (3.5 x 480) + (2.7 x 120)
<BR>   H<SUB>pu </SUB>= 2004 mmBtu/quarter
<P> The maximum rated heat input capacity of all SO<SUB>x</SUB> process units shall be in units of mmBtu/hr.  Since internal combustion engines are usually rated in units of brake horse power, the maximum rated heat input capacity of an engine shall be computed as follows.
<P>R = 0.002545 x bhp / eff (Eq.20)
<P>where:
<P>R = The maximum rated heat input capacity
<P>eff = The manufacturer's rated efficiency @LHV x (LHV/HHV)
<P>= 0.25, if not provided by the operator
<P>bhp = The manufacturer's rated shaft output in brake horse power
<P>_________________________________________________________________________
<P>Example Calculation:
<BR>
<BR>   eff = 0.25
<BR>   bhp = 75 bhp
<BR>   R = 0.002545 x bhp / eff
<BR>   R = 0.002545 x 75/.25
<BR>   R = 0.7635 mmBtu/hr
<P>_________________________________________________________________________
<P> If gas turbines are rated in kilowatts, the rating shall be converted to mmBtu/hr by applying the manufacturer's heat rate (in mmBtu/kw-hr).  If the manufacturer's heat rate is not available, a default value of 15,000 Btu/kw-hr shall be used.

Additionally, the Facility Permit holder shall select an equipment-specific concentration limit for each major source which will be reclassified as a large NOx source.  The concentration limits selected shall be consistent with the source test results and at a level adequate to allow continuous compliance and shall be enforceable through permit conditions.
<P>(D) Requirements to maintain Super Compliant status
<P>Super Compliant status is contingent upon the Facility Permit holder meeting at all times the following provisions:
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>(i) Every major NOx source at a Super Compliant NOx facility which is reclassified as a large NOx source shall be source tested a minimum of once every six months in order to verify compliance with the equipment-specific concentration limit.  The source test shall be conducted pursuant to Appendix A, Chapter 5, Subdivisions A and D and shall constitute the basis for assigning alternative emission factors.  These source tests shall be conducted every two calendar quarters after the initial source test.  If a source test is not conducted within three months after the required date, the facility shall no longer be considered Super Compliant, unless upon good cause the Executive Officer has granted a written extension of time.  If the results of a source test indicate non-compliance with the concentration limit then the Facility Permit holder shall select a new concentration limit which is consistent with the source test results unless the Facility Permit holder demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Executive Officer or designee that no change is warranted.  If all tests conducted pursuant to this paragraph over a two-year period comply with the equipment-specific concentration limit then the facility shall have the option of reducing the source test frequency to once every four quarters.  If any test conducted on a four quarter cycle exceeds the concentration limit then the facility shall return to conducting source tests every two quarters.
<P>(ii) The facility's total annual NOx emissions, as reported in its APEP report, shall not exceed the facility's adjusted compliance year 2003 NOx Allocation.  If there are such exceedances for two consecutive years or any three years, the facility shall no longer be considered Super Compliant.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>BIAS TEST</B>

<P>
The bias of the data shall be determined based on the relative
accuracy (RA) test data sets and the relative accuracy (RATA)
test audit data sets for NO<SUB>X</SUB> pollutant concentration monitors,
fuel gas sulfur content monitors, flow monitors, and emission
rate measurement systems using the procedures outlined below.
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Calculate the mean of the difference using Equation 2-1 of
40 CFR, Part 60, Appendix B, Performance Specification 2.  To
calculate bias for a NO<SUB>X</SUB> pollutant concentration monitor, &quot;d&quot;
shall, for each paired data point, be the difference between the
NO<SUB>X</SUB> concentration values (in ppmv) obtained from the reference
method and the monitor.  To calculate bias for a flow monitor,
&quot;d&quot; shall, for each paired data point, be the difference
between the flow rate values (in dscfh) obtained from the reference
method and the monitor.  To calculate bias for an emission rate
measurement system, &quot;d&quot; shall,  for each paired data
point, be the difference between the emission rate values (in
lb/hr) obtained from the reference method and the monitoring system.
<P>
<LI>Calculate the standard deviation, Sd, of the data set using
Equation 2-2 of 40 CFR, Part 60, Appendix B, Performance Specification
2.
<P>
<LI>Calculate the confidence coefficient, cc, of the data set using
Equation 2-3 of 40 CFR, Part 60, Appendix B, Performance Specification
2.
<P>
<LI>The monitor passes the bias test if it meets either of the
following criteria:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
a. the absolute value of the mean difference is less than |cc|.
<P>
b. the absolute value of the mean difference is less than 1 ppmv.
<P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<LI>Alternatively, if the monitoring device fails to meet the bias
test requirement, the Facility Permit holder may choose to use
the bias adjustment procedure as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 a. If the CEMS is biased high reltive to the reference method,
no correction will be applied.
<P>
 b. If the CEMS is biased low relative to the reference method,
the data shall be corrected for bias using the following procedure:
<P>

 <P><SUB>CEMi</SUB>adjusted = <SUB>CEMi</SUB>monitored x <SUB>BAF</SUB> (Eq. B-1)
<P> where:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> <SUB>CEMi</SUB>adjusted = Data value adjusted for bias at time i.
<P> <SUB>CEMi</SUB>monitored = Data provided by the <SUB>CEMS</SUB> at time i.
<P> <SUB>BAF</SUB> = Bias Adjustment Factor
<P> <SUB>BAF</SUB> = 1 + (|d|/CEM) (Eq. B-2)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
  
<P> where:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> d = Arithmetic mean of the difference between the CEMS and the reference method measurements during the determination of the bias.
<P>

<SUB>CEM</SUB> = Mean of the data values provided by the CEMS during the
determination of bias.
<P>
  If the bias test failed in a multi-level RA or RATA, calculate
the BAF for each operating level.   Apply the largest BAF obtained
to correct for the CEM data output using equation B-1.  Apply
this adjustment to all monitoring data and emission rates from
the time and date of the failed bias test until the date and time
of a RATA that does not show bias.  These adjusted values shall
be used in all forms of missing data computation, and in calculating
the mass emission rate.
<P>
  The BAF is unique for each CEMS.  If backup CEMS is used, any
BAF applied to primary CEMS shall be applied to the backup CEMS
unless there are RATA data for the backup CEMS within the previous
year.

each of the following activities:
<P>
<OL>
<B><LI>Calibration Error Test Procedures</B>

personnel.  However facilities shall be required to take reasonable
steps to monitor and assure implementation of such specific guidelines.
 Such reasonable steps may include periodic audits, issuance of
periodic reminders, implementing training classes, discipline
of employees as necessary, and other appropriate measures.  Steps
that a facility commits to take to monitor and assure implementation
of the specific guidelines shall be set forth in the written plan
and shall be the only elements of Section A-3 and A-5 that constitute
enforceable requirements under the written plan, unless other
program provisions are independently enforceable pursuant to other
requirements of the NO<SUB>X</SUB> protocols or District or federal rules
or regulations.
<P>
<B>B. FREQUENCY OF TESTING</B>
<P>
 The frequency at which each quality assurance test must be performed
is as follows:
<P>
<OL>
<B><LI>Periodic<B> </B>Assessments</B>
<P>
 For each monitor or CEMS, perform the following assessments on
each day during which the unit combusts any fuel or processes
any material (hereafter referred to as a &quot;unit operating
day&quot;), or for a monitor or a CEMS on a bypass stack/duct,
on each day during which emissions pass through the bypass stack
or duct.  These requirements are effective as of the date when
the monitor or CEMS completes certification testing.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  a. Calibration Error Testing Requirements for Pollutant Concentration
Monitors and O2 Monitors
<P>
 Test, record, and compute the calibration error of each NO<SUB>X</SUB> pollutant
concentration monitor and O2 monitor at least once on each unit
operating day, or for monitors or monitoring systems on bypass
stacks/ducts on each day that emissions pass through the bypass
stack or duct.  Conduct calibration error checks, to the extent
practicable, approximately 24 hours apart.  Perform the daily
calibration error test according to the procedure in Paragraph
B.1.a.ii. of this Attachment.
<P>
 For units with more than one span range, perform the daily calibration
error test on each scale that has been used since the last calibration
error test.  For example, if the emissions concentration has not
exceeded the low-scale span range since the previous calendar
day, the calibration error test may be performed on the low-scale
only.  If, however, the emissions concentration has exceeded the
low-scale span range since the previous calibration error test,
perform the calibration error test on both the low- and high-scales
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
i. Design Requirements for Calibration Error Testing of NO<SUB>X</SUB> Concentration
Monitors and O2 Monitors
<P>
 Design and equip each NO<SUB>X</SUB> concentration monitor and O2 monitor
with a calibration gas injection port that allows a check of the
entire measurement system when calibration gases are introduced.
 For extractive and dilution type monitors, all monitoring components
exposed to the sample gas, (for example, sample lines, filters,
scrubbers, conditioners, and as much of the probe as practical)
are included in the measurement system.  For in situ type monitors,
the calibration must check against the injected gas for the performance
of all electronic and optical components (for example, transmitter,
receiver, analyzer).
<P>
 Design and equip each pollutant concentration monitor and O2
monitor to allow daily determinations of calibration error (positive
or negative) at the zero-level (0 to 20 percent of each span range)
and high-level (80 to 100 percent of each span range) concentrations.
<P>
ii. Calibration Error Test for NO<SUB>X</SUB> Concentration Monitors and
O2 Monitors
<P>
 Measure the calibration error of each NO<SUB>X</SUB> concentration analyzer
and O2 monitor once each day according to the following procedures:
<P>
 If any manual or automatic adjustments to the monitor settings
are made, conduct the calibration error test in a way that the
magnitude of the adjustments can be determined and recorded.
<P>
 Perform calibration error tests at two concentrations: (1) zero-level
and (2) high level.  Zero level is 0 to 20 percent of each span
range, and high level is 80 to 100 percent of each span range.
 Use only NIST/EPA-approved certified reference material, standard
reference material, or Protocol 1 calibration gases certified
by the vendor to be within 2 percent of the label value.
<P>
 Introduce the calibration gas at the gas injection port as specified
above.  Operate each monitor in its normal sampling mode.  For
extractive and dilution type monitors, pass the audit gas through
all filters, scrubbers, conditioners, and other monitor components
used during normal sampling and through as much of the sampling
probe as practical.  For in situ type monitors, perform calibration
checking all active electronic and optical components, including
the transmitter, receiver, and analyzer.  Challenge the NO<SUB>X</SUB> concentration
monitors and the O2 monitors once with each gas.  Record the monitor
response from the data acquisition and handling system.  Use the
following equation to determine the calibration error at each
concentration once each day:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>
      | R - A |
CE = -----------  x  100                    (Eq. C-1)
          S
</PRE>
<P>Where:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>CE = Percentage calibration error based on the span range
<P>R = Reference value of zero- or high-level calibration gas introduced into the monitoring system.
<P>A = Actual monitoring system response to the calibration gas.
<P>S = Span range of the instrument
<P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>b. Calibration Error Testing Requirements for Stack Flow Monitors</B>
<P>
Test, compute, and record the calibration error of each stack
flow monitor at least once within every 14 calendar day period
during which at anytime emissions flow through the stack; or for
monitors or monitoring systems on bypass stacks or ducts, at least
once within every 14 calendar day period during which at anytime
emissions flow through the bypass stack or duct.  Introduce a
zero reference value to the transducer or transmitter. Record
flow monitor output from the data acquisition and handling systems
before and after any adjustments.  Calculate the calibration error
using the following equation :

<PRE>
      | R - A |
CE = -----------  x  100                    (Eq. C-2)
          S
</PRE>
<P>Where:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>CE = Percentage calibration error based on the span range
<P>R = Zero reference value introduced into the transducer or transmitter.
<P>A = Actual monitoring system response.
<P>S = Span range of the flow monitor.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>c. Interference Check for Stack Flow Monitors</B>
<P>
 Perform the daily flow monitor interference checks specified
in Paragraph B.1.c.i. of this Attachment at least once per operating
day (when the unit(s) operate for any part of the day).
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
i. Design Requirements for Flow Monitor Interference Checks
<P>
 Design and equip each flow monitor with a means to ensure that
the moisture expected to occur at the monitoring location does
not interfere with the proper functioning of the flow monitoring
system.  Design and equip each flow monitor with a means to detect,
on at least a daily basis, pluggage of each sample line and sensing
port, and malfunction of each resistance temperature detector
(RTD), transceiver, or equivalent.
<P>
 Design and equip each differential pressure flow monitor to provide
(1) an automatic, periodic backpurging (simultaneously on both
sides of the probe) or equivalent method of sufficient force and
frequency to keep the probe and lines sufficiently free of obstructions
on at least a daily basis to prevent sensing interference, and
(2) a means to detecting leaks in the system at least on a quarterly
basis (a manual check is acceptable).
<P>
 Design and equip each thermal flow monitor with a means to ensure
on at least a daily basis that the probe remains sufficiently
clean to prevent velocity sensing interference.
<P>
 Design and equip each ultrasonic flow monitor with a means to
ensure on at least a daily basis that the transceivers remain
sufficiently clean (for example, backpurging the system) to prevent
velocity sensing interference.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>


<B>d. Recalibration</B>
<P>
 Adjust the calibration, at a minimum, whenever the calibration
error exceeds the limits of the applicable performance specification
for the NO<SUB>X</SUB> monitor, O2 monitor or stack flow monitor to meet
such specifications.  Repeat the calibration error test procedure
following the adjustment or repair to demonstrate that the corrective
actions were effective.  Document the adjustments made.
<P>
<B>e. Out-of-Control Period</B>
<P>
 An out-of-control period occurs when the calibration error  of
an NO<SUB>X</SUB> concentration monitor exceeds 5.0 percent based upon the
span range value, when the calibration error  of an O2 monitor
exceeds 1.0 percent O2, or when the calibration error  of a flow
monitor exceeds 6.0 percent based upon the span range value, which
is twice the applicable specification.  The out-of-control period
begins with the hour of completion of the failed calibration error
 test and ends with the hour of completion following an effective
recalibration.  Whenever the failed calibration, corrective action,
and effective recalibration occur within the same hour, the hour
is not out-of-control if 2 or more valid readings are obtained
during that hour as required by Chapter 2, Subdivision B, Paragraph
5.
<P>
 An out-of-control period also occurs whenever interference of
a flow monitor is identified.  The out-of-control period begins
with the hour of the failed interference check and ends with the
hour of completion of an interference check that is passed.
<P>
<B>f. Data Recording</B>
<P>
 Record and tabulate all calibration error test data according
to the month, day, clock-hour, and magnitude in ppm, DSCFH, and
percent volume.  Program monitors that automatically adjust data
 to the calibrated corrected calibration values (for example,
microprocessor control) to record either: (1) the unadjusted concentration
or flow rate measured in the calibration error test prior to resetting
the calibration, or (2) the magnitude of any adjustment.  Record
the following applicable flow monitor interference check data:
(1) sample line/sensing port pluggage, and (2) malfunction of
each RTD, transceiver, or equivalent.
<P>
<LI>Semi-annual Assessments
<P>
For each CEMS, perform the following assessments once semi-annually
thereafter, as specified below for the type of test.  These semi-annual
assessments shall be completed within six months of the end of
the calendar quarter in which the CEMS was last tested for certification
purposes (initial and recertification) or within three months
of the end of the calendar quarter in which the District sent
notice of a provisional approval for a CEMS, whichever is later.
 Thereafter, the semi-annual tests shall be completed within six
months of the end of the calendar quarter in which the CEMS was
last tested.  For CEMS on bypass stacks/ducts, the assessments
shall be performed once every two successive operating quarters
in which the bypass stacks/ducts were operated.  These tests shall
be performed after the calendar quarter in which the CEMS was
last tested as part of the CEMS certification, as specified below
for the type of test.
<P>
Relative accuracy tests may be performed on an annual basis rather
than on a semi-annual basis if the relative accuracies during
the previous audit for the NO<SUB>X</SUB> CEMS are 7.5 percent or less.
<P>
For CEMS on any stack or duct through which no emissions have
passed in two or more successive quarters, the semi-annual assessments
must be performed within 14 operating days after emissions pass
through the stack/duct.
<P>
<B>a. Relative Accuracy Test Audit</B>
<P>
 Perform relative accuracy test audits and bias tests semi-annually
and no less than 4 months apart for each NO<SUB>X</SUB> pollutant concentration
monitor, stack gas volumetric flow measurement systems, and the
NO<SUB>X</SUB> emission rate measurement system in accordance with Chapter
2, Subdivision B, Paragraph 10, Chapter 2, Subdivision B, Paragraph
11, and Chapter 2, Subdivision B, Paragraph 12.  For monitors
on bypass stacks/ducts, perform relative accuracy test audits
once every two successive bypass operating quarters in accordance
with Paragraphs 2.B.10, 2.B.11, and 2.B.12.
<P>
<B>b. Out-of-Control Period</B>
<P>
 An out-of-control period occurs under any of the following conditions:
(1) The relative accuracy of an NO<SUB>X</SUB> pollutant concentration monitor
or the NO<SUB>X</SUB> emission rate measurement system exceeds 20.0 percent;
or (2) the relative accuracy of the flow rate monitor exceeds
15.0 percent.  The out-of-control period begins with the  hour
of completion of the failed relative accuracy test audit and ends
with the hour of completion of a satisfactory relative accuracy
test audit.
<P>
 Failure of the bias test results in the system or monitor being
out-of-control.  The out-of-control period begins with the  hour
of completion of the failed bias test audit and ends with the
hour of completion of a satisfactory bias test.
<P>
<LI>Calibration of Transducers and Transmitters on Stack Flow Monitors
<P>
All transducers and transmitters installed on stack flow monitors
must be calibrated every two operating calendar quarters, in which
an operating calendar quarter is any calendar quarter during which
at anytime emissions flow through the stack.  Calibration must
be done in accordance with Executive Officer approved calibration
procedures that employ materials and equipment that are NIST traceable.

<P>
When a calibration produces for a transducer and transmitter a
percentage accuracy of greater than  1%, the Facility Permit holder
shall calibrate the transducer and transmitter every calendar
operating quarter until a subsequent calibration which shows a
percentage accuracy of less than  1% is achieved.  An out-of-control
period occurs when the percentage accuracy exceeds 2%.  If an
out-of-control period occurs, the Facility Permit holder shall
take corrective measures to obtain a percentage accuracy of less
than 2% prior to performing the next RATA.  The out-of-control
period begins with the hour of completion of the failed calibration
error test and ends with the hour of completion of following an
effective recalibration.  Whenever the failed calibration, corrective
action, and effective recalibration occur within the same hour,
the hour is not out-of-control if two or more valid data readings
are obtained during that hour as required by Chapter 2, Subdivision
B, Paragraph 5, Subparagraph a.

<B>A. PROCEDURES</B>
<P>
 Nothing in this Equipment Tuning Procedure shall be construed
to require any act or omission that would result in unsafe conditions
or would be in violation of any regulation or requirement established
by Factory Mutual, Industrial Risk Insurers, National Fire Prevention
Association, the California Department of Industrial Relations
(Occupational Safety and Health Division), the Federal Occupational
Safety and Health Administration, or other relevant regulations
and requirements.
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Operate the unit at the firing rate most typical of normal
operation.  If the unit experiences significant load variations
during normal operation, operate it at its average firing rate.
<P>
<LI>At this firing rate, record stack-gas temperature, oxygen concentration,
and CO concentration (for gaseous fuels) or smoke-spot number
2 (for liquid fuels), and observe flame conditions after unit
operation stabilizes at the firing rate selected.  If the excess
oxygen in the stack gas is at the lower end of the range of typical
minimum values, and if CO emissions are low and there is no smoke,
the unit is probably operating at near optimum efficiency at this
particular firing rate.
<P>
<LI>Increase combustion air flow to the furnace until stack-gas
oxygen levels increase by one to two percent over the level measured
in Step 2.  As in Step 2, record the stack-gas temperature, CO
concentration (for gaseous fuels) or smoke-spot number (for liquid
fuels), and observe flame conditions for these higher oxygen levels
after boiler operation stabilizes.
<P>
<LI>Decrease combustion air flow until the stack gas oxygen concentration
is at the level measure in Step 2.  From this level, gradually
reduce the combustion air flow in small increments.  After each
increments, record the stack-gas temperature, oxygen concentration,
CO concentration (for gaseous fuels), and smoke-spot number (for
liquid fuels).  Also observe the flame and record any changes
in its condition.
<P>
<LI>Continue to reduce combustion air flow stepwise, until one
of these limits is reached:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
a. Unacceptable flame conditions, such as flame impingement on
furnace walls or burner parts, excessive flame carryover, or flame
instability; or
<P>
b. Stack gas CO concentrations greater than 400 ppm; or
<P>
c. Smoking at the stack; or
<P>
d. Equipment-related limitations, such as low windbox/furnace
pressure differential, built in air-flow limits, etc.
<P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<LI>Develop an O2/CO curve (for gaseous fuels) or O2/smoke curve
(for liquid fuels) using the excess oxygen and CO or smoke-spot
number data obtained at each combustion air flow setting.
<P>
<LI>From the curves prepared in Step 6, find the stack-gas oxygen
levels where the CO emissions or smoke-spot number equal the following
values:<P>

</TABLE>
</CENTER>
<P>
 The above conditions are referred to as the CO or smoke thresholds,
or as the minimum excess oxygen level.
<P>
 Compare this minimum value of excess oxygen to the expected value
provided by the combustion unit manufacturer.  If the minimum
level found is substantially higher than the value provided by
the combustion unit manufacturer, burner adjustments can probably
be made to improve fuel and air mixing, thereby allowing operation
with less air.
<P>
<LI>Add 0.5 to 2.0 percent of the minimum excess oxygen level found
in Step 7 and reset burner controls to operate automatically at
this higher stack-gas oxygen level.  This margin above the minimum
oxygen level accounts for fuel variations, variations in atmospheric
conditions, load changes, and nonrepeatability or play in automatic
controls.
<P>
<LI>If the load of the combustion unit varies significantly during
normal operation, repeat Steps 1-8 for firing rates that represent
the upper and lower limits of the range of the load.  Because
control adjustments at one firing rate may affect conditions at
other firing rates, it may not be possible to establish the optimum
excess oxygen level at all firing rates.  If this is the case,
choose the burner control settings that give best performance
over the range of firing rates.  If one firing rate predominates,
settings should optimize conditions at that rate.
<P>
<LI>Verify that the new settings can accommodate the sudden load
changes that may occur in daily operation without adverse effects.
 Do this by increasing and decreasing load rapidly while observing
the flame and stack.  If any of the conditions in Step 5 result,
reset the combustion controls to provide a slightly higher level
of excess oxygen at the affected firing rates.  Next, verify these
new recorded at steady-rate operating conditions for future reference.

range.  Since stable or certifiable cylinder gas standards (e.g.
Protocol 1 or NIST traceable) may not be available at the concentrations
required for this test, gas dilution systems may be used, with
District approval, if they are used according to either District
or EPA protocols for the verification of gas dilution systems
in the field.  The CEMS high level calibration gas may be diluted
for the purpose of conducting the low level calibration error
test.

Spike Recovery and Bias Factor Determinations
<P>
Spiking is defined as introducing know concentrations of the pollutant
of interest (gas standard to contain a mixture of NO and NO<SUB>2</SUB> is
representative of the ratio of NO and NO<SUB>2</SUB> in stack gas) and an
appropriate non-reactive, non-condensable and non-soluble tracer
gas from a single cylinder (Protocol 1 or NIST traceable to 2
percent analytical accuracy if no Protocol 1 is available) near
the probe and upstream of any sample conditioning systems, at
a flow rate not to exceed 10 percent of the total sample gas flow
rate.  The purpose of the 10 percent limitation is to ensure that
the gas matrix (water, CO<SUB>2</SUB>, particulates, interferences) is essentially
the same as the stack gas alone.  The tracer gas is monitored
in real time and the ratio of the monitored concentration to the
certified concentration in the cylinder is the dilution factor.
 The expected pollutant concentration (dilution factor times the
certified pollutant concentration in the cylinder) is compared
to the monitored pollutant concentration. 
<P>
<I>High Level Spike Recovery/Bias Factor Determination</I>
<P>
The high level spike recovery/bias factor determination is used
when it is technologically not possible to certify the CEMS per
the standard RECLAIM requirements.  The spiking facility/interface
shall be a permanently installed part of the CEMS sample acquisition
system and accessible to District staff as well as the Facility
Permit holder.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
a. Spike the sample to the CEMS with a calibration standard containing
the pollutant of interest and CO or other non-soluble, non-reacting
alternative tracer gas (alternative tracer gas) at a flow rate
not to exceed 10 percent of the CEMS sampling flow rate and of
such concentrations as to produce an expected 40-80 percent of
full scale span for the pollutant of interest and a quantifiable
concentration of CO (or alternative tracer gas) that is at least
a factor of 10 higher than expected in the unspiked stack gas.
 The calibration standards for both pollutant of interest and
CO (or alternative tracer gas) must meet RECLAIM requirements
specified in Attachment A.
<P>
b. Monitor the CO (or alternative tracer gas) using an appropriate
continuous (or semi-continuous if necessary) monitor meeting the

gas.  Sampling times should be sufficiently long to mitigate response
time and averaging effects. 
<P>
d. For each run, the average CEMS reading must be between 40 percent
full scale span and 80 percent full scale span.  If not, adjust
spiking as necessary and continue runs; but expected spike must

by the CEMS. 
<P>
e. Calculate the spike recovery for both the pollutant and the
CO (or alternative tracer gas) for each run by first averaging
the pre- and post-spike values for each run and subtracting that
value from the spiked value to yield nine values for recovered
spikes.
<P>
f. Using the CO (or alternative tracer gas) spike recovery values
for each run and the certified CO (or alternative tracer gas)
concentration, calculate the dilution ratio for each run.  Multiply
the certified pollutant concentration by the dilution factor for
each run to determine the expected diluted pollutant concentrations.
 Using the expected diluted concentrations as the &quot;reference
method&quot; value calculate the Relative Accuracy as specified
in Appendix A.  The RA shall be &lt;/= 20 percent.  Determine

<P>This chapter describes the methodologies for measuring and reporting emissions from large sources.  For this category, the Facility Permit holder shall use Continuous Emissions Monitoring System (CEMS) or elect to use CPMS to measure NOx emissions.  The focal point shall be the emission factor (during the interim period only, January 1, 1994 to December 31, 1994 for Cycle 1 facilities and July 1, 1994 to July 1, 1995 for Cycle 2 facilities), concentration limit, or equipment-specific emission rate.  Mass emissions shall be estimated by using the emission factor (e.g. lb/mm Btu), or concentration limit (e.g. ppmv converted to lb/mm Btu) and a throughput rate (typically fuel consumption adjusted for heating value).
<P>Measurement and reporting requirements apply to variables used to calculate the NOx emissions.  These measured and process variables are found in Table 3-A.  The reporting variables are found in Table 3-B.
<P>In accordance with Rule 2012, the Facility Permit will specify either a concentration limit or an emission rate.  One or more measured variables necessary to substantiate the equipment-specific emission rate shall be monitored and recorded.  These measured variables are listed in Table 3-A.  For sources subject to a concentration limit, only fuel usage or throughput is required to be measured by dedicated fuel meters or by any devices approved by the Executive Officer to be equivalent in accuracy, reliability, reproducibility, and timeliness.
<P>Tables 3-C through 3-F list the rule-specific concentration limits, the emission fee billing factors, the unregulated default control efficiencies, and the standard oxygen concentrations.
<P>The criteria for determining large source category is found in Table 1-B.
<P> Starting January 1, 1994 (Cycle 1 facilities) and starting July 1, 1994 (Cycle 2 facilities), large-source NOx emissions shall be allowed to use an interim reporting procedure to calculate and record on a monthly basis according to the requirements specified in Chapter 3, Subdivision D, Paragraph 1, and Chapter 3, Subdivision G, Paragraph 2 &quot;Large Sources - Continuous Process Monitoring System (CPMS)&quot; .  On and after January 1, 1995 (Cycle 1 facilities) and July 1, 1995 (Cycle 2 facilities), the Facility Permit holder of each large source shall  report consistent with all other applicable requirements specified in this chapter. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>A. - GENERAL REQUIREMENTS</B>
<P><OL><LI> The Facility Permit holder of a large NOx source who has elected to use a concentration limit shall comply with any one of the following, in ppmv and over any continuous 60 minutes:
<P>a. The Facility Permit holder shall be allowed to use the emission factors and/or control efficiencies listed in Tables 3-D, and 3-E or Table 1 of Rule 2002 and apply methodology presented in Subdivision 3, Paragraph C to derive a corresponding concentration limit; or
<P>b. If there is no applicable concentration limit and/or control efficiency, then the Facility Permit holder shall be allowed to request a manufacturer's guaranteed emission factors and/or control efficiency or a manufacturer's guaranteed concentration limit as part of the Facility Permit application; or
<P>c. The Facility Permit holder shall be allowed to use applicable rule-specific concentration limit found in Table 3-C; or
<P>d. The Facility Permit holder shall be allowed to use any other concentration limit as approved by the Executive Officer according to guidelines set forth in this chapter.
<P><LI> The Facility Permit holder of a large NOx source who has elected to use a concentration limit shall calculate the mass emissions according to the methodology specified in  Chapter 3, Subdivision D, Paragraph 2, Subparagraph a.
<P><LI> The Facility Permit holder of a large NOx source who has elected to use an emission rate shall apply the methodology specified in Chapter 5 to derive an acceptable emission rate.
<P><LI> The Facility Permit holder of a large NOx source who has elected to use an emission rate shall calculate the emissions according to the methodology specified in  Chapter 3, Subdivision D, Paragraph 2, Subparagraph b.
<P><LI>The Facility Permit holder of each equipment shall measure and record fuel usage and one or more parametric variables in Table 3-A in order to substantiate the equipment-specific emission rate.  As part of the Facility Permit application review, the Executive Officer shall modify the list of Facility Permit holder-selected variables.
<P><LI> Fuel flow measuring devices used for obtaining stack flow in conjunction with F-factors shall be tested as installed for relative accuracy using reference methods to determine stack flow.
<P> If the flow device manufacturer has a method or device that permits the fuel flow measuring device to be tested as installed for relative accuracy, the Facility Permit holder shall request approval from the Executive Officer.  Approval will be granted in cases where the Facility Permit holder can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Executive Officer that no suitable testing location exists in the exhaust stacks or ducts and that it would be an inordinate cost burden to modify the exhaust stack configuration to provide a suitable testing location.  The method or device used for relative accuracy testing shall be traceable to NIST standards.  This method shall be used only if the Facility Permit holder can prove to the Executive Officer that the natural gas, fuel oil, or other fuels have stable F-factors and gross heating values, or if the Facility Permit holder measures the F-factor and gross heating value of the fuel.  A stable F-factor is defined as not varying by more than + or - 2.5% from the constant value used for F-factor.  For the fuels listed in 40 CFR 60, Appendix A, Method 19, Table 19-1, the F-factors are assumed to be stable at the value cited in Table 19-1.  Any F-factor cited in Regulation XX shall supersede the F-factor in Table 19-1.  For fuels not listed in the citations above, but which the Facility Permit holder can demonstrate that the source-specific F-factor meets the same stability criteria, periodic reporting of F-factor may be accepted and the adequacy of the frequency of analyses shall be demonstrated by the Facility Permit operator such that the probability that any given analysis will differ from the previous analysis by more than 5% (relative to the previous analysis) or less than 5%.  Analysis records shall be maintained, including all charts and laboratory notes.

<P><LI>Fuel meters or any devices approved by the Executive Officer to be equivalent in accuracy, reliability, reproducibility, and timeliness, shall be non-resettable and tamper proof.  The seals installed by the manufacturer shall be intact to prove the integrity of the measuring device.
<P> Meters which are unsealed for maintenance or repairs shall be resealed by an authorized manufacturers representative.

<P><LI> The Facility Permit holder of each large NOx source shall monitor, report, and maintain the records on a monthly basis the type and quantity of fuel burned, in units of millions of standard cubic feet per month (mmscf per month) for gaseous fuels or thousand gallons per month (mgal per month) for liquid fuels, expressed to at least three significant figures.

<P><LI> Monthly NOx mass emissions shall be reported to the District's NOx Central Station Computer according to the requirements specified in Chapter 3, Subdivision G.</ol>

<P><B><LI> Performance Standard</B>
<P>All CPMS at each equipment shall, at a minimum, be able to measure the fuel usage once every fifteen minutes.  Such measured data shall be accumulated and recorded to represent the monthly fuel usage as specified in Paragraphs B.3.
<P><B><LI> Information Required for Each Monthly Interval</B>
<P>All CPMS at each equipment shall, at a minimum, measure and totalize the following data points for each successive monthly period, expressed to at least three significant figures, and at equally spaced intervals thereafter, except where noted:
<P>a. Fuel usage in units of million standard cubic feet per month (mmscf/mo) for gaseous fuels, or thousand gallons per month (mgal/mo) for liquid fuels.  Alternatively, the fuel usage  may be calculated from stack gas volumetric flow rates totalized over a month and oxygen concentration, in which case the Facility Permit holder shall measure:
<P><blockquote>i. Oxygen concentration in the stack in units of percent if required for calculation of the stack gas flow rate.
<P>ii. Volumetric flow rate of stack gases in units of dry standard cubic feet per month.  Standard gas conditions are defined as a temperature at 68&#176;F and one atmosphere of pressure.</blockquote>
<P>b. One or more process variables specified in Table 3-A, if the Facility Permit holder elects for an equipment-specific emission rate.</ol>

<B>C. -  CONCENTRATION LIMIT CALCULATION</B>
<P>Pursuant to the election condition requirements in Rule 2012 (f), the Facility Permit holder shall use the equation provided in this section to calculate the concentration limit.  Equation 15 applies to the Facility Permit holder requesting that the Emission Fee Billing factor in Table 3-D, the emission factor specified in Table 1, Rule 2002 - Baselines and Rates of Reduction for NOx/SOx and/or the control efficiency in Table 3-E be converted into a concentration limit.

<P>b. The diameter of each orifice shall be measured using the method recommended by the orifice plate manufacture.
<P>c. The flatness of the orifice plate shall be checked according to the orifice plate manufacturer's instructions.  The departure from flatness of an orifice plate shall not exceed 0.010 inches per inch of dam height (D-d/2) along any diameter.  Here D is the inside pipe diameter and d is the orifice diameter at its narrowest constriction.
<P>d. The pressure gauge or other device measuring pressure drop across the orifice shall be calibrated against a manometer, and shall be replaced if it deviates more than &#177;2 percent across the range.
<P>e. The surface roughness shall be measured using the method recommended by the orifice plate manufacturer.  The surface roughness of an orifice plate shall not exceed 50 micro inches.
<P>f. The upstream edge of the measuring orifice shall be square and sharp so that it shall not show a beam of light when checked with an orifice gauge.
<P>g. In centering orifice plates, the orifice shall be concentric with the inside of the meter tube or fitting.  The concentricity shall be maintained within 3 percent of the inside diameter of the tube or fitting along all diameters.

<P><OL><LI> For each large source or large sources using a common fuel meter or equivalent monitoring device, the Facility Permit holder shall provide substitute data as described below whenever a valid month of fuel usage data or the amount of production or process feed has not been obtained and recorded.  Alternative data is acceptable for substitution if the Facility Permit holder can demonstrate to the Executive Officer that the alternative system is fully operational during meter down time and within +or- 2% accuracy.
<P><LI> Whenever data from the process monitor is not available or not recorded for the affected equipment or when the equipment is not operated within the parameter range specified in the Facility Permit, the Facility Permit holder shall calculate substitute data for each month according to the following procedures.
<P>a. For a missing data period less than or equal to one month, substitute data shall be calculated using the large source(s) average monthly fuel usage for the previous 12 months.
<P>b. For a missing data period greater than one month, substitute data shall be calculated using the large source(s) highest monthly fuel usage data for the previous 12 months.
<P>c. For a missing data period greater than two months, or if the facility has no records, substitute data shall be calculated using 100 percent uptime during the substitution period and the large source(s) maximum rated capacity and uncontrolled emission factor for each month of missing data.</OL>
<P><B>J.  FUEL METER SHARING</B>
<P><OL><LI> A single totalizing fuel meter shall be allowed to measure the cumulative fuel usage for more than one equipment in a large NOx source provided that each equipment has the same concentration limit, emission rate, or emission factor as specified in the Facility Permit and that any equipment in a large NOx source does not use the annual heat input in order to be classified from a major source to a large source.
<P><LI> One or more pieces of equipment in a large NOx source shall be allowed to share the fuel totalizing meter provided that each equipment elects for the same concentration limit, emission rate, or emission factor as specified in the Facility Permit.
<P><LI> Fuel meter sharing for the interim period shall be allowed for those equipment in a large NOx source with the same emission factor, emission rate, or concentration limit.</OL>

<BR>
<P>Process units are one or more pieces of equipment which are listed in Table 1-C.  The process units emissions are reported quarterly as shown in Table 4-A and based primarily on fuel consumption or operating time in conjunction with an emission factor.  The requirements and procedures for an emission factor and election conditions for an alternative emission factor shall apply to process units.  For equipment designated as exempt from permit in Rule 219 emissions shall be determined according to the methodology specified in this Chapter 4, subdivision F.
<P>Process units and equipment exempt from permit as designated in Rule 219 may share fuel meters if each equipment has the same emission factor.  This chapter also includes the equations describing the methods used to calculate NOx process unit emissions and the reporting procedures.  The interim reporting period does not apply to process units since existing fuel metering equipment or timers  shall be used starting January 1, 1994 for Cycle 1 facilities and July 1, 1994 for Cycle 2 facilities.
<P><B>A. MONITORING, REPORTING, AND RECORDKEEPING
<BR>REQUIREMENTS</B>
<P><OL><LI> The category-specific starting emission factor found in Table 1 of Rule 2002 - Allocations for Oxides of Nitrogen (NOx) and Sulfur (SOx) shall be used for quantifying quarterly mass emissions for a NOx process unit.
<P><LI> The Facility Permit holder of a process unit may request a category-specific emission rate that is reliable, accurate, and representative for purposes of calculating NOx emissions.  The emission rate shall be determined based on the source testing protocol specified in Chapter 5.
<P><LI> The Facility Permit holder of a process unit  shall calculate the mass emissions according to the methodology specified in Paragraph 4.B.2. (totalizing fuel meters) or 4.B.3.a. (timers).
<P><LI> The Facility Permit holder of each NOx Process Unit shall use a totalizing fuel meter or timer as applicable, as specified in the Facility Permit for each NOx process unit to measure and report the variables listed in Tables 4-A and 4-B, respectively, for each NOx process unit. 
<P> <LI> Fuel flow measuring devices used for obtaining stack flow in conjunction with F-factors shall be tested as installed for relative accuracy using reference methods to determine stack flow.
<P> If the flow device manufacturer has a method or device that permits the fuel flow measuring device to be tested as installed for relative accuracy, the Facility Permit holder shall request approval from the Executive Officer to use the manufacturer's method.  Approval will be granted in cases where the Facility Permit holder can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Executive Officer that no suitable testing location exists in the exhaust stacks or ducts and that it would be an inordinate cost burden to modify the exhaust stack configuration to provide a suitable testing location.  The method or device used for relative accuracy testing shall be traceable to NIST standards.  This method shall be used only if natural gas, fuel oil, or other fuels can be shown, by the Facility Permit holder to have stable F-factors and gross heating values, or if the Facility Permit holder measures the F-factor and gross heating value of the fuel.  A stable F-Factor is defined as not varying by more than +/-2.5% from the constant value used for F-Factor.  For the fuels listed in 40 CFR 60, Appendix A, Method 19, Table 19-1, the F-Factors are assumed to be stable at the value cited in Table 19-1.  Any F-Factor cited in Regulation XX shall supersede the f-Factor in Table 19-1.  For fuels not listed in the citations above, but which the Facility Permit holder can demonstrate that the source-specific F-Factor meets the same stability criteria, periodic reporting of F-Factor may be accepted and the adequacy of the frequency of analyses shall be demonstrated by the facility such that the probability that any given analysis will differ from the previous analysis by more than 5% (relative to the previous analysis) is less than 5%.  Analysis records shall be maintained, including all charts and laboratory notes.
<P><LI> Fuel meters and/or timers have to be non-resettable and tamper-proof.  They have to have seals installed by the meter/timer manufacturer to prove the integrity of the measuring device.
<P> Meters which are unsealed for maintenance or repairs shall be resealed by an authorized manufacturers representative.
<P><LI> The Facility Permit holder of each NOx process unit shall monitor, report, and maintain the following records on a quarterly basis:
<P>a. Type and quantity of fuel burned, in units of millions of standard cubic feet per quarter (mmscf per quarter) for gaseous fuels or thousand gallons per quarter (mgal per quarter) for liquid fuels, expressed to  at least three significant figures; or
<P>b. Total hours of operation; and
<P>c. Production/Processing/Feed rate.
<P><LI> The Facility Permit holder of each NOx process unit shall also provide any other data necessary for calculating the emission rates of nitrogen oxides as determined by the Executive Officer.</OL>
<P><B>B. EMISSION CALCULATION FOR REPORTING DATA</B>
<P><B><OL><LI> Quarterly Mass Emissions for Interim Periods </B>
<P> Pursuant to Rule 2012 (f) (1), between January 1, 1994 and December 31, 1994 for Cycle 1 facilities, and between July 1, 1994 and June 30, 1995 for Cycle 2 facilities, the monthly emission of each process unit shall be calculated and recorded according to:

<P> Eip =  <IMG SRC="sum.gif" WIDTH = 31 HEIGHT = 27 ALT="Undisplayed Graphic"> d<SUB>j</SUB>  x  EF<SUB>sj</SUB>        (Eq.22)
<P>  <Blockquote>j=1</Blockquote>
<P>  where:
<P> Eip = The quarterly mass emission of nitrogen oxides for interim period (lb/quarter).
<P> dj = The quarterly  fuel usage for each type of fuel recorded as mmscf/quarter or mgal/quarter).
<P> EF<SUB>sj </SUB>= The starting emission factor used to calculate unit emissions in the initial allocation, as specified in Table 1 of Rule 2002 - Allocations for Oxides of Nitrogen (NOx) and Sulfur (SOx) (lb/mmscf, lb/mgal).
<P> r = The number of different types of fuel consumed per quarter.
<P> j = Each type of fuel.0
<P>_________________________________________________________________________
<P><P>Example calculation: Boiler burning natural gas, rated 6 mmBtu/hr, in compliance with Rule 1146 starting year 1994 
<BR>      Emission factor = 49.18 lb/mmscf 
<BR>      Quarterly fuel usage =  1.1 mmscf per quarter
<BR>
<BR> E<SUB>ip</SUB> =    (49.18) x (1.1)
<BR>  <Blockquote>= 54.1 lb/quarter</Blockquote>

<P>Applicable emission factor is also found in Volume II - Supporting Documentation, Appendix II-F - Methodology for NOx and SOx Starting and Ending Allocation Factors, Table 2-4 - Startpoint 1994 Emission Factors for Nitrogen Oxides.
<P>_________________________________________________________________________
<P><B><LI> Totalizing Fuel Meter-Based Emission Calculation</B>
<P> The Facility permit holder shall use an emission factor shown in Table 1 of Rule 2002 or in Table 3-D or an approved equipment-specific or category-specific emission rate for each affected NOx Process Unit to calculate the quarterly emissions according to:
<P><Blockquote>   r</Blockquote>

<P> where:
<P> E<SUB>k </SUB>= The quarterly emissions of nitrogen oxides (lb/quarter).
<P> d<SUB>j</SUB> = The quarterly fuel usage for each type of fuel recorded by the fuel totalizer (mmscf/quarter or mgal/quarter)
<P> EF<SUB>j</SUB>= The emission factor specified in Table 1 of Rule 2002 - Allocations for Oxides of Nitrogen (NOx) and Sulfur (SOx) or specified in Table 3-D (lb/mmscf, lb/mgal).  The emission factor found in Table 1 of Rule 2002 may or may not include the appropriate control efficiency.
<P> V<SUB>j </SUB>= The higher heating value of each type of fuel (mmBtu/mmscf or mmBtu/mgal) determined by the Facility Permit holder or assigned from Table 3-D.
<P> ER<SUB>j </SUB>= The equipment-specific or category-specific emission rate; fuel-specific emission rate requested by the Facility Permit holder (lb/mmBtu).
<P> r = The number of different types of fuel consumed per month.
<P><B><LI> Timer-Based Emission Calculations</B>
<P>a. If the NOx process unit is equipped with a timer, the quarterly fuel usage shall be estimated according to Eq. 25, 26 27, and 28 and the quarterly emissions for each affected NOx process unit shall be calculated according to Eq. 23 and 24.
<P>If the NOx process unit does not measure fuel with a totalizing fuel meter, the quarterly fuel consumption for each affected equipment shall be estimated according to:
<P> d = d<SUB>pu </SUB>x (H/H<SUB>pu</SUB>) (Eq.25)
<P>  where: 
<P> d = The estimated quarterly fuel consumption of an affected NOx process unit without a dedicated fuel meter (mmscf/quarter or mgal/quarter).
<P> d<SUB>pu</SUB> = The quarterly fuel consumption of all NOx process units at the facility (mmscf/quarter or mgal/quarter).
<P> H = The quarterly heat input of an affected equipment without a dedicated fuel meter (mmBtu/quarter).
<P> H<SUB>pu</SUB> = The quarterly heat input of all NOx process units at the facility (mmBtu/quarter).
<P>_________________________________________________________
<P><P>Example Calculation:
<BR>  d<SUB>pu</SUB> = 1,587 mmscf/quarter
<BR>  H = 5,400 mmBtu/quarter
<BR>  H<SUB>pu</SUB> = 27,000 mmBtu/quarter
<BR>  d = d<SUB>pu</SUB> x (H/H<SUB>pu</SUB>)
<BR>  d = 1,587 mmscf/qtr x (5,400 mmBtu/qtr
<BR>     - 27,000 mmBtu/qtr)
<BR>  d = 317.4 mmscf/qtr
<P>_________________________________________________________
<P> The quarterly fuel usage for all the NOx process units at the facility (d<SUB>pu</SUB>) shall be calculated according to:
<P> d<SUB>pu</SUB> = d<SUB>fac</SUB>  -  (d<SUB>large</SUB>  +  d<SUB>major</SUB>) (Eq.26)

<P>This chapter contains the source testing frequency requirements for large sources.  Also included are the source testing methods and procedures necessary for a Facility Permit holder of a large NO<SUB>x</SUB> source or process unit to establish an alternative emission factor.  The Facility Permit holder of a large source or process unit may use a statistically equivalent methodology upon approval by the Executive Officer.  Statistically equivalent methodologies shall be submitted to the Federal Environmental Protection Agency as an amendment to the State Implementation Plan (SIP).
<P>Large sources and process units differ in the methodology used to evaluate source test data and determine the validity of the results.
<P>Every large NO<SUB>x</SUB> source shall be source tested no later than December 31, 1996 for Cycle 1 facilities and June 30, 1997 for Cycle 2 facilities, and every three years thereafter.  In lieu of submitting the first source test report, the Facility Permit holder may submit the results of a source test not more than three years old which meets the requirements of this Chapter.  The Facility Permit holder of a large source or NO<SUB>x</SUB> process unit shall substantiate the emission rate according to the requirements set forth in this chapter.
<P><B>A. Test Methods</B>
<P> The Facility Permit holders of major or large NO<SUB>x</SUB> sources shall source test each equipment using the following test methods and procedures referenced in the District Source Test Manual and 40 CFR Part 60, Appendix A:
<P><OL><LI> Determinations and measurements prior to sampling:
<P>a. Method 1.1 - sample points, stacks greater than 12 in. diameter
<P>b. Method 1.2 - sample points, stacks less than 12 in. diameter
<P>c. Method 2.1 - flow rate, stacks greater than 12 in. diameter
<P>d. Method 2.2 - flow rate, direct measurement
<P>e. Method 2.3 - flow rate, stacks less than 12 in. diameter 
<P>f. Method 4.1 - moisture
<P>g. EPA Method 19 - calculated flow
<P>h. Direct in-stack instrumental flow measuring device
<P><LI> Nitrogen oxides concentration:
<P>a. Method 100.1 - nitrogen oxides
<P>b. Method 7.1 - nitrogen oxides
<P><LI> Oxygen concentration:
<P>a. Method 3.1 - molecular weight and excess air
<P>b. Method 100.1 - oxygen
<P><LI>[Reserved for methodology to measure NO<SUB>x</SUB> emissions from process units.]
</OL>
<P><B>B. Number of tests</B>
<P> To establish an alternative emission factor, a minimum of three separate tests shall be run at each condition or throughput that the equipment is expected to operate.  Each set of tests should cover the different operating conditions of the cycle in sequence.  The cycle would then have to be repeated in the same manner for the next set of tests.  To comply with the source testing requirements on Table 5-B, one test at each condition or throughput level shall be run.
<P><B>C. Testing frequency</B>
<P> The operator of all NO<SUB>x</SUB> sources shall source test or tune-up their equipment according to the schedule in Table 5-B.
<P><B>D. Sampling time and test procedures </B>
<P><OL><LI> For boilers, heaters, I.C. engines, turbines - tests should be conducted at low, mid and high load.  The same sequence of operating conditions should be followed for each separate test, with each test condition being monitored for a minimum of 15 minutes.
<P><LI> Furnaces, kilns, dryers, calciners and ovens, operating continuously, have to be monitored for a minimum of 30 minutes, for each testing condition.  For non-continuous operations (i.e., batch) samples must be taken for each phase of the operation (i.e. metal furnace charging, fluxing, melting, sweating and taping), for a minimum of 15 minutes or as long as the phase lasts.  Data should be submitted on the time that it takes to complete each phase, and the emissions for the total cycle should be calculated based on the time required to complete each phase and the emissions measured during the corresponding phase.
<P><LI> Incinerators and afterburners are to be monitored for a minimum of 15 minutes at each operating temperature and at each flow rate.
<P><LI> Engine test cells are to be monitored over the total cycle if it lasts less than 30 minutes.  Otherwise, monitor for 15 minutes at each engine test condition, or the total time if less than 15 minutes.
<P><LI> For the equipment not included above, an individual test plan must be submitted for approval by the Executive Officer.  This plan must include justification on how the measurements will quantify equipment emissions.</OL>
<P><B>E. Guidelines for Testing to Establish Emission Rate for Large Sources</B>
<P><OL><LI> For large sources the Facility Permit holder may elect to comply with an equipment-specific concentration limit, equipment-specific emission factor* or establish an average emission rate that accurately represents the emissions from the source over the range of operation under which the testing was done.  The average emission rate shall be used to determine compliance with the facility's annual emission cap.
<P><LI> The criterion for acceptability of the emission rate shall be a 95% confidence interval that the tested emission  rates will be within 20% of the average emission rate.  If a single average emission rate does not meet this criterion over the entire range of operation, the  District will allow up to three emission rates to cover a &quot;normal operating range&quot;, a &quot;high operating rate and a &quot;low operating range,&quot; respectively.  The &quot;normal operating range&quot; shall cover operations for at least 80% of the entire operating time.  The average emission rate at the entire range or at respective low, normal, and high operating range shall be determined according to:

<P><LI>The Facility Permit holder shall identify the monitoring parameter(s) to establish the allowable operating range of process variables to be specified in the Facility Permit for the affected sources from Table 3-A in Chapter 3 for large sources.  This list is not intended to be all inclusive and the Facility Permit holder may identify additional parameters not listed in Table 3-A.  The test conditions are typically related to percent of load; however, the Facility Permit holder may propose any other monitoring parameters as deemed necessary and propose the operating range of these monitoring parameters to ensure that the average emission rate(s) and control efficiency continue to fall within the confidence criterion.
<P><LI> The Facility Permit holder shall conduct source tests to verify the amended average emission rate according to the methods identified in Chapter 5, Subdivision A, or statistically equivalent methodologies.  The testing shall be done in three phases.
<P><LI> Phase I testing shall constitute &quot;normal operating range&quot; testing.  From the &quot;normal operating range&quot; the average emission rate shall be calculated by using the tested emission rates.  To determine a tested emission rate the Facility Permit holder shall test at four conditions that span the &quot;normal operating range&quot;.  At each condition an emission rate shall be tested three times, but not consecutively.  If there are two (or more) monitoring parameters the Facility Permit holder shall identify the primary parameter (i.e. having the greatest effect on emission rate variation) and secondary monitoring parameter(s), (i.e. having the least effect on emission rate variation).  The Facility Permit holder shall test at four conditions that span the &quot;normal operating range&quot; of the primary monitoring parameter and at each primary monitoring parameter condition, test at least two secondary monitoring parameter test conditions that span the &quot;normal range&quot; of the secondary operating monitoring parameter(s).  Each test shall be conducted for a period of at least 30 minutes.  On this basis, the average emission rate and the 95% confidence interval shall be calculated.  If the 95% confidence interval meets the 20% criterion, the unit shall be allowed to use this rate for &quot;normal operating range&quot; upon the approval of the Executive Officer.  If the criterion is not met the Facility Permit holder shall reduce the &quot;normal operating range&quot; and conduct any additional tests to provide the required data sets.
<P><LI> Phase II testing shall constitute &quot;high operating range&quot; testing.  The Facility Permit holder shall test at two conditions that span the &quot;high operating range&quot;.  At each condition an emission rate shall be tested three times, but not consecutively.  Multiple operating conditions shall be addressed in a similar manner as described for Phase I testing.  The values from these tests shall be added to the data from &quot;normal operating range&quot; testing and a test average emission rate and test 95% confidence interval shall be generated.  If the 95% confidence interval for the test average emission rate meets the 20% criterion, then the test average emission rate shall become the allowed rate for both the &quot;normal and high&quot; operating ranges.  If the criterion is not met, then a &quot;high operating range&quot; average emission rate and 95% confidence interval shall be calculated from the data.  If the 20% criterion is met then the facility shall use this as a &quot;high operating range&quot; average emission factor.  If the 20% criterion is not met then tests at two additional conditions within the high range shall be conducted and the 20% criterion again applied to the &quot;high operating range&quot; data set only.  If the 20% criterion is still not met, then the &quot;high operating range&quot; shall be reduced.
<P><LI> Phase III testing shall constitute &quot;low operating range&quot; testing.  This Phase testing is carried out in the same manner as Phase II testing.  If a single &quot;normal/high operating range&quot; emission rate has been determined from Phase II testing, then all of the data for &quot;normal and high&quot; operating range testing shall be included.  If not, then only data from the &quot;normal operating range&quot; testing shall be included to create the &quot;test average emission rate&quot;.  The same acceptance criteria apply as specified under Phase II testing.
<P><LI> If the emission rate in each phase complies with the Confidence Interval, the Facility Permit holder may use up to three average emission rates, each representing a different phase, provided that load duration for each specified phase emission rate is monitored and recorded at the facility.</OL>

<BR>
<BR>The proposed data set failed the confidence interval test, therefore the Facility Permit holder shall select low, normal, or high  range, whichever is representative of their typical operating range according to Paragraphs 6.A.5.c.d.e.f. or g.

<P><B>F. Guidelines for Testing to Establish Emission Rate for process units</B>
<P><OL><LI> For process units the Facility Permit holder shall comply with an average emission rate that accurately represents the emissions from the source or the unit over the range of operation under which the testing was done.  The average emission rate shall be used to determine compliance with the facility's annual emission cap.
<P><LI> The average emission rate shall be calculated by using tested emission rates from a &quot;normal operating range&quot;.  The &quot;normal operating range&quot; shall cover operations for at least 80% of the entire operating time.  The criterion for acceptability of these tested emission rates shall be an 95% confidence interval that the tested emission rates will be within 25% of the average emission rate.  The average emission rate over the &quot;normal operating range shall be determined according to:

<P>   ERc = The average emission rate (lb/mmBtu) determined over the entire &quot;normal operating range&quot;.
<P>   C.I. = The confidence interval with 95 % confidence level (%).
<P><LI> The Facility Permit holder shall identify the source test parameter(s) to establish the boundaries of operating conditions for the affected sources from Table 4-A in Chapter 4 for process units.  This list is not intended to be all inclusive and the Facility Permit holder may identify additional source test parameters not listed in Table 4-A.  The test conditions are typically related to percent of load; however, the Facility Permit holder may propose any other source test parameters as deemed necessary and propose the operating range of these source test parameters to ensure that the average emission rate(s) continue to fall within the confidence criterion.
<P><LI> The Facility Permit holder shall conduct source tests to verify the amended average emission rate according to the methods identified in Chapter 5, Subdivision A, or statistically equivalent methodologies.  The testing shall be done over the &quot;normal operating range&quot;.
<P><LI> From the &quot;normal operating range&quot; the average emission rate shall be calculated by using the tested emission rates.  To determine a tested emission rate, the Facility Permit holder shall test at four conditions that span the &quot;normal operating range&quot;.  At each condition an emission rate shall be tested three times, but not consecutively.  If there are two (or more) source test parameters the Facility Permit holder shall identify the primary source test parameter (i.e. having the greatest effect on emission rate variation) and secondary source test parameter(s), (i.e. having the least effect on emission rate variation).  The Facility Permit holder shall test at four conditions that span the &quot;normal operating range&quot; of the primary source test parameter and at each primary source test parameter condition, test at least two secondary source test parameter test conditions that span the &quot;normal range&quot; of the secondary operating source test parameter(s).  Each test shall be conducted for a period of at least 30 minutes.  On this basis, the average emission rate and the 95% confidence interval shall be calculated.  If the 95% confidence interval meets the 25% criterion, the unit shall be allowed to use this rate for &quot;normal operating range&quot; upon the approval of the Executive Officer.  If the criterion is not met the Facility Permit holder shall reduce the &quot;normal operating range&quot; and conduct any additional tests to provide the required data sets.</OL>

<BODY>
<P>
<I>(Adopted October 15, 1993)(Amended December 7, 1995)(Amended July 12, 1996)</I>
<P>
<P><B>RULE 2015 - BACKSTOP PROVISIONS</B>
<P><B>(a) Purpose</B>
<BR> This rule specifies RECLAIM program auditing requirements and backstop provisions.
<P><B>(b) Program Audits</B>
<P><OL>
<LI> Annual Audits
<BR> The District will conduct an annual program audit.  The annual audit will assess:
<P>(A) emission reductions;
<P>(B) per capita exposure to air pollution;
<P>(C) facilities permanently ceasing operation of all sources;
<P>(D) job impacts;
<P>(E) average annual price of each type of RTC;
<P>(F) availability of RTCs;
<P>(G) toxic risk reductions;
<P>(H) New Source Review permitting activity;
<P>(I) compliance issues;
<P>(J) emissions trends/seasonal fluctuations; and
<P>(K) emission control requirement impacts on stationary sources in the program compared to other stationary sources identified in the AQMP.
<P> As part of the first three annual program audits, the Executive Officer will review the effectiveness of enforcement and protocols and recommend revisions to the protocols to achieve improved measurement and enforcement of RECLAIM emission reductions while minimizing administrative cost to the District and RECLAIM participants.  The first audit will be presented to the Governing Board in a public hearing on or before January 1996, and included henceforth in the District annual performance report to the California legislature.
<P><LI>Mapping of Emissions
<BR> The Executive Officer will maintain, on an quarterly basis, a District-wide map indicating the most current sum of certified emissions.  The information used to maintain the map will be obtained from the Quarterly Certification of Emissions and APEP required of Facility Permit holders pursuant to Rule 2004 - Requirements.
<P><LI> Three-Year Audit
<BR> In 1997, at the close of the third year of trading, the District will conduct or commission a comprehensive audit to evaluate the performance of RECLAIM.  This comprehensive audit will be presented to the Governing Board in a public hearing in the year 1998.  The Governing Board will evaluate the performance of the program against the following criteria:
<P>(A) RECLAIM has produced the emission reductions required;</P>
<P>(B) public health exposure to criteria air pollution has been significantly reduced, and public health exposure to toxics has not significantly increased as a result of RECLAIM;</P>
<P>(C) RECLAIM has not accelerated business shutdowns, job loss or shifts in the occupational structure of the region;</P>
<P>(D) the price of credits and the trading activity in each market has demonstrated adequate supply and demand;</P>
<P>(E) the emission monitoring, recordkeeping, and penalty provisions of RECLAIM have produced a strong compliance program and adequate deterrence of violations;</P>
<P>(F) RECLAIM is consistent with the provisions of the Federal Clean Air Act and the California Clean Air Act;</P>
<P>(G) the emission factors listed in Rule 2002 - Allocations for Oxides of Nitrogen (NOx) and Oxides of Sulfur (SOx), Tables 1 and 2 are consistent with and appropriate for any recent technology advancements;
<P>(H) RECLAIM has not resulted in disproportionate impacts measured in terms of required emission reductions, on stationary sources in the program, compared to other stationary sources identified in the AQMP;
<P>(I) whether RECLAIM should include a broad spectrum of sources, including mobile, area and stationary; and
<P>(J) control technology has advanced as much as projected under the AQMP.
<P><LI> Reports to the Governing Board
<BR> The Hearing Board will present a written report to the District Governing Board regarding any increases in annual Allocations issued pursuant to permit appeals.  The Executive Officer will report to the District Governing Board, any recommendations necessary to maintain equivalency.  These reports shall be incorporated into the Annual Program Audit Report prepared pursuant to Rule 2015(b)(1).  The Executive Officer will propose to the Governing Board, any AQMP amendments necessary to make up for any shortfall resulting from adjustments to Allocations issued pursuant to Hearing Board appeals.  In addition, the Executive Officer will propose to the Governing Board rule amendments to adjust RECLAIM Allocations if the Hearing Board issues Allocation adjustments that create a shortfall and are of a type which, if made by the Executive Officer during the issuance of initial Facility Permits, would have resulted in altered Allocations and rates of reduction for RECLAIM facilities.
<P><LI> Program Amendment
<BR> The District reserves the right to amend the program pursuant to program <!--re-->evaluations.  Nothing in District rules shall be construed to limit the District's authority to condition, limit, suspend or terminate any RTCs or the authorization to emit which a Facility Permit represents.
<P><LI> Should the average RTC price be determined, pursuant to Rule 2015 (b)(1)(E), to have exceeded $15,000 per ton, within six months of the determination thereof, the Executive Officer shall submit to the Air Resources Board and the Environmental Protection Agency the results of an evaluation and review of the compliance and enforcement aspects of the RECLAIM program, including the deterrent effect of Rule 2004 paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(4).  This review shall be in addition to the audits to be preformed pursuant to Rule 2015.  The evaluation shall include, but not be limited to, an assessment of the rates of compliance with applicable emission caps, an assessment of the rate of compliance with monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting requirements, an assessment of the ability of the South Coast Air Quality Management District to obtain appropriate penalties in cases of noncompliance, and an assessment of whether the program provides appropriate incentives to comply.  The Executive Officer shall submit, with the results of the evaluation, either a recommendation that paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(4) be continued without change, or amendments to the RECLAIM rules setting forth revisions to paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(4) of Rule 2004, if the District's Governing Board determines that revisions are appropriate in light of the results of the evaluation.</OL>

<P><B>(c) AQMP Revisions</B>
<P><OL><LI>In conjunction with the preparation of future AQMP revisions, the Executive Officer shall evaluate the relative potential emission reductions between RECLAIM and non-RECLAIM sources.  Said evaluation shall include consideration of technology advancements and cost-effectiveness.  The Executive Officer will propose to the Governing Board, AQMP revisions which ensure that any increases in Allocations which occur based on any adjustments made pursuant to Rule 2002 (c)(12), Rule 2015 (c)(2), and Rule 2015 (e) shall be offset in the AQMP.</P>

<P><LI> In conjunction with the preparation of future AQMP revisions, the Executive Officer will quantify additional energy demand and the potential need for increased Allocations resulting from implementation of the AQMP.  In accordance with the results of the evaluation, the Executive Officer will propose amendments to Rule 2002, if appropriate, and if amendments are adopted, the Executive Officer will recalculate the Allocations for the year 2003 and subsequent years, and will issue these Allocations to affected electric generating and natural gas distribution facilities.  The Executive Officer's evaluation will establish a need for any such increase in Allocations.
<P><LI>Evaluation of Emission Factors
<P>(A) In conjunction with the preparation of the 1994 AQMP revision, the Executive Officer will complete the evaluation of the ending emission factors found in Tables 1 and 2 of Rule 2002 for the source categories listed in subparagraph (c)(3)(B) of this rule.  The Executive Officer shall take into account the environmental, energy, and economic impacts by each source category in evaluating the achievability of NOx emission reduction technologies for each source category.  In accordance with the results of the evaluation, the Executive Officer will propose amendments to Rule 2002, if appropriate, and if amendments are adopted, the Executive Officer will recalculate and reissue all affected Allocations for RECLAIM facilities in the source categories found in subparagraph (c)(3)(B).  The Executive Officer will propose that any increases in Allocations which occur based on any adjustments made pursuant to this provision shall be offset in the AQMP.
<P>(B) The Executive Officer will reevaluate the ending emission factors for the following source categories in accordance with subparagraph (c)(3)(A):
<BLOCKQUOTE>(i) glass melting furnaces;
<P>(ii) gray cement kilns;
<P>(iii) steel slab reheating, flat rolled product annealing and flat rolled product galvanizing furnaces;
<P>(iv) metal melting furnaces;
<P>(v) hot mix asphalt operations; and
<P>(vi) petroleum coke calciners (NOx only).</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(C) The Executive Officer will reevaluate the accuracy of emission factors for SO3 emissions from petroleum refineries.  In accordance with the results of the evaluation, the Executive Officer will propose amendments to Regulation XX, which may include, but are not limited to:
<BLOCKQUOTE>(i) enhanced monitoring requirements; and
<P>(ii) revision of Allocations.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(D) For gray portland cement kilns, the operator may submit a plan no later than August 1, 1996 for the Executive Officer&#146;s approval which sets forth an alternative to the NOx emissions factor listed in Table 1 of Rule 2002.  The plan shall include:  (i) a demonstration of indirect firing with a low-NOx burner and mid kiln firing NOx reduction technologies; and (ii) emission testing pursuant to District approved methods of such demonstration that shall be completed and submitted to the AQMD by March 1, 1998.  If the demonstration is completed in accordance with the requirements and timeline specified in this subparagraph and the demonstration of this emission factor shows a higher NOx emission factor than the emission factor listed in Table 1 of Rule 2002, the Executive Officer shall change the NOx ending emission factor and reissue all affected Allocations for RECLAIM facilities for gray cement kilns.</OL>
<P><B>(d) Program-Specific Backstops</B>
<P><OL><LI> Based on annual and three-year audits conducted pursuant to paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(3), or upon discovery by the Executive Officer, the Executive Officer will propose that the Governing Board amend the program to address any specific program problems.  In addition, upon discovery that actual emissions from RECLAIM sources exceeded Allocations for any annual period by five percent or greater, the Executive Officer will propose amendment to the RECLAIM program to the Governing Board.  Recommendation may include, but are not limited to:</P>
<P>(A) restricting trading;
<P>(B) requiring pre-approval of trades;
<P>(C) enhanced monitoring;
<P>(D) increasing rates of reduction;
<P>(E) implementing technology-specific emission reductions;
<P>(F) increased penalties.
<P><LI> If such program adjustments are determined to have failed to correct the specific program problems, the Executive Officer shall recommend that the Governing Board, after holding a Public Hearing, consider reinstating all or a portion of the source category-specific emission limits or control measures contained in the then current AQMP in lieu of the RECLAIM program.</OL>
<P><B>(e) Severability, Effect of Judicial Order</B>
<BR>In the event that any portion of this regulation is held by judicial order to be invalid or inapplicable with respect to any source or category of sources, such order shall not affect the validity or applicability of this regulation to any other sources.  In such event, all emission limitation provisions listed in Rule 2001 Table 1 and Table 2, which in the absence of Rule 2001 would be applicable to such source or category of sources, shall become effective immediately; or if the emission limitation provisions require the installation of control equipment, one year after such order.  In addition, the Executive Officer will, as expeditiously as possible, propose rules for adoption by the Governing Board which will require that each source or source category affected by the order comply with emission limitations representing Best Available Retrofit Control Technology, as defined in Health and Safety Code Section 40406.</P></BODY></HTML>

<P> 
<P><B>RULE 1306.</B><B> </B><B>EMISSION CALCULATIONS</B></P>
<P>(a)<B> General</B>
<BR> This rule shall be used as the basis for calculating applicability of Regulation XIII as stated in Rule 1301(b) and Rule 1303.  This rule shall also be the basis for calculating daily emission increases and decreases used for offset requirements and Emission Reduction Credits.
<P>(b) <B>Emission Increases</B>
<BR> Emission increases for new sources and the new total emissions for modified sources shall be calculated, as approved by the Executive Officer or designee, (1) using calendar monthly emissions divided by 30 for determination of the required amount of offsets, and (2) on a pound per day basis for determination of BACT and modeling applicability, from permit conditions which directly limit the emissions or, when no such conditions are imposed, from:
<OL><LI> the maximum rated capacity; and
<P><LI> the maximum daily or monthly hours of operation as applicable; and
<P><LI> the physical characteristics of the material processed.</OL>

<P>(c) <B>Emission Decreases</B>
<BR> Emission decreases from sources which are modified or removed from service shall be the actual emissions reduced to the amount which would be actual if current BACT were applied.  The emission amount shall be calculated from the following:

<P><LI> Renewal of Temporary Permit to Operate New Equipment
<BR>A Permit to Construct, which has not expired or has not been canceled or voided, will be considered a temporary Permit to Operate on the date the applicant completes final construction and commences operation, pursuant to subdivision (a) of Rule 202.  For the purposes of this paragraph, the date specified as the estimated completion date on the application for Permit to Construct will be considered the date of commencement of operation, unless the applicant notifies the District in writing that operation will commence on another date, or unless the equipment already has been placed in operation.  Such temporary Permit to Operate shall be valid for the period of time between commencement of operation and the applicant's next annual renewal date following commencement of operation and shall be subject to a prorated amount of the annual operating permit renewal fee prescribed in paragraph (d)(2).  The proration shall be based on the time remaining to the next annual renewal date.  On that next annual renewal date, and each year thereafter, the annual operating permit renewal fee for the temporary Permit to Operate shall be due in the amount prescribed in paragraph (d)(2).
<P><LI>Renewal of Temporary Permit to Operate Existing Equipment
<BR>In the case of equipment operating under a temporary Permit to Operate issued pursuant to subdivision (c) of Rule 202, where a Permit to Construct was not issued, the company is immediately subject to a prorated amount of the annual operating permit renewal fee prescribed in paragraph (d)(2) following the submission of the completed application for Permit to Operate.  The proration shall be based on the time remaining to the next annual renewal date.  On that next annual renewal date, and each year thereafter, the annual operating permit renewal fee shall be due in the amount prescribed in paragraph (d)(2).  If no annual renewal date has been established, the Executive Officer shall set one upon receipt of the application.
<P><LI>If, for any reason, the Executive Officer determines it is necessary to change the annual renewal date, all annual operating permit renewal fees shall be prorated according to the new annual renewal date.
<P><LI>The same annual renewal date shall apply from one change of operator to another.
<P><LI>Notice of Amount Due and Nonpayment Penalties
<BR>At least thirty (30) days before the annual renewal date, the owner/operator of equipment under permit will be notified by mail of the amount to be paid and the due date.  If such notice is not received at least thirty (30) days before the annual renewal date, the owner/operator of equipment under permit shall notify the District on or before the permit renewal date that said notice was not received.  The annual operating permit renewal fee for each permit shall be in the amount described in paragraph (d)(2).  If the annual operating permit renewal fee is not paid within thirty (30) days after the due date, the permit will expire and no longer be valid.  In such a case, the owner/operator will be notified by mail of the expiration and the consequences of operating equipment without a valid permit, as required by Rule 203 (Permit to Operate).  For the purpose of this paragraph, the fee payment will be considered to be received by the District if it is postmarked by the United States Postal Service on or before the expiration date stated on the billing notice.  If the expiration date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or a state holiday, the fee payment may be postmarked on the next business day following the Saturday, Sunday, or state holiday with the same effect as if it had been postmarked on the expiration date.

<P><LI> Any person holding permits to operate for two or more emission controls applicable to the same equipment who establishes that any of the emission controls is redundant, i.e., not necessary to assure compliance with all applicable legal requirements, shall not be required to pay annual operating permit renewal fees under subdivision (d) for the redundant equipment.  The Executive Officer may reinstate the obligation to pay such fees at any time upon determination that operating the control is or has become necessary to assure compliance with any applicable legal requirements.</OL>

<B>(e) Annual Operating Permit Emissions Fee</B>
<OL><LI> In addition to the annual operating permit renewal fee, the owner/operator of all equipment operating under permit shall pay an annual operating permit emissions fee based on the total weight of emissions of each of the contaminants specified in Table III from all equipment used by the operator at all locations, including total weight of emissions of each of the contaminants specified in Table III resulting from all products which continue to passively emit air contaminants after they are manufactured, or processed by such equipment, with the exception of such product that is shipped or sold out of the District so long as the manufacturer submits records which will allow for the determination of emissions within the District from such products.  Emissions from equipment not requiring a written permit pursuant to Regulation II shall be reported but not incur a fee for emissions so long as the owner/operator keeps separate records which allow the determination of emissions from such non-permitted equipment.  Similarly, an owner/operator shall not pay a fee for emissions from the use of Clean Air Solvents issued a valid Certificate from the District so long as the facility submits separate records which allow the determination of annual emissions, usage, and identification of such products.  A copy of the Clean Air Solvent certificate issued to the manufacturer or distributor shall be submitted with the separate records.

<P><LI> Each facility emitting 4 tons or more per year of any one of the following air contaminants:  gaseous sulfur compounds (expressed as sulfur dioxide), total organic gases ( excluding methane, specific organic gases, and contaminants listed in Table IV), specific organic gases, oxides of nitrogen (expressed as nitrogen dioxide), or total particulate matter (excluding particulate toxic air contaminants listed in Table IV), or in excess of 100 tons per year for carbon monoxide, shall be assessed a fee for every ton greater than or equal to 4 tons of that contaminant (in excess of 100 tons for carbon monoxide) as prescribed in Table III.  In addition, each source emitting 250 tons or more per year of any of the above referenced contaminants shall pay an annual clean fuels fee (California Health and Safety Code Section 40512) for every ton of that contaminant as prescribed in Table V.

<P><LI>Each source emitting a toxic air contaminant or ozone depleter as listed in Table IV shall be assessed an annual operating permit emissions fee as indicated therein.
<P>(A)In lieu of calculating benzene emissions from gasoline dispensing equipment, fee rates shall be assessed at a rate of $0.012 per thousand gallons of gasoline dispensed from a bulk loading facility.
<P>(B) Any dry cleaning facility that emits less than two (2) tons per year of perchloroethylene, or any furniture stripping facility that emits less than eight (8) tons per year of methylene chloride, and qualifies as a small business as defined in the general definition of Rule 102, shall be exempt from fees listed in Table IV.  This provision shall be retroactive to include the July 10, 1992, rule amendment which included perchloroethylene in Table IV.  The methylene chloride fee exemption for furniture strippers shall be valid from July 1, 1995 until June 30, 1996.
<P>(C) Any facility that emits less than two (2) tons per year of formaldehyde, perchloroethylene, or methylene chloride, may petition the Executive Officer, at least thirty (30) days prior to the official submittal date of declaration of emissions as specified in paragraph (e)(4), for exemption from formaldehyde, perchloroethylene, or methylene chloride fees as listed in Table IV. Exemption from emissions fees shall be granted if the facility demonstrates that no alternatives to the use of these substances exist, no control technologies exist, and that the facility qualifies as a small business as defined in the general definition of Rule 102.

<P><LI> Declaration of Total Emissions from Preceding Reporting Period and Unreported or Under-reported Emissions from Prior Reporting Periods

<P>(A) The owner/operator of equipment subject to paragraph (e)(1), (e)(2), and (e)(3) shall declare to the Executive Officer the total emissions for the immediate preceding reporting period of each of the air contaminants concerned from all equipment.  The declaration shall be made at the time and in the manner prescribed by the Executive Officer.  The permit holder shall report the total emissions for the twelve (12) month period reporting for each air contaminant concerned from all equipment or processes, regardless of the quantities emitted.
<P>(B) Beginning July 1, 1994, the reporting period for annual operating permit emissions fees shall be from July 1 of a given year through June 30 of the following year.
<P>(C) The Executive Officer will determine default emission factors applicable to each piece of permitted equipment or group of permitted equipment, and provide them to the owner/operator in a general mailing, or upon request.  In determining emission factors, the Executive Officer will use the best available data.  A facility owner/operator can provide alternative emission factors that more accurately represent actual facility operations subject to the approval of the Executive Officer.

<P>(D) A facility owner/operator shall declare to the Executive Officer, in the same manner, and quantify any emissions of air contaminants in previous reporting periods which had not been reported correctly under the requirements in effect in the reporting period in which the emissions occurred and should have been reported.

<P><LI> Notice to Pay and Late Filing Penalties
<P>(A) A notice to pay the fee specified in this subdivision and a declaration of emissions form package will be mailed annually to the owners/operators of all equipment (as shown in District records) to which this subdivision applies.  A notice to pay the semi-annual fee specified in paragraph (e)(6) will also be mailed to facilities which in the preceding reporting year emitted ten (10) tons or more of any one of the following air contaminants:  gaseous sulfur compounds (expressed as sulfur dioxide), total organic gases ( excluding methane, specific organic gases, and contaminants listed in Table IV), specific organic gases, oxides of nitrogen (expressed as nitrogen dioxide), or total particulate matter (excluding particulate toxic air contaminants listed in Table IV), or in excess of 100 tons per year for carbon monoxide as listed in Table III.  The annual or semi-annual emissions fee payments are the responsibility of the owner/operator.  Fees are  due and payable immediately on receipt of the notice to pay.  If the fee payment and the completed declaration of emissions (for annual emission reporting) are not received by the sixtieth (60th) day following January 1st or July 1st as applicable, it shall be considered late; and penalties for late payment shall be imposed as set forth in subparagraph (e)(5)(B).  For the purpose of this paragraph, emissions fee payment shall be considered to be timely received by the District if it is postmarked on or before the sixtieth (60th) day following January 1st or July 1st as applicable.  If the sixtieth (60th) day falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or a state holiday, the fee payment and declaration of emissions may be postmarked on the next business day following the Saturday, Sunday, or the state holiday with the same effect as if it had been postmarked on the sixtieth (60th) day.  Those facilities receiving notices to pay semi-annual fees shall also be subject to paragraph (e)(6).

<P>(B) If no fee payment is received within the time prescribed by subparagraph (e)(5)(A), a late payment penalty shall be assessed and added to the original amount of the emission fee due according to the following schedule:
<P> Less than 30 days 5% of reported amount
<BR> 30 to 90 days 15% of reported amount
<BR> 91 days to 1 year 25% of reported amount
<BR> More than 1 year  (See subparagraph (e)(5)(D)
<P> (C) If an emission fee is timely paid, and if, within one year after the sixtieth (60th) day from the official due date is determined to be less than ninety percent (90%) of the full amount that should have been paid, a fifteen percent (15%) penalty shall be added, and is calculated based on the difference between the amount actually paid and the amount that should have been paid, to be referred to as underpayment.  If payment was ninety percent (90%) or more of the correct amount due, the difference or underpayment shall be paid but with no penalties added.  The fee rate to be applied shall be the fee rate in effect for the year in which the emissions actually occurred.  If the underpayment is discovered after one (1) year and sixty (60) days from the official fee due date, fee rates and penalties will be assessed based on subparagraph (e)(5)(D).

<P>(D) The fees due and payable for the emissions reported or reportable pursuant to subparagraph (e)(4)(D) shall be assessed according to the fee rate for that contaminant specified in Tables III, IV, and V, and further increased by fifty percent (50%).  The fee rate to be applied shall be the fee rate in effect for the year in which the emissions are actually reported, and not the fee rate in effect for the year the emissions actually occurred.

<P> (E) If one hundred twenty (120) days have elapsed since January 1 or July 1 as applicable, and all emission fees including any penalty have not been paid in full, the Executive Officer may take action to revoke all Permits to Operate for equipment on the premises, as authorized in Health and Safety Code Section 42307.

<P><LI> Semi-Annual Emissions Fee Payment

<P> (A) For facilities emitting ten (10) tons per year or more of any one of the following air contaminants: gaseous sulfur compounds (expressed as sulfur dioxide), total organic gases ( excluding methane, specific organic gases, and contaminants listed in Table IV), specific organic gases, oxides of nitrogen (expressed as nitrogen dioxide), or total particulate matter (excluding particulate toxic air contaminants listed in Table IV), or in excess of one hundred (100) tons per year for carbon monoxide the previous reporting period, the Executive Officer will estimate one half (1/2) of the previous annual emission fees and request that the permit holder pay such an amount as the first installment on annual emission fees for the period of July 1 through June 30.  This fee is due by January 1 of each year.

<P> (B) In lieu of payment of one half the estimated annual emission fees, the facility may choose to report and pay on actual emissions for the first six months (July 1 through December 31).  By July 1, the permit holder shall submit a final Annual Emission Report together with the payment of the balance, the annual emission fees less the first installment previously paid.  The report shall contain an itemization of emissions from July 1 of the preceding calendar year through June 30 of the current calendar year.  

<P> (C) An installment fee payment is considered late and is subject to late payment penalties if not received within sixty (60) days of the due date (July 1) pursuant to paragraph (e)(5).

<P><LI>Acceptance of a fee payment does not constitute validation of the emission data.

<P><LI> Beginning with the reporting period of July 1, 1995 to June 30, 1996, and for subsequent reporting periods, emissions of acetone, ethane, parachlorobenzotrifluoride (PCBTF), and volatile methylated siloxanes (VMS), shall not be subject to the requirements of Rule 301(e).</OL>

<BR> (Amended June 6, 1992)(Amended October 2, 1992)(Amended June 11, 1993)
<BR> (Amended June 10, 1994)(Amended May 10, 1996)</P>
<P><B>RULE 304.</B><B> </B><B>EQUIPMENT, MATERIALS, AND AMBIENT AIR </B><B>ANALYSES</B></P>
<P>(a) Whenever the Executive Officer finds that an analysis of the materials used by, or the emissions from, any source is necessary to determine the extent and amount of pollutants being discharged to the atmosphere, he may order the testing of such sources.</P>
<P>(b) Whenever the Executive Officer has reasonable cause to believe that air pollutants being discharged into the atmosphere from any source may be contrary to any permit condition or any state or local law, order, rule, or regulation relating to air pollution, or may be endangering the comfort, repose, health, or safety of a considerable number of persons, or the public, he may order the testing of the ambient air which may be affected.</P>
<P>(c) After the Executive Officer determines that ambient air testing should be conducted and that the source should be assessed fees to pay for such testing, and that the test has begun, he shall within two working days advise the source of the basis upon which the finding of reasonable cause was made, the pollutants being tested for, the duration of testing, and the estimated fees.</P>
<P>(d) Testing will be accomplished by the collection of samples and the analyses of such samples by qualified personnel of the South Coast Air Quality Management District, continuous automatic recording ambient monitoring by a District van, device, facility or an independent testing laboratory under contract to the District.  Alternatively, the Executive Officer may require (or the owner/operator of the source may, with the approval of the Executive Officer, elect that testing be performed by an approved independent testing laboratory, that meets the criteria in subdivision (k).  Such testing shall be done using procedures and methods and under conditions prescribed by the Executive Officer.  Where tests are performed by an approved independent testing laboratory, the Executive Officer may require that sampling and/or testing be witnessed by qualified District personnel at the fee rate of $76.81 per person per hour or prorated portion thereof.  The owner/operator of the source shall provide to the Executive Officer a copy of all test reports, including all test data, description of test methods, analyses, and results.</P>
<P>(e) The owner/operator of a source tested by District personnel or an independent testing laboratory under contract to the District shall not pay a fee for the initial test/analysis which is conducted to determine compliance with a permit condition, or any state or local law, order, rule, or regulation relating to air pollution.  If the initial test/analysis indicates that the source is or may be in violation of a permit condition, or any state or local law, order, rule, or regulation relating to air pollution, any subsequent test/analysis conducted in order to verify the compliance status shall result in a fee charged to the owner/operator in accordance with the fee specified in Rule 304.1.  Tests scheduled of one or more permit units to be operated under prearranged conditions, which are canceled due to a change in the permit units' prearranged operating conditions, shall result in a fee charged to the owner/operator in accordance with the fee specified in Rule 304.1.  Such a fee shall not be charged if the owner/operator notifies the District of the cancellation at least 24 hours prior to the scheduled test date and time.</P>
<P>(f) Fees for any test not listed in Rule 304.1 shall be determined by the Executive Officer.</P>
<P>(g) Federal, state, or local government agencies or public districts shall pay all fees.</P>
<P>(h) Should the estimated fees for conducting any ambient air monitoring program as described in subdivision (b) of this Rule exceed $10,000, the affected owner/operator may, within 30 days of notification, request that the program be approved by the District Board at a public hearing.</P>
<P>(i) After completion of testing, the owner/operator of the source shall be notified by the District accounting office of the fees to be paid.  Such fees shall be assessed only for subsequent testing when initial testing, as described in subdivision (e), indicates that the source is or may be in violation of a permit condition or of any state or local law, order, rule, or regulation relating to air pollution, or when there may be any endangerment of the comfort, repose, health, or safety of a considerable number of persons or the public and a subsequent verification is required.  Failure to pay any such fees within thirty (30) days after the date shown on the notice of fees due shall constitute grounds for the denial or suspension of the permits to operate at sources subject to permit requirements and shall constitute a violation of this Rule for any source, whether or not subject to permit requirements.</P>
<P>(j) A small business shall pay twenty percent (20%) of the fees listed in Rule 304.1.  Small business is defined in Rule 102 as &quot;Small Business.&quot;</P>
<P>(k) For the purposes of this Rule, when an independent testing laboratory is used for the purposes of establishing compliance with District rules or to obtain a District permit to operate, it must meet all of the following criteria:</P>
<OL>
<LI>The testing laboratory shall have no financial interest in the company or facility being tested, or in the parent company or any subsidiary thereof;</P>
<P><LI>The company or facility being tested, or parent company or any subsidiary thereof, shall have no financial interest in the testing laboratory;</P>
<P><LI>Any company or facility responsible for the emission of significant quantities of pollutants to the atmosphere, or parent company or any subsidiary thereof, shall have no financial interest in the testing laboratory; and</P>
<P><LI>The testing laboratory shall not be in partnership with, own or be owned by, in part or in full, the contractor who has provided or installed equipment (basic or control), or monitoring systems, or is providing maintenance for installed equipment or monitoring systems, for the company being tested.</P>
</OL>
<P>The testing laboratory shall submit a statement certifying that it meets the above criteria with respect to the company or facility being tested.</P>
<P>(l) No fees shall be assessed for initial laboratory analyses of the following materials when submitted for analysis by District enforcement personnel, in order to determine compliance with applicable District rules:  barbecue ignition products, coatings, adhesives, solvents, cleaning materials, fountain solutions, inks, thinners, monomers, resins, fuels, and oils.  If the initial test/analysis indicates that the source is or may be in violation of a permit condition, or any state or local law, order, rule, or regulation relating to air pollution, the owner/operator shall pay a fee in accordance with Rule 304.1, for any subsequent test/analysis conducted in order to verify the compliance status.</P>
<P>(m) Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision (k), the Executive Officer, by written approval, may allow the operator of a publicly owned treatment works to conduct testing in connection with wastewater treatment or reclamation operation pursuant to this rule, if the Executive Officer determines the following:</P>
<OL>
<LI>the operator complies with all requirements of this rule, other than subdivision (k);</P>
<P><LI>the operator submits a written self-testing plan request to the Executive Officer for certification on a method-by-method basis, in accordance with the requirements of guidelines established by the Executive Officer; and</P>
<P><LI>the operator pays a fee for the processing of the self-testing plan request at a rate of $76.81 per person per hour, pursuant to Rule 306(d), so as not to exceed the amount necessary to recover the District costs.</P>
</OL>
(n) The District may approve independent testing firms to perform specified analyses and tests required for compliance with District rules, regulations and permit conditions.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Approval fees (for each method required for approval) will be assessed to cover the costs of processing the laboratory approval application and subsequent District validation of the independent firm's expertise and reliability.</P>
<P><LI>For firms located outside District boundaries, reasonable travel charges will be assessed for site visits as required as part of the approval process.</P>
<P><LI>An approved facility may renew its status by paying an annual fee per method and by complying with the original approval requirements as well as any additional approval requirements or any additional conditions.</P>
</OL>
Fees are based on actual costs at the staff hour rate specified in paragraph (d) above and as shown in Table I.</P>

<BR> (Amended May 10, 1996)</P>
<P><B>RULE 306. PLAN FEES</B></P>

<B><P>(a) Summary</B>
<BR> California Health and Safety Code Section 40522 provides authority for the South Coast Air Quality Management District to adopt a fee schedule for the approval of plans to cover the costs of review, planning, inspection, and monitoring related to activities conducted pursuant to the plans.  An annual fee may also be charged to cover the costs of annual review, inspection, and monitoring related thereto.  This rule establishes such a fee schedule, and requires that fees be paid for:
<OL>
<LI> Filing of plans;
<BR><LI> Evaluation of the above plans; 
<BR><LI> Duplicate plans;
<BR><LI> Change of condition; and
<BR><LI> Annual review, if applicable.
</OL>

<B><P>(b) Definitions</B>
<BR> For the purpose of this rule, a plan is any data and/or test report required by federal or state law, or District Rules and Regulations to be submitted to the District.  A plan may be a description of a method to control or measure emissions of air contaminants required by the Rules and Regulations.  Plans include, but are not limited to, the following:  Demonstration Plan; Application Test Plan; Implementation Plan; Compliance Plan; Management Plan; Control Plan; Acid Rain Repowering Extension Plan and Compliance Plan; Acid Rain Continuous Emission Monitoring System Plan; Acid Rain Protocol/Report Evaluation; VOC Excavation Mitigation Plan; Reduction of Refrigerant Emissions from Stationary Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Systems Plan, and Solid Waste Air Quality Assessment Test Reports (Health and Safety Code Section 41805.5).

<P><B>(c) Plan Filing Fee</B>
<BR> The filing fee for a plan or change of condition shall be $76.80.

<P><B>(d) Plan Evaluation Fee</B>
<BR> The plan evaluation fee shall be an amount equal to the total actual and reasonable time incurred by the District for evaluation of a plan, assessed at the rate of $76.81 per person per hour or prorated portion thereof.

<P><B>(e) Duplicate Plan Fee</B>
<BR>A request for a duplicate plan shall be made in writing by the applicant.  The applicant shall pay $13.30 for each plan requested.

<P><B>(f) Change of Condition Fee</B>
<BR>Any request for a change of condition on a VOC Excavation Mitigation Plan shall be made in writing by the applicant.  A request submitted after thirty (30) days of the issuance of the plan shall be subject to additional fees assessed at the rate of $76.81 per hour for time spent in evaluation of the plan.  Such fees shall be imposed at the time the review is completed.

<P><B>(g) Annual Review Fee</B>
<BR>If the Executive Officer determines that an annual review is necessary, an annual review fee shall be charged.  The annual review fee shall be an amount equal to the total actual and reasonable time incurred by the District for review of the plan, assessed at the rate of $76.81 per person per hour or prorated portion thereof, and shall be imposed at the time the review is completed. 

<B><P>(h) Payment of Fees</B>
<OL>
<LI>In addition to payment of the filing fee, an initial payment for plan evaluation fees of $256.0<S>4</S> shall be paid at the time of filing.  This fee shall not apply to plans pursuant to Rule 403 - Fugitive Dust, and Rule 1166 - Various Location Plans issued pursuant to the Decontamination of VOC Soil, for which the initial payment for plan evaluation fees will be $76.80.  The adjustment to plan evaluation fees will be determined at the time a plan is approved or rejected and notification of the amount due or refund will be made.

<P>
<LI>Payment of all applicable fees, including annual review fee, shall be due in thirty (30) days from the date of personal service or mailing of the notification of the amount due.  Non-payment of the fee within this time period will result in expiration of the plan.  For the purpose of this paragraph, the fee payment will be considered to be received by the District if it is postmarked by the United States Postal Service on or before the expiration date stated on the billing notice.  If the expiration date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or a state holiday, the fee payment may be postmarked on the business day following the Saturday, Sunday, or the state holiday with the same effect as if it had been postmarked on the expiration date.  No further plan applications will be accepted until such time as all overdue fees have been fully paid.

<P> Whenever the Executive Officer has reasonable cause to believe that the plan evaluation fee will be less than the fee for one hour's work, the fee need not be paid at the time of filing and notification of amount due, if any, shall be sent at the time the plan is approved or rejected.
</OL>

<B>(i) Protocol/Report Evaluation Fees</B>
<BR>A minimum fee of $409.60 will be charged for the evaluation of source test protocols and reports.  Additional fees will be assessed at a rate of $76.81 per hour for time spent in the evaluation in excess of 10 hours up to a maximum total fee of $1,561.80.

<P><B>(j) Request for Time Extension of Payment Due</B>
<BR>Whenever this rule requires fees to be paid by a certain date to avoid expiration, cancellation, or the imposition of an increased fee for late payment, the Executive Officer may, for good cause, grant an extension of time, not to exceed one hundred eighty (180) days, within which the fee payment shall be made.  Any request for an extension of time hereunder shall be made in writing and accompanied by a statement of reasons explaining why the extension should be granted.

<P><B>(k) Adjustment of Fees</B>
<BR>The Executive Officer may, upon finding an administrative error by District staff regarding the calculation, imposition, noticing, invoicing, and/or collection of any fee set forth within this rule, rescind, reduce, increase, or modify such fee.  Any request for such relief from an administrative error shall be received by the District in writing prior to the expiration date of notification of the amount due, accompanied by a statement of why such relief should be granted.  Claims for refund of any fee required by this rule shall be submitted in writing within one (1) year after the fee was paid.

<B><P>(l) Exemptions</B>
<BR>Mobile Source Emission Reduction Credit (MSERC) Applications and Compliance Plans required under Regulation XVI shall be exempt from the provisions of this rule.  Fees for Regulation XVI MSERC Applications and Compliance Plans shall be assessed in accordance with District Rule 309.

<B><P>(m) Government Agencies</B>
<BR>Federal, state, or local government agencies or public districts shall pay all fees.

<P><B>(n) Effective July 1, 1996,</B> all Air Quality Investment Program (AQIP) fees shall be subject to Rule 311 and all other Rule 2202 registration fees shall be subject to Rule 308.

The procedure for estimating priority of facilities were developed based on the California Air Pollution Control Officers&#146; Association (CAPCOA) &#147;Air Toxics &#147;Hot Spots&#148; Program Facility Prioritization Guidelines, July 1990&#148;, and was adopted by the District Board on September 24, 1990.  Those facilities that have not yet been prioritized shall remain in the appropriate Plan and Report Program category.
<P> (B) The facility had its health risk assessment approved by the District in accordance with Health and Safety Code Section 44362 and was notified in writing by the District that the risk assessment results show a total potential cancer risk at an actual receptor, summed across all pathways of exposure and all compounds, of less than one chance per one million persons and a total hazard index for each toxicological endpoints of less than 0.1.  An approved final risk assessment is one that has been reviewed by OEHHA before being approved by the District.  The procedures for determining potential cancer risk and total hazard index are presented in the CAPCOA &#147;Air Toxics &#147;Hot Spots&#148; Program Revised 1992 Risk Assessment Guidelines, October 1993&#148;, which is incorporated by reference herein.

<P>(C) The facility primarily performs printing as described by SIC Codes 2711 through 2771 or 2782, and the facility uses an annualized average of two (2) gallons per day or less [or seventeen (17) pounds per day or less] of all graphic arts materials.

<P><B>RULE 1303. - REQUIREMENTS</B>
<P><B>(a) Best Available Control Technology</B>:
<OL><LI> The Executive Officer or designee shall deny the Permit to Construct for any relocation or for any new or modified source which results in an emission increase of any nonattainment air contaminant, any ozone depleting compound, or ammonia, unless Best Available Control Technology is employed for the new or relocated source or for the actual modification to an existing source. 

<P> <LI> In implementing subdivision (a), the Executive Officer or designee shall periodically publish guidelines indicating the administrative procedures and requirements for commonly permitted sources.  Best Available Control Technology for other source categories shall be determined on a case-by-case basis using the definition of Best Available Control Technology in Rule 1302 and the general administrative procedures and requirements of the Best Available Control Technology Guidelines.

<P> <LI> Where the requirement of paragraph (a)(1) is applicable to a small business that is not a major polluting facility, the Executive Officer or designee shall consider cost in determining the level of Best Available Control Technology required for new or modified sources at such a facility, provided that the applicant fully substantiates his eligibility as a small business as defined in Rule 1302.  Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, Best Available Control Technology for such sources shall be at least as stringent as Lowest Achievable Emission Rate as defined in the federal Clean Air Act Section 171(3) [42 U.S.C. Section 7501(3)].

<P> <LI> The Best Available Control Technology requirements of this paragraph shall apply regardless of any modeling or offset exemption in Rule 1304.</OL>

<P><B>(b)</B> The Executive Officer or designee shall, except as Rule 1304 applies, deny the Permit to Construct for any new or modified source which results in a net emission increase of any nonattainment air contaminant at a facility, unless each of the following requirements is met:
<OL><LI> Modeling
<BR>The applicant substantiates with modeling, according to Appendix A or other analysis approved by the Executive Officer or designee, that the new facility or modification will not cause a significant increase in an air quality concentration as specified in Table A-2 of Appendix A.
<P><LI> Emission Offsets
<BR>Unless exempt from offsets requirements pursuant to Rule 1304, emission increases shall be offset by either Emission Reduction Credits approved pursuant to Rule 1309, or by allocations from the Priority Reserve in accordance with the provisions of Rule 1309.1.  Offset ratios shall be 1.2-to-1.0 for Emission Reduction Credits and 1.0-to-1.0 for allocations from the Priority Reserve, except for facilities located in the Southeast Desert Air Basin, where the offset ratio for Emission Reduction Credits only shall be 1.2-to-1.0 for VOC, NO<SUB>X</SUB>, SO<SUB>X</SUB>and PM10 and 1.0-to-1.0 for CO.
<P><LI>Sensitive Zone Requirements
<BR>Unless credits are obtained from the Priority Reserve, facilities located in the South Coast Air Basin are subject to the Sensitive Zone requirements specified in Health and Safety Code Section 40410.5.  A facility in zone 1 may obtain Emission Reduction Credits originated in zone 1 only, and a facility in zone 2A may obtain Emission Reduction Credits from either zone 1 or zone 2A, or both, or demonstrate to the Executive Officer or designee a net air quality benefit in the area impacted by the emissions from the subject facility.
<P> <LI>Facility Compliance

<B>(a) Purpose</B><BR>
 The purpose of this rule is to provide opportunities to generate NOx, VOC,
CO, and PM mobile source emission reduction credits (MSERCs) that can be
used as an alternative means of compliance with District regulations, as
well as promote the purchase of low-polluting equipment and the early retirement
of older, high-polluting equipment.  These credits would be generated based
on voluntary emission reductions within the District that are beyond those
required by local, state, and federal regulations.
<P>
<B>(b) Applicability</B><BR>
 This rule applies to any lawn &amp; garden equipment for which emission
standards have been adopted by the ARB.  The equipment subject to this rule
includes lawn mowers, edgers, trimmers, blowers, vacuums, tillers, shredders,
grinders, chainsaws, riding mowers, and garden tractors.

found in California's Utility and Lawn and Garden Emission Regulation.
<P>
<LI>LOW-EMISSION EQUIPMENT means lawn and garden equipment purchased
or delivered for sale prior to January 1, 1999, that utilizes ARB-certified
engines which meet California's 1999 and later emission standards as specified
in Title 13, California Code of Regulations.
<P>
<LI>MOBILE SOURCE EMISSION REDUCTION CREDIT (MSERC) means real, quantified
emission reductions in accordance with the ARB's Mobile Source Credit Guidelines,
approved by the Executive Officer or designee, that can be used to comply
with District Regulations pursuant to subdivision (h), and are surplus to
emission reductions required by U.S. EPA, or ARB regulations.
<P>
<LI>NITROGEN OXIDES (NOx) means the sum of nitric oxides and nitrogen
dioxides emitted, calculated as nitrogen dioxide.
<P>
<LI>REMAINING USEFUL LIFE is the number of years until an existing piece
of equipment is removed from service, and shall be based on the difference
between the age of the equipment and the expected equipment life.
<P>
<LI>SCRAPPING means to permanently remove existing lawn and garden equipment
from service.
<P>
<LI>VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUND (VOC) is any volatile compound of carbon;

<P>
<OL><LI>The total amount of NOx, VOC, CO, and PM MSERCs generated per year
for
the number of years specified in Table 1, when any low- or zero-emission
lawn and garden equipment is purchased, sold, replaced, or scrapped shall
be based on the following calculation:
<P>  MSERC  = (Credit per Unit  x  # Units)/TAF
<P>
 where:<BR>
 MSERC = Mobile source emission reduction credits
(pounds/year).<BR><BR>Credit  = Annual emissions reduction generated by equipment
type (pounds/year).
<P>  Unit  = The actual number of lawn and garden equipment purchased, sold,
replaced, or scrapped.
<P>  TAF  = Technical Uncertainty Adjustment Factor, for the purpose of
generating credits.
<P>
<LI>The amount of Credits per Unit is to be taken from Table 2 for units
used by residential users and from Table 3 for units used by commercial users.
 For projects involving scrapping and replacement, the amount of Credit per
Unit is read directly from Tables 2 and 3.  For purchase-only projects occurring
prior to January 1, 1999, the Credit per Unit is the difference between the
credits generated for low- or zero-emission equipment and equipment meeting
the 1995 California Emission Standards for Utility and Lawn and Garden Engines.
 After January 1, 1999, the Credit per Unit is the difference between the

<LI>MSERCs may be used for any of the following applications:
<P>(A) As RECLAIM Trading Credits.  The Executive Officer or designee shall
convert MSERCs to RTCs upon submission of MSERCs by the user.
<P>
(B) As an alternative method of compliance with District Regulation
XI rules that have future compliance dates.  MSERCs shall not be used to
offset emission increases caused by the removal of emission control equipment
or replacement of compliant with noncompliant materials subject to Regulation
XI.  MSERCs must be in existence and designated as an alternative method
of compliance in advance of the compliance date.
<P>
(C) As a method of compliance with District Rule 2202.
<P>
(D) As New Source Review (NSR) offsets for emission increases at new
or modified facilities that are subject to Rule 1303 (b)(2) in accordance
with the provisions of Regulation XIII.  Pursuant to Rule 504, no variance
or series of variances, including emergency and interim variances, shall
be granted for a period in excess of 90 days from the initial granting of
a variance, from a permit condition implementing a Regulation XIII offset
requirement if such permit condition is based upon the use of MSERCs.
<P>
(E) For voluntary retirement of MSERCs for air quality benefits.
<P>
(F) As an alternative method of compliance with any District regulations
which specifically authorize the use of MSERCs.
<P>
<LI>MSERCs shall only be consumed in the air basin where the lawn
and garden equipment, used to generate the MSERCs, are based.
<P>
<LI>In order to use MSERCs for the applications listed in subparagraph
(h)(1)(B) of this subdivision, the user shall submit a compliance plan to
the Executive Officer or designee.  The user of MSERCs for applications listed
under subparagraph (h)(1)(F) shall also submit a compliance plan to the Executive
Officer or designee if the District regulation specifically authorizing the
use of MSERCs does not already require a compliance plan.  The purpose of
the compliance plan is to demonstrate compliance with rule requirements,
and specify the use of MSERCs.

the related requirements of 23 U.S.C. 109(j), with respect to
the conformity of transportation plans, programs, and projects
which are developed, funded, or approved by the United States
Department of Transportation (DOT), and by Southern California
Association of Governments (SCAG) or other recipients of funds
under Title 23 U.S.C. or the Federal Transit Act (49 U.S.C. 1601
et seq.).  This rule sets forth policy, criteria, and procedures
for demonstrating and assuring conformity of such activities to
an applicable implementation plan developed pursuant to Section
110 and Part D of the CAA.
<P>

<B>(b) Applicability.</B>
<BR>
<OL><LI>Action Applicability.

   (ii) The adoption, acceptance, approval or support of Transportation
Improvement Programs (TIPs) developed pursuant to 23 CFR Part
450 or 49 CFR Part 613 by a Metropolitan Planning Organization
(MPO) or Department of Transportation (DOT); and
<P>
   (iii) The approval, funding, or implementation of Federal Highway
Administration/Federal Transit Administration (FHWA/FTA) projects.
</BLOCKQUOTE><P>
  (B) Conformity determinations are not required under this rule
for individual projects which are not FHWA/FTA projects.  However,
subdivision (ad) applies to such projects if they are regionally
significant.
<P>
<LI>Geographic Applicability.
<P>
  (A) The provisions of this rule shall apply in all nonattainment
and maintenance areas for transportation-related criteria pollutants
for which the area is designated nonattainment or has a maintenance
plan.
<P>
  (B) The provisions of this rule apply with respect to emissions
of the following criteria pollutants: ozone, carbon monoxide,
nitrogen dioxide and particles with an aerodynamic diameter less
than or equal to a nominal 10 micrometers (PM10).
<P>
  (C) The provisions of this rule apply with respect to emissions
of the following precursor pollutants:
<BLOCKQUOTE>(i) Volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides in ozone
areas;
</BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>(ii) Nitrogen oxides in nitrogen dioxide areas;
and
<P>
   (iii) Volatile organic compounds, nitrogen oxides and PM10
in PM10 areas if:
<BLOCKQUOTE>(I) During the interim period, the EPA Regional Administrator
or the director of the CARB has made a finding that transportation-related
precursor emissions within the nonattainment area are a significant
contributor to the PM10 nonattainment problem and has so notified
the SCAG and DOT; or
<P>
    (II) During the transitional, control strategy, and maintenance
periods, the applicable implementation plan (or implementation
plan submission) establishes a budget for such emissions as part
of the reasonable further progress, attainment or maintenance
strategy.
</BLOCKQUOTE><P>
</BLOCKQUOTE><LI>Limitations.
<P>
  (A) Projects subject to this rule for which the NEPA process
and a conformity determination have been completed by FHWA or
FTA may proceed toward implementation without further conformity
determinations if one of the following major steps has occurred
within the past three years:  NEPA process completion;  start
of final design;  acquisition of a significant portion of the
right-of-way;  or approval of the plans, specifications and estimates.
 All phases of such projects which were considered in the conformity
determination are also included, if those phases were for the
purpose of funding, final design, right-of-way acquisition, construction,
or any combination of these phases.
<P>
  (B) A new conformity determination for the project will be required
if there is a significant change in project design concept and
scope, if a supplemental environmental document for air quality
purposes is initiated, or if no major steps to advance the project
have occurred within the past three years.
<P>
<LI>Grace Period for new nonattainment areas.
<P>
(A)For areas or portions of areas which have been in attainment for either
ozone, CO, PM-10, or NO2 since 1990 and are subsequently redesignated to
nonattainment for any of these pollutants, the provisions of this subpart
shall not apply for such pollutant for 12 months following the date of final
designation to nonattainment
</OL><P>

<P>
<LI>CONTROL STRATEGY IMPLEMENTATION PLAN REVISION is the applicable
implementation plan which contains specific strategies for controlling
the emissions of and reducing ambient levels of pollutants in
order to satisfy CAA requirements for demonstrations of reasonable
further progress and attainment (CAA Sections 182(b)(1), 182(c)(2)(A),

<P>
<LI>CONTROL STRATEGY PERIOD with respect to particulate matter
less than 10 microns in diameter (PM10), carbon monoxide (CO),
nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and/or ozone precursors (volatile organic
compounds and oxides of nitrogen), means that period of time after
EPA approves control strategy implementation plan revisions containing
strategies for controlling PM10, NO2, CO, and/or ozone, as appropriate.
 This  period ends when a State submits and EPA approves a request
under Section 107(d) of the CAA for redesignation to an attainment
area.
<P>
<LI>DESIGN CONCEPT means the type of facility identified by the
project, e.g., freeway, expressway, arterial highway, grade-separated
highway, reserved right-of-way rail transit, mixed-traffic rail
transit, exclusive busway, etc.
<P>

(FHWA) or Federal Transit Administration (FTA) approval for some
aspect of the project, such as connection to an interstate highway
or deviation from applicable design standards on the interstate
system.
<P>
<LI>FTA means the Federal Transit Administration of DOT.
<P>
<LI>FORECAST PERIOD with respect to a transportation plan is
the period covered by the transportation plan pursuant to 23 CFR
Part 450.
<P>
<LI>HIGHWAY PROJECT is an undertaking to implement or modify
a highway facility or highway-related program.  Such an undertaking
consists of all required phases necessary for implementation.
 For analytical purposes, it must be defined sufficiently to:
<P>
  (A) Connect logical termini and be of sufficient length to address
environmental matters on a broad scope;
<P>
  (B) Have independent utility or significance, i.e., be usable
and be a reasonable expenditure even if no additional transportation
improvements in the area are made; and
<P>
  (C) Not restrict consideration of alternatives for other reasonably
foreseeable transportation improvements.
<P>
<LI>HORIZON YEAR is a year for which the transportation plan
describes the envisioned transportation system in accordance with
subdivision (h).
<P>
<LI>HOT-SPOT ANALYSIS is an estimation of likely future localized
CO and PM10 pollutant concentrations and a comparison of those
concentrations to the national ambient air quality standards.
Pollutant concentrations to be estimated should be based on the
total emissions burden which may result from the implementation
of a single, specific project, summed together with future background
concentrations (which can be estimated using the ratio of future
to current traffic multiplied by the ratio of future to current
emission factors) expected in the area.  The total concentration
must be estimated and analyzed at appropriate receptor locations
in the area substantially affected by the project.  Hot-spot analysis
assesses impacts on a scale smaller than the entire nonattainment
or maintenance area, including, for example, congested roadway
intersections and highways or transit terminals, and uses an air
quality dispersion model to determine the effects of emissions
on air quality.
<P>
<LI>INCOMPLETE DATA AREA means any ozone nonattainment area
which EPA has classified, in 40 CFR Part 81, as an incomplete
data area.
<P>
<LI>INCREASE THE FREQUENCY OR SEVERITY means to cause a location
or region to exceed a standard more often or to cause a violation
at a greater concentration than previously existed and/or would
otherwise exist during the future period in question, if the project

Amendments of 1990 and subsequently redesignated to attainment
subject to the requirement to develop a maintenance plan under
Section 175A of the CAA, as amended.
<P>
<LI>MAINTENANCE PERIOD with respect to a pollutant or pollutant
precursor means that period of time beginning when a State submits
and EPA approves a request under Section 107(d) of the CAA for
redesignation to an attainment area, and lasting for 20 years,
unless the applicable implementation plan specifies that the maintenance
period shall last for more than 20 years.
<P>
<LI>METROPOLITAN PLANNING ORGANIZATION (MPO) is that organization
designated as being responsible, together with the State, for
conducting the continuing, cooperative, and comprehensive planning
process under 23 U.S.C. 134 and 49 U.S.C. 1607.  It is the forum
for cooperative transportation decision-making.  [For the South
Coast Air Basin, Southern California Association of Governments
(SCAG) is the designated MPO.]
<P>
<LI>MILESTONE has the meaning given in Section 182(g)(1) and
Section 189(c) of the CAA.  A milestone consists of an emissions
level and the date on which it is required to be achieved.
<P>
<LI>MOTOR VEHICLE EMISSIONS BUDGET is that portion of the total
allowable emissions defined in a revision to the applicable implementation
plan (or in an implementation plan revision which was endorsed
by the Governor or his or her designee, subject to a public hearing,
and submitted to EPA, but not yet approved by EPA) for a certain
date for the purpose of meeting reasonable further progress milestones
or attainment or maintenance demonstrations, for any criteria
pollutant or its precursors, allocated by the applicable implementation
plan to highway and transit vehicles.  The applicable implementation
plan for an ozone nonattainment area may also designate a motor
vehicle emissions budget for oxides of nitrogen (NOx) for a reasonable
further progress milestone year if the applicable implementation
plan demonstrates that this NOx budget will be achieved with measures
in the implementation plan (as an implementation plan must do
for VOC milestone requirements).  The applicable implementation
plan for an ozone nonattainment area includes a NOx budget if
NOx reductions are being substituted for reductions in volatile
organic compounds in milestone years required for reasonable further
progress.
<P>
<LI>NATIONAL AMBIENT AIR QUALITY STANDARDS (NAAQS) are those
standards established pursuant to Section 109 of the CAA.
<P>
<LI>NEPA means the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969,
as amended (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq).
<P>
<LI>NEPA PROCESS COMPLETION, for the purposes of this rule,
with respect to FHWA or FTA, means the point at which there is
a specific action to make a determination that a project is categorically
excluded, to make a Finding of No Significant Impact, or to issue
a record of decision on a Final Environmental Impact Statement
under NEPA.

<P>
  (B) The date that the Clean Air Act requires relevant control
strategy implementation plans to be submitted to EPA, provided
EPA has made a finding of the State's failure to submit any such
plans and the State, SCAG, and DOT have received notice of such
finding of the State's failure to submit any such plans.  The
precise end of Phase II of the interim period is defined in subdivision
(ad).
<P>
<LI>PROJECT means a highway project or transit project.
<P>
<LI>PROTECTIVE FINDING means a determination by EPA that the control strategy
contained in a submitted control strategy implementation plan revision would
have been considered approvable with respect to requirements for emissions
reductions if all committed measures had been submitted in enforceable form
as required by Clean Air Act section 110(a)(2)(A).
<P>
<LI>RECIPIENT OF FUNDS DESIGNATED UNDER TITLE 23 U.S.C. OR THE
FEDERAL TRANSIT ACT means any agency at any level of State, county,
city or regional government that routinely receives Title 23 U.S.C.

definition does not include private landowners or developers,
or contractors or entities that are only paid for services or
products created by their own employees.
<P>
<LI>REGIONALLY SIGNIFICANT PROJECT means a transportation project
(other than an exempt project) that is on a facility which serves
regional transportation needs (such as access to and from the
area outside of the region, major activity centers in the region,
major planned developments such as new retail malls, sports complexes,
etc., or transportation terminals as well as most terminals themselves)
and would normally be included in the modeling of a metropolitan
area's transportation network, including at a minimum all principal
arterial highways and all fixed guideway transit facilities that
offer an alternative to regional highway travel.  Additional criteria
may be developed by appropriate agencies through the Interagency
consultation process.
<P>
<LI>RURAL TRANSPORT OZONE NONATTAINMENT AREA means an ozone
nonattainment area that does not include, and is not adjacent
to, any part of a Metropolitan Statistical Area or, where one

<P>
<LI>TRANSIT PROJECT is an undertaking to implement or modify
a transit facility or transit-related program; purchase transit
vehicles or equipment; or provide financial assistance for transit
operations.  It does not include actions that are solely within
the jurisdiction of local transit agencies, such as changes in
routes, schedules, or fares.  It may consist of several phases.
 For analytical purposes, it must be defined inclusively enough
to:
<P>
  (A) Connect logical termini and be of sufficient length to address
environmental matters on a broad scope;
<P>
  (B) Have independent utility or independent significance, i.e.,
be a reasonable expenditure even if no additional transportation

horizon years.
<P>
  (A) The agency or organization developing the transportation
plan may choose any years to be horizon years, subject to the
following restrictions:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(i) Horizon years may be no more than 10 years apart.

</BLOCKQUOTE><P>(B) For these horizon years:
<BLOCKQUOTE>(i) The transportation plan shall quantify and document the
demographic and employment factors influencing expected transportation
demand, including land use forecasts, in accordance with implementation
plan provisions and subdivision (f);
</BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>(ii) The highway and transit system shall be described
in terms
of the regionally significant additions or modifications to the
existing transportation network which the transportation plan
envisions to be operational in the horizon years.  Additions and
modifications to the highway network shall be sufficiently identified
to indicate intersections with existing regionally significant
facilities, and to determine their effect on route options between
transportation analysis zones.  Each added or modified highway
segment shall also be sufficiently identified in terms of its
design concept and design scope to allow modeling of travel times
under various traffic volumes, consistent with the modeling methods
for area-wide transportation analysis in use by SCAG.  Transit
facilities, equipment, and services envisioned for the future
shall be identified in terms of design concept, design scope,
and operating policies sufficiently to allow modeling of their
transit ridership.  The descriptions of additions and modifications
to the transportation network shall also be sufficiently specific
to show that there is a reasonable relationship between expected
land use and the envisioned transportation system; and
<P>
   (iii) Other future transportation policies, requirements, services,

needed to fully implement each TCM indicates that TCMs which are
eligible for funding under Title 23 U.S.C. or the Federal Transit
Act are on or ahead of the schedule established in the applicable
implementation plan, or, if such TCMs are behind the schedule
established in the applicable implementation plan, SCAG and DOT
have determined that past obstacles to implementation of the TCMs
have been identified and have been or are being overcome, and
that all State and local agencies with influence over approvals

funding of TCMs over other projects within their control, including
projects in locations outside the nonattainment or maintenance

<BR>
 A transportation project which is not from a conforming transportation
plan and TIP must contribute to emission reductions or must not
increase emissions in PM10 and NO2 nonattainment areas.  This
criterion applies during the interim and transitional periods
only.  This criterion is met if a regional emissions analysis
is performed which meets the requirements of subdivision (z) and
which includes the transportation plan and project in the "Action"
scenario.  If the project which is not from a conforming transportation
plan and TIP is a modification of a project currently in the transportation
plan or TIP, and paragraph (z)(2) is used to demonstrate satisfaction
of this criterion, the 'Baseline' scenario must include the project
with its original design concept and scope, and the 'Action' scenario
must include the project with its new design concept and scope.

<P>
  (A) The transportation plan and TIP must be demonstrated to
conform by 18 months from the date of the State's initial submission to EPA
of  each control strategy implementation plan establishing a motor vehicle
emissions budget.  If conformity is not determined by 18 months from the
date of submission of such control strategy implementation plan, the conformity
status of the transportation plan and TIP will lapse, and no new project-level
conformity determinations may be made, until the transportation plan and
TIP have been demonstrated to conform.
<P>
  (B)  For areas not yet in the control strategy period for a given pollutant,
conformity shall be demonstrated using the motor vehicle emissions budget(s)
in a submitted control strategy implementation plan revision for that pollutant
beginning 90 days after submission, unless EPA declares such budget(s) inadequate
for transportation conformity purposes.  The motor vehicle emissions budget(s)
may be used to determine conformity during the first 90 days after its submission
if EPA agrees that the budget(s) are adequate for conformity purposes.

<P>
  (A)  If EPA disapproves the submitted control strategy implementation plan
revision and so notifies the State, MPO, and DOT, which initiates the sanction
process under Clean Air Act section 179 or 110(m), the conformity status
of the transportation plan and TIP shall lapse 120 days after EPA's disapproval,
and no new project-level conformity determiniations may be made.  No new
transportation plan, TIP, or project may be found to conform until another
control strategy implementation plan revision fulfilling the same Clean Air
Act requirements is submitted and conformity to this submission is determined.
<P>
  (B)  Notwithstanding subparagraph (ac)(2)(A) of this section, if EPA
disapproves the submitted control strategy implementation plan revision but
makes a protective finding, the conformity status of the transportation plan
and TIP shall lapse on the date that highway sanctions as a result of the
disapproval are imposed on the nonattainment area under section 179(b)(1)
of the Clean Air Act.  No new transportation plan, TIP, or project may be
found to conform until another control strategy implementation plan revision
fulfilling the same Clean Air Act requirements is submitted and conformity
to this submission is determined.

<LI>Failure to submit and incompleteness.  For areas where EPA notifies the
State, MPO, and DOT of the State's failure to submit or submission of an
incomplete control strategy implementation plan revision, which initiates
the sanction process under Clean Air Act section 179 or 110(m), the conformity
status of the transportation plan and TIP shall lapse on the date that highway
sanctions are imposed on the nonattainment area for such failure under section
179(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, unless the failure has been remedied and
acknowledged by a letter from the EPA Regional Administrator.
<P>
<LI>Federal implementation plans.  When EPA promulgates a federal implementation
plan that contains motor vehicle emissions budget(s) as a result of a State
failure, the conformity lapse imposed by this section because of that State
failure is removed.

  (A) Before a FHWA/FTA project which is regionally significant

may be found to conform, the State air agency must be consulted
on how the emissions which the existing transportation plan and
TIP's conformity determination estimates for the "Action"
scenario [as required by subdivisions (w) through (ab)] compare
to the motor vehicle emissions budget in the implementation plan
submission or the projected motor vehicle emissions budget in
the implementation plan under development.

<P>
 (A) The regional emissions analysis for the transportation plan,
TIP, or project not from a conforming plan and TIP shall include
all regionally significant projects expected in the nonattainment
or maintenance area, including FHWA/FTA projects proposed in the
transportation plan and TIP and all other regionally significant
projects which are disclosed to the MPO as required by subdivision
(f).  Projects which are not regionally significant are not required
to be explicitly modeled, but VMT from such projects must be estimated
in accordance with reasonable professional practice.  The effects
of TCMs and similar projects that are not regionally significant
may also be estimated in accordance with reasonable professional
practice.
<P>
 (B) The emissions analysis may not include for emissions reduction
credit any TCMs which have been delayed beyond the scheduled date(s)
until such time as implementation has been assured.  If the TCM
has been partially implemented and it can be demonstrated that
it is providing quantifiable emission reduction benefits, the
emissions analysis may include that emissions reduction credit.
<P>
 (C) Emissions reduction credit from projects, programs, or activities
which require a regulation in order to be implemented may not
be included in the emissions analysis unless the regulation is
already adopted by the enforcing jurisdiction.  Adopted regulations
are required for demand management strategies for reducing emissions
which are not specifically identified in the applicable implementation
plan, and for control programs which are external to the transportation
system itself, such as tailpipe or evaporative emission standards,
limits on gasoline volatility, inspection and maintenance programs,
and oxygenated or reformulated gasoline or diesel fuel.  A regulatory
program may also be considered to be adopted if an opt-in to a
Federally enforced program has been approved by EPA, if EPA has
promulgated the program (if the control program is a Federal responsibility,
such as tailpipe standards), or if the Clean Air Act requires
the program without need for individual State action and without
any discretionary authority for EPA to set its stringency, delay
its effective date, or not implement the program.
<P>
 (D) Notwithstanding subparagraph (1)(C) of this subdivision,
during the transitional period, control measures or programs which
are committed to in an implementation plan submission as described
in subdivisions (s) through (u), but which have not received final
EPA action in the form of a finding of incompleteness, approval,
or disapproval may be assumed for emission reduction credit for
the purpose of demonstrating that the requirements of subdivisions
(s) through (u) are satisfied.
<P>
 (E) A regional emissions analysis for the purpose of satisfying
the requirements of subdivisions (w) through (y) may account for
the programs in subparagraph (1)(D) of this subdivision, but the
same assumptions about these programs shall be used for both the
"Baseline" and "Action" scenarios.
<P>
 (F) Ambient temperatures shall be consistent with those used
to establish the emissions budget in the applicable implementation
plan.  Factors other than temperatures, for example the fraction
of travel in a hot stabilized engine mode, may be modified after
interagency consultation in accordance with subdivision (f)  if
the newer estimates incorporate additional or more geographically
specific information or represent a logically estimated trend
in such factors beyond the period considered in the applicable

<P>
 (A) A network-based transportation demand model or models relating
travel demand and transportation system performance to land-use
patterns, population demographics, employment, transportation
infrastructure, and transportation policies must be used to estimate
travel within the metropolitan planning area of the nonattainment
area.  Such a model shall possess the following attributes:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(i) The modeling methods and the functional relationships used
in the model(s) shall in all respects be in accordance with acceptable
professional practice, and reasonable for purposes of emission
estimation;
<P>
 (ii) The network-based model(s) must be validated against ground
counts for a base year that is not more than 10 years prior to
the date of the conformity determination.  Land use, population,
and other inputs must be based on the best available information
and appropriate to the validation base year;
<P>
 (iii) For peak-hour or peak-period traffic assignments, a capacity
sensitive assignment methodology must be used;
<P>
 (iv) Zone-to-zone travel times used to distribute trips between
origin and destination pairs must be in reasonable agreement with
the travel times which result from the process of assignment of
trips to network links.  Where use of transit currently is anticipated
to be a significant factor in satisfying transportation demand,
these times should also be used for modeling mode splits;
<P>
 (v) Free-flow speeds on network links shall be based on empirical
observations;
<P>
 (vi) Peak and off-peak travel demand and travel times must be
provided;
<P>
 (vii) Trip distribution and mode choice must be sensitive to
pricing, where pricing is a significant factor, if the network
model is capable of such determinations and the necessary information
is available;
<P>
 (viii) The model(s) must utilize and document a logical correspondence
between the assumed scenario of land development and use and the
future transportation system for which emissions are being estimated.
 Reliance on a formal land-use model is not specifically required
but is encouraged;
<P>
 (ix) A dependence of trip generation on the accessibility of
destinations via the transportation system (including pricing)
is strongly encouraged but not specifically required, unless the
network model is capable of such determinations and the necessary
information is available;

 (x) A dependence of regional economic and population growth on
the accessibility of destinations via the transportation system
is strongly encouraged but not specifically required, unless the
network model is capable of such determinations and the necessary
information is available; and

of
vehicle miles traveled shall be considered the primary measure
of vehicle miles traveled within the portion of the nonattainment

included in HPMS, for urban areas which are sampled on a separate
urban area basis.  A factor (or factors) shall be developed to
reconcile and calibrate the network-based model estimates of vehicle
miles traveled in the base year of its validation to the HPMS
estimates for the same period, and these factors shall be applied
to model estimates of future vehicle miles traveled.  In this
factoring process, consideration will be given to differences
in the facility coverage of the HPMS and the modeled network description.
 Departure from these procedures is permitted with the concurrence

area vehicle travel on off-network roadways within the urban transportation
planning area, and on roadways outside the urban transportation

(B) Regional emissions may be estimated by methods which do not
explicitly or comprehensively account for the influence of land
use and transportation infrastructure on vehicle miles traveled
and traffic speeds and congestion.  Such methods must account
for VMT growth by extrapolating historical VMT or projecting future
VMT by considering growth in population and historical growth
trends for vehicle miles travelled per person.  These methods
must also consider future economic activity, transit alternatives,
and transportation system policies.

<P>
 Notwithstanding the other requirements of this subpart, highway
and transit projects of the types listed in Table 3 are exempt
from regional emissions analysis requirements.  The local effects
of these projects with respect to CO or PM10 concentrations must
be considered to determine if a hot-spot analysis is required
prior to making a project-level conformity determination.  These
projects may then proceed to the project development process even
in the absence of a conforming transportation plan and TIP.  A
particular action of the type listed in Table 3 is not exempt
from regional emissions analysis if the MPO in consultation with
other agencies (see clause (f)(3)(A)(iii), the EPA, and the FHWA
(in the case of a highway project) or the FTA (in the case of
a transit project) concur that it has potential regional impacts
for any reason.

in paragraph (3) of this subdivision.
<P>
<LI>Optional conformity procedures.  The State or MPO may voluntarily
develop an attainment demonstration and corresponding motor vehicle
emissions budget like those required in areas with higher nonattainment
classifications.  In this case, the State must submit an implementation
plan revision which contains that budget and attainment demonstration.
 Once EPA has approved this implementation plan revision, the
procedures in subdivisions (s) through (u) apply in lieu of the

implementation plan revision is approved by EPA.  Following EPA
approval of this revision to the applicable implementation plan
(or a portion thereof), the approved (or approved portion of the)
State criteria and procedures would govern conformity determinations.

<P><P><B><A NAME="E9E1" >INTRODUCTION</B>
<P>In this chapter, 1995 air quality in the South Coast Air Basin (Basin),
and in the portions of the Mojave Desert and Salton Sea Air Basins (MDAB/SSAB)
monitored by the South Coast Air Quality Management District (District),
is compared to state and federal ambient air quality standards.  (The MDAB
and SSAB were part of the Southeast Desert Air Basin or SEDAB until May 30,
1996, when the California Air Resources Board adopted the boundaries and
names of the two new air basins.)  For those pollutants which exceeded federal
standards, maps which compare 1995 air quality in different areas of the
Basin have been included.
<P>Nationwide air quality for 1994 is also briefly summarized in this chapter.
 A comparison of air quality in the Basin to other U.S. and California urban
areas is presented in the following pages.
<A ID="E9E2" NAME="E9E2"></A>
<P>
<B>AMBIENT AIR QUALITY STANDARDS</B>
<P>Ambient air quality standards for ozone, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide,
sulfur dioxide, particulate matter (PM<SUB>10</SUB>), and lead have been
set by both the California state and federal governments.  The state has
also set standards for sulfate and visibility.  The ambient air quality standards
for each of these pollutants and their effects on health are summarized in
Table 2-1.
<P>In 1995 the Basin exceeded the federal standards for ozone, carbon monoxide,
and PM<SUB>10</SUB> on a total of 116 days.  In recent years the Basin has
recorded many more days exceeding the federal standards than any other area
of the U.S.
<A ID="E9E3" NAME="E9E3"></A>
<P>
<B>COMPARISON TO OTHER U.S. AREAS</B>
<P>The Basin's severe air pollution problem is a consequence of the combination
of emissions from the nation's second largest urban area and especially adverse
meteorological conditions.  The average wind speed for Los Angeles is the
lowest of the nation's ten largest urban areas.  In addition, the summertime
maximum mixing height (an index of how well pollutants can be dispersed
vertically in the atmosphere) in Southern California averages the lowest
in the U.S.  The Southern California area is also an area with abundant sunshine,
which drives the photochemical reactions which form pollutants such as ozone.

are recorded largely during the spring to early fall months.  By contrast,
exceedances of the federal carbon monoxide standard occur in late fall and
winter.  Exceedances of the federal 24-hour PM<SUB>10</SUB> standard can
occur throughout the year, but occur most frequently in fall and winter.
 Although there are changes in emissions by season, the observed variations
in pollutant concentrations are largely a result of seasonal differences
in weather conditions.
<P>In 1995, the federal standard for ozone was exceeded at one or more Basin
locations on 27 percent of days and the federal carbon monoxide standard
was exceeded on 4 percent of days.  The federal PM<SUB>10</SUB> standard
was exceeded on 10 percent of the days sampled. [ PM 10  is sampled every
sixth day, unlike the gaseous pollutants such as ozone and carbon monoxide
which are sampled continuously.]
<P>Figure 2-1 shows maximum pollutant concentrations in 1994 for the South
Coast Air Basin compared to other urban areas in the U.S. and California.
 Maximum concentrations in these other large U.S. urban areas exceeded the
federal ozone and PM<SUB>10</SUB> standards in some instances, and did not
exceed the carbon monoxide standard.  However several other areas in the
country did report exceedances of the carbon monoxide standard.  In California,
some of the other large urban areas also exceeded the PM<SUB>10</SUB> and
ozone standards, but did  not exceeded the carbon monoxide standard.
<P>The maximum second highest 1-hour average ozone concentration in the Basin
was nearly twice the federal standard.  New York and Houston exceeded by
much less of a margin, and Philadelphia and Washington barely exceeded, while
Chicago did not exceed the standard.  Though New York is a much larger urban
area than Houston, the maximum ozone concentration for Houston equaled that
of New York.  Houston, like Los Angeles, is an area with abundant sunshine
which creates favorable conditions for the photochemical reactions that yield
ozone and other photochemical pollutants.  In California, San Francisco did
not exceed the ozone standard, while the San Diego, Sacramento and Oxnard-Ventura
metropolitan areas each exceeded the standard.  Both the San Diego and
Oxnard-Ventura metropolitan areas are subject to higher ozone levels due
to transport from the South Cost Air Basin.
<P>The maximum 8-hour average carbon monoxide concentration in the Basin
was over one and a half times the federal standard.  The standard was not
exceeded in the other major urban areas depicted in this comparison.
<P>Maximum annual average PM<SUB>10</SUB> concentrations recorded in the
Basin, New York, and Philadelphia exceeded the federal PM<SUB>10</SUB> standard,
and San Diego exceeded very narrowly.  Only Philadelphia recorded a higher
PM<SUB>10</SUB> than the Basin, as a consequence of nearby stationary source
emissions.

<BR>Maximum Pollutant Concentrations as Percentages of the Federal

<P>In 1994, no location in the Basin or any other area of the U.S. exceeded
the nitrogen dioxide standard.  The Los Angeles County portion of the Basin
was the last area of the U.S. to exceed the standard, but has remained in
compliance since 1991.  Sulfur dioxide concentrations in the Basin continued
to remain well below federal standards, and were lower than those in the
urban areas of the Eastern U.S.  Concentrations of sulfur dioxide in urban
areas in the Eastern U.S. have generally been higher than those in the Basin
due to the use of fuels such as coal which have relatively high sulfur content.
<A ID="E9E4" NAME="E9E4"></A>
<P>
<B>CURRENT AIR QUALITY SUMMARY</B>
<P>Figure 2-2 shows the maximum pollutant concentrations for 1995 as percentages
of the state and federal standards.  The maximum ozone concentration exceeded
the federal standard by the widest margin, with a maximum 1-hour average
(0.26 ppm recorded in the Central San Bernardino Mountain area) that was
200 percent of the federal standard.  The highest 8-hour average carbon monoxide
concentration recorded (13.86 ppm in the South Central Los Angeles County
area) was 146 percent of the federal carbon monoxide standard.  The maximum
24-hour average PM<SUB>10</SUB> (219 &#181;g/m<SUP>3</SUP> in the Metropolitan
Riverside County area) was 145 percent of the federal 24-hour standard, and
the maximum annual average PM<SUB>10</SUB> (69 &#181;g/m<SUP>3</SUP> recorded
in Metropolitan Riverside County) was 138 percent of the federal annual
PM<SUB>10</SUB> standard.  The maximum sulfate concentration (26.3
&#181;g/m<SUP>3</SUP> in Metropolitan Riverside County) was 105 percent of
the state sulfate standard.
<P>Concentrations of other pollutants remained below the standards.  The
maximum annual average nitrogen dioxide concentration (0.0464 ppm in the
East San Gabriel Valley and Northwest San Bernardino Valley areas) was 87
percent of the federal standard, while the maximum annual average sulfur
dioxide concentration (0.0030 ppm in South Central Los Angeles County) was
10 percent of the federal standard.  The maximum quarterly average lead
concentration recorded at any District air monitoring station was 4 percent
of the federal standard.  However, higher concentrations of lead (40 percent
of the standard) were recorded at special monitoring locations immediately
adjacent to stationary sources.
<P>Figure 2-3 shows the percent of days on which the federal and state standards
were exceeded in 1995 at the Basin locations which exceeded most frequently.
 The federal ozone standard was exceeded on a maximum of 20 percent of days
(in the East San Gabriel Valley area of Los Angeles County), and the federal
carbon monoxide standard was exceeded on a maximum of 4 percent of days (in
South Central Los Angeles County).  Exceedances of the federal 24-hour
PM<SUB>10</SUB> standard were recorded on a maximum of 7 percent of days
sampled (Metropolitan Riverside County), while the state sulfate standard
was exceeded on a maximum of 2 percent of days sampled (Metropolitan Riverside
County).

<P>Detailed analyses of current air quality and statistics for all monitoring
areas are contained in Appendix II.  The following sections present summary
information on health effects and how frequently, and by how much of a margin,
different areas of the Basin and MDAB/SSAB exceeded the federal and state
ambient air quality standards in 1995.

<B><U>Health Effects</U></B>
<P>Individuals exercising outdoors, children and people with preexisting
lung disease such as asthma and chronic pulmonary lung disease are considered
to be susceptible the most sub-groups for ozone effects.  Short-term exposures
(lasting for a few hours) to ozone at levels typically observed in Southern
California can result in breathing pattern changes, reduction of breathing
capacity, increased susceptibility to infections, inflammation of the lung
tissue, and some immunological changes.  In recent years, a correlation between
elevated ambient ozone levels and increases in daily hospital admission rates,
as well as mortality has also been reported.<P>Ozone exposure under exercising conditions is known to increase the severity
of the above mentioned responses observed.  Similarly, animal studies suggest
that exposures to a combination of pollutants which include ozone is more
toxic than exposure to ozone alone.  Although lung volume and resistance
changes observed after a single exposure diminish with repeated exposures,
biochemical and cellular changes appear to persist, which can lead to subsequent
lung structural changes.  The cancer causing potential of ozone exposure
identified in some studies needs further evaluation to draw any definitive
conclusions.

<B><U>Air Quality</U></B>
<P>In 1995, the South Coast Air Quality Management District monitored ozone
concentrations at 33 locations in the Basin and MDAB/SSAB.  In the Basin,

widely by area (Figure 2-4).  Areas along the immediate coast did not exceed
the federal standard, due in large part to the prevailing sea breeze which
transports polluted air inland before high ozone concentrations can be reached.
 In addition, some inland areas which are remote from urban areas of the
Basin did not exceed the standard.  The standard was exceeded most frequently
in the inland valleys extending from East San Fernando Valley through the
San Gabriel Valley into the Riverside-San Bernardino area, and in the adjacent
mountains.  The East San Gabriel Valley recorded the greatest number of
exceedances of the federal standard (73 days), health advisory level (48
days) and Stage I episode level (9 days).  The greatest number of state standard
exceedances (123 days) was recorded in the East San Bernardino Valley area.

<P>A consistent association between increasing ambient CO levels and excess
admissions for heart diseases, such as congestive heart failure, is observed
in many cities across the United States.  Individuals with deficient blood
supply to the heart are more susceptible to the adverse effects of CO exposure.
 The effects observed include earlier onset of chest pain with exercise,
and electrocardiograph changes indicative of worsening oxygen supply to the
heart.
<P>Inhaled CO has no direct toxic effect on the lungs, but exerts its effect
on tissues by interfering with oxygen transport by competing with oxygen
to combine with hemoglobin present in the blood to form carboxyhemoglobin
(COHb).  Hence, conditions with an increased demand for oxygen supply can
be adversely affected  by exposure to CO. Examples include fetal development,
chronic hypoxemia (oxygen deficiency) as seen in high altitudes, anemia,
and diseases involving heart and blood vessels.
<P>Reduction in birth weight and impaired neurobehavioral development have
been observed in animals chronically exposed to CO resulting in COHb levels
similar to those observed in smokers.

<P>A consistent correlation between elevated ambient PM<SUB>10</SUB> levels
and an increase in mortality rates, respiratory infections, number and severity
of asthma attacks and the number of hospital admissions has been observed
in different parts of the United States and various areas around the world.
 Although the concentrations and/or combinations of pollutants are significantly
different in these studies, most of the PM<SUB>10</SUB><SUB> </SUB>levels
recorded in these studies are lower than those observed in the South Coast
Air Basin.
<P>In recent years, some studies have reported an association between long-term
exposure to air pollution dominated by fine particles and increased mortality,
reduction in life-span, and the possibility of an increased incidence of
cancer.
<P>Daily fluctuations in PM<SUB>10</SUB> levels have also been related to
acute respiratory hospital admissions in children, to school and kindergarten
absences, to a decrease in respiratory lung volumes in normal children and
to increased medication use in children and adults with asthma.
<P>The elderly, people with pre-existing respiratory and/or cardiovascular
disease and children appear to be susceptible to the effects of
PM<SUB>10</SUB>.  There is a growing consensus among the scientific community
that the fine fraction of PM<SUB>10</SUB> is relatively more toxic than the
coarse fraction and is responsible for the majority of effects observed.

<P>PM<SUB>10</SUB> concentrations were monitored at 21 locations by the South
Coast Air Quality Management District in 1995.  Maximum 24-hour and annual
average concentrations are shown in Tables 2-4 and 2-5.  The maximum 24-hour
PM<SUB>10</SUB> concentration recorded in the Basin (219
&#181;g/m<SUP>3</SUP> in the Metropolitan Riverside County area) was 145
percent of the federal standard and 429 percent of the state standard.  The
maximum was associated with high winds, but other exceedances of the federal
standard not associated with high winds were recorded.  Maximum concentrations
in all four of the Basin counties exceeded the federal 24-hour standard.
 The maximum annual average PM<SUB>10</SUB> (69 &#181;g/m<SUP>3</SUP> in
Metropolitan Riverside County) was 138 percent of the federal annual standard.
 The  federal annual standard was exceeded in Riverside and San Bernardino
Counties but not in Los Angeles or Orange Counties.  The much more stringent
state annual standard was exceeded in all areas of the Basin.
<P>In 1995, both annual and 24-hour maximum concentrations of PM<SUB>10</SUB>
in the Los Angeles County portion of the MDAB were below the federal standards.
 However in the Riverside County area of the SSAB, both standards were exceeded.
 The maximum 24-hour PM<SUB>10</SUB> concentration (199
&#181;g/m<SUP>3</SUP> in the Coachella Valley) was 132 percent of the federal
24-hour standard, and was associated with high winds in the desert areas.
 The maximum annual average PM<SUB>10</SUB> concentration (52.0
&#181;g/m<SUP>3</SUP> in the Coachella Valley) was 104 percent of the federal
annual standard.  It should be noted that the exclusion of the high wind
event day reduces the annual average to 49.5 &#181;g/m<SUP>3</SUP>, or 99
percent of the standard.

<P>Population-based studies suggest that an increase in acute respiratory
illness, including infections and respiratory symptoms in children (not infants),
is associated with long-term exposures to NO<SUB>2</SUB> at levels found
in homes with gas stoves, which are higher than ambient levels found in Southern
California.  Increase in resistance to air flow and airway contraction without
any effect on lung volumes (breathing capacity) is observed after short-term
exposure to NO<SUB>2</SUB> in healthy subjects.  Larger decreases in lung
volumes are observed in individuals with asthma and/or chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (e.g., chronic bronchitis, emphysema) than in healthy
individuals, following exposure to lower levels of NO<SUB>2</SUB>, indicating
the greater susceptibility of these sub-groups.
<P>In animals, exposure to levels of NO<SUB>2</SUB> considerably higher than
ambient concentrations results in increased susceptibility to infections,
possibly due to the observed changes in cells involved in maintaining immune
functions.  The severity of lung tissue damage associated with high levels
of ozone exposure increases when animals are exposed to a combination of
ozone and NO<SUB>2</SUB>.

mortality and morbidity effects are observable with an increase in ambient
sulfate concentrations.  However, efforts to separate the effects of sulfates
from the effects of other pollutants, including ozone, have not been successful.
<P>Clinical studies of asthmatics exposed to sulfuric acid suggest that
adolescent asthmatics are probably a subgroup susceptible to acid aerosol
exposure.  Animal studies suggest that acidic particles such as sulfuric
acid aerosol and ammonium bisulfate are probably more toxic than non-acidic
particles like ammonium sulfate.  Whether the effects are attributable to
acidity or to particles remains unresolved.  However, the severity of effects
observed appears to be greater in population studies from the eastern United

<B><U>Health Effects</U></B>
<P>Fetuses, infants, and children are more sensitive than others to the adverse
effects of lead exposure.  Exposure to low levels of lead can adversely affect
the development and function of the central nervous system, leading to learning
disorders, distractibility, inability to follow simple commands, and lower
intelligence quotient.  In adults, increased lead levels are associated with
increased blood pressure.
<P>Lead poisoning can cause anemia, lethargy, seizures and death.  It appears
that there are no direct effects of lead on the respiratory system.  Lead
can  be stored in the bone from early-age environmental exposure, and elevated
blood lead levels can occur due to breakdown of bone tissue during pregnancy,
hyperthyroidism (increased secretion of hormones from the thyroid gland)
and osteoporosis (breakdown of bony tissue).  Fetuses and breastfed babies
can be exposed to higher levels of lead because of previous environmental
lead exposure of their mothers.
<A ID="E11E13" NAME="E11E13"></A>
<P>
<B><U>Air Quality</U></B>
<P>The federal and state standards for lead were not exceeded in any area
of the District in 1995.  There have been no violations of the standards
at the District's regular air monitoring stations since 1982 as a result
of removal of lead from gasolines.  However, special monitoring stations
immediately adjacent to stationary sources of lead have recorded exceedances
of the standards in very localized areas of the Basin as recently as 1991
for the federal standard and 1994 for the state standard.  Table 2-9 shows
the maximum concentrations recorded in 1995.
<P>The maximum quarterly average lead concentration (0.06
&#181;g/m<SUP>3</SUP> at several Los Angeles County sites) recorded at  District
air monitoring stations was 4 percent of the federal standard.  The highest
quarterly average lead concentration (0.60 &#181;g/m<SUP>3</SUP> in Southeast
Los Angeles County) measured at special monitoring locations immediately
adjacent to stationary sources of lead was 40 percent of the federal standard.
<P>The maximum monthly average lead concentration at the regular monitoring
stations (.07 &#181;g/m<SUP>3</SUP> at several Los Angeles County locations)
was 5 percent of the state standard, and the maximum at the special monitoring
sites immediately adjacent to sources (0.62 &#181;g/m<SUP>3</SUP> in Southeast
Los Angeles County) was 41 percent of the standard.

<P>
<B>Visibility Specific Information</B>
<P>Air pollution induced visibility degradation in the Basin is due primarily
to particulate matter.  On some days, the presence of water droplets may
contribute significantly to visibility reduction.  Days for which this is
true are removed by excluding days on which the relative humidity was greater
than 70 percent from consideration when determining compliance with the standard
<P>In 1995, visual range data were collected at two locations in the Basin.
 Both sites exceeded the state standard by a significant margin.  The standard
was exceeded on a maximum of 35 percent of days in the only area (East San
Gabriel Valley area of Los Angeles County) for which complete data were
available.
<A ID="E10E10" NAME="E10E10"></A>
<P><B>Summary</B>
<P>In 1995, the Basin continued to exceed federal and state standards for
ozone, PM<SUB>10</SUB>, and carbon monoxide, and the state standard for sulfate
and visibility.  The MDAB/SSAB areas continued to exceed standards for ozone
and PM<SUB>10</SUB>.  However for PM<SUB>10</SUB>, the removal of one high
wind natural event in the Coachella Valley results in MDAB/SSAB meeting the
federal PM<SUB>10</SUB> standards, but not the state PM<SUB>10</SUB> standards.
<P>The Basin exceeded one or more federal standards on nearly one third of
the days of the year.  Maximum concentrations of PM<SUB>10</SUB> and carbon
monoxide were nearly one and one-half times the federal standards, and the
maximum ozone concentration was twice the federal standard.

</P>

<P><A NAME="WHAT IS"></A><B>What is Title V?</B></P>

<P>Title V is the name of a new program to standardize permits and the
permitting process for major sources of emissions across the country. It
will require more than 1000 of the largest facilities in the AQMD to obtain
new, more comprehensive permits over the next three years. Each permit
will be subject to US EPA&nbsp;review.</P>

<P><A HREF="http://www.epa.gov/oar/oaq_caa.html">Title V of the 1990 federal
Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA)</A> required the Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) to establish a national, federally enforceable operating permit
program. Accordingly, EPA published <A HREF="http://law.house.gov/cfr.htm">Title
40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 1, Part 70 (Part 70)</A>,
which requires each state or local permitting authority to develop and
submit a federally enforceable facility operating permit program for EPA
approval. </P>

<P>Title V is intended to further facilitate and enhance air quality planning,
emission controls, and compliance, and to improve existing emission inventories.
</P>

<P>In addition to existing AQMD regulations, Title V provides for: </P>

<UL>
<P> EPA veto authority over permit issuance,<BR>
 Greater opportunity for federal and citizen enforcement,<BR>
 Enhanced public participation during the permit issuance process,<BR>
 Clearer determination of applicable requirements; and <BR>
 Improved enforceability of applicable requirements. <BR>
</P>
</UL>

<P>AQMD adopted <A HREF="/rules/html/tofc30.html">Regulation
XXX</A> rules on October 8, 1993, to meet the requirements of Part 70 and
to interface the Title V permitting effort with AQMDs existing comprehensive
permit program. <A HREF="/rules/html/tofc30.html">Regulation
XXX</A> rules were amended August 11, 1995, to clarify requirements necessary
to gain EPA interim program approval.<A HREF="/rules/html/reg5.html#r518">
Rule 518</A> and <A HREF="/rules/html/reg5.html#r5181">Rule
518.1</A> were also amended August 11, 1995, to address Hearing Board procedures
for Title V facilities and permit appeal procedures for Title V facilities,
respectively. <A HREF="/rules/html/reg5.html#r5182">Rule
518.2</A> was adopted January 12, 1996, to provide a procedure for federal
recognition of variances through alternative operating conditions. </P>

<P>AQMD expects interim approval of its Title V program on October 28,
1996. Under federal law, all Title V facilities must apply for permits
within one year of the October 28, 1996, effective date, and AQMD must
issue all permits within three years of the effective date at the rate
of at least one-third of the permits per year. Therefore, AQMD has divided
the Title V universe into Groups A, B, and C. In order to issue one-third
of the permits (i.e., Group A) in the first program year, AQMD will require
all Group A facilities to submit initial Title V permit applications within
three months of the effective date. </P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Compliance Assurance </H2>

<hr><BR>


<P>One of AQMD's key tasks is to assure compliance with <A HREF="/rules/rulesreg.html">air
quality rules and regulations </A>and with state and federal air quality
statutes to achieve and sustain <A HREF="/aqmp/97draft/main/ch2/ch20618.html">air
quality standards</A> throughout the South Coast Air Basin.</P>

<P>AQMD does this through a multi-faceted effort that couples traditional
enforcement activities -- such as <A HREF="/comply/compgui.html">inspections</A>
and <A HREF="/comply/airprob.html">public complaint
response</A> -- with a full range of <A HREF="/comply/flyer.html">educational</A>
and <A HREF="/comply/sm_bus.html">technical assistance</A>
programs.</P>

<P><B>Traditional Enforcement</B></P>

<P>Under clean air law, the federal EPA has set health-based standards
for ambient air quality. AQMD's mission is to develop and maintain a <A HREF="/aqmp/">plan</A>
for reducing pollution to meet those standards and to implement that plan
though adopting <U>regulations </U>that set emissions limits. AQMD administers
these regulations through air pollution control <A HREF="/permit/">permits</A>
that set emissions limits and operating conditions on some 30,000 individual
facilities.</P>

<P>AQMD inspects facilities periodically to ensure that permit operating
conditions and emissions limits are being met and maintained. Inspectors
also respond to <A HREF="/comply/airprob.html">air quality
complaints reported </A>by the public. According to AQMD's compliance policy,
when inspectors find violations they will write either a <A HREF="/comply/nov.html">Notice
of Violation </A>(usually emissions-related), which can involve penalties,
or a <A HREF="/comply/ntcmply.html">Notice to Comply</A>
(usually administrative in nature), which does not carry penalties as long
as the facility owners/operators make any needed corrections in a timely
manner. </P>

<P>In handling violations, AQMD carefully considers all the facts and circumstances
under its <A HREF="/comply/policy.html#general">General
Compliance Policy</A>. If a facility has a good compliance record and other
requirements are met, the violation may be resolved under AQMD's <A HREF="/comply/policy.html#creative">Creative
Penalty Policy</A>, which allows the use of measures which will create
a direct or indirect air pollution benefit, instead of cash, as a form
of civil penalty. AQMD also gives special treatment under its <A HREF="/comply/policy.html#self-auditing">Self-Auditing
Penalty Policy</A> to facilities that promptly report violations discovered
through self-auditing, including a waiver or significant reduction of civil
penalties.</P>

<P><B>Assistance Emphasized</B></P>

<P>As AQMD continues its traditional enforcement efforts with a steady
commitment to inspecting large facilities, there is an increasing emphasis
on education and technical assistance, particularly with small- and medium-sized
businesses. Among the many forms of assistance now available are:</P>

<P><BR>
</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="/comply/flyer.html">Compliance classes</A>
explaining how to follow the rules; </LI>

<LI><A HREF="/comply/sm_bus.html">Technical consultations</A>
during which AQMD will make recommendations on how to comply most economically
without the fear of enforcement action as long as compliance is achieved
in a reasonable time; and </LI>

<LI>Loan guarantees for small businesses that must purchase pollution control
equipment.</LI>
</UL>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>AQMD has also moved to streamline its <A HREF="/permit/">permit
application</A> review process, and to provide more regulatory flexibility
through market-based compliance options (such as scrapping old cars).</P>

<P><B>High Compliance Level</B> </P>

<P>AQMD has found that the vast majority of businesses in the region do
their best to comply with air pollution control standards. By emphasizing
education and technical assistance, technical consultations, and self-auditing
strategies, AQMD helps sources achieve a higher level of compliance with
pollution control rules. In 1995, for instance, AQMD carried out 13,930
inspections. Only 866 <A HREF="/comply/nov.html">Notices
of Violation</A> were issued for emissions-related violations of air quality
rules. For administrative violations, 1667 <A HREF="/comply/ntcmply.html">Notices to Comply </A>were issued.

<CENTER>
<h2><B>COMPLIANCE GUIDELINES</B></h2></CENTER>
<p><center><img src="/icon/line4.gif" border=0 ></center></p>
<h3><B>The inspection process</h3></h3>
<P>
AQMD Inspectors use their observations of industrial and commercial processes and equipment to determine compliance with AQMD <A HREF="/rules/rulesreg.html">rules and regulations</A>, policies and state law (California Health and Safety Code).  Although each inspection is unique, a series of general guidelines govern inspection procedures in the field.
<BR>
<H3>
<B>What happens before an inspection?</B></H3>

Inspections are generally unannounced.  Before AQMD Inspectors enter a facility, they review the facility&#146;s files to become familiar with its equipment, processes, emissions, and compliance history, and to identify the rules and regulations, and permit conditions that govern its operation.
<P>
As Inspectors approach a facility, they make general observations about the immediate surroundings to look for evidence of fugitive emissions (odors, paint overspray, vegetation damage, etc.).  They also look for excess <A HREF="/rules/html/r401.html">visible emissions</A> (smoke) produced by the operation
<BR>
<H3>
<B>What happens during an inspection?</B></H3>
<P>
AQMD Inspectors are authorized to enter and inspect facilities under Section 41510 of the California Health and Safety Code.  Upon entry, the Inspector presents proper AQMD identification, then informs a facility representative of the purpose and scope of the inspection and the procedures that will be followed.  During this opening conference, Inspectors typically describe new requirements, <A HREF="/permit/fees.html">fees</A>, or other issued related to compliance, and answer any preliminary questions before being escorted by the facility representative through the facility.
<P>
During the inspection itself, the Inspector looks to see if the proper <A HREF="/permit/perm_net.html">permits</A> (photocopies are acceptable) are posted near the equipment.  Inspectors may ask the facility representative to describe the types of equipment at the facility, and how each type is used and maintained.  All conditions, practices, and other relevant observations are noted, and those which are unusual or which may create problems are recorded and described in detail.
<P>
Inspectors frequently request copies of production or usage records, and may also take samples or photographs as appropriate to further support their observations of facility operations.  Throughout the inspection, Inspectors explain the inspection process and respond within their ability and authority to questions raised by the facility representative.
<BR>
<H3>
<B>What information might an inspector request during an inspection?</B></H3>
<P>
To facilitate the inspection process, facility representatives are encouraged to provide AQMD Inspectors with the following basic information:

<UL>
<P>
<LI> Any changes to the listed name and address of facility.
<LI> Names, titles, and telephone numbers of facility representatives.
<LI> Maps showing the location of the facility and its geographic relationship to residences or other neighboring sites potentially affected by emissions.
<LI> Facility layout plans showing the location of all permitted and unpermitted process and control equipment.
<LI> Flowsheets identifying sources, control devices, monitors, and other features of the operation.
<LI> Description and design data for control devices and relevant process equipment.
<LI> Baseline performance data for control equipment.
<LI> Process and production information.
<LI> Sources of emissions and locations of emission points.
<LI> Product invoices and operating, throughput, usage records.
<LI> Self-monitoring data and reports, including self-inspection and equipment maintenance checklists.

</UL>

<H3>
<B>What happens after an inspection?</B></H3>
<P>
During the closing conference, the Inspector continues to answer any questions raised by the facility representative, referring questions and problems to other AQMD personnel when necessary.
<P>
The Inspector gathers any other information needed to complete the overall determination of compliance, and suggests available resources, including technical publications or special services available to industry.  Inspectors will discuss their findings with facility representatives before leaving the premises, and later document these findings in written inspection reports.
<P>
Instances of non-compliance are identified as appropriate, and documented in <a href = "/comply/ntcmply.html">Notices to Comply</a>  or <A HREF="/comply/nov.html">Notices of Violation</A> which are issued to the facility.
<BR></BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>
<B>Compliance with source-specific rule requirements is only part </B>
  of the clean air picture</B></H3>
<P>
Most AQMD rules and permit conditions are designed to limit or control emissions from specific types of equipment and/or processes.   But compliance with these source-specific permit conditions and rules requirements is only part of the clean air picture.
<P>
Sources which create visible emissions or a public nuisance may be cited for failure to comply with AQMD <A HREF="/rules/html/r401.html">Rule 401</A> (Visible Emissions) or <A HREF="/rules/html/r402.html">Rule 402</A> (Public Nuisance) even when they are in full compliance with all other applicable permit conditions and rule requirements.
<P>
Visible emissions violations can occur when a source produces uncontrolled smoke, dust, or other particulate matter that reduces visibility and impedes air quality.  AQMD inspectors trained to evaluate visible emissions determine whether the relative opacity (density) of airborne particulate matter is great enough to warrant enforcement action.
<P>
Public nuisance violations can occur when a number of individuals complain to AQMD of odors, paint overspray, or other bothersome conditions that appear to be related to the operation of a business in the neighboring vicinity.  An AQMD inspector may be dispatched to investigate such complaints in order to determine whether an alleged source is jeopardizing the public health, safety, or welfare, or creating local property damage.
<P>
Owners and operators of businesses with a high potential for generating odors, overspray, smoke, or other &quot;fugitive emissions&quot; that can threaten public health and welfare should take special precautions to avoid creating visible emissions or a public nuisance.
<P>
Using a paint spray booth or other equipment designed to capture volatile emissions, operating during hours when fewer people are likely to be affected by odors and fumes, and ensuring that pollution control equipment is well-maintained and functioning properly are among the many ways in which instances of non-compliance can be avoided.

<img src="/icon/line4.gif" border=0  >
</CENTER></B>
<P>The AQMD Prosecutor&#146;s Office is committed to fair, reasonable, and firm treatment of regulated sources.  Staff investigators process incoming Notices of Violation, many of which are resolved through the Mutual Settlement Agreement program, conduct compliance investigations, and provide administrative support for law enforcement agencies on Notices of Violation referred for criminal prosecution.  Staff attorneys manage hearing board and civil penalty cases, provide a broad range of legal counsel and representation to AQMD on compliance-related matters, interact with other government agencies on emergency and ongoing environmental matters, and participate in community outreach activities for the benefit of the regulated community, the environmental community, the organized bar, and the public.

<P><B>JUDGING EACH VIOLATION INDIVIDUALLY</B>
<P>As a matter of state law, a judge or jury is obligated to evaluate each violation individually and with reference to all facts and circumstances.  This is an important legislative policy that the Prosecutor&#146;s Office follows in negotiating settlements. By evaluating each case individually and pursuing creative penalties wherever appropriate, the office has placed a major emphasis on balancing economic and environmental concerns.  This policy recognizes that what might be a fair penalty for a large company might not be for a small company, despite the fact that the same rule was violated.

<P>AQMD considers such factors as the financial burden to the violator or the action taken to correct the violation, thus allowing a &#147;sliding scale&#148; in negotiating the appropriate penalty.  Without such a policy, all violators would have to be treated exactly alike without regard for the factors which can make one violation different from another.  The California Health and Safety Code requires that the following factors be considered in assessing penalties:
<UL><P> (a) The extent of harm caused by the violation.
<P> (b) The nature and persistence of the violation.
<P> (c) The length of time over which the violation occurs.
<P> (d) The frequency of past violations.
<P> (e) The record of maintenance.
<P> (f) The unproven or innovative nature of the control equipment.
<P> (g) Any action taken by the defendant to mitigate the violation.
<P> (h) The financial burden to the defendant.</UL>
<P>While it is clearly important for the AQMD to enforce air pollution regulations to comply with federal and state law and to protect public health, it is also important to recognize that the regulated community is made up of all kinds and sizes of businesses.  The legislative policy of individualized attention to air pollution violations allows the AQMD to carry forth with its legal obligations and mandates while carefully judging all of the circumstances of each air pollution violation.

<P>The successful implementation of this policy has resulted in fair and reasonable penalty assessments and has led to the development of a nationally recognized &#147;creative penalty&#148; program that has balanced economic and environmental concerns in a fair and effective manner.  Whether the penalty involves money or a creative measure contributing to air quality, the policy of the Prosecutor&#146;s Office is the same; that is, each case is carefully reviewed for the most appropriate penalty assessment.

<A NAME="creative"></A>
<P><B><CENTER> CREATIVE PENALTY POLICY</CENTER></B>
<P>Creative penalties represent an opportunity to use measures which will create a direct or indirect air pollution benefit, instead of cash, as a form of civil penalty.  Depending upon the circumstances of the case, a creative penalty typically involves a change of process, equipment, material, environmental clean up, indirect source reduction, or public outreach for the purposes of eliminating or reducing air contaminant emissions.
<P><B>ELIGIBILITY</B>
<P>A creative penalty is a measure that &#147;generally&#148; is not available to &#147;bad actors&#148; or to a company that has caused a toxic air pollution violation.  If the source fits the bad actor profile set forth below, a creative penalty may not be pursued unless expressly approved by the District Prosecutor.  This exception is to handle circumstances where a creative penalty may be extremely useful and/or necessary.

<P>In determining whether a source is a &#147;bad actor,&#148; the Prosecutor&#146;s Office applies the following:
<OL><LI> <B>Compliance History.  </B>The overall number, frequency, and severity of past violations demonstrate a clear disregard for AQMD rules and regulations, or;
<P><LI> <B>Violation in Question.  </B>The type and severity of the violation(s) in question is/are such that a serious risk to public health and safety or to the environment was threatened or occurred, or;
<P><LI> <B>Response to Violation.  </B>Following receipt of the Notice of Violation, the source operator failed or refused to acknowledge the violation, mitigate the harm, and/or cooperate with the AQMD in investigating or resolving the matter.</OL>

<P><B>CRAFTING THE PENALTY</B>
<P>The creative measures fashioned as a penalty must be designed to produce the broadest air quality benefit possible.  Offers to the District of products or benefits are never allowed.  The creative penalty must benefit the public and/or the environment.

<P>The creative penalty must be a measure over and above the cost to the source operator to come into compliance.  A fundamental tenet of the Prosecutor&#146;s settlement practice is that a settlement is possible <U>only</U> after the source operator has come into compliance.  No part of the cost or effort undertaken to achieve compliance may be considered to be part of the creative penalty (or any penalty) because although the penalty may be creative, it is nevertheless a penalty.

<P>Creative penalties must not be designed to &#147;reward&#148; the violator.  Accordingly, each measure undertaken as a creative penalty is designated in writing by the District with a compliance date, and increments of progress, if applicable.

<P>As stated above, these measures must be designed to produce the broadest air quality benefit possible.  In furtherance of this, the Prosecutor&#146;s Office coordinates, where appropriate, with relevant AQMD divisions to design and designate the appropriate creative penalty assessment.  Such divisions receive a copy of the settlement agreement ten days after completion in order to facilitate compliance tracking.  The Prosecutor&#146;s Investigations Unit also tracks the settlements to insure compliance.

<A NAME="self-auditing"></A>
<P><B><CENTER>SELF-AUDITING PENALTY POLICY</CENTER></B>

<P>It is the policy of the Prosecutor&#146;s Office to support companies which audit its own facilities and correct any AQMD rule violations in a timely manner.  Depending on the circumstances of the case, a penalty sought for a violation discovered through self-auditing and promptly reported to the AQMD should be significantly reduced or when appropriate, waived in order to encourage all facilities to implement an effective self-auditing program.

<P>The Prosecutor&#146;s Office&#146;s self auditing penalty policy is founded on the basic principle that violations which are self-audited, disclosed and corrected warrant penalties that are consistently and predictable lower than penalties for violations which are discovered by the AQMD.

<P>This penalty policy is structured to provide an incentive for facilities to self-audit so that violations will be promptly found and corrected, thereby minimizing any harm to the environment.
<P><B>ELIGIBILITY</B>
<P>To determine whether a company is <B>eligible</B> for a reduced or waived penalty, the following criteria must be met:
<OL><LI> The violation was <B>discovered</B> by the facility without any participation by the AQMD or other regulatory agency.
<P><LI>The violation was <B>reported voluntarily</B> by the facility, i.e. without any requirement to do so by law, regulation, permit or agreement.
<P><LI>The violation was reported promptly by the facility to appropriate AQMD staff, as soon as possible after discovery.
<P><LI> The violation was <B>corrected promptly and effectively</B> by the facility to reduce or eliminate all emissions and to prevent reoccurrence of the violation.</OL>

<P>In all cases, the company or facility seeking the penalty waiver or reduction must provide sufficient documentation to the Prosecutor&#146;s Office to prove eligibility for the application of this policy and must bear the burden of persuasion that waiver or reduction is appropriate.

<P>There are circumstances under which a violation, even if discovered pursuant to self-auditing and voluntarily reported, would not be eligible for a reduced or waived penalty.  To determine whether a company is <B>ineligible</B> for a reduced penalty, the following criteria must be considered:
<OL><LI> The violation was the result of <B>knowing, willful</B> or <B>intentional conduct</B> or was the result of <B>gross negligence</B>.
<P><LI> The violation resulted in the emissions of any <B>toxic</B> air contaminant.
<P><LI>The violation created a <B>public nuisance</B>.
<P><LI>The company or facility has a <B>prior history</B> of the same violation.</OL>

<P><B>CRAFTING THE PENALTY</B>
<P><B>Penalty Waiver</B>
<BR>Under certain limited circumstances, it may be appropriate to waive a penalty.  Penalty waivers should be used sparingly.  Often, a creative penalty may be a more appropriate alternative to a penalty waiver.  Please note that under no circumstances may a penalty be waived without the prior approval of the District Prosecutor.
<P>The following circumstances indicate that a penalty waiver <B>may</B> be appropriate:
<OL><LI> The violation occurred despite the good faith efforts on the part of the facility to comply with all rules and regulations.
<P><LI>The facility has a history of good compliance and cooperation with the AQMD&#146;s enforcement efforts.
<P><LI>The violation did not result in significant harm to the environment or any risk to public health.
<P><LI> the facility, upon discovery of the violation, took immediate and effective action under appropriate technical supervision to cease or remediate the violation and avoid repeated violations, and agrees in writing with the AQMD to take any further action necessary to address to violation in a manner that is acceptable to the AQMD.
<P><LI>The violation did not result in any economic gain or competitive advantage to the company facility.</OL>
<P><B>Penalty Reduction</B>
<BR>In those cases where any of the above conditions set forth for penalty waiver have not been met, or where other circumstances indicate that a waiver is not warranted, the Prosecutor&#146;s Office will consider all legal and factual circumstances to determine the extent to which a penalty associated with a violation discovered through self-auditing and voluntarily reported to the AQMD should be reduced.
<P>As is always the case when seeking a penalty, the Prosecutor&#146;s Office must consider all factors set forth in the California Health and Safety Code.
<P>In all cases, the Prosecutor&#146;s Office may seek to recover any economic benefit afforded to the company or facility as a result of the violation.
<P><B>QUESTIONS AND FURTHER INFORMATION</B>
<P>If you have any questions about these policies or would like further information about the AQMD&#146;s Prosecutor&#146;s Office, please contact the Duty Deputy at (909) 396-3400 or send your question by e-mail to <I>ddeputy@aqmd.gov</I>.

<P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<LI>The provisions of an AECP shall be submitted by the District
to the Air Resources Board (ARB) for submittal to the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) as a source-specific revision to the State
Implementation Plan (SIP).  Sources which obtain an approved AECP
from the District remain subject to federal enforcement of existing
SIP limits pending federal approval of the AECP as a source-specific
SIP revision pursuant to Section 110 (a)(3)(A) of the Clean Air
Act.
<P>
<LI>The provisions of this rule shall apply to all stationary
sources of VOC emissions currently complying with a District rule
by means of an AECP or Equivalency Plan.  A stationary source
may continue to achieve compliance through an existing Plan for
a period not to exceed 180 days from date of Plan submission in
accordance with the schedule set forth in paragraph (e).
<P>
<LI>Each permit unit to be included in an AECP shall have been
in operation pursuant to District permit or pursuant to Rule 219
prior to the submittal of the AECP application.
<P>
</OL>
(c) Definitions
<P>
<OL>
<LI>ALTERNATIVE EMISSION CONTROL PLAN (AECP) is a plan which allows
a source to demonstrate an alternative method of rule compliance.
<P>
<LI>BASELINE EMISSIONS are the product of three factors expressed
as lbs VOC/day (see (d)(7)).  The factors are emissions rate,
capacity utilization, and hours of operation.
<P>
<LI>EMISSION REDUCTIONS:
<P>
 (A) ENFORCEABLE means the operating conditions which qualify
the AECP for approval are included in a Permit to Operate enforced
by the District and the AECP is submitted as a source-specific
SIP revision.
<P>
 (B) PERMANENT means the AECP contains permit conditions which
ensure the emission reductions from the baseline are achieved
for each and every operating day and the AECP is submitted as
a source-specific SIP revision.
<P>
 (C) QUANTIFIABLE means emissions must be able to be measured
before and after the reduction using the same test method and
averaging time.
<P>
 (D) SURPLUS means the emission reductions are not required by
current SIP regulations, are not a measure in Tier I of the Air
Quality Management Plan, or relied upon for SIP planning purposes,
and are not used by the source to meet any other regulatory requirements.
 Surplus emission reductions shall be determined by using an appropriate
baseline as described under (d)(7).
<P>
<LI>EQUIVALENCY PLAN is the same as an AECP.
<P>
<LI>MODIFICATION means any physical change, change in method of
operation of, or addition to, an existing stationary source, requiring
an application for permit to construct.  Routine maintenance and/or
repair shall not be considered a physical change.  A change in
the method of operation of equipment, unless previously limited
by an enforceable permit condition, shall not include:
<P>
 (A) an increase in the production rate, unless such increase
will cause the maximum design capacity of the equipment to be
exceeded; or
<P>
 (B) an increase in the hours of operation; or
<P>
 (C) a change in ownership of a source.
<P>
<LI>PERMIT UNIT means any article, machine, equipment, or other
contrivance, or combination thereof, which may cause or control
the issuance of air contaminants, and which:
<P>
 (A) requires a written permit pursuant to Rules 201 and/or 203;
or
<P>
 (B) is in operation pursuant to the provisions of Rule 219.
<P>
<LI>PLAN refers to an Alternative Emission Control Plan.
<P>
<LI>REASONABLY AVAILABLE CONTROL TECHNOLOGY (RACT) is the lowest
emission limit established through District regulations for a
particular source.
<P>
<LI>STATE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN is the State (District) prepared
plan, approved by the EPA, detailing how National Ambient Air
Quality Standards will be achieved and maintained.
<P>
<LI>STATIONARY SOURCE is any permit unit or grouping of permit
units or other air contaminant-emitting activities which are located
on one or more contiguous properties within the District, in actual
physical contact or separated solely by a public roadway or other
public right-of-way, and which are owned or operated by the same
person (or by persons under common control).  Such above-described
groupings, if non-contiguous, but connected only by land carrying
a pipeline, shall not be considered one stationary source.
<P>
<LI>TRANSFER EFFICIENCY (TE) is the ratio of the weight or volume
of coating solids deposited on an object to the total weight or
volume of coating solids used in a coating application step expressed
as a percentage.
<P>
<LI> VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUND (VOC) is any volatile compound
of carbon, excluding methane, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide,
carbonic acid, metallic carbides or carbonates, ammonium carbonate,
1,1,1 trichloroethane, methylene chloride, trifluoromethane (FC-23),
trichlorotrifluoroethane (CFC-113), dichlorodifluoromethane (CFC-12),
trichlorofluoromethane (CFC-11), chlorodifluoromethane (HCFC-22),
dichlorotetrafluoroethane (CFC-114), chloropentafluoroethane (CFC-115),
dichlorotrifluoroethane (HCFC-123), tetrafluoroethane (HFC-134a),
dichlorofluoroethane (HCFC-141b), and chlorodifluoroethane (HCFC-142b).
<P>
</OL>
(d) Requirements
<P>
<OL>
<LI>An owner or operator may demonstrate compliance with a specific
District rule by means of an AECP, provided that the owner or
operator:
<P>
(A) submits an application for a Plan which is enforceable on
a 24-hour daily emissions basis; and
<P>
(B) submits applications and receives new Permits to Operate for
permit units included in the Plan; and
<P>
(C) prior to Plan implementation, receives written approval of
the Plan from the Executive Officer with operating conditions
included in a Permit to Operate enforced by the District.  Permit
conditions may specify parameters for conducting source tests
of control equipment in order to determine compliance.
<P>
<LI>Existing permits shall be surrendered and new permits incorporating
the provisions of the AECP shall be obtained.  Notwithstanding
provisions of Rule 219, if a Plan encompasses operation of permit
units not previously subject to permit, such permit units shall
lose their exemption and require permits.
<P>
<LI>The owner or operator of a stationary source of VOC emissions
shall be subject to the applicable rule's specific requirements
pending District approval of a submitted Plan unless the source
is operating under the provision of subparagraph (b)(3).
<P>
<LI>The AECP shall provide, as a minimum, all data, records,
and other information necessary to determine eligibility for alternative
emission control including but not limited to:
<P>
(A) applicable District rule; and
<P>
(B) a list of equipment subject to alternative emission control;
and
<P>
(C) calculations showing baseline emissions for each piece of
equipment included in the Plan; and
<P>
(D) calculations showing how the required 20 percent emission
reduction will be obtained; and
<P>
(E) an explanation of how the proposed 20 percent emission reduction
will be enforceable, permanent, quantifiable, and surplus; and
<P>
(F) amounts of VOC-containing materials to be used and their VOC
concentrations for each operation.
<P>
<LI>The owner or operator operating under an approved Plan shall
maintain daily operating records, information on operations, source
tests, laboratory analyses, monitoring data, and other information
in a manner and form consistent with determining compliance with
the Plan on a 24-hour basis.  Such records and reports shall be
retained for a period of not less than two (2) years and shall
be submitted to the District upon request.
<P>
<LI>The Plan shall result in at least a twenty (20) percent reduction
in VOC baseline emissions, thus producing a net air quality benefit
and establishing an AECP emissions limit.
<P>
<LI>Baseline emissions are the product of:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  Emission rate (ER) (lbs VOC/gal of solids)
<P>
 Capacity utilization (CU) (gals of solids/hour)
<P>
 Hours of operations (H) (hrs/day)
<P>
   Baseline emissions  =  ER  x  CU  x  H  =  (lbs VOC/day)
<P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
  Baseline emission calculations shall include data for permit
units included in the Plan.  Calculations shall use the lowest
of either (1) the actual emission rate, (2) SIP allowable emission
limit, or (3) RACT limits (as defined by the District regulations
as of the date of application for credit).  Also, calculations
shall use the lowest of either actual or SIP allowable values
for the capacity utilization and hours of operation factors. The
hours of operation may be expressed as an hourly usage over a
representative time, as approved by the Executive Officer not
to exceed 24 hours.  Sources lacking specific hours of operation
records may substitute daily records (2 years) of VOC emissions
from coatings and solvents usage expressed as lbs VOC/day.  Actual
values for the capacity utilization and hours of operation shall
be based on the average from data for two years directly preceding
the source's application for a Plan, unless another two-year period
can be shown to the satisfaction of the Executive Officer and
EPA to more accurately represent the source's normal allowable
operations.  No credit will be given for down-time.
<P>
<LI>Emission reductions shall consist of VOC emissions only and
shall be enforceable, permanent, quantifiable, and surplus.
<P>
<LI>For Plans encompassing VOC emissions from coating operations,
the emission reductions shall be demonstrated on a solids basis,
i.e. averaging shall be performed using pounds of VOC emitted
per gallon of solids.  The VOC content of the coating is as applied
including any thinner added before or during application.  Water
and exempt solvents shall be excluded in this calculation.
<P>
<LI>Emission reductions shall consist of emissions resulting
from activities governed by only one source-specific District
rule for which the Plan is submitted.
<P>
<LI>Equipment subject to the Plan shall be located within the
same stationary source.
<P>
<LI>If the emission reduction required by the AECP is accomplished
through equipment shutdown or production curtailment, the permanency
of the reduction shall be ensured by permit conditions limiting
the total VOC emissions from the entire facility.  Thus, all future
increases in VOC emissions from the facility shall require complete
emission reduction offsets, regardless of the provisions of Regulation
XIII.
<P>
<LI>Plans using add-on controls to achieve emission reductions
shall specify test methods for both the emission collection system
and the control system.  Add-on controls shall not be considered
part of an AECP unless incorporated in an emissions averaging
approach to compliance.
<P>
</OL>
(e) Compliance Schedule
<P>
<LI>For sources operating under District approved AECPs at the
time of this rule's adoption, the following schedule shall apply:
<P>
  (A) sources seeking compliance with Rules 1124 - Aerospace Assembly
and Component Coating Operations; 1125 - Metal Container, Closure,
and Coil Coating Operations; 1128 - Paper, Fabric, and Film Coating
Operations; 1130 - Graphic Arts; 1136 - Wood Products Coatings;
1145 - Plastic, Rubber, and Glass Coatings; 1151 - Motor Vehicle
and Mobile Equipment Non-assembly Line Coating Operations; 1164
- Semiconductor Manufacturing; and 1168 - Control of Volatile
Organic Compound Emissions from Adhesive Application shall submit
Plans consistent with this rule's requirements within 120 days
of rule adoption.  The District will move to approve or deny such
Plans within 180 days of submittal; or
<P>
  (B) sources seeking compliance with Rules 1104 - Wood Flat Stock
Coating Operations, 1106 - Marine Coating Operations, Rules 1107
- Coating of Metal Parts and Products, and 1115 - Motor Vehicle
Assembly Line Coating Operations shall submit Plans consistent
with this rule's requirements within 180 days of rule adoption.
 The District will move to approve or deny such Plans within 180
days of submittal.
<P>
<LI>New Plans and Plans updated subsequent to any initial plans
submittals required by the adoption of this rule shall be submitted:
<P>
(A) prior to modification of equipment subject to alternative
emission control; or
<P>
(B) within 60 days following the date the specific rule relating
to the Plan is amended if the rule amendment is pertinent to the
Plan; or
<P>
(C) not less than 90 days prior to implementation of a specific
rule's future compliance date which is pertinent to the Plan,
but which the Plan does not address.
<P>
</OL>
(f) Restrictions
<P>
<OL>
<LI>A Plan shall not result in a net increase in any baseline
emission of an air pollutant regulated, proposed for regulation,
listed, or the subject of a notice-of-intent-to-list under the
Clean Air Act Section 112, National Emission Standards for Hazardous
Air Pollutants (NESHAP).  The Plan shall not be used to meet any
NESHAP requirements.  The baseline emissions of a hazardous pollutant
shall be determined by the lower of either actual or NESHAP's
allowable emissions.
<P>
<LI>Plans shall no4 include credits from emission reductions made
prior to application for the Plan.  This includes emission reductions
from equipment shutdown and production curtailment.
<P>
<LI>Plans shall not include credits from emission reductions required
by subsequent amendments to the rules specified in (b)(1).
<P>
<LI>Plans shall not include credits from emission reductions calculated
through solvent usage for surface preparation, cleanup and/or
stripping operations.
<P>
<LI>TE shall not be included as an alternative means of control.
<P>
<LI>Emission reductions from Plans shall not be used to meet requirements
of New Source Performance Standards (NSPS).

whereby the system is accurately recording the concentration of
the specific air contaminant or diluent gas as evidenced by calibration
checks, achieved by periodic manual or automatic adjustment.
<P>
<LI>CALIBRATION CHECK is a procedure to determine the response

(B) Analyzer
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
(i) Air Contaminant Analyzer - that portion of the monitoring
system that senses the air contaminant and generates a signal
output that is a function of the concentration of that gas.
<P>
(ii) Diluent Analyzer - that portion of the monitoring system
that senses the concentration of oxygen or carbon dioxide and
generates a signal output that is a function of the concentration
of that gas.  This subsystem is required only for sources noted
in a (a)(1)(A).
<P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
(C) Data Recorder - that portion of the monitoring system that
provides a permanent record of the output signal in terms of concentration
units, including additional equipment such as computers required
to convert the original recorded value to any value required for
reporting.
<P>
<LI>SYSTEM FAILURE occurs anytime the monitoring system is suspected
or known to be unable to meet the requirements of (c)(2) or (b)(2),
as applicable.
<P>
<LI>USE FACTOR is the amount of time used per year divided by
the amount of time available for use per year, expressed as a
percent.
<P>
<LI>ZERO CALIBRATION REFLECTOR is a device which is inserted
into the internal light path of the analyzer to provide a measurement
output that simulates a zero gas concentration.
<P>
<LI>ZERO DRIFT** is the change in the monitoring system over a
stated period of time of normal continuous operation when the
air contaminant or diluent gas concentration at the time of the
measurements is zero, or is simulated to be zero by use of a zero
calibration reflector.
<P>
<LI>ZERO GAS is a gas containing less than a specified amount
of the air contaminant or diluent gas which, when periodically
injected into the monitoring system, is used to check that system's
response to the absence of the air contaminant or diluent gas.
<P>
  *The operational period test performed prior to final approval
shall be preceded by a 168 hour (minimum) conditioning period
during which the system shall be operated without unscheduled
maintenance, repair, or adjustment.
<P>
 **Expressed as the sum of the mean value plus the 95 percent
confidence interval of a series of tests.

ENHANCEMENT OF THE ENVIRONMENT</B>
<P>
(a) In addition to providing the notice of District Board meetings
and hearings as required by Health and Safety Code Section 40725,
the District shall consult with state and local governmental agencies
having jurisdiction by law with respect to the subject matter
of a proposed rule or regulation, and notice shall be mailed to
all persons who have requested such notice in writing.  For informational
purposes, notice may be provided to newspapers of general circulation,
to all persons believed to be interested in the proceeding, and
to the State Clearinghouse for circulation to public agencies.
<P>
(b) Prior to holding a public hearing to adopt, rescind, or amend
a rule or regulation of the District, a staff report shall be
prepared and published by the staff of the District.  The staff
report shall be published at least 30 days prior to the date of
the public hearing.  Staff reports shall be available for public
review and comment, and shall be distributed to the California
Air Resources Board, the Environmental Protection Agency, the
State Clearinghouse, and to all other persons who have requested
such report.
<P>
(c) It is the policy of the District to utilize an interdisciplinary
approach as set forth in the District's CEQA implementation guidelines
adopted by the District Board pursuant to Public Resources Code
Section 21082 to prepare staff reports in a manner consistent
with the environmental protection purpose of the District's regulatory
program and with the goals and policies of the California Environmental
Quality Act (Public Resources Code Section 21000 et seq.).  All
staff reports shall contain, among other things, a description
of the proposed action, an assessment of the anticipated significant
long- or short-term adverse and beneficial environmental impacts
associated with the proposed action, and a succinct analysis of
those impacts.  The analysis shall address feasible mitigation
measures and feasible alternatives to the proposed action which
would substantially reduce any significant adverse impact(s) identified.
<P>
(d) If comments are received during the evaluation process which
raise significant environmental issues associated with the proposed
action, the staff shall summarize and respond to the comments
either orally at the public hearing, or in a supplemental written
report.  Prior to taking final action on any proposal for which
significant environmental issues have been raised, the District
Board shall approve a written response to each such issue. 
<P>
(e) Any action or proposal for which significant adverse environmental
impacts have been identified during the review process shall not
be approved or adopted as proposed if there are feasible mitigation
measures or feasible alternatives available which would substantially
reduce such adverse impact.  For the purposes of this subparagraph,
&quot;feasible&quot; means capable of being accomplished in a
successful manner within a reasonable period of time, taking into
account economic, environmental, social, and technological factors,
and consistent with the District's statutory authority and with
federal and state laws and regulations.
<P>
(f) Notice of final action and the written response to significant
environmental issues raised shall be filed with the Secretary
of the Resources Agency for public inspection.

<BR>
(Amended December 7, 1995)
<P>
<B>RULE 212. STANDARDS FOR APPROVING PERMITS</B>
<P>
(a) The Executive Officer or designee shall deny a Permit to Construct
or a Permit to Operate, except as provided in Rule 204, unless
the applicant shows that the equipment, the use of which may cause
the issuance of air contaminants or the use of which may eliminate,
reduce, or control the issuance of air contaminants, is so designed,
controlled, or equipped with such air pollution control equipment
that it may be expected to operate without emitting air contaminants
in violation of Section 41700, 41701, or 44300 (et sec.) of the
State Health and Safety Code or of these rules.
<P>
(b) If the Executive Officer or designee finds that the equipment
has not been constructed in accordance with the permit and provides
less effective air pollution control than the equipment specified
in the Permit to Construct, he shall deny the Permit to Operate.
<P>
(c) Prior to granting a Permit to Construct for a significant
project, all addresses within the area described in section (d)
shall be notified of the Executive Officer's or designee's intent
to grant a Permit to Construct at least 30 days prior to the date
action is to be taken on the application.  For the purpose of
this rule, significant projects will consist of:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>all new or modified permit units that may emit air contaminants
located within 1000 feet from the outer boundary of a school.
 This subdivision shall not apply to modification of an existing
facility if the Executive Officer or designee determines that
the modification will result in a reduction of emissions of air
contaminants from the facility and no increase in health risk
at any receptor location.  This paragraph shall not apply to modifications
that have no potential to affect emissions;
<P>
<LI>all new or modified facilities which have on-site emission
increases exceeding any of the daily maximums specified in subdivision
(g) of this rule; and
<P>
<LI>all new or modified permit units with increases in emissions
of toxic air contaminants, for which the Executive Officer or
designee has made a determination that a person may be exposed
to an individual cancer risk greater than, or equal to, one in
a million (1 x 10-6) during a lifetime (70 years) period, or may
be exposed to quantities or concentrations of other substances
that pose a potential risk of nuisance.  Toxic and potentially
toxic air contaminants are substances listed in Table I of Rule
1401, or any other material determined by the Executive Officer
or designee to be potentially toxic.  This paragraph shall not
apply if the Executive Officer or designee determines that modifications
to the existing facility will not result in an increase in health
risk at any receptor location.
</OL>
<P>
(d) Except as provided for in subdivision (g), the notification
of the proposed construction of a significant project, which is
to be prepared by the District, is to contain sufficient detail
to fully describe the project.  The applicant shall provide verification
to the Executive Officer or designee that public notice has been
distributed as required by this subdivision.  In the case of notifications
performed under paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3), the applicant for
the Permit to Construct shall be responsible for the distribution
of the public notice to each address within a 1/4 mile radius
of the project or such other area as determined appropriate by
the Executive Officer or designee.  In the case of notifications
performed under paragraph (c)(1), distribution of the public notice
shall be to the parents of children in any school within 1/4 mile
of the facility and the applicant shall provide distribution of
the public notice to each address within a radius of 750 feet
from the outer property line of the proposed new or modified facility.
<P>
(e) Any person may file a written request for notice of any decision
or action pertaining to the issuance of a Permit to Construct.
 The Executive Officer or designee shall provide mailed notice
of such decision or action to any person who has filed a written
request for notification.  Requests for notice shall be filed
pursuant to procedures established by the Executive Officer or
designee.  The notice shall be mailed at the time that the Executive
Officer or designee notifies the permit applicant of the decision
or action.  The 10-day period to appeal, specified in Rule 216(b),
shall commence on the third day following mailing of the notice
pursuant to this subdivision.  The requirements for public notice
pursuant to this subdivision are fulfilled if the Executive Officer
makes a good faith effort to follow procedures established pursuant
to this subdivision for giving notice and, in such circumstances,
failure of any person to receive the notice shall not affect the
validity of any permit subsequently issued by the Executive Officer
or designee.
<P>
(f) An application for a Permit to Operate, for a permit unit
installed or constructed without a required Permit to Construct,
shall be subject to the requirements of this rule.
<P>
(g) For new or modified sources subject to Regulation XIII, RECLAIM
facilities, or Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) facilities located
within 25 miles of the State's seaward boundary and for which
the District has been designated as the corresponding onshore
area (COA), which undergo construction or modifications resulting
in an emissions increase exceeding any of the daily maximums specified

<B>RULE 216. APPEALS</B>
<P>
(a) The applicant may petition the Hearing Board in writing within
ten days after receipt of notification from the Executive Officer
of the denial of a permit or the conditions of operation imposed
on the permit.  The Hearing Board shall commence a public
hearing within 30 days after receiving the petition, unless such
time is extended by order of the Hearing Board upon stipulation
of the parties.  The Hearing Board may sustain or reverse the
action of the Executive Officer.  The Hearing Board order may
be made subject to specified conditions.  An applicant who desires
to continue operating equipment pending the determination of an
appeal of the denial of a permit to operate, or who desires to
operate the equipment at variance with the conditions imposed
by the Executive Officer pending the determination of an appeal
of the conditions, must obtain a variance from Rule 203 from the
Hearing Board.
<P>
(b) Within ten days of any decision or action pertaining to the
issuance of a permit by the Executive Officer, any person who,
in person or through a representative, submitted written comments
or otherwise participated in the review by the Executive Officer,
may petition the Hearing Board to hold a public hearing to determine
whether the permit was properly issued.  The Hearing Board shall
schedule a public hearing to take place within 30 days of the
filing of the petition, unless such time is extended by order
of the Hearing Board upon stipulation of the parties.  The petition
shall be in writing in a form approved by the Hearing Board and
shall include, at a minimum, a clear, concise statement of the
rules of the District or provisions of state law with which the
equipment which is the subject of the permit would not comply.
 If the petition claims that the permit conditions imposed by
the Executive Officer are inadequate to assure compliance with
District rules or provisions of state law, it shall state which
rules or laws may not be complied with, which permit conditions
are inadequate and the basis for such alleged inadequacies.  Failure
to comply with the provisions of this subparagraph shall be grounds
for dismissal of the petition.

<P>
(Adopted November 4, 1977)(Amended August 7, 1981)
<P>
<B>RULE 220. EXEMPTION-NET INCREASE IN EMISSIONS</B>
<P>
(a) Upon petition of the owner or operator of a source, and after
notice and hearing in accordance with the procedures provided
in Health and Safety Code Sections 40826 and 40807, the Executive
Officer may exempt a source from any prohibitory rule of Regulations
IV and XI if he makes a finding that installation of controls
and/or process changes required to achieve compliance with the
subject prohibitory rule will result in a net adverse impact on
air quality.
<P>
(b) In granting an exemption hereunder, the Executive Officer
shall require the person seeking the exemption to install, as
a condition to its permit to operate, alternative controls and/or
process changes which will result in the greatest practical net
emission reduction.
<P>
(c) In making the finding set forth above, the Executive Officer
shall consider secondary emissions including but not limited to,
incremental electrical power generation emissions.
<P>
(d) Provisions of this rule shall not apply to those sources with
primary emissions of one pound per hour or more of the air contaminant
which the rule from which the exemption is sought is designed
to control.
<P>
(e) The Executive Officer may revoke the exemption if he determines
after a hearing that conditions have changed such that there is
no longer a net air quality benefit.
<P>
(f) The hearing shall be conducted by the Executive Officer. 
The Executive Officer shall report each determination to grant
or deny an exemption hereunder to the District Board at its next
regular meeting following the grant or denial of such exemption.
 Any person who has been denied an exemption hereunder or whose
exemption has been revoked, may petition the District Board to
rehear the matter.  Such petition shall contain a verified statement
of facts setting forth the basis for petitioner's claim that the
Executive Officer improperly denied or revoked the exemption.

<B>RULE 301.2 - ANNUAL OPERATING PERMIT EMISSION FEE - REDUCED
PENALTY FOR UNDERPAYMENTS</B> 
<P>
For the two reporting periods calendar year 1993 and January 1
through June 30, 1994 respectively, if an emission fee is timely
paid, and if within two (2) years after the sixtieth (60th) day
from the official due date it is later determined to be less than
ninety percent (90%) of the full amount that should have been
paid, a fifteen percent (15%) penalty shall be added, in lieu
of the 50% otherwise required by Rule 301 (e)(5)(C). The penalty
shall be calculated on the difference between the amount actually
paid and the amount that should have been paid, to be referred
to as underpayment. If payment was ninety percent (90%) or more
of the correct amount due, the difference of underpayment shall
be paid but with no penalties added. The fee rate to be applied
shall be the fee rate in effect for the year in which the emissions
actually occurred.

pursuant to subsection (e), above, may be reinstated by the permit
holder upon payment of such overdue fees and accrued penalties.

to the gas offtake piping on a coke oven to and including the
flange of the battery pressure control valve.
<P>
<li>GAS OFFTAKE SYSTEM means any set of piping (e.g., standpipes,
goosenecks) that interconnects a coke oven with a collecting main
which is common to all such systems.  The gas offtake system extends
from the connection on top of the coke oven to the connection
on the collecting main.
<P>
<li>HOT CAR means a vehicle which transfers hot coke from the
oven to the area of quenching.
<P>

of doors from which visible emissions are being discharged.  The
manner of inspection shall be determined by the Executive Officer
of the District and a copy of that procedure shall be made available
to owners or operators of coke ovens upon request.  If application
of the percentage allowable results in a fraction, the fraction
shall be rounded to the nearest whole number.
<P>
<B>(f) Separate Violations</B>
<P>
<ol>
<li>Exceedances of the applicable emission limitations specified
in subparagraph (b)(5) or in the final control plan shall constitute
a separate violation of this rule for each battery exceeding the
applicable limit.
<P>
<li>If, at any time, the coke plant emissions limitation specified
in subparagraph (b)(6) is exceeded, violations shall be determined
as follows:
<P>
(A) If no battery has exceeded the emission limitation specified
for that battery in subparagraph (b)(5), then there is only a
violation of subparagraph (b)(6).
<P>
(B) If any battery has exceeded the emission limitation specified
for that battery in subparagraph (b)(5), then there is a separate
violation of subparagraph (b)(5) for each battery exceeding the
applicable emission limitation rather than violation of subparagraph
(b)(6).
<P>
<li>Each of the requirements of subparagraphs (b)(1), (b)(2),
(b)(3), (b)(4), and (c) shall be regarded as separate requirements
to be met at all times by each battery and shall result in separate
liability for each separate violation by each separate battery.
<P>
<li>There can be no more than one violation of each subparagraph
per battery per day.

<P>
<B>RULE 1109. EMISSIONS OF OXIDES OF NITROGEN FROM BOILERS AND
PROCESS HEATERS IN PETROLEUM REFINERIES</B>
<P>
<B>(a) Definitions</B>
<P>
<ol>
<li>BOILER means any combustion equipment fired with liquid and/or
gaseous fuel and used to produce steam, including a carbon monoxide
boiler.
<P>
<li>PROCESS HEATER means any combustion equipment fired with liquid
and/or gaseous fuel and which transfers heat from combustion gases
to process streams.
<P>
<li>REFINERY-WIDE RATE OF NITROGEN OXIDES EMISSIONS means the
ratio of the total mass rate of discharge into the atmosphere
of nitrogen oxides from units (subject to the rule) when firing
at their maximum rated capacity to the sum of the maximum rated
capacities for those units.
<P>
<li>UNIT means any petroleum refinery boiler or process heater,
as defined in subsections (1) and (2) of this section, with a
permit to construct or a permit to operate prior to March 2, 1984.
<P>
<li>NITROGEN OXIDES means the sum of nitric oxide and nitrogen
dioxide in the flue gas, collectively expressed as nitrogen dioxide
and averaged over a period of 15 consecutive minutes.
<P>
<li>COMBUSTION MODIFICATION means any modification of the burner,
combustion air flow, or fuel flow system that reduces nitrogen
oxides emissions.
<P>
<li>MAXIMUM RATED CAPACITY means maximum design heat input at
the higher heating value of the fuel unless:
<P>
(A) the boiler/process heater is limited by permit condition to
a lesser heat input, in which case the limiting condition shall
be used as the maximum rated capacity; or
<P>
(B) the boiler/process heater is operated above the maximum design
heat input, in which case the maximum operated rate shall be used
at the maximum rated capacity.
<P>
<li>EMISSIONS RATE means the ratio of the mass rate of discharge
into the atmosphere of nitrogen oxides from a unit to the actual
heat input for that unit.
<P>
<li>HEAT INPUT means the heat of combustion released by fuel oxidation
in a unit, using the higher heating value of the fuel.  This does
not include the enthalpy of incoming combustion air.  In the case
of carbon monoxide boilers, the heat input includes the enthalpy
of all regenerator off gases and the heat of combustion of the
incoming carbon monoxide and of the auxiliary fuel.  The enthalpy
of the fluid catalytic cracking unit regenerator off-gases refers
to the total heat content of the gas at the temperature it enters
the carbon monoxide boiler, referred to the heat content at 60oF,
as being zero.
<P>
</ol>
<B>(b) Requirements</B>
<P>
<ol>
<li>(A) From July 1, 1988 until December 31, 1992, the owner operator
of any petroleum refinery shall reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides

  (i) 0.14 pound (0.064 kilogram) of nitrogen oxides per million
BTU of heat input when operated on gaseous fuel;
<P>
  (ii) 0.308 pound (0.14 kilogram) of nitrogen oxides per million
BTU of heat input when operated on liquid fuel;
<P>
  (iii) the weighted average of the limits of subsections (b)(1)(A)(i)
and (b)(1)A(ii), when operated concurrently on both liquid and
gaseous fuel.  For purpose of this rule, the nitrogen oxides formed
in the fluid catalytic cracking unit regenerator shall be assumed
to be from the burning of gaseous fuel.
<P>
</blockquote>
 (B) On December 31, 1992 and subsequent dates, the owner or operator
of any petroleum refinery shall reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides
from each unit subject to this rule so that:

  (iii) For each unit firing at less than the maximum rated capacity,
mass emissions of nitrogen oxides shall be less than or equal
to the quantity that would occur at the applicable limit specified
in (b)(1)(B)(i) and (b)(1)(B)(ii) at maximum rated capacity, or
as specified in the AECP.
<P>
  (iv) Alternative Emission Control Plan (AECP)
<P>
    An owner/operator may achieve compliance with paragraphs (b)(1)(B)(i)
and (b)(1)(B)(ii) by achieving equivalent nitrogen oxides emissions
reductions obtained by alternative control methods provided the
applicant submits an Alternative Emission Control Plan that is
enforceable by the District and receives approval of the Plan
in writing from the Executive Officer prior to implementation.
 The Alternative Emission Control Plan shall:
<P>
 (I) Contain, as a minimum, all data, records, and other information
necessary to determine eligibility for alternative emission control,
including but not limited to:
<P>
<blockquote>
 a) A list of equipment subject to alternative emission control;
<P>
 b) Daily hours of utilization for applicable equipment;
<P>
 c) Estimated emission of nitrogen oxides for each operation;
<P>
 d) Rated capacity; and
<P>
 e) Historical and projected fuel use.
<P>
</blockquote>
 (II) Present the methodology for estimation of equivalency of
emission reductions under the proposed Alternative Emission Control
Plan as compared to either the emission reductions otherwise required
by the rule or to actual emissions, whichever is less.
<P>
 (III) Demonstrate that the permit units subject to the specified
rule emission limitations are in compliance with or on an approved
schedule for compliance with all applicable District rules.
<P>
</blockquote>
<li>The owner or operator shall operate each unit subject to this
rule such that the assigned maximum nitrogen oxides emissions
rate for each unit (pounds or kilograms per million BTU heat input,
expressed as nitrogen dioxide) is in accordance with the list
approved by the Executive Officer pursuant to subsection (b)(6)(B),
and any specified permit conditions.
<P>
<li>The owner or operator of any petroleum refinery which has
units subject to this rule shall submit to the Executive Officer
a control plan for installation of nitrogen oxides emissions control
equipment to meet the requirements of subsection (b)(1);
<P>
Such plan shall contain as a minimum:
<P>

emissions for each unit to achieve the refinery-wide emissions
rates specified in subsection (b)(1), and
<P>
(D) On-site nitrogen oxide offsets from co-generation facilities
may be incorporated in the plan.
<P>
<li>All units which are identified in the control plan required
by subsection (b)(3) shall be tested, in a manner approved by
the Executive Officer, for nitrogen oxides emissions while firing
gaseous fuel and liquid fuel, if applicable, at the maximum rated
capacity, or as near thereto as practicable.  Such tests shall
be performed:
<P>
(A) Within 180 days after completion of modifications, but no
later than 1 month before any applicable compliance date for units
which are to be modified with nitrogen oxides control equipment,

Alternative Emission Limit to Limit
<BR>
the Oxides of Nitrogen (NO<SUB>x</SUB>) Emissions
<BR>
<U>from Stationary Internal Combustion Engines</U>
</CENTER>
<BR>

For stationary internal combustion engines, emissions of oxides
of nitrogen shall not exceed an emission limit as determined by
the following equation:
<PRE>
                  STANDARD  x  UNIT EFFICIENCY
EMISSION LIMIT = ------------------------------
                      STANDARD EFFICIENCY
</PRE>
The STANDARD is 48 ppm NO<SUB>x</SUB> for rich-burn or 96 ppm for lean-burn
as corrected to 15 percent oxygen at an engine STANDARD EFFICIENCY
of 30 percent.  UNIT EFFICIENCY equals the total shaft output
and reclaimed heat from any heat recovery system divided by the
energy input (as determined by a fuel measuring device accurate
to <U>+</U> 5 percent and based on the higher heating value of
the fuel).  Any engine which has a tested efficiency greater than
30 percent is allowed a 30 percent unit efficiency for the purpose
of this limitation.
<P>
The volume concentration (ppm) of the oxides of nitrogen (NO<SUB>x</SUB)
shall be corrected to 15 percent oxygen (O<SUB>2</SUB>) on a dry basis as
follows:
<P>
     
<PRE>
                                            20.9% - 15%

<P>
<B>(a) Definition</B>
<P>
For the purpose of this rule, the following definition shall apply.
<P>
VESSEL means any container or structural envelope in which materials
are processed or treated; it does not include any container whose
principal purpose is material storage.
<P>
<B>(b) Requirements</B>
<P>
<ol>
<li>During refinery process turnaround, a person shall not depressurize
any vessel containing organic materials unless the vapors released
from the vessel are collected and contained for use as fuel or
sent to a gas disposal system until the pressure in the vessel
is below five pounds per square inch, gauge, or is within ten
percent above the minimum gauge pressure at which the vapors can
be collected, whichever is lower.
<P>
<li>For every refinery that uses inert gas displacement or vacuum
eduction for process turnaround, a person operating the refinery
shall submit to the Executive Officer a plan which describes at
least the following:
<P>
(A) the procedure used for gas displacement or eduction;
<P>
(B) the disposition of the displaced or educed organic gases;
<P>
(C) the stage in the displacement or eduction procedure at which
the disposition is changed from a control facility to atmospheric
venting, and
<P>
(D) the criteria by which said stage is identifiable.
<P>
<li>The Executive Officer shall approve the plan upon his determination
that it provides for the maximum feasible control of emissions
of displaced or educed organic gases without causing damage to
equipment, malfunction of pollution control or safety devices,
or violations of safety regulations and without installation or
structural modification equipment which is not needed to comply
with subparagraph (b)(1) of this rule.
<P>
<li>After approval of a plan, all displacement operations shall
be conducted according to said plan unless another specifically
approved plan is used.
<P>
</ol>
<B>(c) Recordkeeping</B>
<P>
 A refinery operator shall maintain a record of each refinery
process unit turnaround containing at a minimum the date the unit
was shut down, the approximate vessel hydrocarbon concentration
when hydrocarbons were first discharged into the atmosphere, and
the approximate amount of hydrocarbons emitted into the atmosphere.
 Such records shall be kept at the facility for at least two years,
and shall be made available to District staff upon request.
<P>
<B>(d) Exemptions</B>
<P>
 Any vessel, or group of vessels, that has been depressurized
to less than five pounds per square inch, gauge, shall be exempted
from the provisions of subparagraph (b)(2) by the Executive Officer
upon determination by the Executive Officer that the use of existing
control facilities to comply with subparagraph (b)(2) is likely
to damage equipment, cause the malfunction of pollution control
or safety devices, or cause violations of safety regulations.

     shutdown, malfunction or emergency conditions, except for CEMS
     breakdowns and repairs.  Calibration data shall be recorded during
     zero and span calibration checks, and zero and span adjustments.
     For periods of hot standby the utilities may enter a default
     value for NOx emissions.  Before using any default values the
     utilities must obtain the approval of the Executive Officer and
     must include in the CEMS applications or CEMS plans the estimates
     of NOx emissions, the NOx concentrations, the oxygen concentrations,
     and the fuel input rate or the stack gas volumetric flow rate
     during hot standby conditions.  The Executive Officer will approve
     only those emission values which he finds to correspond to hot
     standby conditions.

2.7  When less than 90% of valid nitrogen oxides emission data
     are collected by the CEMS, emission rate data shall be obtained
     using District Methods 7.1 or 100.1 (for NOx concentration in
     the stack gas) in conjunction with District Methods 1.1, 2.1,
     3.1, and 4.1 or by using District Methods 7.1 or 100.1 in conjunction
     with District Method 3.1 and EPA Method 19.  If the NOx concentrations
     are less than 20 ppm, use Special District Method 7.1 (IC Alternative)
     or Modified District Method 100.1 for Low NOx Concentrations.
     Descriptions of the last two methods can be found in Paragraphs
     3.3.1 and 3.3.2 of the Relative Accuracy Test Procedure.  For
     District Method 7.1 or Special District Method 7.1 (IC Alternative),
     a minimum of 12 samples, equally spaced over a one-hour period,
     shall be taken.  Each sample shall represent the five-minute period
     in which it was taken.

2.8  Load curves of NOx emission rates or other alternative means
     of NOx emission rate data generation may be used to obtain nitrogen
     oxides emission data, provided the utility has obtained the approval
     of the Executive Officer prior to using alternate means of NOx
     emission rate data generation.  The load curves and the alternate
     means of NOx emission rate data generation mentioned in this paragraph
     shall not be used more than 72 hours per calendar month and may
     only be used if no CEMS data or reference method data gathered
     under paragraph 2. 7 is available.  Load curves may be used on
     units which have air pollution control devices for the control
     of nitrogen oxides emissions provided the utilities submit a complete
     list of operating conditions that characterize the permitted operation.
     The conditions must be specified in the compliance plans and
     permits which the rule requires.  The process parameters specified
     in the conditions must be monitored by the CEMS.

2.9   At each affected boiler, unit, or approved alternative or
      advanced combustion resource the number of valid data points (N)
      during the day shall be greater than 90 percent of the number
      operating minutes during the day in order to obtain a valid daily
      emission rate for nitrogen oxides and the daily net MWH of electricity
      produced.  Valid data points are data points from the CEMS which
      meet the requirements of Paragraphs 2.18, 2.19, 2.19.1, 2.19.2,
      2.19.2, 2.19.4, 2.19.5, 2.19.6, 2.19.7, 2.19.8, and 2.20 or which
      are obtained by the methods indicated in Paragraphs 2.7 and 2.8.
      The utility is deemed to be out of compliance with rule 1135
      on a systemwide basis if one or more boilers, units, or approved
      alternative or advanced combustion resources do not comply with
      the 90 percent valid data requirement.

2.10  Full scale span ranges for the NOx analyzers at each unit
      shall be set on a unit-by-unit basis.  The full scale span range
      of the NOx analyzers shall be set so that all the data points
      gathered by the CEMS lie within 20-95 percent of the full-scale
      span range.

2.11  The CEMS design shall allow determination of calibration
      drift at zero and high-level (90 to 100 percent of full scale)
      values.  Alternative low-level and high-level span values may
      be allowed with the prior written approval of the Executive Officer.

2.12  The volumetric flow measurement system shall meet a relative
      accuracy requirement of being less than or equal to 10 percent
      of the mean value of the reference method test data in units of
      DSCFM.  Relative accuracy is calculated by the equations in Section
      8 of 40 CFR Part 60, Appendix B, Performance Specification 2.

2.13  The emission rate measurement shall meet a relative accuracy
      requirement of being less than or equal to 20 percent of the mean
      value of the reference method test data in units of lb/hr.  Relative
      accuracy is calculated  by the equations in Section 8 of 40 CFR
      Part 60, Appendix B, Performance Specification 2.

2.14  The portion of the CEMS which samples, conditions, analyzes,
      and records the nitrogen oxides and oxygen concentrations in the
      stack gas shall be certified according to the specifications in
      District Rule 218.

2.15  Each boiler, unit, and approved alternative or advanced combustion
      resource shall have test facilities which meet the &quot;Guidelines
      for Construction of Sampling and Testing Facilities&quot; in the
      District Source Test Manual.  If an alternate location (not conforming
      to the criteria of eight duct diameters downstream and two diameters
      upstream from a flow disturbance) is used, the absence of flow
      disturbance and stratification shall be demonstrated using District
      Source Test Methods.

2.16  The CEMS sample line from the CEMS probe to the sample conditioning
      system shall be heated to maintain the sample temperature above
      the dew point of the sample.

2.17  The District shall reevaluate the monitoring systems at any
      affected boiler, unit, or approved alternative or advanced combustion
      resource, where changes to the basic process equipment or air
      pollution control equipment occur, to determine the proper full
      span range of the monitors. Any monitor system requiring change
      to its full span range in order to meet the criteria in Paragraph
      2.10 shall be recertified according to all the specifications
      in Rule 218 including the relative accuracy tests, the calibration
      drift tests, and the calibration error tests.  A new CEMS plan
      shall be submitted for each CEMS which is reevaluated.

2.18  Procedure 1 of 40 CFR Part 60, Appendix F is incorporated
      by reference for the nitrogen oxides and oxygen monitors.  The
      quality assurance plans required by 40 CFR Part 60, Appendix F
      shall be submitted to the District for the approval of the Executive
      Officer before the CEMS is certified.  The reference method tests
      are those methods in Section 3 (RELATIVE ACCURACY TEST METHODS)
      of this guideline.  Any CEMS which is deemed out-of-control by
      40 CFR Part 60, Appendix F shall be corrected, retested by the
      appropriate audit procedure, and restored to in-control within
      24 hours after being deemed out-of-control.  If the CEMS is not
      in-control at the end of the 24-hour period, the CEMS data shall
      be gathered using the methods in paragraphs 2.7 and 2.8 of these
      requirements.  All data which is gathered in order to comply with
      40 CFR Part 60, Appendix F shall be maintained for two years and
      be made available to the Executive Officer upon request.  Any
      such data which is invalidated shall be identified and reasons
      provided for any data invalidation.

2.19  Each volumetric flow measurement system shall be audited
      at least once each calendar quarter.  Successive audits shall
      occur no closer than two months.  The audits shall be conducted
      as follows:

2.19.1  The Relative Accuracy Test Audit (RATA) shall be conducted
        at least once every four quarters.  Conduct the RATA as described
        in Section 3 (RELATIVE ACCURACY TEST METHODS).

2.19.2  The Relative Accuracy Audit may be conducted three of four
        calendar quarters, but no more than three quarters in succession.
        To conduct an RAA, follow the procedure described in Section
        3 (RELATIVE ACCURACY TEST METHODS) for the relative accuracy test,
        except that only three sets of measurement data are required.

2.19.3  Follow the equations described in Section 8 of 40 CFR Part
        60, Appendix B, Performance Specification 2 to calculate the relative
        accuracy for the RATA.  The RATA shall be calculated in units
        of dry standard cubic feet per minute (DSCFM).

2.19.4  Follow this equation to calculate the accuracy for the
        RAA:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
2.19.5  If the relative accuracy using the RATA exceeds 20 percent
        of the mean reference method value, the CEMS shall be considered
        out-of-control.  If the relative accuracy exceeds &#177;15 percent
        using the RAA, the CEMS shall be considered out-of-control.  If
        the CEMS is out-of-control, take necessary corrective action to
        eliminate the problem.  Following corrective action, audit the
        CEMS accuracy with an RAA or an RATA to determine if the CEMS
        is operating properly.  An RATA shall be used following an out-of-control
        period resulting from an RATA.  If the audit shows the CEMS to
        be out-of-control, the CEMS operator shall report the results
        of the audit showing the CEMS to be out-of-control, any subsequent
        audit showing the CEMS to remain out-of-control following corrective
        action, and the audit showing the CEMS to be operating within
        specifications following corrective action.

2.19.6  The beginning of the out-of-control period shall be the
        time corresponding to the completion of the sampling of the RAA
        or RATA.  The end of the out-of-control period shall be the time
        corresponding to the completion of the sampling of the subsequent
        successful RAA or RATA.

2.19.7  During the period the CEMS is out-of-control, the CEMS
        data shall not be used in calculating emission compliance nor
        be counted towards meeting minimum data availability.

2.19.8  Whenever out-of-control periods occur for two consecutive
        quarters, the owner or operator shall revise the quality control
        procedures contained in the quality assurance plans, or modify
        and replace the CEMS.  If the CEMS is modified or replaced, the
        new CEMS shall be recertified by the Executive Officer.

2.20  The nitrogen oxides emission rate (lb NOx/hr) portion of
      the CEMS at each boiler, unit or approved alternative or advanced
      combustion resource shall have a relative accuracy of no greater
      than 20 percent of the mean value of the reference method test
      data in terms of lb NOx/hr.  This relative accuracy test shall
      be conducted during the certification test of each CEMS, and shall
      be conducted  at least once every four quarters as an RATA for
      each CEMS. An RAA may be conducted three of four calendar quarters
      as described in Paragraph 2.19.1.  The definition of an out-of-control
      CEMS is the same as Paragraph 2.19.5, except that the RAA shall
      exceed &#177;20 percent before the CEMS is considered out-of control.
      The definition of out-of-control period is the same as Paragraph
      2.19.6.The CEMS status during an out-of-control period is the
      same as Paragraph 2.19.7.  The criteria for acceptable procedures
      is the same as Paragraph 2.19.8.

<B>3. RELATIVE ACCURACY TEST METHODS</B>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
3.1  Conduct the reference method (RM) tests in such a way that
     they will yield results representative of the emissions from the
     source and can be correlated to the CEMS data.

3.2  Conduct a minimum of nine sets of all necessary reference
     method (RM) tests.  Conduct each set within a period of 30 to
     60 minutes.

3.3  Unless the expected concentrations of NOx are less than 20
     ppm, District Methods 7.1 or 100.1 are the reference methods for
     NOx concentrations.

3.4  Use the Special District Method 7.1 (IC Alternative) or the
     Modified District Method 100.1 to determine NOx stack gas concentrations
     of less than 20 ppm.

3.4.1  Modified District Method 100.1 for Low NOx Concentrations
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

District Method 100.1 may be used to measure low NOx concentrations
if the following additional quality control measures are taken
on the reference method monitor:
<P>
a. Perform NO<FONT SIZE=-1>2</FONT> system bias checks in addition to the regular system
bias check in District Method 100.1.  Use approximately 10 ppm
NO<FONT SIZE=-1>2</FONT> span gas for this system bias check.  Perform these checks
at the beginning, the middle, and the end of each test day.  The
checks made in the middle and the end of the test day must be
made before emptying the condensate from the sampling system (if
applicable).
<P>
b. Determine the NOx to NO concentration readings during at least
one test run. 
<P>
c. Determine the NO<FONT SIZE=-1>2</FONT> to NO conversion efficiency by running a
known NO<FONT SIZE=-1>2</FONT> calibration gas (about 10 ppm) through the NO<FONT SIZE=-1>2</FONT> convertor
and comparing the calibrated monitor response to the NO<FONT SIZE=-1>2</FONT> concentration.

<P>
d. The calibration error limits and the calibration gas specifications
are the same as those in District Method 100.1.  However, the
tester may use calibration gas certified to an analytical accuracy
of &#177;2 percent if calibration gases with analytical accuracies
of &#177;1 percent are not available. 
<P>
e. Conduct an NH<FONT SIZE=-1>3</FONT> interference test if NH<FONT SIZE=-1>3</FONT> is present.  Use NH<FONT SIZE=-1>3</FONT>
calibration gas at 80-100 percent of the allowed NH<FONT SIZE=-1>3</FONT> concentration.

<P>
f. Conduct Special District Method 7.1 (IC Alternative) tests
simultaneously with the Modified District 100.1 tests during at
least two runs.  Collect at least six NOx bulbs during each run.
 Take at least two field blanks each testing day. 

<BLOCKQUOTE>

3.5  District Method 2.1 shall be used to determine the stack gas
     volumetric flow rate.

3.6  For District Method 2.1, District Method 1.1 shall be used
     to select the sampling site and the number of traverse points.

3.7  District Method 3.1 shall be used for diluent gas (O<FONT SIZE=-1>2</FONT> or CO<FONT SIZE=-1>3</FONT>)
     concentration and stack gas density determination.

3.8  District Method 4.1 shall be used for moisture determination
     of the stack gas.
