<h1>Global Change Documents and Publications</h1>
<p align=left>
One of GCRIO's primary mission elements is to serve as a <strong>clearinghouse</strong> for documents and publications that pertain to global environmental change research, adaptation/mitigation strategies and technologies, and education.  Although GCRIO 


facilitates access to documents from many different sources, the emphasis is on those derived from relevant activities of US Federal Agencies and Organizations.   GCRIO performs this function in two ways:
<p align=left>
<ul>
<li>First, GCRIO provides access to <a 
href="biblio.html">bibliographic data bases</a> that enable a user to identify relevant documents and publications based on free-text searches of the title, abstract, and various keywords.  GCRIO maintains its own bibliographic data base which consists pr
imarily of information on global change-related documents that have been generated by US Federal Agencies and Organizations.  In parallel, some Agencies maintain their own bibliographic data base, and in an effort to minimize any duplication of effort, GC
RIO simply provides links to those agency data bases.  Finally, GCRIO also provides links to other non-Federal and commercial bibliographic systems.  There are many such systems in the world today; we have tried to identify a few that contain information 
that is relevant to our mission area. (Many commercial services tend to be business oriented.)  Note that in most cases, one needs an account to use the commercial system.  This list is certainly not exhaustive.  We welcome suggestions for other relevant 
systems to add to our list. </li>
<p>
<li>Second, GCRIO provides access to selected documents and publications <a href="online.html">on-line</a> in their entirety.  These documents are typically selected on the basis of their widespread appeal (i.e., <i>Our Changing Planet</i> provides

 an annual overview of activities of the USGCRP) or because they support the timely dissemination of important events or results related to global environmental change.</li>

<h1>Global Change Data and Information Resources</h1>
<p align=left>
In terms of access and dissemination, GCRIO's primary responsibility lies in the realm of <a href="/docpub.html">documents and publications</a>.  Providing and facilitating access to global change-related <strong>data and information resources</strong> that are derived from Federal Agencies and Organizations is one of the overall goals of the <a href="http://www.gcdis.usgcrp.gov/">GCDIS</a>.  GCRIO supports the GCDIS in terms of high-level users services and outreach, but it should not and does not attempt to duplicate the access and dissemination infrastructure provided by the "GCDIS approach" to increasing interagency interoperability.   GCRIO can, however, provide a set of links to existing Federal (and relevant non-Federal) information systems, while in parallel, 

GCDIS strives to make these systems more interoperable.
<p align=left>
For this effort, GCRIO defines four classes of information systems that are relevant to the GCRIO mission:
<dl>
<dt><a href="/catalog.html">Catalog Systems</a>
<dd>These systems provide access to <strong>metadata</strong> or <i>information about data</i>.  Generally, these systems are used to identify, locate, and in some instances, browse, and order data and information resources of interest.  In general, there

 are two levels of "location metadata."  <strong>Directory-level metadata</strong> describes entire datasets or data resources at a very high level.  It tells a user about the existence and location of a dataset (i.e., what the content is, where it is archived, its temporal and spatial extent, and who to contact for more information.)  <strong>Inventory-level metadata</strong> describes individual products that are available from a particular dataset or data resource.
<p align=left>
<dt><a href="/guide.html">Guide Systems</a>
<dd>Guide information is also considered metadata, but unlike Directory-level or Inventory-level metadata, it's function is to help a user understand or exploit the dataset as opposed to identifying or locating it.  A dataset guide can be thought of as the "200 page User's Manual" that describes all aspects of the dataset in great detail.  The concept of a "dataset guide" has been expanded to include guides on satellites, sensors, programs, organizations, entire countries, and even issues or themes.  Many guides are developed using html-constructs so establishing appropriate hypertext links between them provides a powerful mechanism for building comprehensive documentation libraries.
<p align=left>
<dt><a href="datasys.html">Data and Information Access Systems</a>
<dd>These systems permit a user to access actual data and information resources directly on-line (as opposed to just the metadata about the resources.)
<p align=left>
<dt><a href="browse.html">Browsing, Visualization, and Integration Tools</a>
<dd>These systems allow a user to browse and/or manipulate the data and information resource in some value-added fashion. 
</dl> 
<p align=left>
Please note that the classification scheme is not perfect.  Many of the systems that GCRIO links to fit into more than one of the categories listed above.  Thus, some systems may appear in more than one list.

<h1>US Global Change Research Program</h1>
<p align=left>
Organized in 1989 and created by the Global Change Research Act of 1990, the <a href="http://www.usgcrp.gov/">U.S. Global Change Research Program </a>(USGCRP), an integrated effort of various Agencies and Organizations of the Federal Government,  has been working to better understand  and to deal with natural and human-induced changes in the Earth's environment.  Changes in the global environment, including ozone depletion, climate change and greenhouse warming, natural  variations in the climate, and land use change have the potential for inducing signficant effects on human society  and the Earth's natural ecosystems. 
<p>
The USGCRP is dedicated to sponsoring research on these and other global 
change issues, to use this information to project future climate 
conditions, and to improve understanding of possible consequences of 
global climate change. More detailed information about the USGCRP can be found at the <a href="http://www.usgcrp.gov/">USGCRP Home Page</a>.  An overview of some important aspects of the USGCRP is presented below.

<h1>Global Change Data and Information System (GCDIS)</h1>
<p align=left>
The <a href="http://www.gcdis.usgcrp.gov/">Global Change Data and Information System</a> (GCDIS) is the set of individual agency data and information systems that support global change research supplemented by a minimal amount of crosscutting new infrastructure, and made interoperable by the use of standards, common approaches, technology sharing, and data policy coordination.  The GCDIS user community extends from global change researchers to other researchers, policy makers, educators, private industry, and private citizens.  Through the GCDIS, these users are able to learn about the existence and location of relevant data and information resources, have key holding available in useful forms, and be assured of their quality and continued availability.
<p>
The individual agency components of the GCDIS are funded through their respective budgets.  There will neither be a lead agency nor a separately funded budget for the GCDIS.  Interagency GCDIS implementation will be coordinated through the GCDIS Subgroup of the Data Management Working Group (DMWG) of  the Subcommittee of Global Change Research (SGCR). 
<p>
More detailed information about the GCDIS can be found at the <a href=http://www.gcdis.usgcrp.gov>GCDIS Home Page</a>.  An overview of some important aspects of the GCDIS is presented below.

adaptating teaching materials to local needs(Mexico, India,
Europe, Australia, Vietnam, and Japan with more countries to come) and the
production of
foreign language adaptations of Teachers Guides.
World Resources 1996-97, an excellent reference
source in full-text, offers "projections based on scientific studies, scenarios, and
quantitative models to document future environmental challenges" and 
"contains more than
150 tables, charts, maps, and figures with essential environmental and natural
resources data for nearly every
country in the world."
The projected development(Spring 1997) of DataScape, an interactive software
that will allow "students and professionals to explore global resource data on
the environment, offers promise for future activities.<p>

<h2> Abstract </h2>

<i>Our Changing Planet: The FY 1997 U.S. Global Change Research 
Program</i>  is a report to Congress supplementing the President's FY97 
budget, pursuant 
to 
the Global Change Research Act of 1990. The report describes the structure of 
the program, its goals and objectives, the specific contributions of 
participating agencies, and the proposed budget for component elements of 
the 
program. The report also discusses current and planned research activities 
designed to address a number of key global change environmental science 
issues. Achieving the goals and objectives of the program will require 
continued strong support for the scientific research needed in order to 
improve understanding of how human activities are affecting the global 
environment, as well as how natural and human-induced global change is 
affecting society.<p>

<h3>Purpose</h3>
The purpose of this Program Guide is to provide information on the types of
research and development activities that are supported by Federal agencies in
the area of environment and natural resources, the mechanisms used by
agencies to select R&D recipients of Federal R&D dollars, and potential
funding opportunities. The Administration is committed to a broad range of
high-priority investments (including science and technology), as well as to
deficit reduction, and to a smaller, more efficient Federal Government.  This
document does not represent the final determinant in an overall
Administration budget making process. The research program presented in
this Guide will have to compete for resources against other high-priority
Federal programs. If these programs compete successfully, they will be
included in future Administration budgets.

<br align=center>Rockville, Maryland</h3>

Below are on-line text and downloadable WordPerfect versions of the EPA Report "The Probability of Sea Level Rise".
Both contain the text and tables that were submitted by EPA to its
contractor for editing.  Readers interested in examining
the figures should obtain the hard copy.  Because changes in figure
numbers and in wording were made to Chapters 2-6 in the final
draft, the authors suggest that anyone needing to directly should
obtain the hard copy.  The results chapters (Chapter 7, 8, and 9) and
the summary have not been changed.<p>

        The hard copy of this report can be obtained from the EPA by faxing a
request to 513-489-8695,  or writing to National Center for
Environmental Publications and Information, P.O. Box 42419,
Cincinatti, Ohio, 45242.  Substantive comments and questions
concerning the report should be emailed to the author:

<h3><p align=center>Executive Summary, October, 1996</h3>


This summary comes between the Assessments of 1994 and 1998 on 
Environmental Effects of Ozone Depletion.  Recent research has 
confirmed the conclusions of the earlier assessments and shown an 
increase in reports of new findings since the last Assessment.<p>

In some areas there are still fields of research where the uncertainty 
of the impact of ozone depletion needs to be reduced: For global UV 
irradiation reaching the earth's surface, verification of long-term UV 
trends by direct measurement is needed; for human health, 
infectious diseases, vaccination efficacy, cataract and melanoma 
incidence are areas of uncertainty; and for aquatic and terrestrial 
ecosystems, the areas include food production and biodiversity.  It is 
clear that several of these research areas require long-term studies 
for meaningful results to be obtained.<p>

<h3>Ozone and UV Changes</h3>

Reductions in stratospheric ozone are continuing, both in the 
Antarctic with the re-appearance of the ozone "hole" each spring, and 
at other locations and times in both hemispheres.  High latitudes of 
the northern hemisphere have experienced very low ozone in the 
last two winters, apparently due to record-low temperatures in the 
lower stratosphere, which favor the formation of polar stratospheric 
clouds and thereby the activation of ozone-destroying chlorine.  Mid-
latitude ozone levels in both hemispheres remain significantly lower 
than during the 1980s.  Record low ozone recently observed at some 
lower latitude locations (e.g., Mauna Loa) during 1994/95 was 
probably mainly due to stratospheric circulation changes rather than 
to chemical causes.  Re-analysis of ozone measurements from the 
Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) aboard the Nimbus-7 
satellite has been carried out recently.  However, detailed 
comparisons between the re-analyzed data and the earlier (version 
6) TOMS data, the other satellite data (e.g., SBUV and SBUV/2), and 
the ground-based ozone measurements (Dobson instruments) are yet 
to be published.<p>

Substantial progress has been made in the estimation of global 
surface UV levels through the assimilation of satellite-derived data 
into radiative transfer models.  In contrast to earlier models, which 
accounted only for variations in ozone, these new techniques appear 
promising for including also the effects of clouds and possibly 
aerosols on UV transmission.  One study, based on 1979-1992 ozone 
and cloud reflectivity data from TOMS (version 7), gives erythemal 
UV trends that are smaller (by 10-50%, depending on latitude) than 
the cloud-free trends previously estimated 
from TOMS version 6, SBUV and SBUV/2 ozone data.  However, 
clouds had only a minor impact on the trends of the new study, and 
the discrepancies appear to result from the lower ozone trends 
estimated from the new version 7 TOMS data.<p>

The record of direct UV measurements is still too short for reliable 
estimation of long-term trends.  However, recent measurements at 
both polar and middle latitudes show the expected relationship 
between episodic ozone decreases and UV increases.  Surface UV-
monitoring continues to expand, with international coordination 
under the auspices of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) 
and the Network for Detection of Stratospheric Change (NDSC).  
Several international comparisons of monitoring instruments have 
been carried out, and confirm earlier estimates of usual agreement at 
the 5% level in the UV-A and 10% in the UV-B.  Intercomparisons 
among UV radiation models, and between models and measurements 
are also being carried out or planned.<p>

The effects of clouds on atmospheric and surface radiation have 
received considerable theoretical and observational attention in the 
last year.  Topics of active research have included the spectral 
dependence induced by clouds (showing more effective transmission 
of UV-B than visible radiation), and the complex effects of non-
uniform and broken cloud fields.<p>

<h3>Health Effects</h3>

The principal impacts of UV on health are mediated through two 
organ systems, the skin and the eyes, which receive all of the 
exposure.  These systems are generally either well adapted to (the 
skin) or well protected from (the eyes) such exposures; humans 
benefit from UV exposures through the initiation of Vitamin D3 
production, and even detrimental effects such as DNA damage, are 
normally corrected by efficient repair mechanisms.  Our average 
day-to-day exposure to UV is generally sufficient to ensure 
appropriate levels of Vitamin D.  There is some evidence in tissue 
culture that Vitamin D has inhibitory effects on tumor cell growth.  
Such effects have been suggested as the mechanism underlying an 
observed increase in breast and colon cancers at higher latitudes 
(where solar exposures are less).  This linkage is still conjectural, 
however.  The production of the biologically active vitamin is self-
limiting so that excessive exposures are not likely to be associated 
with any benefit.<p>

New findings with regard to the molecular events underlying UV-
induced nonmelanoma skin cancer extend the earlier observations 
that these tumors often have alterations (mutations) in a particular 
(p53) tumor suppressor gene that are typical of UV-B radiation.  The 
recent findings indicate that similar UV-B alterations in a second 
tumor suppressor gene (ptc) are associated with spontaneous (non-
hereditary) basal cell carcinomas (BCC).  These data provide the most 
direct evidence that UV-B radiation contributes to the development 
of these skin tumors.<p>

Additional studies on the involvement of p53 indicate that the 
frequency of such typical UV-B alterations in the skin tumors may 
decrease with lower dose levels and spectral shifts toward the 
longwave UV-A.  An additional finding in UV-induced carcinogenesis 
comes from recent epidemiologic studies, which indicate that BCC is 
not principally related to cumulative UV dose, but as with melanoma, 
appears to be more related to childhood and intermittent over-
exposures.<p>

New epidemiologic studies on melanoma for the most part confirm 
earlier work.  Several studies have suggested that sunscreen use may 
not be protective for melanoma and may even be associated with 
increased risk.  A possible explanation offered to explain these 
observations is that wearing sunscreens, while reducing UV-B 
exposure, provides little protection from UV-A exposures and that 
such exposures are important to melanoma risk.  Although such an 
interpretation is in line with the spectral response of melanoma 
induction in a fish model, such epidemiologic findings may be biased 
by linkages among susceptibility, exposure and sunscreen use.  New 
work in the opossum model for melanoma has shown that short-term 
neonatal exposures to broadband UV-B/UV-A radiation (of 
approximately a week) result in highly aggressive (metastatic) 
melanomas.<p>

It is now clear that there are at least three mechanisms by which 
UV-B exposures may suppress cellular immunity: DNA damage, 
isomerization of urocanic acid, and through the active metabolite of 
vitamin D.  Immune effects can occur both locally at the skin and 
systemically throughout the body.  The local effects have long been 
considered important to the development of skin cancer, but there 
has been little evidence found with regard to the importance of 
systemic effects.  Recent observations of an increase in non-
Hodgkin's lymphoma with increasing solar radiation have led to the 
suggestion that UV-B-induced systemic immunosuppression 
contributes to cancer development in this system.  The implications 
of either local or systemic immune effects for human infectious 
diseases are still unknown.  Epidemiological studies are still required 
to explore these issues.<p>

There is very little new information on UV effects on the eye.  A 
critical lack is an action spectrum for eye effects associated with 
chronic exposures, e.g., cataract.<p>

<h3>Effects on Terrestrial Ecosystems</h3>

Since the last report in 1994, there has been progress on 
understanding the mechanisms of UV action on organisms.  There has 
also been an increasing emphasis on outdoor studies of 
nonagricultural vegetation.  In such experimentation, the importance 
of maintaining a realistic spectral balance between UV and longer 
wavelength radiation during experiments has received more 
attention.  This is important because longer wavelength radiation 
may have ameliorating effects.  The UV-A can also have effects in 
some respects similar to that of UV-B.  In addition to UV-B 
supplementation studies designed to simulate the consequences of 
ozone reduction on sunlight, other research of late has involved 
manipulation of natural solar radiation with filters to show the 
effectiveness of both UV-B and UV-A on organisms.<p>

Many of the effects of UV-B may not involve damage, per se, but 
instead be a matter of the plant using this type of radiation as a 
signal for altering growth form and some physiological processes.  
One example of such a change is the commonly observed increase in 
UV-absorbing protective compounds in plant leaves following 
exposure to UV-B.  This may explain, at least in part, many of the 
seemingly paradoxical results of recent and earlier studies suggesting 
stimulating effects in plants by UV-B.  The UV-B responsiveness is 
often very specific to species, or even races of a given species, and 
depends on other environmental factors such as mineral nutrition, 
drought, local air pollutants, etc.  These differential effects on species 
will likely lead to changes in species interactions and on ecosystem 
dynamics.  Various indirect effects of elevated UV-B radiation are 
receiving attention, including effects of UV-B on decomposition of 
plant litter, which may influence cycling of nutrients.  Other indirect 
effects include influence on plant pathogen susceptibility and plant 
attractiveness to herbivores and pollinators.  Many of these indirect 
effects may be UV-B action mediated through changes in plant 
structure, secondary chemistry and timing of life cycle events.  
Nevertheless, these effects may ultimately be the most important on 
ecosystems.  This is not to dismiss more direct, apparently 
detrimental effects of UV-B on organisms, including microbes and 
lower plants such as mosses.  The peat-forming moss, Sphagnum, 
appears to be sensitive which has implications for some processes in 
biogeochemical cycles such as decreased carbon storage.  Trace gas 
emission from vegetation is also potentially important.  One recent 
study, however, showed no effect of elevated UV-B on emission of 
isoprene, an important precursor compound for tropospheric ozone 
formation.<p>

Recent studies suggest that potentially detrimental effects of UV-B 
radiation in evergreen woody plants may accumulate from year to 
year as had been indicated in earlier work.  Another example of 
accumulating effects has recently been shown for subsequent 
generations of native annual plants.  With exposure of each 
generation, the manifestations of adverse effects were intensified.<p>

The interacting effects of elevated UV-B with other factors important 
in global change such as elevated CO<SUB>2</SUB> and temperature 
are receiving more attention.  While elevated CO<SUB>2</SUB> and 
temperature usually have more pronounced effects than elevated 
UV-B, there are often interactions among these factors such that the 
effects may counteract each other or sometimes they may be 
additive.<p>

<h3>Effects on Aquatic Ecosystems</h3>

In the recent past, scientific and public interest has focused on 
marine primary producers and aquatic ecosystems, which resulted in 
a multitude of studies indicating mostly detrimental effects of UV-B 
radiation on aquatic organisms.  The interest has expanded to include 
effects in individual species as well as specific responses and has 
concentrated on ecologically significant groups and major biomass 
producers using mesocosm studies, emphasizing species interactions.  
In addition, light penetration into the water column was investigated 
by several research groups.<p>

Macroalgae and seagrasses are major biomass producers in aquatic 
ecosystems.  In contrast to phytoplankton most of these organisms 
are sessile and can thus not avoid the exposure to solar radiation at 
their growth site.  Recent investigations showed a pronounced 
sensitivity to solar UV-B, and effects have been found throughout the 
top 10 - 15 m of the water column.  Mechanisms of protection and 
repair are being investigated.<p>

Controversy still exists regarding the interpretation of data on UV-B 
effects in Antarctic phytoplankton.  Estimates of the decreases in 
overall biomass productivity by different authors range from 0 - 12 
%.  Most recently, shifts in phytoplankton community structure have 
been demonstrated, which may have consequences for the food 
web.<p>

Bacteria play a vital role in mineralization of organic matter and 
provide a trophic link to higher organisms.  Recently, the mechanism 
of nitrogen fixation by cyanobacteria has been shown to be affected 
by UV-B stress.  Wetlands constitute important ecosystems both in 
the tropics and at temperate latitudes.  In these areas cyanobacteria 
form major constituents in microbial mats.  The organisms optimize 
their position in the community by vertical migration in the mat 
which is controlled by both visible radiation and UV-B.  
Cyanobacteria are also important in tropical and subtropical rice 
paddy fields where they contribute significantly to the availability of 
nitrogen.  Growth, development and several physiological responses 
of these organisms are affected by solar UV.<p>

Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and particulate organic carbon (POC) 
are degradation products of living organisms.  These substances are 
of importance in the cycling of carbon in aquatic ecosystems.  UV-B 
radiation has been found to break down high molecular weight 
substances and make them available to bacterial degradation.  In 
addition, DOC is responsible for short wavelength absorption in the 
water column.  Especially in coastal areas and freshwater ecosystems, 
penetration of solar radiation is limited by high concentrations of 
dissolved and particulate matter.  On the other hand, climate 
warming and acidification result in faster degradation of these 
substances and thus enhance the penetration of UV radiation into the 
water column.<p>

UV effects on aquatic animals have found increased interest.  In 
addition to effects on larval stages in amphibia, sea urchins were 
found to be affected by solar UV-B radiation despite the fact that 
they have partial protection from mycosporine amino acids, which 
they take up with their food.  Corals have been known to be directly 
affected by solar UV; in addition, photosynthesis in their symbiotic 
algae is impaired, resulting in reduced organic carbon supply.<p>

All of the previous studies on UV penetration into the water column 
were based on occasional measurements.  This will be corrected by a 
recent project involving the development of a monitoring system 
(ELDONET) for solar radiation in Europe using three-channel 
dosimeters (UV-A, UV-B, PAR), which are being installed from 
Abisko (North Sweden, 68&#176  N, 19&#176  E) to Tenerife (Canary 
Islands, 27&#176  N, 17&#176  W).  Some of the instruments will be 
installed in the water column (North Sea, Baltic Sea, Kattegat, East 
and Western Mediterranean, North Atlantic), establishing the first 
network of underwater dosimeters for continuous monitoring.<p>

<h3>Effects on Biogeochemical Cycles</h3>

Terrestrial studies are continuing to examine the influence of 
enhanced UV-B radiation on microbial decomposition of plant litter 
to carbon dioxide and nutrients.  Additional studies have confirmed 
that litter from plants grown under enhanced UV-B is enriched in 
lignin and decomposed to CO<SUB>2</SUB> more slowly by soil 
microorganisms.<p>

The fate and transport of trifluoroacetate (TFA), a persistent 
substance derived from the oxidation of certain CFC replacements 
(HFC-123, HFC-124, HFC-134a), was investigated in a temperate 
forest of North America.  The study indicates that the added TFA was 
retained in vegetation and soil, especially in the case of wetlands 
with organic soils.  In addition, biological accumulation was observed 
as was a lack of microbial consumption.<p>

Studies of photodegradation of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) by UV 
radiation are continuing and expanding.  Several studies published 
over the past year have provided additional evidence that exposure 
to UV radiation enhances the degradation of DOC to CO<SUB>2</SUB> 
and ammonium.  In addition, low-molecular-weight organic products 
are produced and are readily assimilated by microorganisms.<p>

Volatile compounds are produced by aquatic DOC photodegradation 
and additional studies of the photoproduction of carbon monoxide 
have appeared.  CO is an important trace gas that strongly influences 
biogeochemical cycles through its effects on chemical reactions in the 
atmosphere.  Two new studies of marine CO photoproduction have 
resulted in disparate estimates of global oceanic sea-to-air emissions.  
These two global flux estimates are two orders of magnitude apart: 
10-15 Tg CO year<sup>-1</sup> and 1000 Tg year<sup>-1</sup> (1 Tg 
= 1012 g).  Total annual emissions of CO from all sources, by 
comparison, are about 2000-2500 Tg year<sup>-1</sup> primarily 
from fossil fuel combustion and CH<SUB>4</SUB> oxidation.<p>

New modeling approaches are being developed to predict the 
interactions and feedbacks between climate change and UV-B 
induced changes in marine biogeochemical cycles.  Important links 
exist between oceanic dimethylsulfide (DMS) production, sea-to-air 
DMS flux and subsequent changes in the sulfate aerosol-related 
atmospheric radiation balance.  These alterations indicate possible 
consequences with regard to climate and climate prediction, because 
DMS is an important source of cloud condensation nuclei over parts 
of the ocean.<p>

<h3>Effects on Air Quality</h3>

The photo-dissociation of ozone by atmospheric UV-B radiation is a 
key reaction that controls urban and regional oxidants, the self-
cleaning capacity of the troposphere, and the atmospheric lifetimes 
of many natural and anthropogenic gases.  In the last year, published 
evidence from theoretical, laboratory, and field studies shows that 
UV-A wavelengths also contribute to this reaction, and therefore 
some revision of current tropospheric chemistry models is required.  
Although quantitative estimates of the implications of this new 
finding have not been carried out yet, impacts are likely for 
predicted geographical and seasonal distributions of gases such as 
methane (CH<SUB>4</SUB>) and carbon monoxide (CO), and the 
sensitivity of tropospheric chemistry to stratospheric ozone 
depletion.<p>

Further evidence for the linkage between stratospheric UV 
transmission and tropospheric composition was found in the records 
of surface CH<SUB>4</SUB> and CO concentrations.  Temporary 
increases in tropical CH<SUB>4</SUB> and CO concentrations were 
observed in the second half of 1991, in phase with high levels of 
stratospheric sulfur dioxide and sulfate aerosols that resulted from 
the June 1991 eruption of Mt. Pinatubo.  The reduced stratospheric 
UV transmission is believed to have lowered the rate of 
CH<SUB>4</SUB> and CO removal, due to decreased photo-dissociation 
of tropospheric ozone, and therefore decreased hydroxyl radical (OH) 
production.<p>

The atmospheric chemistry of CFC substitutes and the possible build-
up of their breakdown products (particularly trifluoroacetic acid, or 
TFA) has attracted more attention.  The background atmospheric 
concentrations of HFC-134a (a principal precursor of TFA) are 
increasing rapidly, according to measurements at Cape Grim, 
Tasmania (41&#176  S) between 1978 and 1995, and Mace Head, 
Ireland (53&#176  N) between July 1994 and May 1995.  Model 
estimates suggest that HFC-134a emissions have risen rapidly from 
ca 0.25x10<sup>6</sup> kg in 1991 to ca 8x10<sup>6</sup> kg in 
1994.  TFA concentrations in air and water samples collected in 
Germany, Switzerland and Israel in 1995 contained surprisingly high 
levels of TFA, comparable to concentrations predicted by models for 
the year 2010.  This suggests that an additional yet unknown source 
of TFA may be present.<p>

Modeling studies give different estimates for future concentrations of 
TFA in rainwater, e.g., tropical maxima of 0.114 mg l<sup>-1</sup> 
predicted for the year 2020, and a global mean of 0.160 mg l<sup>-
1</sup> by the year 2010 predicted by another study.  However, 
other modeling studies have concluded that a number of factors can 
enhance local concentrations of TFA.  The TFA concentrations in the 
precipitation of arid and semi-arid regions may be 2-4 times greater 
than the global mean.  Furthermore, in urban air where high OH and 
HFC levels are present, the rate of formation of TFA may be 
enhanced by an order-of-magnitude or more.  Therefore, local TFA 
concentration in rainwater as high as 2-20 mg l<sup>-1</sup> or 
more appears plausible.  Water bodies characterized by little or no 
outflow and which have high evaporation rates may be susceptible to 
accumulation of rain-borne TFA, leading to significant concentration 
enhancements.  Model calculations predict that such wetlands could 
experience concentrations of up to 100 mg l<sup>-1</sup> within 30 
years, even when seepage is as much as 10%.<p>

<h3>Materials Damage</h3>

Efforts to refine the wavelength sensitivity data for common 
polymers have continued, with the commodity polymers 
polyethylene and polypropylene receiving the most attention.  
Results from several research groups include data on the relative 
photodamage to polyolefins, acrylics, polystyrene, and other 
polymers, caused by exposure to different regions of a solar-
simulated source spectrum.  With polyethylene, the wavelength 
range 300-330 nm in simulated sunlight was reported to be most 
effective in reducing the tensile extensibility of the material, a result 
in agreement with previous findings.  These types of data, referred 
to here as activation spectra, are useful in the estimation of damage 
to polymers exposed to UV-enhanced solar radiation that results 
from ozone depletion.<p>

Recent findings have shown that while solar radiation is principally 
responsible for outdoor degradation of polymers including 
polyethylene, factors such as temperature and exposure to moisture 
also have an impact on the useful lifetime of materials outdoors.  
Several studies have reported on the acceleration of weathering of 
polyethylene films under harsh desert conditions, where the 
radiation dose and the temperatures are particularly high.<p>

Research was recently carried out on polycarbonate 
photodegradation aimed at generating action spectra for the 
yellowing and molecular-level breakdown of this polymer used in 
glazing applications.  This research also studied the irradiance 
dependency of the degradation process, an important consideration, 
since the construction of action spectra and their derivation from 
polychromatic exposure experiments assume the damage process to 
be irradiance-independent within the range of irradiance 
encountered in the experiments.  The findings facilitate the 
intercomparison of previously reported wavelength sensitivity data 
for polycarbonate polymers.  An on-going study is aimed at 
separating out the contributions of solar radiation and temperature, 
to the damage suffered by polyethylene polymers during outdoor 
exposure.  The data will allow a better understanding of the role of 
temperature in modifying the UV-induced photodegradation of 
polymers exposed to UV-enhanced sunlight resulting from ozone 
depletion.<p>

<h3>Future Effects Studies</h3>

The global environment is experiencing a wide range of 
perturbations.  Increased greenhouse gases, sulfate and dust aerosols 
and increased UV-B from ozone depletion are all occurring 
simultaneously.  Assessment of the potential risks from such changes 
needs to consider the full context in which these changes are taking 
place and must take into account the many interactions that may 
occur.  This will require a long-term integrated, interdisciplinary 
research program designed to include studies which evaluate not 
only UV-B but also the other processes which are contributing to 
global environmental change.<p>

<blockquote><hr size="0.5" noshade>
<font size="+1">
The Earth Education Site <b>Features</b> is a monthly series of full-length articles. 
Through 
Features, we will seek out scientists on the cutting edge of research
about our 
Earth, follow trailblazing environmentalists, and check out
Earth-related education programs.  But most importantly, we will talk to
exceptional teachers from around the globe
and 
relay their knowledge and experiences to you!<p>

Our first feature articles focus on views from the classroom:<p>

<ul>
<li><b><A HREF="Tillery-Feature.html">Teacher, Weatherman, and Future Hurricane
Hunter:</A></b> An Interview
with Fairfax County's John Tillery, a
pioneering 
teacher in the use of direct readout reception from NOAA weather
satellites
to teach high school science.  In 1994 John was the first recipient of the 
Satellite Educator Award from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration's (NOAA) National Environmental Satellite, Data, and
Information 
Service (NESDIS).<p>

<li><b><A HREF="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/papers/globeart.html">GLOBE Program
brings relevance to science 
activities for today's students</b></A>--this article originally appeared
in the
<i>Earth System Monitor</i> and provides some insights on how this major 
international education program is coordinating the work of students,
teachers, 
and scientists.<p>

</ul>
<font size="+2"><b>Let us know what feature articles you want to see in the 
future</b></font><p>


What do the frigid temperatures and crazy weather during the winter of 1996
have to 
do with global warming?  What are the expectations of faculty for college 
freshmen entering their environmental science programs?  What does an
Earth 
system scientist actually do?   Tell us what you want to learn about or
who you would like to 
hear from and we'll do the sleuthing!

The following document is extracted from a new monograph (Berger, A.R. & W.J.Iams 1996. <cite>Geoindicators: Assessing Rapid Environmental Changes in Earth Systems</cite>. Rotterdam: A.A.Balkema).  The full rationale for geoindicators,
together with extensive background material, can be found in this volume.
<p>
ABSTRACT: The condition of the environment at any time reflects not only human
influences but also natural processes and phenomena, which may be causing
change whether or not people are present. The long evolutionary history of the
Earth and the biosphere has been punctuated throughout by environmental changes
that reduced or enhanced the capacity of terrestrial landscapes to provide a
place for healthy life. Moreover, away from obvious sources of human
disturbance (cities, waste disposal sites, mines, deforested areas), it may be
extraordinarily difficult to separate the effects of human actions from those
due to "background" natural processes.<p>
A newly compiled checklist of geological indicators of rapid environmental
change illustrates this point. Listed here are 27 earth system processes and
phenomena that are liable to change in less than a century in magnitude,
direction, or rate to an extent that may be significant for environmental
sustainability and ecological health. Geoindicators have been developed as
tools to assist in integrated assessments of natural environments and
ecosystems, as well as for state-of-the-environment reporting. As descriptors
of common earth processes that operate in one terrestrial setting or another,
geoindicators represent collectively a new kind of landscape metric, one  that
concentrates on the non-living components of the lithosphere, pedosphere,
hydrosphere, and their interactions with the atmosphere and biosphere
(including humans).<p>
<p>
SOURCES: The geoindicator checklist has been developed by the International
Union of Geological Sciences through its Commission on Geological Sciences for
Environmental Planning. The Geoindicators Working Group is chaired by Dr.
Antony Berger, (528 Paradise St. Victoria BC V9A 5E2. Ph/fax (604) 480-0840).

<H4><P> Under the U.S. Country Studies Program, the U.S.
Government provides technical and financial support to
developing countries and countries with economies in transition
to help them conduct climate change studies and prepare national
climate change action plans.  These studies will assist countries
in fulfilling requirements under the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change<A
HREF="http://www.ciesin.org/datasets/unced/unced.html">
(UNFCCC)</A>. 
A total of <A HREF="country.html">fifty-five countries</A> on five

<h1>Bibliographic Data Bases</h1>
<p align=left>
GCRIO provides access to bibliographic data bases that enable a user to 
identify relevant documents and publications based on free-text searches of the title, abstract, and various keywords.  GCRIO maintains its own bibliographic data base which consists primarily of information on global change-related documents that have been generated by US Federal Agencies and Organizations.  In parallel, some Agencies maintain their own bibliographic data base, and in an effort to minimize any duplication of effort, GCRIO simply provides links to those agency data bases.  Finally, GCRIO also provides links to other non-Federal and commercial bibliographic systems.  There are many such systems in the world today; we have tried to identify a few that contain information that is relevant to our mission area. (Many commercial services tend to be business oriented.)  Note that in most cases, one needs an account to use the commercial system.  This list is certainly not exhaustive.  We welcome suggestions for other relevant systems to add to our list.

<h1>Catalog Systems</h1>
<p align=left>
Catalog systems provide access to <strong>metadata</strong> or <i>information about data</i>.  Generally, these systems are used to identify, locate, and in some instances, browse, and order data and information resources of interest.  In general, there are two levels of "location metadata."  <strong>Directory-level metadata</strong> describes entire datasets or data resources at a very high level.  It tells a user about the existence and location of a dataset (i.e., what the content is, where it is archived, its temporal and spatial extent, and who to contact for more information.)  <strong>Inventory-level metadata</strong> describes individual products that are available from a particular dataset or data resource.

<dt><a href="http://ask.gcdis.usgcrp.gov:8080""/>The Global Change Assisted Search for Knowledge (GC-ASK)</a>
<dd>The Global Change Assisted Search for Knowledge (GC-ASK)  is the second of a series of incremental developments to provide the Global Change community with a comprehensive set of tools for accessing and exploiting diverse, distributed databases via the Internet. It builds upon the results of the "GCDIS Thesaurus Pilot Project, 1993," which provided a proof-of-concept for comprehensive searching of text databases. GC-ASK will provide a Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS)-based foundation for further development within and among Global Change participating agencies.

<h1>Guides</h1>
<p align=left>
Guide information is metadata whose function is to help a user utilize the data set rather than just identifying or locating it.  A data set guide can be thought of as a 
"User's Manual" that describes all aspects of the data set in great detail.  The concept of a "data set guide" has been expanded to include guides on satellites, sensors, programs, organizations, entire countries, and even issues or themes.

<h1>Data and Information Systems</h1>
<p align=left>
Items on this page provide access to on-line data.  Most sites allow you to download data directly to your computer system. Metadata (information about the data such as observation methods and data quality) are often also available at these sites.  Some datasets have restrictions on their use.  For example, a dataset might not be quality-checked, and therefore not ready for analysis that would lead to publication.  It is important that you also view the metadata and "readme" files associated with a dataset or product.
<p>  
Some systems linked from this page let you order data from the host organization. Depending on the host, the data may be available on a number of media (printouts, floppy disks, tape, CD- ROMS, etc.).  Some datasets are free.  Others may be available for 
a nominal fee to cover the host organization's marginal cost of preparation, reproduction, and/or dissemination.

<h1>Browse and Visualization Systems</h1>
<p align=left>
Systems that enable the browsing or visualization of data are typically used to determine whether or not a particular product is suitable to a given application or requirement.  A browse entity often consists of a subset of the actual data product, and is intended to provide a representative sample of the content at reduced resolution. 
<p>  
There are two general browse methods.  In a static browse system, a user accesses browse products that have been pre-selected.  In a dynamic browse system, browse entities are generated "on the fly" in response to user requirements.

<dd>The Global Land Information System (GLIS) is an interactive computer system
developed by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) for researchers seeking sources
of information about the Earth's land surfaces. GLIS contains metadata that is,
descriptive information about data sets. Through GLIS, researchers can evaluate
data sets, determine their availability, and place online requests for
products.
GLIS offers online samples of earth science data that may be ordered through
the system.

<center><h2>TITLE I--UNITED STATES *GLOBAL CHANGE* RESEARCH 
PROGRAM</h2></center>
 
<h3>SEC. 101.  FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.</h3>

(a) FINDINGS.--The Congress makes the following findings:

<ol><li>Industrial, agricultural, and other human activities,
coupled with an expanding world population, are contributing to
processes of *GLOBAL CHANGE* that may significantly alter the
Earth habitat within a few human generations.

<li>Such human-induced *CHANGES*, in conjunction with natural
fluctuations, may lead to significant global warming and thus
alter world climate patterns and increase *GLOBAL* sea levels.  Over
the next century, these consequences could adversely affect
world agricultural and marine production, coastal habitability,
biological diversity, human health, and *GLOBAL* economic and
social well-being.

<li>The release of chlorofluorocarbons and other stratospheric
ozone-depleting substances is rapidly reducing the ability of the
atmosphere to screen out harmful ultraviolet radiation, which
could adversely affect human health and ecological systems.

<li>Development of effective policies to abate, mitigate, and
cope with *GLOBAL CHANGE* will rely on greatly improved scientific
understanding of *GLOBAL* environmental processes and on our
ability to distinguish human-induced from natural *GLOBAL*
*CHANGE*.

<li>New developments in interdisciplinary Earth sciences,
*GLOBAL* observing systems, and computing technology make 
possible significant advances in the scientific understanding and
prediction of these *GLOBAL CHANGES* and their effects.

<li>Although significant Federal *GLOBAL CHANGE* research 
efforts are underway, an effective Federal research program will
require efficient interagency coordination, and coordination
with the research activities of State, private, and international
entities.</ol>

(b) PURPOSE.--The purpose of this title is to provide for development 
and coordination of a comprehensive and integrated United States 
research program which will assist the Nation and the world to 
understand, assess, predict, and respond to human-induced and 
natural processes of *GLOBAL CHANGE*.

well as the citizens of foreign countries, scientific research 
information available in the United States which would be useful in
preventing, mitigating, or adapting to the effects of *GLOBAL 
CHANGE*.<p>

Such information shall include, but need not be limited to, results of
scientific research and development on technologies useful for--<p>
<ol><li>reducing energy consumption through conservation and 
energy efficiency;
<li>promoting the use of solar and renewable energy sources which 
reduce the amount of greenhouse gases released into the 
atmosphere;
<li>developing replacements for chlorofluorocarbons, halons, and 
other ozone-depleting substances which exhibit a significantly 
reduced potential for depleting stratospheric ozone;
<li>promoting the conservation of forest resources which help reduce 
the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere;
<li>assisting developing countries in ecological pest management 
practices and in the proper use of agricultural, and industrial 
chemicals; and
<li>promoting recycling and source reduction of pollutants in order to 
reduce the volume of waste which must be disposed of, thus 
decreasing energy use and greenhouse gas emissions.</ol>

<h2>International Global Change Programs and Activities</h2><p>

In recent years the international scientific community has worked to
improve understanding of global environmental processes. Governmental,
intergovernmental, and nongovernmental organizations are developing
research programs and working groups to answer the fundamental question,
"How does the earth system work?" International global change programs
address scientific questions related to the global environment. Questions
put forth by these organizations and leading national programs have driven
much of the scientific research in this field. Many countries have
instituted national global change research programs.<p>

The international global change programs and activities include:<p>

<h2>Library Holdings </h2><p>

The GCRIO serves as a pointer to 
several libraries.  These may be smaller libraries that 
contain specialized information (such as the U. S. Environmental 
Protection Agency Library), or they may be general-purpose 
research libraries (such as the University of Michigan Library).  
Although the software for searching varies from system to system, 
the following library systems that can be connected to from the GCRIO 
allow searching of materials by author, title, subject, and keywords:<p>

<h1>Bulletin Board Systems</h1>
<p align=left>
Bulletin Board Systems (BBSs) provide access to documents, data, 
software, and discussion groups covering a wide range of environmental 
topics.   Traditionally, BBSs were accessible via phone dial-up.  
Many of them are now accessible via the Internet.  Most BBSs ask a user for his/her name, address, and possibly other information when logging in.
<p align=left>
<h2>US Federal Bulletin Board Systems</h2>
<p align=left>
<ul>
<li><a href="telnet://fedworld.gov">Fed World</a><br>
Fed World provides access to a large number of federally-maintained bulletin board services.  They are organized into subject categories; the Environment and Energy Mall seems particularly relevant.  This link connects (via telnet) to a FedWorld host,
 and a new is prompted for name, address, phone number, etc.  New users must define a password which is used for future accesses.  FedWorld also maintains a <a href="http://www.fedworld.gov/index.html"> web site</a>.
<p>
<li><a href="telnet://ttnbbs.rtpnc.epa.gov">EPA Technology Transfer Network Bulletin Board</a><br>
The EPA Technology Transfer Network Bulletin Board provides information on clear air admendments, air pollution, and emissions test methods.
<p>
<li><a href="telnet://gopher.c-wr.siu.edu:4503">WaterTalk</a><br>
The US Geological Survey sponsors WaterTalk, a bulletin board service that has discussions on hydrology, international water resources, groundwater quality, and water policy.
<p>
</ul>
<h2>Non-Federal and Commercial Bulletin Board Systems</h2>
<p align=left>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://dkeep.com/sbi.htm">Select BBSs on the Internet</a><br>
The web site is a listing of bulletin board systems that are accessible on the Internet.  It is maintained by Richard Marx and is the official BBS Internet list maintained by BBS Magazine.

<h2>CD-ROM</h2>

Compact Disc Read-Only Memory (CD-ROMs) are convenient and inexpensive
media to store large amounts of data and information.  The information
stored on a CD-ROM may include data, text, graphics, audio, and software. 
Given the large amounts of information stored on a CD-ROM, and that many
data sets require more than one disc for storage, it is not practical to
access information from CD-ROMs on-line.  The following items
describe CD-ROM products that are available from
various sources.  Some of these products are free, but most are available
for a nominal processing fee.<p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/OnLnDat/cfr.html">
	Environmental Code of Federal Regulations CD-ROM</a>

<li><a href="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdrom/cdrom.html">
	National Climatic Data Center CD-ROM (NCDC)</a>

<strong>
Members of Congress:</strong>

<p>

I am pleased to forward to you a copy of Our Changing Planet: The FY1997 
U.S. Global Change Research Program.  This annual report was prepared 
under the auspices of the President's National Science and Technology 
Council (NSTC). 

<p>

The U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) is crucial to 
understanding, predicting, and assessing global environmental changes and 
their consequences for human health, food production, ecological systems, 
and sustainable economic development.  The USGCRP has advanced our 
understanding of key global environmental science issues, including:  
seasonal to interannual climate variability; climate change over decades to 
centuries; changes in ozone, UV radiation, and atmospheric chemistry; and 
changes in land cover and in terrestrial and marine ecosystems.  As the 
National Academy of Sciences noted in its recent review of the program: "A 
great deal of extremely high-quality science that is recognized worldwide for 
its excellence has resulted from the USGCRP."

<p>

The past year has brought significant new findings about the causes and 
consequences of global change.  New results include demonstration of strong 
El Ni&#241;o impacts on crop yields and rangeland conditions in Utah and 
Idaho, 
and compelling new evidence of links between climate change, weather, and 
negative human health effects, including increases in heat-related mortality 
and in exposure to both vector and non-vector-borne diseases.  Perhaps most 
important is the widespread agreement reached this year among leading 
researchers that the balance of evidence suggests that there is a discernible 
human influence on global climate.

<p>

The USGCRP, a coordinated interagency effort established by President 
Reagan and elevated to a Presidential Initiative by President Bush, was 
codified by Congress in the Global Change Research Act of 1990.  President 
Clinton is continuing this strong bipartisan tradition of support.  The FY1997 
Budget Request demonstrates the Administration's ongoing commitment to 
the program.  The President and the Vice President believe that global change 
research is critical to our future as we head into the 21st century.

<p>

I commend Dr. Robert Corell of the National Science Foundation, Chair of 
the NSTC Subcommittee on Global Change Research, the members of the 
Subcommittee, and all of the participants in government, academia, and 
industry for their efforts in making this program a success.

<p>

Summary</title></head>

<h1><p align=center>Executive Summary</h1><p>

<center><h3>Overview of the U.S. Global Change Research 
Program</center></h3><p>

The Earth's environment is constantly changing. Scientific evidence 
indicates that these changes are the result of a complex interplay 
among a number of natural and human-related systems.<p>

While the complexity of the Earth system and the interconnections 
among its components make understanding and prediction a very 
difficult challenge, the development of scientific knowledge and 
research capabilities are greatly advancing the understanding of 
global environmental change and the role of human activities in 
contributing to and responding to change.<p>

Humans have come to play a powerful and expanding role as agents 
of environmental change and human activities are also substantially 
impacted by global-scale environmental changes. The current and 
future state of the Earth system is inexorably linked to human 
activities.<p>

The United States, through the U.S. Global Change Research Program 
(USGCRP), along with other nations, supports the research needed to 
characterize and understand global environmental change and to 
provide answers to important questions about the Earth system 
(including human activities), how it is changing, and the implications 
of global change for society and the natural ecosystems and managed 
resource systems on which society depends.<p>

To assess the state of scientific information and identify research 
needs, the United States participates actively in national and 
international evaluations of the scientific understanding of global 
change issues. These assessments bring together large numbers of 
scientists representing a broad spectrum of research specialties and 
viewpoints to prepare carefully and widely reviewed reports that 
encompass the range of qualified scientific findings and 
perspectives.<p>

In 1995, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 
approved its Second Assessment Report, which, among other 
conclusions, stated that "the balance of evidence suggests that there 
is a discernible human influence on global climate."<p>

This follows on a 1994 scientific assessment of ozone depletion 
organized by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and 
United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), which found that 
the "conclusion that anthropogenic chlorine and bromine compounds, 
coupled with surface chemistry on natural polar stratospheric 
particles, are the cause of polar ozone depletion has been further 
strengthened."<p>

Since its establishment as a Presidential Initiative in the FY90 
budget, the USGCRP has been responsible for directing Federal 
support for scientific research to address key uncertainties about 
global environmental change and the Earth system.<p>

The goals of the U.S. Global Change Research Program are:<p>
<ul>
<li>To observe and document changes in the Earth system<br>

<li>To understand what changes are occurring and why<br>

<li>To improve predictions of future global change<br>

<li>To analyze the environmental, socioeconomic, and health 
consequences of global change<br>

<li>To support state-of-the-science assessments of global 
environmental change issues.</ul><p>

The USGCRP budget request for FY97 is $1.73 billion, with 10 
agencies participating in the program. A few of the agencies support 
research on the broad range of scientific areas relating to the global 
environment, while others support research that has a more mission-
oriented focus. The programmatic contributions of the USGCRP 
agencies are coordinated and closely matched to agency missions and 
areas of expertise.<p>

In response to requests from the Subcommittee on Global Change 
Research and from Congressional committee chairs in both the House 
and Senate, the National Research Council (NRC) of the National 
Academy of Sciences (NAS) has been conducting a major program 
review of the USGCRP.<p>

In a September 1995 interim report, the NRC concluded, "The 
scientific and societal motivations of the program remain compelling, 
and the USGCRP should be aggressively pursued." The report stated 
that, "A great deal of extremely high-quality science that is 
recognized worldwide for its excellence and leadership has resulted 
from the USGCRP."<p>

The NRC also made a number of recommendations. The 
Subcommittee on Global Change Research and the USGCRP 
participating agencies have been moving aggressively to respond to 
the NRC recommendations on program integration and strategic 
research directions.<p>


<h3><center>Key Global Change Environmental Science 
Issues</center></h3><p>

In response to the development of scientific understanding and 
research capabilities that has occurred over the life of the program, 
the USGCRP is moving to focus research efforts on what the NRC has 
termed "...priority issues in four mature areas of Earth system 
science that are of great scientific and practical importance." These 
priority environmental science issues follow:<p>
<ul>
<b>1) Seasonal to Interannual Climate Variability, </b>with the goal of 
obtaining a predictive understanding and the skills to produce 
forecasts of short-term climate fluctuations and to apply these 
predictions to problems of social and economic development in the 
United States and abroad.<p>

Progress toward this goal will provide improved predictions that can, 
among other direct benefits, help farmers maintain their agricultural 
productivity in spite of extreme climatic events such as droughts and 
floods, help water resource managers to ensure reliable water 
deliveries and optimal reservoir levels, help in planning fishery 
harvests, and help foresters allocate resources effectively to 
safeguard forests (and the public) from fire during droughts.<p>

Scientists can now predict with reasonable certainty, up to 1 year in 
advance, the onset of episodes of the phenomenon known as the El 
Ni&#241;o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in the tropical Pacific Ocean. 
This interaction between the ocean and atmosphere is linked to 
fluctuations in precipitation and temperature throughout the tropics 
and into higher latitudes, including the United States. These 
fluctuations can result in severe flooding and harsh droughts. As 
evidenced by the 1996 drought in the southwestern United States, 
extreme climatic events have serious implications for economic and 
social systems. The USGCRP plays a leading role in an on-going global 
endeavor to develop and enhance prediction capabilities, and to 
apply experimental forecasts to real problems of economic planning 
and development in climate sensitive sectors such as agriculture, 
water, and public health.<p>

<b>2) Climate Change over Decades to Centuries, </b>with the goal of 
understanding, predicting, assessing, and preparing for changes in 
the climate and the global environment that will result from the 
influences of projected changes in population, energy use, land cover, 
and other natural and human-induced factors.<p>

Progress toward this goal will provide information needed by 
decision makers considering adaptive or mitigative responses to the 
projected changes in climate and the associated environmental and 
societal impacts. The information will also assist planners and 
managers with responsibilities for the design of infrastructure and 
other major facilities, sustained management of natural resource-
based systems, and long-term planning in the financial sector.<p>

The scientific community, through the IPCC Second Assessment 
Report, projects that during the next century and beyond human 
influences will alter the climate to an extent almost as great as the 
changes associated with going from past glacial to interglacial 
periods. This unprecedented rate of change will likely have 
significant impacts on forests, agriculture, water supplies, and human 
health. While much scientific progress has been made over the past 
few decades in developing a broad-scale understanding of the causes 
of global climate change, significant gaps remain, particularly with 
regard to estimating regional changes and understanding potential 
consequences and how society can mitigate or adapt to these 
changes. The USGCRP will continue to play a leading role in reducing 
scientific uncertainties in the understanding of the physical climate 
system while broadening research to improve the understanding of 
the impacts of climate change on natural resources and 
socioeconomic sectors.<p>

<b>3) Changes in Ozone, UV Radiation, and Atmospheric 
Chemistry,</b> with the goal of understanding and characterizing the 
chemical changes in the global atmosphere and their consequences 
for human health and well-being.<p>

Progress toward this goal will provide information to assist policy 
makers in protecting human health, preserving the cleansing and 
protective qualities of the atmosphere, and ensuring that new 
compounds do not lead to inadvertent environmental 
consequences.<p>

The USGCRP provides a framework for a comprehensive and 
integrated research effort that provides information of great value to 
policy makers. For example, through USGCRP-supported research, 
emissions of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) from human activities have 
been unambiguously identified as the cause of the Antarctic ozone 
hole. Projections that large increases in CFC emissions would lead to 
large losses of stratospheric ozone underlie the agreement to phase 
out CFC use, and observations of declining CFC concentrations 
demonstrate the efficacy of policies adopted to protect the ozone 
layer.<p>

<b>4) Changes in Land Cover and in Terrestrial and Marine 
Ecosystems, </b>with the goal of providing a stronger scientific basis 
for understanding, predicting, assessing, and responding to the 
causes and consequences of changes in terrestrial and marine 
ecosystems resulting from human-induced and natural 
influences.</ul><p>

Progress toward this goal will provide a stronger scientific basis for 
developing environmental and natural resource practices that are 
environmentally sound and practical, and that will ensure 
ecosystems yield sustainable benefits to humankind.<p>

The USGCRP supports research projects to inventory the current land 
cover of the Earth and to document changes; to improve 
understanding of the dynamics of land-cover and land-use change 
and how terrestrial ecosystems react to change; and to document and 
understand chemical, physical, and biological processes in the oceans 
and their relationship with the carbon cycle and marine life.<p>

<h3><center>Integrating Research Themes, Scientific Information, and 
Outreach Responsibilities</h3></center><p>

To provide the basis for continuing advancement in scientific 
understanding and to fulfill the U.S. commitment to international 
leadership in global change research, the USGCRP supports a number 
of essential ongoing integrative and cooperative efforts:<p>
<ul>
<b>1) Observing and Monitoring Global Change,</b> with the goal of 
ensuring the availability of a long-term, high-quality observational 
record of the state of the Earth system, its natural variability, and 
changes that are occurring over extended time scales.<p>

These observations of the atmosphere, oceans, and land surface, and 
their interactions, will provide the basis for understanding and 
monitoring changes in the Earth system.<p>

The United States supports a diverse set of surface, <i>in situ</i>, and 
satellite systems, including the Earth Observing System (EOS) series 
of satellites and surface and satellite measurement capabilities that 
contribute to multiple goals, including weather and climate 
prediction, hazard warning, and documentation of changes in the 
global environment. These capabilities already provide a substantial 
base of information. Planning is underway to move toward an even 
more comprehensive system for observing and monitoring the 
changing state of the Earth system.<p>

<b>2) Global Change Data, Products, and Information Services,</b> 
with the goal of providing all users ready and affordable access in 
useful forms to the full spectrum of global change data, products, and 
information.<p>

Achieving this goal will accelerate scientific progress while also 
greatly enhancing public and private sector access to data that can 
make the economy more resilient to changes and fluctuations, help 
education at all levels, allow adaptation to changes, and aid resource 
managers in management and planning.<p>

This user service activity includes the identification, assembly, 
documentation, archiving, and dissemination of data and information 
gathered from many types of observational platforms and research 
programs. It primarily focuses on providing user access to Federal 
agency sources of data and information, but has links to international 
and other sources.<p>

<b>3) Earth System Science, with the goal of supporting the long-
term,</b> integrated and exploratory research needed to gain a 
predictive understanding of the interactions among the physical, 
chemical, geological, ecological, and solar processes that determine 
the functioning of the Earth system and its trends and fluctuations on 
global and regional scales.<p>

Pursuing this goal provides the basis for continuing advances in 
fundamental understanding of the world around us and helps to 
identify emerging issues and potential changes of low probability but 
high impact (often referred to as surprises).<p>

The USGCRP supports the advance of understanding of the Earth 
system through experiments that explore the working of physical, 
chemical, geological, solar, and biological processes, and through 
Earth system modeling to interrelate and tie together the many 
processes into a unified representation of the atmosphere-ocean-
land-ecological system.<p>

<b>4) Human Contributions and Responses to Global Change, </b>with 
the goal of identifying, understanding, and analyzing how human 
activities contribute to changes in natural systems, how the 
consequences of natural and human-induced change affect the health 
and well-being of humans and their institutions, and how humans 
could potentially respond to problems associated with environmental 
change.<p>

Progress toward this goal will provide an improved scientific basis 
for decision makers considering how society should respond to 
global-scale environmental change.<p>

Research on human contributions and responses is a small, but 
critical and growing, component of the USGCRP. The USGCRP supports 
a diverse range of studies by leading researchers in universities, 
research institutions, and Government laboratories across the United 
States, in both basic and applied settings.<p>

<b>5) International Research Cooperation, </b>with the goal of 
supporting and assisting the program and its participating scientists 
and agencies in their interactions with related international research, 
observing, and assessment activities and in the full and open 
international sharing of data and research findings.<p>

Progress toward this goal will enhance the cooperative effort to 
improve understanding of global change, which can best be achieved 
by aggregating and coordinating the capabilities and resources of 
various nations.<p>

In support of this cooperative effort, the USGCRP participates in and 
supports the three major international non-governmental global 
change research programs that are initiated within the scientific 
community. The USGCRP has also developed a range of global, 
regional, and bilateral mechanisms to provide a framework within 
which U.S. scientists and colleagues in other countries can cooperate 
to address specific research issues and to study specific regions of 
mutual interest.<p>

<b>6) Global Change Education and Communication,</b> with the goal 
of increasing public awareness of the Earth system and how it is 
changing and to promote global change education.</ul><p>

Progress toward this goal will help ensure that societal decision 
making is based on an informed understanding of global change, and 
will serve society's vital interest in the education of young 
scientists.<p>

The USGCRP has a multi-pronged approach to promote the 
dissemination and use of global change research and information; to 
promote the development of the next generation of scientists; to 
integrate global change information into the existing formal and 
informal educational systems; and to support professional 
development programs for educators on Earth system science.

<h1><center>Overview Of The U.S. Global Change Research 
Program</h1></center><p>

<i><center>A great deal of extremely high - quality science that is recognized

<sup><a href="fn1ch1.html">1</a></sup></i></center><p>

<b><center><a name="earth">The</a> Earth System</b></center><p>

The Earth's environment is in a state of continuous change. Continents drift, 
mountains are driven upwards and erode, animal and plant species evolve, 
terrestrial and marine ecosystems change, the Earth's orbit about the Sun 
varies, and the atmosphere and oceans adjust in response to these and 
numerous other forces that act on our planet. Large changes such as these 
generally occur very slowly and are the result of major natural forces beyond 
human influence or control. Over periods of decades to centuries, however, 
natural changes have been relatively small, at least for the several thousand 
years before the onset of large-scale agricultural and industrial activities.<p>

Although we are relative newcomers to the scene, humans have now become 
powerful agents of environmental change, at least initially on time scales of 
decades to centuries. The chemistry of the atmosphere has been altered by the 
agricultural and industrial revolutions. Erosion of soils, sediment loading of 
rivers, and shoreline contours have been influenced dramatically by 
agriculture and construction. The production and release of toxic chemicals as 
well as changes in land use and land management have affected the health 
and distribution of populations of living organisms. The development of 
water resources has affected patterns of natural water storage, evaporation, 
and river flow on the world's continents.<p>

With the increasing world population, the expanding global economy, and 
the development of new technologies, the role of humans as agents of 
environmental change is likely to become even more significant in the 
future. The use of fossil fuels is changing atmospheric composition and 
exerting an increasing warming influence on the global climate. The 
destruction of forests and certain agricultural practices also contribute to 
changes in the atmospheric composition and to climate change. Changes in 
land use alter the ability of the land to provide ecological services, including 
water purification and habitat for wildlife. The emissions of CFCs and other 
chlorine-and bromine-containing gases have led to depletion of stratospheric 
ozone that will take decades to reverse. All of these factors and more are 
leading to changes in the global environment that could have profound 
consequences.<p>

Scientific research is the means for developing an understanding of these 
changes and their causes. Scientific evidence accumulated over the last few 
decades indicates that the rate, magnitude, and extent of environmental 
changes are the result of a complex interplay among a number of natural and 
human-related systems. Understanding what is occurring and what will occur 
in the future thus requires an understanding of all of the components of what 
has come to be called the Earth system.<p>

The components of the Earth system include the atmosphere, the oceans, the 
continents, the biological life, and the regions of ice and snow. The state of 
these components is controlled by "forcing agents" that lead to changes in 
their state, thus to changes in the overall Earth system. The components are 
linked by an amazing diversity of physical, chemical, and biological processes 
that transmit change throughout the system. Most of these are natural 
processes, but some - for example, changes in land use that result in land-
cover changes and the production of greenhouse gases - are strongly 
influenced by human activities.<p>

Changes in any single element of the Earth's environment cannot be 
understood by studying that component alone. For example, the Earth's 
climate involves not only temperature, winds, and clouds in the atmosphere, 
but also the interactive effects of ocean currents and surface temperatures; the 
biosphere (living organisms and the environment that supports them); 
atmospheric composition; the Earth's orbital characteristics; the reflective 
properties of the planet; the distribution of water between the atmosphere, 
hydrosphere (oceans and freshwater), and cryosphere (snow and ice); and 
numerous other factors. Similarly, other important occurrences, such as 
changes in the productivity of the oceans or land surface or the incidence of 
volcanic eruptions, are linked to a variety of interactive phenomena.<p>

Given the complexity of the Earth system and the many feedbacks among its 
components, understanding and predicting climatic and environmental 
change is an exceedingly difficult challenge. For example, human-induced 
increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO<SUB>2</SUB>) and other trace 
gas concentrations are major forcing factors for climate change. However, 
because CO<SUB>2</SUB> is the primary raw material for photosynthesis, 
an increased CO<SUB>2</SUB> concentration is also likely to influence the 
character, extent, and distribution of the Earth's vegetative cover. This, in 
turn, will affect solar and terrestrial radiation (processes of energy transfer), 
the biogeochemical budget (distribution and circulation of chemicals, such as 
carbon and nitrogen, between the Earth's crust and the cells of living 
organisms), and the hydrological budget (distribution and circulation of 
water). These changes can alter climate in ways that can serve either to 
enhance or ameliorate the effects of the original CO<SUB>2</SUB> forcing. 
Such complexities make prediction anything but straightforward.<p>

Over the past decade, the development of scientific insight and research 
capabilities has greatly advanced the understanding of global change. The 
growing understanding - among scientists and non-scientists alike - that the 
current and future state of the Earth system is inexorably linked to human 
activities, and the growing societal concern about the implications of global 
environmental change, underscore the need for and importance of these 
scientific efforts. The results of research supported by the USGCRP are 
providing both quantitative and qualitative information about important 
questions involving the Earth system (including humans), how it is 
changing, and the implications of global environmental change for 
society.<p>


<b><center><a name="gcrp">The</a> U.S. Global Change Research 
Program</b></div ><p>

The USGCRP was established by President Reagan and included as a 
Presidential Initiative in the FY90 budget by President Bush as a high-priority 
research effort:<p>
<ul>
<li>To address key uncertainties about changes, both natural and human-
induced, in the Earth system<br>

<li>To monitor, understand, and predict global change<br>

<li>To provide a sound scientific basis for national and international decision 
making on global change issues. <sup><a 
href="fn2ch1.html">2</a></sup></ul><p>


Congress codified the USGCRP in the <a href="/gcact1990.html">Global 
Change Research Act of 1990</a>, in order to provide for the following:<p>
<ul>
<li>"Development and coordination of a comprehensive and integrated U.S. 
research program that will assist the Nation and the world to understand, 
assess, predict, and respond to human-induced and natural processes of global 
change"<br>

<li>"Increasing the overall effectiveness and productivity of Federal global 
change research efforts." <sup><a 
href="fn3ch1.html">3</a></sup></ul><p>

The <a href="/gcact1990.html">Global Change Research Act</a> defines 
global change as "changes in the global environment (including alterations in 
climate, land productivity, oceans or other water resources, atmospheric 
chemistry, and ecological systems) that may alter the capacity of the Earth to 
sustain life."<p>

This mandate for the USGCRP makes it clear that the program is to have a 
broad scope and consider the full set of issues dealing with actual and 
potential global environmental change. This broad approach recognizes the 
profound economic, social, and ecological implications of global changes and 
the need for U.S. leadership in this area.<p>

Since its inception, the USGCRP has been directed toward strengthening 
research on key scientific issues, and has fostered much improved insight 
into the processes and interactions of the Earth system. The results of research 
supported by the USGCRP play an important role in international scientific 
assessments, including assessments of climate change and stratospheric ozone 
depletion. The USGCRP research results provide the scientific information 
base that underpins consideration of possible response strategies, but the 
USGCRP does not recommend policies on global change issues, nor does it 
include support for research and development of energy technologies, 
development of mitigation strategies, or the Climate Change Action Plan.<p>

The underlying premise of the USGCRP is that appropriate use of the Earth 
for human habitation and survival is inextricably linked to an improved 
understanding of the systems that are undergoing change in response to 
natural and human-influenced processes. Presidents Bush and Clinton, and 
Congress, have supported the USGCRP as a high priority in the national 
scientific research agenda.<p>

For FY97, the President's budget requests appropriations of $1.73 billion for 
the USGCRP. See <a href="appA.html">Appendix A</a> for a description of 
the overall USGCRP budget request. See <a href="appB.html">Appendix 
B</a> for a description of global change research budget requests for 
individual USGCRP-participating agencies.<p>

<b><center><a name="agcontr">Program</a> Direction and Agency 
Research Contributions</b></center><p>

The Subcommittee on Global Change Research (SGCR) of the Committee on 
Environment and Natural Resources (CENR), a component of the National 
Science and Technology Council (NSTC), provides overall direction and 
executive oversight of the USGCRP. Within this framework, agencies 
manage and coordinate Federally supported scientific research on global 
change. The <a href="/gcact1990.html">Global Change Research Act</a> 
specifies a minimum of 14 Federal agencies as well as planning and oversight 
offices of the Executive Office of the President to be represented in the 
oversight of global change research.<p>

In FY97, 10 agencies will be supporting research as part of the USGCRP. A few 
of the agencies support research on a broad range of issues, while others have 
a more specialized focus. Programmatic contributions are closely matched to 
agency missions and areas of expertise.<p>

[see <a href="box1ch1.html">Subcommittee on Global Change 
Research</a>]<p>

Global environmental issues are very complex and require a wide range of 
expertise. Close cooperation among agencies is required because of the wide 
range of challenges to be addressed, the differing interests and capabilities of 
each agency, and the need to make the most effective use of available 
budgetary resources to implement a strong research program.<p>

Thus, for example, NASA leads efforts relating to satellite observations of the 
Earth as well as research to interpret and understand these observations; 
NOAA leads efforts relating to its interests in improving predictions of 
atmospheric and oceanic behavior; DOE focuses on research to predict the 
behavior of the global climate system on decadal to centennial time scales in 
response to changes in atmospheric composition, and to evaluate the 
contribution of energy-based emissions to climate change; NSF focuses on 
broadly based fundamental research to improve understanding of the Earth 
system; USDA focuses on the roles of and consequences for agriculture, food 
production, and forests of global-scale environmental change; NIH focuses on 
potential health-related impacts; DOI focuses on climate system history and 
impacts on water resources and public lands; EPA focuses on ecosystem and 
societal impacts of global change; DoD focuses on prediction of seasonal 
climate anomalies affecting its national security operations; and the 
Smithsonian Institution focuses on improving knowledge of the natural 
processes involved in global change.<p>

<b><center><a name="goal">USGCRP Goal</a></b></center><p>

It is crucial to have a sound, widely accepted, integrated scientific approach to 
investigating global change. The USGCRP presented a detailed scientific 
research plan in October 1990.<sup><a href="fn4ch1.html">4</a></sup> 
This plan, updated annually in <i>Our Changing Planet</i>, which is 
submitted to Congress each year as a supplement to the President's budget, 
has served as an important guide to research efforts over the past several 
years. The research programs that have been developed since this plan was 
published emphasize the search for a better predictive understanding of the 
world around us through increased interagency, bilateral, and multilateral 
cooperation.<p>

The USGCRP is preparing a new multi-year research plan that is responsive 
to the advancement of scientific understanding, the recommendations of the 
National Academy of Sciences in its 1995/96 review of the program, and the 
<a href="/gcact1990.html">Global Change Research Act</a>. Concurrently, 
the USGCRP has drafted an updated statement of the overall goal of the 
program.<p>

<b><center>Goal of the U.S. Global Change Research 
Program</b></center><p>
<ul>
<li>To observe and document changes in the Earth system<p>

<li>To understand what changes are occurring and why<p>

<li>To improve predictions of future global change<p>

<li>To analyze the environmental, socioeconomic, and health consequences 
of global change<p>

<li>To support state-of-the-science assessments of global environmental 
change issues</ul><p>


<b><center><a name="nasreview">National</a> Academy of Sciences 
Review of the USGCRP</b></center><p>

In response to requests from the Subcommittee on Global Change Research 
and from Congressional committee chairs in both the House and the Senate, 
the National Academy of Sciences asked its operational arm, the National 
Research Council, to initiate a major program review of the USGCRP; the 
first phase was begun in the summer of 1995. This review was undertaken by 
the NRC Board on Sustainable Development and its Committee on Global 
Change Research, which convened a joint 2-week meeting in July 1995, and 
continued their deliberations at meetings in November 1995 and March 
1996.<p>
[see <a href="box3ch1.html">National Research Council 1995 Review 
Recommendations on the USGCRP</a>]<p>

The NRC issued an interim report in September 1995, entitled <i><a 
href="/USGCRP/LaJolla/cover.html">A Review of the U.S. Global Change 
Research Program and NASA's Mission to Planet Earth/Earth Observing 
System</a></i>. In this first phase, the review considered the scientific 
foundations and progress to date of the USGCRP, and the role of the Earth 
Observing System and the EOS Data and Information System (EOSDIS) in 
meeting the USGCRP's need for global observations.<p>

Since receiving the NRC interim review in September 1995, the SGCR and 
the USGCRP agencies have been moving aggressively to respond to the NRC 
recommendations on program integration and strategic research directions. 
The SGCR has presented its plans for streamlining its interagency structure to 
the NRC for consideration and is moving to ensure a stronger set of contacts 
with the scientific community through the NRC. Interagency teams have 
been formed to draft focused components of a new USGCRP multi-year plan, 
which is being prepared for review and approval during 1996.<p>

With the President's FY97 budget request, NASA will be able to sustain the 
planned launch schedule of MTPE satellites. The overall EOS program has 
been restructured to include opportunities for small satellite missions to both 
initiate new science studies and to test new instrument technologies. 
Planning for streamlining and re configuring EOSDIS is underway.<p>


<b><center><a name="resfram">Research 
Framework</a></b></center><p>

The accompanying figure presents a schematic diagram of the USGCRP 
research framework. This framework is designed to strengthen the 
integration of scientific activities and to aid in achieving strategic direction for 
future research program efforts.<p>

[see <a href="framework.html">USGCRP Research Framework</a> 
diagram]<p>

The top row of the diagram indicates the major issue-oriented thrusts of the 
USGCRP. These focused research efforts on key global change environmental 
science issues depend on a set of integrating activities, including observations 
and data management, pr

ocess studies, predictive modeling, environmental and human consequences 
research, and support for assessments to provide a 
scientific underpinning for societal decision making as appropriate to each 
issue.<p>

These activities are represented by the supporting layers in the diagram, 
which define the activities and perspectives central to program integration. 
These integrating activities and perspectives  contribute in varying ways to all 
of the program thrusts on key environmental science issues. In addition, the 
diagram indicates ongoing program responsibilities pertaining to 
international research cooperation and to global change education and 
communication.<p>

Within each of these areas, the USGCRP emphasizes the following:<p>
<ul>
<li>Identification of new research opportunities that will advance the overall 
objectives for their areas<br>
<li>Coordination of agency programs.</ul><p>

The SGCR has program direction and oversight responsibility for ensuring 
integration and balance in the efforts of these panels.<p>

<h1><center> Global Change Environmental Science 
Issues</h1></center><p>

<h3><center>Enhancing the USGCRP Focus on Priority 
Issues</center></h3><p>

In its 1995 review of the USGCRP, the National Research Council 
recommended that, in order to be most effective, the USGCRP 
"...should focus on priority issues in four mature areas of Earth 
system science that are of great scientific and practical 
importance."<p>

A USGCRP internal review had suggested similar steps be taken, to 
more closely integrate scientific research with the objectives and 
needs of societal decision making. The FY96 edition of <i><a href="/ocp96/toc.html">Our Changing Planet</a></i> includes a description of the scientific basis for these environmental science issues and a summary of key recent findings in each area.<p>

As a consequence of these external and internal reviews, the USGCRP 
is moving aggressively to focus research efforts on the four 
interrelated environmental science issue areas that were 
identified:<p>
<ul>
<b>1) Seasonal to Interannual Climate Variability, </b>with the goal of 
obtaining a predictive understanding and the skills to produce 
forecasts of short-term climate fluctuations and to apply these 
predictions to problems of social and economic development in the 
United States and abroad<p>

<b>2) Climate Change over Decades to Centuries, </b>with the goal of 
understanding, predicting, assessing, and preparing for changes in 
the climate and the global environment that will result from the 
influences of projected changes in population, energy use, land cover, 
and other natural and human-induced factors<p>

<b>3) Changes in Ozone, UV Radiation, and Atmospheric Chemistry, 
</b>with the goal of understanding and characterizing the chemical 
changes in the global atmosphere and their consequences for human 
health and well-being<p>

<b>4) Changes in Land Cover and in Terrestrial and Marine 
Ecosystems,</b> with the goal of providing a stronger scientific basis 
for understanding, predicting, assessing, and responding to the 
causes and consequences of changes in terrestrial and marine 
ecosystems resulting from human-induced and natural 
influences.</ul><p>

The remainder of Chapter 2 provides an overview of research and 
program activities and directions for each of these key issues. For 
additional information on recent progress in each of these 
environmental areas, the <i><a href="/ocp96/toc.html">Our Changing Planet</a></i> for last year 
(reporting on the FY96 budget proposal) provided an introductory 
discussion of each of these issues and reported on recent research 
accomplishments. Additional detail on planning in each of these areas 
for the next 5 to 10 years will be included in the full National Global 
Change Research Plan, which is being prepared by interagency teams 
for review by the NRC before submission to Congress pursuant to the 
<a href="/gcact1990.html">Global Change Research Act</a> of 1990.<p>

<h3><center><a name="seaclivar">Seasonal</a> to Interannual Climate 
Variability</h3></center><p>

<b><center>Understanding Year-to-Year Climate Fluctuations:<br> 
Forecasts and Applications</b></center><p>

Climatic records and human experience demonstrate that the Earth's 
climate is a naturally dynamic system. Variations in climate occur on 
time scales of seasons to years, and decades to centuries. These 
natural fluctuations in the patterns and amounts of precipitation, 
temperature, and other climatic measures significantly influence 
agricultural productivity and economies around the world.<p>

Meteorologists currently track and forecast the 
weather - that is, the state of the atmosphere at a 
given time and place. These forecasts provide the public with useful 
information about expected near-term precipitation, temperature, 
and wind conditions. Until recently, meteorological forecasting skill 
was limited to predicting weather changes over the next several 
days. Now, scientists are gaining the skill to forecast prevailing 
precipitation and temperature conditions in particular regions over 
periods of time from a season out to even a year.<p>

Scientists are making exciting breakthroughs in understanding 
climate fluctuations that occur on time scales of seasons to years. 
These breakthroughs could ultimately revolutionize the relationship 
between human activities and the natural environment. The USGCRP 
plays a leading role in an ongoing international endeavor to develop 
and enhance prediction capabilities and to apply experimental 
forecasts to real problems of the management of increasingly scarce 
water resources, agricultural production, forests and other managed 
ecosystems, emerging and re-emerging vector-borne diseases 
(carried by insects, rodents, and other organisms), and coastal 
fisheries.<p>

Variations in rainfall and temperature patterns that occur on time 
scales of seasons to years can lead to extreme climatic conditions, 
such as droughts and floods. Extended periods of drought and heat 
can increase the susceptibility of urban settlements and forest and 
rangelands to fire, disrupt food production and water supplies, and, 
in developing regions, occasionally lead to massive human 
migrations. Prolonged and excessive periods of precipitation can 
cause flooding, delay planting, contaminate water resources, and 
temporarily disrupt patterns of production and trade.<p>

Extreme weather events, such as the recent flooding in Oregon, 
Washington, Montana, and Idaho, the multi-year drought in 
California in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and the very snowy 
winter of 1996 in the eastern United States are not necessarily due 
to random chance, as was once believed. There is tantalizing evidence 
that many of these extreme events are linked to a natural 
phenomenon known as the El Ni&#241;o/Southern Oscillation. When 
an El Ni&#241;o event - the anomalous warming of 
the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean - interacts with its 
atmospheric counterpart, the Southern Oscillation, temperature and 
precipitation patterns are affected throughout the tropics and into at 
least the lower reaches of the higher latitudes.<p>

Although the ENSO is believed to be the most important contributor 
to year-to-year climate variability in many regions of the world, 
other phenomena are also believed to play a significant role in some 
regions:<p>
<ul>
<li>The Asian summer monsoon regime and its possible links to both 
the ENSO and to higher latitude events that affect Himalayan/Tibetan 
snow cover<br>

<li>Variability of equatorial Atlantic sea temperatures and their 
relationship to drought in northeastern Brazil and the African 
Sahel<br>

<li>The Quasi-Biennial Oscillation in the upper atmosphere and its 
linkages (along with the ENSO) to tropical cyclone activity in the 
North Atlantic region<br>

<li>Land surface vegetative and hydrological conditions and their role 
in the persistence of summer droughts in the United States and 
elsewhere<br>

<li>The relationship between early season snow cover and 
subsequent temperature and precipitation regimes over 
continents.</ul><p>


<b><i>Seasonal to Interannual Climate Variability Program 
Goal</i></b><p>

<i>The goal of the seasonal to interannual climate variability 
component of the USGCRP is to obtain a predictive understanding and 
the skills to produce forecasts of short-term climate fluctuations and 
to apply these predictions to problems of social and economic 
development in the United States and abroad.</i><p>

Progress toward this goal will provide improved predictions that can, 
among other direct benefits, help farmers maintain their agricultural 
productivity in spite of extreme climatic events such as droughts and 
floods; help water resource managers to ensure reliable water 
deliveries and optimal reservoir levels; help in planning fishery 
harvests; and help foresters allocate resources effectively to 
safeguard forests (and the public) from fire during droughts.<p>

Much progress has been made by the scientific community in 
developing the capability to predict, with reasonable certainty, 
incipient El Ni&#241;o events and the related teleconnections 
(related atmospheric linkages to distant effects). These experimental 
El Ni&#241;o forecasts are already being used with documented 
success in the tropics (where current prediction skill is highest) to 
maintain the productivity of the agricultural sector during ENSO-
related periods of anomalous rainfall and temperature. Peruvians 
have been able to sustain the gross output of their agricultural 
sector, increasing it by 3&#37; in 1987 in spite of the moderate 
1986-87 ENSO event (in contrast to a 14&#37; decrease in 1983, 
which accompanied the devastating 1982-83 event). In Ceara, Brazil, 
during the drought of 1991-92, a systematic effort to organize the 
timing of seeding, based on prediction information, maintained 
agricultural production close to the historical annual mean.<p>

These early applications projects in Brazil and Peru demonstrate the 
potential social and economic returns from a continued national (and 
international) investment in "end-to-end" seasonal to interannual 
climate research. "End-to-end" refers to the application of research-
based products to real issues of socioeconomic development and 
sustainability, with feedback from the information users to the 
scientific community to guide future research directions.<p>

The U.S. economy is both directly and indirectly affected by climate 
fluctuations associated with ENSO. The economic benefits of improved 
forecasts of ENSO to the agricultural sector of the southeastern United 
States have been estimated to exceed $100 million per year. The 
economic value of improved forecasts to other U.S. regions is also 
likely to be large. Indirect effects of ENSO on the U.S. economy arise 
because the United States is part of the global marketplace. Many 
countries affected by ENSO events are developing countries with a 
high dependence on the agricultural and fisheries sectors as major 
sources of food supply, employment, and foreign exchange. Current 
assessments of these issues strongly suggest that research to support 
improved ENSO forecasting will bring significant benefits to the 
Nation.<p>

<b><i>Seasonal to Interannual Climate Variability Research 
Objectives</b></i><p>

Due in large part to the international Tropical Oceans/Global 
Atmosphere (TOGA) program that was conducted from 1985-95, 
scientists can now predict with reasonable certainty (up to 1 year in 
advance) the onset of El Ni&#241;o episodes in the tropical Pacific 
Ocean (see the figure on the back cover for an example of forecast 
skill). TOGA produced fundamental new knowledge of the processes 
that couple the tropical Pacific Ocean to the global atmosphere, and 
ultimately led to the emerging prediction capability. The USGCRP will 
continue in the coming year to build upon the success of TOGA as it 
participates in the Global Ocean-Atmosphere-Land System (GOALS) 
project of the international program on Climate Variability and 
Predictability (CLIVAR), undertaken under the auspices of the World 
Climate Research Programme (WCRP). In addition, the USGCRP will 
advance research geared to provide a greater predictive 
understanding of other climate processes that play a role in short-
term climate fluctuations, through projects such as the Global Energy 
and Water Cycle Experiment Continental-Scale International Project 
(GEWEX/GCIP).<p>

In FY97 and over the next several years, the USGCRP will build on its 
initial successes and support research activities geared to achieve the 
following objectives.<p>


<b>Objective 1 - Improve Prediction Skills, 
particularly over the United States</b><p>

While the TOGA program made possible the ability to forecast El 
Ni&#241;o events up to a year in advance, the forecasts are limited 
in that they focus on the evolution of the tropical Pacific and its 
related climate impacts. Forecast skill is highest in the tropics, near 
the source of an El Ni&#241;o, and diminishes at higher latitudes 
(e.g., over North America) where other processes may play a greater 
role. The international GOALS program is designed to continue 
research necessary for continuous improvements of El Ni&#241;o 
predictions and to extend predictability of climate fluctuations 
beyond the tropical Pacific to include the effects of the other tropical 
oceans, higher latitude oceans, and land-surface processes on 
seasonal to interannual climate variability, particularly at higher 
latitudes.<p>

<b>Objective 2 - Monitor the Tropical Pacific Ocean in 
Order to Better Determine its Influence on Climate, and to Improve 
Predictions</b><p>

Variations in the tropical Pacific Ocean, particularly variations of sea 
surface temperature, exert a tremendous influence on the climate of 
many tropical and mid-latitude countries, including the United 
States. The USGCRP, in collaboration with its international research 
partners, has put in place a unique observation array of instruments 
to monitor constantly the state of the tropical Pacific Ocean and 
transmit data to research and operational centers in real-time. These 
data on current conditions provide the critical initial conditions 
needed in order to make more accurate forecasts.<p>

<b>Objective 3 - Map Global Precipitation and its 
Relationship to Climate Fluctuations</b><p>

Rainfall distributions in the tropics and in several key locations 
outside the tropics are closely tied to large-scale atmospheric 
circulation patterns that are forced by the interactions between the 
atmosphere, land surfaces, and the oceans (see <a href="ensodia.html">figure</a>). By 
merging estimates from a wide range of ground-based and satellite 
measuring systems, the USGCRP, in cooperation with many 
international partners, has produced the first reliable maps of global 
precipitation. These developments were advanced by the 
international TOGA program, the International Satellite Cloud 
Climatology Project (ISCCP), TRMM science activities, and the 
International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project (ISLSCP). 
Continued improvements in mapping global precipitation, advanced 
in part by the GEWEX/GCIP initiative, will benefit the global 
community through improved management of water resources and 
through better understanding of and ability to predict the climate 
system, to understand the controlling processes relevant to climate 
on seasonal to interannual time scales and regional to global spatial 
scales, and to develop predictive climate models.<p>

<b>Objective 4 - Incorporate Field Data into Models in 
Order to Improve Forecasts of Climate Variability</b><p>

Air-sea interaction processes in the western tropical Pacific Ocean 
are important to the evolution of the ENSO phenomenon. High-quality 
data sets resulting from a recent international field campaign in the 
western Pacific are being analyzed in order to improve 
understanding of the coupling between the ocean and the 
atmosphere in this climatically important region. Process-based 
models will be modified to incorporate improvements in 
understanding.<p>

<b>Objective 5 - Assess Human Vulnerability to 
Climate Variations and Identify Options for Adaptation Based on 
Improved Information from Predictions</b><p>

An understanding of the social and economic factors that render 
individuals, communities, and economic sectors more or less 
vulnerable to seasonal or yearly climatic fluctuations is critical for 
reducing that vulnerability and improving adjustment. To capitalize 
on advances in climate analysis and predictive capability, climate 
information needs to be incorporated into management decisions in 
climate-sensitive sectors (e.g., hydropower, insurance, transportation, 
fisheries, and agriculture). Moreover, lessons learned from adapting 
to natural variability will help society to be prepared to deal with 
the possibility that longer term climate change may manifest itself as 
changes in the frequency and magnitude of extreme events.<p>

<b>Objective 6 - Establish a Network of Research 
Centers to Improve Forecast Model Development and Diagnostics, and 
the Application of Predictive Information to Socioeconomic Planning 
Processes</b><p>

To ensure that advances in climate prediction continue and are 
suited to the specific needs of affected populations, within and 
outside the United States, the USGCRP, led by NOAA, has established 
a Seasonal-to-Interannual Climate Prediction Program (SCPP), based 
on the evolution of existing USGCRP efforts to observe, research, 
model, and assess the interactions of the ocean, atmosphere, and land 
surfaces. The SCPP is based on an integrated approach that addresses 
climate variability from its origins in coupled atmospheric and 
oceanic behavior through its physical manifestations and 
socioeconomic impacts.<p>

[see <a href="ensodia.html">ENSO Diagram</a>]<p>

A fundamental component of the SCPP is the establishment of a 
multinational network of research and application centers to develop 
and issue experimental seasonal to interannual climate predictions 
based on global ocean-atmosphere modeling of interannual 
processes. One of these research centers will serve as the 
International Research Institute (IRI) for seasonal to interannual 
climate prediction, which will disseminate forecasts to nations and 
regions that are particularly affected by climate variability 
associated with the ENSO. Application centers will refine the global 
forecasts and tailor guidance to the specific conditions and needs of 
the localities they serve. At a high-level meeting convened by the 
United States in November 1995 (the International Forum on

Seasonal to Interannual Climate Fluctuations</a>]<p>

<i><b>Agency Contributions</b></i><p>

Reflecting the complexity of the issue, several Federal agencies are 
associated with the USGCRP's endeavor to understand and predict 
seasonal to interannual climate variability. NOAA, NSF, and NASA are 
major contributors to this component of the USGCRP. DoD, USDA, DOI, 
and other agencies provide additional focused contributions. Each 
agency brings unique strengths and expertise to this coordinated 
effort:<p>
<ul>
<li>NOAA has the primary responsibility within the USGCRP for 
routinely providing forecasts of seasonal to interannual climate 
variability, especially extreme events, to the Nation. To fulfill this 
role, NOAA is implementing prediction systems for systematic 
delivery of climate forecasts for the United States and the 
international community; maintaining a climate observing and data 
delivery system to provide data routinely for forecasts and analysis; 
conducting research to improve predictive skill of climate models; 
and assessing socioeconomic impacts of climate forecasts. In the area 
of short-term climate variability, NOAA is a key agency in supporting 
the GOALS component of CLIVAR and the GEWEX/GCIP efforts.<p>

<li>NSF-funded research includes basic studies directed at describing 
and understanding the physical processes responsible for short-term 
climate variability and its predictability, thus providing the scientific 
foundations for extending the range and accuracy of seasonal to 
interannual climate predictions.<p>

<li>NASA operates the Ocean Topography Experiment 
(TOPEX)/Poseidon satellite, a joint U.S.-France mission, which is 
making global sea level measurements with unprecedented accuracy, 
providing the most precise measurements ever of El Ni&#241;o's 
effect on the ocean surface and its progress as a broad, low-
amplitude "wave" across the Pacific. The soon-to-be-launched TRMM 
satellite, a cooperative U.S.-Japan venture, will measure the diurnal 
variation of rainfall in the global tropics and help establish an 
accurate tropical rainfall climatology. Several instruments onboard 
the planned EOS-AM and -PM launches will also contribute to the 
measurement of clouds, water vapor, atmospheric temperatures, and 
other parameters needed for understanding and prediction of 
seasonal to interannual variability. NASA continues to develop new 
measurement technologies and methods for assimilating space-based 
and <i>in situ</i> data into coupled ocean-atmosphere-land models to 
provide research-quality data sets that contribute to the 
understanding of seasonal to interannual climate fluctuations.<p>

<li>DoD-sponsored research concurrently satisfies Defense mission 
requirements and the USGCRP charge to understand and predict 
seasonal to interannual climate variability. Research in high-latitude 
dynamics and regional-resolving models coupled with unique 
observing systems is supported.<p>

<li>USDA conducts research on the effects of climate variability on the 
frequency of extreme events-drought, wildfire, and insect 
infestation-in forested systems. Scientists are integrating climate 
scenarios with effects research into growth and disturbance models 
to understand the implications of climate variability and extreme 
events on forest health and productivity.<p>

<li>DOI research focuses on the linkages between large-scale 
atmospheric and oceanic patterns and regional hydrologic variability, 
as well as on the development of improved flood-frequency 
estimation techniques, in support of operational water resources 
management.<p>

<li>DOE funds research that relates the value of improved seasonal 
and interannual forecasting to better strategies for energy 
production and use.</ul><p>


<h3><center><a name="deccent">Climate</a> Change Over Decades to 
Centuries</center></h3><p>

<b><center>Predicting Climate Change and Understanding its 
Implications for Society and the Environment</b></center><p>

The growth and sustainability of human activities and the character 
of our environment are strongly influenced by the Earth's prevailing 
climate. Climate strongly affects the viability of agriculture, the 
extent of forests and rangelands, the diversity of flora and fauna, the 
availability of water, the spread of insects and rodents that carry 
human disease organisms, the intensity and frequency of floods and 
severe weather events, and much more. These forces influence the 
social and economic characteristics and success of societies.<p>

Historical and geological records provide extensive evidence that 
climate has changed in the past in ways that have (or would have) 
significantly affected human activities. Research has provided 
important insights into the natural factors that caused major changes 
in the climates of the past. These factors tend to cause modest 
climate fluctuations on time scales of years to centuries and large-
scale changes, with few exceptions, on time scales of millennia and 
longer.<p>

Since the start of the Industrial Revolution 2 centuries ago, human 
activities have been having an effect on atmospheric composition. 
The current concentration of CO<SUB>2</SUB> is about 30&#37; above 
pre industrial levels as a result of combustion of coal, oil, and natural 
gas and as a result of clearing of land and plowing of soils for 
agriculture (see <a href="co2time.html">figure</a>). The current concentration of 
methane is more than twice the pre industrial level due to land- and 
energy-related activities. One hundred years ago, rising emissions of 
CO<SUB>2</SUB> spurred the Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius to 
make the first quantitative estimate of the potential temperature 
change from an enhanced greenhouse effect. The estimate he made 
with respect to climate sensitivity is only slightly higher than current 
estimates; however, the change is occurring much more rapidly than 
his estimate, which was based on energy use at that time.<p>

Extensive research, much of it funded during the last 20 years by the 
set of U.S. agencies that participate in the USGCRP, has been carried 
out to develop more precise and detailed estimates of how human 
activities will affect the long-term climate. To provide internationally 
recognized and authoritative scientific information about global 
climate change, its potential consequences for the environment, and 
the interactions between climate and society, the United States 
participates in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The 
IPCC was established in 1988 by the United Nations Environment 
Programme and the World Meteorological Organization.<p>

[see <a href="co2time.html">Carbon Dioxide vs. Time diagram</a>]<p>

The IPCC provides a mechanism for conducting a comprehensive 
assessment of the scientific literature on global climate change and 
its consequences and significance. To prepare these assessments, the 
IPCC brings together the leading researchers representing a wide 
range of disciplinary backgrounds and perspectives. It is asked to 
consider the findings from the world scientific community and, 
where possible, to reconcile competing views, to characterize 
alternative perspectives and viewpoints when consensus is not 
achievable, and to analyze the potential implications of uncertainties. 
In this way, the IPCC assessments serve two major purposes: (i) They 
provide a summary of the current state of the science for 
consideration by decision makers, and (ii) they enable the scientific 
community to take stock of current knowledge, identify areas of 
agreement and disagreement, and define areas for future research 
that will help to clarify such differences and advance knowledge to 
reduce key uncertainties.<p>

[see <a href="box2ch2.html">Key Findings of the IPCC Second 
Assessment Report</a>]<p>

The research sponsored by the USGCRP on climate change, together 
with the results of the research programs of nations around the 
world, provides the supporting information for the IPCC assessments. 
The first comprehensive assessment was conducted in 1990. Interim 
reports were issued in 1992 and 1994 on special aspects of the issue. 
The Second Assessment Report was completed in 1995.<p>

In its most recent scientific assessment, the IPCC came to a number 
of new conclusions. For example, the IPCC concluded that human 
activities most likely have caused an influence on the global climate 
over the last century that is becoming discernible from natural 
variations and that the human-induced effect is becoming larger 
than the natural climatic variations that have occurred over the past 
1,000 years. The IPCC assessment, after reviewing the state of 
climate modeling, projected that during the next 2 centuries and 
beyond human influences will cause the climate to change more 
rapidly than during any known period in the last 10,000 years of 
human settlement. While some new opportunities for taking 
advantage of these changes are expected to emerge, human-induced 
climate change is currently projected, on balance, to cause significant 
disruptions to resource systems, societies, economies, and the 
environment (see the <a href="box2ch2.html">accompanying box</a> 
and the <i><a href="/ocp96/toc.html">FY96 Our Changing Planet</a></i> for an introduction to 
scientific understanding of the potential for human-induced climate 
change).<p>

Among the results of the IPCC assessment is the identification of 
limitations in scientific understanding and of areas where additional 
research would be particularly helpful in resolving remaining 
questions. In formulating the USGCRP research activities in this 
element of the program, the agencies focus on addressing the 
findings of the IPCC and the uncertainties identified by the National 
Academy of Sciences and the broader scientific community in their 
consideration of this issue.<p>


<b><i>Climate Change Program Goal</i></b><p>

<i>The goal of the climate change element of the USGCRP is to 
understand, predict, assess, and prepare for changes in the climate 
and the global environment that will result from the influences of 
projected changes in population, energy use, land cover, and other 
natural and human-induced factors.</i><p>

Progress toward the goal will provide information needed by 
decision makers considering adaptive or mitigative responses to 
projected changes in climate and the associated environmental and 
societal impacts. The information will also assist planners and 
managers with responsibilities for the design of infrastructure and 
other major facilities, sustained management of natural resource-
based systems, and long-term planning in the financial sector.<p>

Research to achieve this goal requires a wide range of activities:<p>
<ul>
<li>Global observations of the climate system, including monitoring 
long-term changes in the climate and in factors that force climatic 
change (through ground-, airborne-, ocean-, and space-based 
measurements)<p>

<li>Compilation of inventories of greenhouse gas and aerosol 
emissions, and their precursors, resulting from human activities<p>

<li>Understanding of the processes that cause climatic changes and 
fluctuations (through laboratory studies, site-specific research, and 
field campaigns)<p>

<li>Incorporation of that understanding into predictive models that 
can test the extent of understanding, reveal deficiencies in model 
simulations, and predict future climatic and environmental responses 
to various emissions scenarios<p>

<li>Determination of the consequences of climate change for human 
activities and resource systems, including economic and natural 
resource systems<p>

<li>Development of analytical tools to evaluate the potential 
effectiveness and viability of alternative approaches to adapt to or 
mitigate such consequences<p>

<li>Synthesis and critical review of the findings and their integration 
for use by decision makers.</ul><p>

Together, these studies will provide a set of predictive tools and 
capabilities that can provide information for use by policy makers as 
they consider various options for responding, mitigating, or adapting 
to climatic change. The scientific ability to predict, even in a limited 
way, how the climate is likely to change will provide valuable 
information for decision makers seeking to ensure our continued 
prosperity, to reduce the exposure of the human population to 
health-related stresses, and to protect the overall vitality of the 
environment on which society depends. Increased understanding and 
enhanced prediction capabilities are required in order to provide the 
information needed by decision makers in considering actions to 
moderate future changes and to promote efficient adaptation to the 
changes that do occur.<p>

<b><i>Climate Change Research Objectives</i></b><p>

Significant progress has been made over the past few decades in 
providing a broad-scale understanding of the role that human 
activities are playing and will play in the future in changing the 
global climate. While we have learned that human activities are 
changing the climate and that significant changes will occur in the 
future, significant gaps remain in understanding the regional 
patterns of climate change and the potential consequences and 
implications of climate change for the environment and for society. 
In FY97 and over the next several years, the USGCRP will continue to 
address significant uncertainties through support for research 
activities oriented toward the following key objectives.<p>

<b>Objective 1 - Quantify the Natural and Human-
Induced Factors that Change Atmospheric Composition and 
Radiation</b><p>

The most important human-induced factors that are forcing climate 
change include gases and aerosols (small particles) that are 
modifying the Earth's natural greenhouse effect by altering the 
fluxes of solar and infrared (heat) radiation balance. Changes in the 
land surface and its vegetation are also altering the Earth's 
reflectivity and hydrology. Quantifying the character and trends in 
these climate forcing factors is vital to understanding the causes of 
past changes and to predicting more accurately future changes in 
climate. In addition, understanding what is causing the changes in 
these factors will provide the basis for quantifying the effects of 
various mitigation options.<p>

The most important results from recent research indicate that 
atmospheric aerosols, largely emitted from human activities, exert a 
non-uniform cooling effect over the globe. On average, this effect 
may be counterbalancing about half of the expected warming from 
the increase in the concentrations of greenhouse gases. In 1997, the 
USGCRP will continue to support studies of the cycles of greenhouse 
gases and of the generation and distribution of aerosols; these studies 
will be carried out in coordination with the atmospheric chemistry 
research component of the USGCRP. Studies to refine understanding 
of the global carbon cycle will focus on the role of terrestrial systems 
in carbon uptake and will be carried out in coordination with the 
land cover and ecosystem change research component of the USGCRP. 
Studies of volcanic and solar variability will be carried out to 
document natural factors that influence the climate.<p>

<b>Objective 2 - Characterize Natural Climate 
Variability and the Factors Contributing to Decadal and Longer Period 
Climate Fluctuations</b><p>

Climate varies over many time scales. Over periods of a few years to 
decades, climate can be changed by volcanic eruptions, solar forcing, 
and natural fluctuations in the climate system. Paleoclimatic records 
reconstructed from ice cores and other sources of data provide 
evidence that the Earth's long-term climate varied significantly prior 
to about 10,000 years ago. However, since that time, the long-term 
climate has been relatively stable, especially over the past few 1,000 
years. It is important to understand why this is the case, and what 
the prospects might be for a return to a significantly more variable 
climate.<p>

Although the long-term climate has been stable, the evidence 
suggests that, during the last glacial period (which ended about 
10,000 years ago), shorter term climate changes occurred over 
periods as short as a few decades. Data from the past 1,000 years 
suggest that there have been interdecadal swings in climate, creating 
periods of drought in some regions and excess moisture in others. 
Determining the character and causes of climate variability is thus 
essential as context for detecting that climate change has occurred 
and for determining the extent to which the changes are due to 
human activities. The natural variability component of the 
international CLIVAR program is being designed to improve 
understanding of natural changes in the climate.<p>

Recent research has provided information on past changes in the 
Earth's climate (from historical records, ice cores, lake-level data, and 
other indicators). Evidence suggests that the melting of very large 
icebergs associated with glacial retreat can perturb ocean circulation 
patterns and result in relatively abrupt climate shifts over periods as 
short as decades. In 1997, research will even more intensively focus 
on interactions within the coupled atmosphere-ocean-ice system. The 
coupled processes appear to be important contributing factors to 
natural variations in the climate on inter- and multi-decadal time 
scales. Studies of solar variability and major volcanic eruptions as 
climate forcing factors on these time scales will also be carried out. 
Efforts will continue to reconstruct past climates of the Earth to 
improve understanding of the dynamics of climate change, with 
emphasis given to the study of warm climates to provide information 
for comparing to the warm climate now being experienced.<p>

<b>Objective 3 - Improve Quantitative Representations 
of Climate System Mechanisms and Feedback Processes</b><p>

Predicting climate change requires a quantitative understanding of 
the climate system and of the mechanisms and feedback processes 
that determine its state. This understanding is needed to determine 
how the atmosphere, oceans, and land surface will be affected by the 
projected changes in greenhouse gases, aerosols, land cover, and 
other factors that are causing changes in the Earth's radiation 
balance. Available knowledge clearly indicates that changes in the 
radiation balance can be amplified or moderated by various feedback 
processes and mechanisms as the Earth system responds to these 
diverse forcing factors. Feedback mechanisms control whether the 
climate will respond strongly or weakly to human-induced changes. 
They also control how rapidly or slowly the Earth's climate will 
change. Reducing uncertainty about the magnitude of feedbacks is 
thus essential to providing more accurate predictions of how climate 
will change in response to alternative emissions scenarios for 
greenhouse gases, and to developing the capability to provide more 
accurate estimates of the regional patterns of climate change.<p>

New and unexpected research results indicate that significantly more 
solar radiation may be absorbed by the atmosphere, both clear and 
cloudy, than is currently predicted by theory and climate models. 
Because this result is inconsistent with current understanding and is 
therefore controversial, it requires further observational 
confirmation. If confirmed, these new findings will require 
understanding the processes responsible for the currently 
unpredicted atmospheric solar absorption and a re analysis of the 
Earth's radiation balance, and could result in significant 
improvements in climate models. In 1997 and beyond, just as it has 
in earlier years, the USGCRP will continue to support broad-based 
and diversified programs of observations, field studies, analysis, and 
process-based modeling to improve understanding of coupling and 
interactions among aerosols, water vapor, and radiation in both 
cloudy and clear atmospheres; the hydrologic cycle; ocean circulation; 
biogeochemical cycling; land-surface/atmosphere interactions; and 
climate-chemistry feedbacks.<p>

<b>Objective 4 - Improve Scenario-Driven Predictions 
of Climate Change and Identification of the Human-Induced 
Component in the Recent Climate Record</b><p>

Because of the historical uniqueness of the ongoing human-induced 
changes in atmospheric composition, predictions of future conditions 
for particular scenarios require the use of numerical, computer-
based Earth system models. It is essential that these 
models - which are composed of traditional ocean and 
atmospheric general circulation models (GCMs) augmented by 
representations of the land surface, vegetation, chemistry, and the 
cryosphere (glaciers, snow, and ice) - be based on a 
comprehensive scientific understanding of the functioning of the 
climate system. The comprehensive understanding needed to 
develop and apply such models is developing rapidly from 
observational, process, and modeling studies. Such studies are 
starting to provide important insights into how the climate system 
has behaved in the past and how it will respond in the future to 
natural and human-induced forcing factors.<p>

Over the past 10 years, as a result of USGCRP-sponsored research, 
atmospheric and oceanic GCMs have improved significantly and have 
strong potential for continuing advances through improved 
representations of critical climate processes and finer model 
resolution for regional-scale predictions. More accurate simulations 
of past climatic conditions are helping to improve confidence in the 
models by providing explanations for past changes and a 
quantitative identification of the human influence on recent climate. 
In FY97, research will continue to emphasize incorporation of 
carefully tested modules in climate models; enhanced use of the most 
powerful computers; coupling of atmospheric, oceanic, and land 
surface components of the Earth system; and testing and comparison 
of model simulations with observations as a means to evaluate the 
confidence that can be placed in model results. Studies to detect 
human-induced climate change will be continued with additional 
studies of the roles of various influences in contributing to climate 
change.<p>

<b>Objective 5 - Develop Improved Measures of the 
Sensitivity, Vulnerability, and Adaptability of Natural Ecological 
Systems and Managed Resource Systems and Project the 
Consequences of Climate Change and Long-Term Variations of the 
Climate</b><p>

The potential impacts of climate change on natural and managed 
systems, human activities, and the economy are of great practical 
interest. Human activities that inadvertently influence climate are 
integrally intertwined with natural and managed resource systems. 
Examples include failure to optimize use of organic and chemical 
nitrogen fertilizer; degradation and clearing of forests; and shifts in 
land use between forest, range agriculture, and other uses. Given 
these many couplings, only limited progress has been made over the 
past 10 years in projecting the potential consequences to the 
environment of climate change. In addition, because accurate 
projections of regional changes in the climate are not available, the 
near-term focus must be on developing an understanding of the 
sensitivity and vulnerability of resource and societal systems to 
hypothetical changes that may occur over the next century.<p>

Recent research results indicate that some plant species could 
potentially benefit from increased atmospheric concentrations of 
CO<SUB>2</SUB>. Experiments on the interactive effects of exposing 
agricultural crop species to different mixtures of atmospheric gases 
suggest that elevated CO<SUB>2</SUB> concentrations may, for some 
species, mitigate the damaging effects of elevated ozone 
concentrations and improve their water use efficiency. However, 
some species, such as aspens, become more sensitive to increased 
concentrations of ozone if CO<SUB>2</SUB> concentrations are 
elevated. In 1997, USGCRP studies will be continued that focus on the 
responses of terrestrial ecosystems (including agriculture, forests, 
rangelands, and polar ecosystems) and marine ecosystems to large-
scale environmental change, including the enhancement of plant 
growth by the rising CO<SUB>2</SUB> concentration. These studies 
will be coordinated with the efforts described in the land cover and 
ecosystems section of this report. Internationally, research will focus 
on sensitive ecosystems and regions that are experiencing multiple 
stresses in addition to climate change, and will be carried out in 
coordination with other nations.<p>

<b>Objective 6 - Develop Improved Measures of the 
Sensitivity, Vulnerability, and Adaptability of Socioeconomic 
Systems, and Project the Societal Implications of Climate Change and 
Long-Term Natural Variability</b><p>

In order to develop a stronger capability for assessing the impacts of 
changes and the implications of alternative societal responses, 
research on the human dimensions of climate change must be carried 
out along with research on the behavior of natural and managed 
systems. An important effort will continue to be the enhancement of 
integrated assessment capabilities, including, but not limited to, the 
further development of integrated assessment models. In FY97, 
research to understand and improve the capabilities for estimating 
and accounting for the non-market aspects of climate change will be 
more actively pursued. In addition, efforts will be made to better 
enable coupling of findings relating to climate change with other 
aspects of environmental and societal change.<p>

Human society and the natural and managed ecosystems upon which 
it depends are undergoing continual change as a result of many 
internal stresses and challenges. Prolonged changes in the climate 
over periods of decades to centuries will be an additional external 
influence, leading to further changes in societies and affecting their 
relationships to these systems. Research will continue to explore 
these linkages and better define the role of inadvertent human 
influences on the systems on which we depend.<p>

<b><i>Links to Users of Information through Assessment</i></b><p>

Because climate is such a pervasive influence in human affairs, it is 
essential in studying climate to be able to assemble and 
systematically evaluate diverse sets of information - a 
process called assessment. The United States, through the USGCRP, 
has joined with other nations in supporting the Intergovernmental 
Panel on Climate Change as the mechanism for organizing climate 
change assessments. As explained in the international research 
cooperation section of this report, the USGCRP agencies have also 
assisted other nations in understanding their vulnerability to climate 
change through national studies and participation in the IPCC 
process.<p>

To provide more specific information requested by international 
decision makers, the broadly based IPCC Second Assessment Report 
will be followed up with Technical Papers and Special Reports 
providing more focused information. In addition to research on the 
six objectives indicated above, the USGCRP will continue actively to 
participate in international assessments of climate change through 
the IPCC and will explore the opportunities for enhancing the 
resource base on the national implications of climate change. In 
addition, research results will be provided to national and State-level 
planners and decision makers so that regional vulnerability can be 
evaluated.<p>

<b><i>Agency Contributions</i></b><p>

To conduct and support the interdisciplinary research needed for 
more accurate predictions of climate change and to provide a better 
understanding of its potential consequences and implications for the 
environment and society, the USGCRP agencies are committed to a 
coordinated, long-term research effort on climate change over 
decades to centuries. Because of the issue's complexity, research 
contributions are needed by multiple agencies. NASA, DOE, NOAA, 
and NSF play major roles in improving the projections of climate 
change, while USDA, DOI, EPA, and other agencies contribute to 
evaluating the potential consequences of climate change for society, 
ecosystems, and natural resources:<p>
<ul>
<li>NASA's research efforts involve space-based studies of the Earth 
as an integrated system. NASA's Mission to Planet Earth has a 
comprehensive program of satellite observations, as described in the 
observations and monitoring section, and process and modeling 
studies that contribute to national and international efforts to 
understand climate change over decades to centuries. Using data 
from satellite sensors, MTPE programs examine the role of clouds in 
the global radiation balance; the atmospheric water cycle; the 
concentrations, chemistry, and radiative effects of gases and aerosols; 
ocean circulation; air/sea fluxes; mean sea level change; sea ice 
dynamics; the mass balance of ice sheets; and other processes and 
features of the Earth. General circulation and Earth system modeling 
programs bring together remotely sensed and <i>in situ</i> data to 
examine climate change dynamics.<p>

<li>DOE global change research addresses the impact of energy 
production and use on the global Earth system, primarily through 
studies of climate response to increases in radiatively active trace 
gases and aerosols. The research focuses on climate change 
prediction, including research to develop faster running and more 
accurate climate prediction models; to describe more accurately key 
physical processes that are the sources of the uncertainties in 
present climate predictions (e.g., cloud-radiation-water vapor 
interactions); quantify the sources and sinks of CO<SUB>2</SUB> and 
other greenhouse gases; and evaluate the effects of changes on 
ecological systems and resources. Additional efforts include studies 
of the atmospheric transport, dispersion, and fate of energy-related 
emissions (e.g., aerosols); critical data needs for global change 
research and for early detection of climate change; development of 
methods and models for integrated assessments of climatic and 
atmospheric changes; and funding for education and training of 
scientists and researchers in global change.<p>

<li>NOAA carries out a balanced program of observational, 
experimental, and modeling studies that contribute to the 
understanding and prediction of natural climate variability and the 
consequences of human activities on climate. NOAA research includes 
characterizing the factors that are forcing climate change, with 
emphasis on narrowing the uncertainties in the global carbon cycle 
and elucidating the trends and forcing of the greenhouse gases and 
aerosols; understanding the role of the oceans in climate change, with 
emphasis on examining the role of the deep ocean circulation in 
climate; ensuring a long-term climate record through improvements 
in instrumentation and data records; elucidating the impact of 
changes in the ozone layer on the Earth's radiation balance; 
understanding and documenting the causes of rapid climate 
fluctuations in the paleoclimatic record and the response of marine 
ecosystems to changes in climate; and furnishing prediction, 
assessment, and human-impacts information on global climate 
change.<p>

<li>NSF supports research to improve the description and 
fundamental understanding of the physical, chemical, biological, and 
social and economic processes that affect and are affected by natural 
and human-induced climate variability and change. Research 
includes development, evaluation, and application of a global climate 
system model; observations of atmospheric and oceanic behavior and 
processes; the extension of records of climate variability and change 
through the assembly and analysis of paleoclimatic and instrumental 
data sets, and analyses of these data to distinguish natural climate 
variability from human-induced climate change; and understanding 
the connections among climate change, natural and managed 
ecosystems, and society and its activities. The ultimate goal of the 
integrated research efforts is to develop the capacity to predict the 
magnitude and rate of global and regional climate changes that 
would result from human-induced factors, such as enhanced 
atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases. As a contribution to 
the scientific community in this area, NSF sponsors the Climate 
Simulation Laboratory at the National Center for Atmospheric 
Research (NCAR), a super computing resource that is used by 
scientists funded by many different agencies.<p>

<li>DOI conducts studies to understand the natural history of climate 
change, including the natural causes, rates, and ranges of climate 
change; and the interaction of changing climate with environmental 
systems on the Earth's land surfaces. Research emphasizes high-
latitude cold regions and arid to semi-arid regions of the United 
States, which are particularly sensitive to climate, as well as 
biogeographic areas throughout the Nation where DOI requires 
information about the potential consequences of climate change on 
the management of U.S. land, freshwater, and biological resources. 
DOI research emphasizing the natural history, land-air-water 
interactions, and causes of climate change helps in testing and 
improving analytical models, distinguishing human influence from 
natural variation, and estimating the potential extremes and 
consequences of future climate change.<p>

<li>EPA conducts process-level research to improve understanding of 
the sources, sinks, and transformation of greenhouse gases; 
freshwater ecosystem response; coastal zone ecosystem response; 
long-term effects of global climate change on vegetation; and 
integration of terrestrial greenhouse gas emissions in Earth system 
models. Research is being conducted toward predicting effects of 
runoff on freshwater habitats and biota. Coastal zone sensitivity and 
coastal ecosystem response to interannual to decadal scale climate 
changes are being investigated in the Mid-Atlantic region of the U.S., 
where warm water species have replaced former colder water 
dominants in the region over the last 20 years. Single tree, forest 
stand, and global vegetation models are being used to predict the 
long-term effects of global climate change and increased atmospheric 
CO<SUB>2</SUB> on the distribution of global forests, rangelands, 
croplands, and deserts.<p>

<li>The Smithsonian Institution conducts collection-based research at 
its National Museum of Natural History that utilizes millions of 
specimens as well as field studies to look at both the natural causes 
of climate change and the human response. Such objects provide 
cultural records of human reaction to changing climates in a variety 
of ecological zones, ranging from the Arctic to the tropics. Studies of 
delta regions and coastal changes in tropical areas are used to 
determine long- and short-term effects of sea level on coastal 
ecosystems.<p>

<li>USDA has no focused programs within the climate change issue 
area. USDA does, however, conduct a wide range of studies for other 
primary purposes that provide significant information about how 
forests, grasslands, and agriculture will be affected by long-term 
changes in the climate. In addition, through its continuing efforts to 
develop new seed strains and to enhance soil nutrient quality, USDA 
research contributes to the understanding of how intensively and 
less-intensively managed ecosystems can adapt to rapid climate 
change.</ul><p>

To assemble and assess the emerging information, the USGCRP 
agencies together support and participate in scientific assessments 
and in the development of enhanced integrated assessment

<b><center>Understanding Atmospheric Chemistry and its Links to 
Human Well-Being</b></center><p>

The recognition that many Earth System 
components - including the oceans, geosphere, 
terrestrial and marine biospheres, and 
cryosphere - are linked via the atmosphere is central 
to understanding global change. Geological records show that past 
climate change closely parallelled changes in the atmospheric 
abundance of the greenhouse gases carbon dioxide and methane, 
illustrating that changes to the atmosphere have the potential to 
perturb other major parts of the Earth system and <i>vice versa</i>. 
Because of this linkage, observations of atmospheric change may be 
early harbingers of climate change, and comprehending the reasons 
for atmospheric change is fundamental to understanding the 
potential for climate change.<p>

As the global population nears 6 billion, human activities are 
inducing significant atmospheric change. This impact is clear, for 
example, in the firmly established linkage between emissions of 
CFCs - substances entirely of human 
manufacture - and the depletion of stratospheric 
ozone. Indeed, the awarding of the 1995 Nobel Prize in Chemistry to 
Professor Paul Crutzen, Professor Mario Molina, and Professor F. 
Sherwood Rowland for the demonstration of this linkage underscores 
the significance of this basic concept - that human 
activities can and do influence the global atmosphere and 
environment. As a consequence, an understanding of changes in 
atmospheric chemical composition and the implications of these 
changes is required if decision makers (e.g., the parties to the 
Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer and 
subsequent amendments and adjustments) are to choose among 
scientifically sound options.<p>

The 1995 Nobel Prize in Chemistry also acknowledged the 
identification of the relationship between emissions at ground level 
and the chemistry of ozone formation and destruction in the 
stratosphere. This conceptual breakthrough, identifying the close 
coupling of Earth system components and phenomena, demonstrated 
that many environmental issues previously treated as unrelated are, 
in fact, interdependent. During the course of their studies on 
stratospheric ozone and atmospheric chemistry, all three scientists 
have been supported in part by funding from the agencies that 
support USGCRP research.<p>

[see <a href="box4ch2.html">1995 Nobel Prize in Chemistry</a>]<p>

Research has demonstrated that stratospheric ozone depletion not 
only causes increased exposure to ultraviolet light, but exerts a 
cooling influence on the global climate. Conversely, formation of 
tropospheric (lower atmospheric) ozone, a primary component of 
smog, not only pollutes the air, but induces a warming influence on 
the climate. Further, emissions of sulfur dioxide from fossil fuel 
combustion not only lead to the formation of acid rain, but contribute 
to aerosol haze, which exerts a cooling influence. Similarly, increases 
in surface-UV radiation exposure and its consequences are associated 
with depletion of the stratospheric ozone layer, but are also 
influenced by many non-chemical variables, such as cloudiness. And 
more subtly, changes in ozone levels in the troposphere influence the 
survival of certain ozone-depleting substances in their transit from 
the ground to the stratosphere.<p>

The atmosphere does not segregate these chemical phenomena by 
scientific discipline, nor can the atmosphere be segregated from its 
interactions with the Earth system. Rather, there is one atmosphere, 
whose chemical changes can be properly understood only within the 
framework of a comprehensive and integrated Earth system research 
effort such as that of the USGCRP.<p>

<b><i>Atmospheric Chemistry Goal</i></b><p>

<i>The goal of the atmospheric chemistry element of the USGCRP is to 
understand and characterize the chemical changes in the global 
atmosphere and their consequences for human health and well-
being.</i><p>

Progress toward this goal will provide information to assist policy 
makers in protecting human health, in preserving the cleansing and 
protective qualities of the atmosphere, and in ensuring that new 
compounds do not lead to inadvertent environmental 
consequences.<p>

Research to achieve this goal involves the following:<p>
<ul>
<li>Global observations of atmospheric change (through ground-, 
airborne-, and space-based measurements)<br>

<li>Elucidation of the processes that cause those changes (through 
laboratory studies, site-specific research, and field campaigns)<br>

<li>Incorporation of that understanding into a predictive capability 
(through development of models that test the scientific theories, 
reveal deficiencies in understanding, and predict future atmospheric 
responses to various emissions scenarios)<br>

<li>Linkages of atmospheric chemical changes to other environmental 
changes such as ecological and human health<br>

<li>Evaluation and assessment of the findings and their integration 
for use by decision makers.</ul><p>

Together, these studies will provide an improved set of predictive 
tools and capabilities that can continue to provide information for 
use by policy makers as they consider various options for mitigating 
or adapting to global change. Successful examples of such output 
from the research of USGCRP abound: Human emissions of CFCs and 
halons have been unambiguously identified as the cause of the 
Antarctic ozone hole; projections that large increases in CFC emissions 
would lead to large losses of ozone underlie amendments to the 
Montreal Protocol to phase out CFC use; and observations of declining 
CFC growth rates and increasing abundance's of CFC substitutes 
demonstrate the efficacy of the policies adopted to protect the ozone 
layer.<p>

Improved understanding of the chemical processes associated with 
ozone depletion is being used to assess the ozone-depleting potential 
of proposed CFC substitutes. One substitute used in air conditioning 
(HFC-134a) was recently shown to be benign to the ozone layer 
despite hypotheses to the contrary, thus avoiding an erroneous and 
costly recall by the U.S. automobile industry. This is a prime example 
of immediate economic payoff from understanding fundamental 
atmospheric processes.<p>

<b><i>Atmospheric Chemistry Research Objectives</i></b><p>

The USGCRP atmospheric chemistry program focuses on meeting 
near-term information needs by establishing global chemical trends; 
characterizing atmospheric chemical processes, including ozone 
depletion, and their consequences; and assessing this information in 
terms of decision making. The objectives and near-term payoffs of 
the USGCRP's atmospheric chemistry research are as follows.<p>

<b>Objective 1 - Monitor Atmospheric Chemical 
Composition Trends and the Human-Influenced Emissions that Cause 
Them</b><p>

"What is changing in the atmosphere and why?" The answer to this 
basic question is often the clearest sign of a changed relationship 
between humankind and the environment. For example, the 
slowdown in the growth rate of CFC concentrations demonstrates the 
impact of international decisions to phase out the production of these 
compounds (see the <a href="chlorine.html">figure</a>). To meet the need for 
ongoing monitoring, a combination of ground-, airborne-, and 
satellite-based studies are focusing on defining and explaining the 
trends in ozone, ozone-depleting substances and their substitutes, 
and greenhouse gases.<p>

Updated information on long-term atmospheric trends can aid in 
monitoring global compliance with decisions, thereby offering 
accountability in science and policy. Also, they provide an "early 
warning system" for new issues, (e.g., unexpected chemical species 
and surprises in the growth rates of substitutes for the CFCs and 
halons).<p>

<b>Objective 2 - Understand the Stratospheric Ozone 
Variations during the Coming Most-Vulnerable Decade</b><p>

Nations are committed to eliminating CFCs and halons, but 
development of practical, "ozone-friendly" substitutes requires a 
detailed understanding of the chemical processes responsible for 
ozone depletion. Further, despite such commitments, the ozone layer 
will be at its most vulnerable over the next decade, when peak 
halogen abundance's will occur, and during which time a cold, 
protracted Arctic winter or a large volcanic eruption could accelerate 
ozone depletion resulting from human activities. In fact, the causes of 
the observed global downward trends are not yet fully understood, 
nor are the full impacts of newly recognized threats to the ozone 
layer, such as methyl bromide and aircraft emissions. Therefore, 
investigations are including airborne field campaigns to elucidate 
atmospheric processes, coupled with laboratory and modeling studies 
to analyze the impacts of proposed substitutes and their potential for 
enhanced ozone depletion.<p>

This understanding will help avoid costly missteps in the search for 
and development of appropriate CFC and halon substitutes, provide 
better forecasts and attributions of ozone changes over the next 
decade, and keep the decisions associated with "rehabilitation" of the 
ozone layer on a sound scientific basis.<p>

<b>Objective 3 - Monitor Changes in Surface UV 
Radiation, and Quantify Exposure and Consequences to the Biosphere 
and Human Health</b><p>

Extended monitoring data on ultraviolet radiation are not currently 
available. The technical complexities associated with this task are 
challenging. Yet, such records are the raw material for assessing the 
impacts of enhanced UV exposure on ecosystems, materials, and 
human health, and are vital to public awareness of the dangers of 
increased exposure. Therefore, research is focusing on development 
and deployment of a network of UV-monitoring instruments, 
detection of trends in ground-level UV associated with ozone 
depletion, and studies of the impacts of enhanced UV on human 
health and ecosystems. Findings from this research should lead to an 
enhanced ability to model the global climatology of UV radiation, to 
improved characterization of radiation in atmospheric chemistry 
models, and to improved tests of model predictions using 
observations from UV networks.<p>

A UV radiation exposure prediction and warning network could 
assist individuals to avoid potential adverse health effects. An 
understanding of how UV radiation initiates and promotes disease 
could lead to techniques to intervene before diseases such as skin 
cancer and cataracts are fully developed. The results of this research 
will constitute an improved scientific basis for policies to protect 
human health and the environment.<p>

<b>Objective 4 - Develop a Predictive Understanding 
of the Chemistry of the Global Troposphere</b><p>

The lowest portion of the Earth's atmosphere (i.e., the troposphere) is 
intimately involved in the chemistry of global change. Natural 
tropospheric processes cleanse the atmosphere of most pollutants, 
thereby interrupting the transport of many ozone-depleting 
substances to the stratosphere and limiting the persistence in the 
atmosphere of the most common greenhouse gases. Accordingly, 
gaining a predictive understanding of tropospheric chemistry is 
central to efforts to protect the stratospheric ozone layer and to 
determine the climatic impacts of the aerosols and greenhouse gases 
that arise from surface pollution. Therefore, research is focusing on 
field campaigns designed to elucidate the chemical and mixing 
processes that control trace substances in the lower atmosphere, on 
space-based observations to achieve global coverage, and on 
modeling studies to test and refine prognostic capabilities.<p>

A better understanding of chemical removal and other processes in 
the troposphere will help quantify the global warming potentials of 
human-influenced emissions and any potential environmental roles 
of aircraft. Better understanding will also provide the research base 
for addressing effectively the currently unknown, but inevitable, 
future issues associated with this part of the atmosphere, which is in 
direct contact with human activities.<p>

<b>Objective 5 - Characterize the Radiative Links 
between Atmospheric Chemistry and Climate Change</b><p>

Stratospheric ozone depletion is now understood to introduce a 
cooling tendency in the climate system. In contrast, tropospheric 
ozone formation adds a warming tendency. In addition, chemically 
formed and other aerosols introduce a cooling influence, not only 
through their direct scattering of sunlight away from the Earth, but 
through their modification of the number and size of cloud droplets 
and their possible influence on cloud extent and persistence. 
Understanding these components, which is the next step to 
augmented climate-prediction endeavors, will require a blend of 
ground- to space-based observational studies, coupled with 
improved radiative theories and atmospheric chemistry models.<p>

Improved knowledge of the links between atmospheric chemistry 
and climate change will help improve the level of confidence in 
scientific assessments (e.g., the expected IPCC assessment in the year 
2000) regarding the detection and attribution of the climate changes 
that have occurred over the past several decades.<p>

<b>Objective 6 - Assess the Scientific Understanding of 
the Future of the Ozone Layer and of the Role of Human-Influenced 
Chemistry in the Radiative Forcing of Climate Change</b><p>

In December 1995, in Vienna, Austria, the United Nations (UN) 
Montreal Protocol Parties called for an updated state-of-
understanding assessment of the ozone layer to be prepared in 1998. 
The Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on 
Climate Change (UNFCCC) has requested an elaboration of specific 
issues covered in the IPCC Second Assessment Report, and is also 
expected to call for a full, comprehensive Third Assessment Report in 
the year 2000. Further, it is possible that the International Civil 
Aviation Organization will need similar scientific input regarding 
aircraft issues. Accordingly, the USGCRP will place an overall focus on 
near-term projects that will facilitate preparation of these 
assessments, including conducting special reviews of related 
atmospheric chemistry and physics, and communicating research 
findings to stakeholders, including Government policy makers, key 
private sector decision makers, and the public.<p>

The result will be a continued and updated series of authoritative, 
community-wide, unbiased, and integrated assessments of the 
scientific, technical, and economic knowledge on which informed 
decisions can be based.<p>


<b><i>Links to Users of Information through Assessment</i></b><p>

Information produced by the atmospheric chemistry research 
community is conveyed to decision makers and the public through a 
variety of channels, beginning with peer-reviewed scientific journals. 
Periodically, panels of leading scientists review and interpret this 
evolving literature in policy-relevant terms and publish consensus 
assessment documents such as the roughly triennial series, 
<i>Scientific Assessment of Ozone Depletion</i>, prepared under the 
auspices of the World Meteorological Organization and the United 
Nations Environment Programme to serve as the scientific input to 
the Montreal Protocol process. Another example of the assessment 
process is the series of <i>Climate Change</i> assessments, prepared 
under the auspices of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change, which serve as one of the key inputs to the Conference of the 
Parties to the UNFCCC. In addition, information on new findings and 
their implications are regularly provided to Government and private-
sector decision makers.<p>

[see <a href="box5ch2.html">Highlights of Recent Research on 
Atmospheric Chemistry</a>]<p>

<b><i>Agency Contributions</i></b><p>

Several agencies work in close cooperation to gain a better 
understanding of atmospheric chemistry and its related issues. For 
example, the long-standing partnership and close coordination 
between NASA, NOAA, and NSF was a major underpinning of the 
highly effective research program in the late 1980s that provided 
the rapid understanding of the newly discovered Antarctic ozone 
"hole." Atmospheric chemical research has been augmented by 
selected programs sponsored by DOE and DoD. Further, the study of 
the impacts of ozone depletion and of the mitigative options has 
yielded, in concert with these agency efforts, an integrated 
information base for addressing this issue, with the primary 
emphasis on human health by HHS/NIH, with additional input from 
EPA, and on agricultural impacts and strategies by USDA. The 
component agency emphases are summarized as follows:<p>
<ul>
<li>NASA provides the major USGCRP support for the development 
and implementation of satellite observations of global atmospheric 
chemistry properties, along with supporting airborne and balloon-
borne measurements and field campaigns. These comprehensive 
global observing programs span many of the atmospheric chemistry 
research objectives. Particular focuses include development and 
deployment of global chemical space-based observing systems for 
the stratosphere and the troposphere; helping build a predictive 
understanding of stratospheric ozone depletion and tropospheric 
ozone formation, with a particular focus on the role of aircraft 
emissions; and development of computational methodologies 
including global three-dimensional chemistry/transport models and 
large-scale data assimilation techniques.<p>

<li>NOAA shares the focused atmospheric chemistry USGCRP 
leadership role with NASA, bringing a coordinated program of trace-
gas monitoring and laboratory and field characterization of chemical 
processes, with the objective of providing better forecasts and 
predictions of global atmospheric chemical changes. Particular 
focuses include the characterization of the chemical processes 
involved in stratospheric ozone depletion and in tropospheric ozone 
formation; identification of the natural processes involved in altering 
ozone concentrations; identification and quantification of ozone-
friendly alternatives for the ozone-depleting substances; elucidation 
of trends of trace greenhouse gases; and characterization of the role 
of atmospheric chemical change in climate forcing. NOAA and NASA 
also lead the preparation and reporting of the international scientific 
assessments of ozone depletion.<p>

<li>NSF leads the support for university-based, investigator-driven 
studies in atmospheric chemistry, with a focus on tropospheric 
chemistry. Particular focuses include field, laboratory, and model 
investigations of changes affecting the radiative properties and 
oxidizing capacity of the atmosphere. Major support has been 
provided for field measurements of the chemical processes 
associated with the formation of radiation-altering aerosols and UV 
radiation monitoring in polar regions.<p>

<li>NIST supports atmospheric chemistry research, with emphases on 
chemical and radiation standards, laboratory measurements of 
chemical processes associated with ozone depletion, and the 
establishment of standards of reference for the physical properties of 
proposed substitutes for ozone-depleting substances.<p>

<li>DoD's Naval Research Laboratory plans to continue to support the 
Polar Ozone Aerosol Monitor II (POAM II) sensor, launched on the 
Systeme pour l'Observation de la Terre-3 (SPOT-3) satellite in 1993, 
and the POAM III, to be launched on SPOT-4 in 1998. These 
operational space-based systems provide continuous, consistently 
calibrated, high-resolution vertical profiles of ozone, water vapor, 
aerosols, and nitrogen dioxide in the polar stratosphere. A third 
sensor, giving similar data at low and mid-latitudes, will be launched 
on an Air Force satellite in 1998. These data are essential in 
determining the effectiveness of the Montreal Protocol on Substances 
that Deplete the Ozone Layer and other measures to minimize ozone 
depletion during the period 1994-2003.<p>

<li>DOE supports source-receptor sequence studies to examine the 
fate of energy-related emissions in the atmosphere. These studies 
include examination of the chemical formation of aerosol particles, 
the large-scale transport of chemicals associated with fossil fuel 
combustion, and the processes associated with the formation and 
destruction of ozone in mid-latitudes.<p>

<li>USDA contributes programs focused on development and 
deployment of a ground-based network of instruments for the 
measurement of surface UV trends; development of alternatives to 
the use of methyl bromide in agricultural applications; and, as part of 
ecosystem studies, assessing the impacts of increased UV radiation 
on agriculture.<p>

<li>HHS/NIH contributes programs focused on characterizing the 
impacts of increased UV radiation on human health and well-being; 
determining how UV radiation initiates and promotes disease; and 
exploring the potential health-related impacts of the degradation of 
CFC substitutes.<p>

<li>EPA contributes programs focusing on development and 
deployment of a monitoring network. EPA provides leadership for 
the international assessments of the technical and economic 
feasibility of developing and deploying new technologies to protect 
the ozone layer.</ul><p>

<h3><center><a name="landcov">Changes</a> in Land Cover and in 
Terrestrial and Marine Ecosystems</h3></center><p>

<b><center>Global Ecosystems and the Dynamics of 
Sustainability</b></center><p>

Changes in land cover and land use are occurring around the world at 
an increasingly rapid rate, as is the nature and configuration of our 
coastlines. Fisheries and marine ecosystems shift with changes in 
temperature and with human harvesting. Such changes are coupled 
in complex ways with the physical climate system, Earth system 
biogeochemistry, the vitality of ecosystems and sustainability of 
natural resources, and the societal activities associated with economic 
development and human migration.<p>

The increasingly rapid rates of land-cover and land-use change and 
coastal alteration are driven largely by human activities. These 
activities are already beginning to threaten the continued provision 
of marketable goods and services produced in ecological systems 
through cultivation or harvesting (e.g., marine fisheries) and the 
effectiveness of ecosystem-level processes of importance to human 
activities (e.g., purification of water by forests and wetlands, 
regulation of water flow by forested watersheds, preservation of soil 
fertility).<p>

The sustainability of these "ecological goods and services" depends on 
the recognition that (i) processes that control biogeochemical and 
hydrologic cycles are closely tied to and result in ecological goods and 
services; (ii) human influences that transform land cover and coastal 
areas from one type to another, or that change or intensify land- and 
coastal-management regimes, clearly affect the provision of 
ecological goods and services on regional scales and have the 
potential to affect their global availability and the chemical 
composition of the atmosphere on regional and global scales; and (iii) 
understanding the human influences on these processes is necessary 
in order to determine the potential for continuing provision of 
ecological goods and services to meet the needs of the expanding 
human population.<p>


<b><i>Ecosystems Program Goal</i></b><p>

<i>The goal of the land cover and terrestrial and marine ecosystems 
element of the USGCRP is to provide a stronger scientific basis for 
understanding, predicting, assessing, and responding to the causes 
and consequences of changes in terrestrial and marine ecosystems 
resulting from human-induced and natural influences.</i><p>

Progress toward this goal will provide a stronger scientific basis for 
developing environmental and natural resource practices that are 
environmentally sound and practical, and that will ensure 
ecosystems yield sustainable benefits to humankind.<p>

The effort to achieve this goal requires a wide range of activities. For 
example, observations are needed to document changes in land 
cover, coastal alterations, and ecological systems, including both 
natural changes and changes that result from human activity. 
Simultaneous <i><i>in situ</i></i> research is needed to quantify 
process rates and provide information for predictions of future 
ecological changes based on these processes. Combined information 
on patterns of change and processes causing these changes is needed 
to provide the foundation for evaluating landscape, coastal margin, 
and ecological changes due to global forcings (e.g., greenhouse gases, 
climate) as well as due to local and regional influences (e.g., 
watershed alterations, air pollution).<p>

To take advantage of existing investments, new research efforts in 
land-use, land-cover, and coastal habitat change will be coupled to 
existing research programs and to data-gathering platforms and 
instruments that are already in place. To meet future research needs, 
new technologies and measurement capabilities will also be 
developed as necessary. Linkages will also be made to operational 
land-cover and coastal habitat classification and mapping efforts, 
both in the U.S. and abroad. The additional information to be derived 
from new and continuing observations will assist in the design of 
more sustainable management practices.<p>

While some of the necessary measurements can be made from space, 
achieving the scientific understanding necessary to interpret and 
evaluate these observations cannot be done simply with data from 
remote sensing; other monitoring data are also necessary. An 
effective research program will require the cooperation of research 
communities and agencies with space-based, ground-based, ocean-
based, and <i><i>in situ</i></i> research capabilities. Accounting 
accurately for land-use, land-cover, land-management, and coastal 
habitat change with fine spatial and temporal resolution, and 
carrying out the research needed for interpreting the findings, will 
necessarily require a partnership of many scientific and natural-
resource management institutions around the world.<p>

<b><i>Ecosystems Research Objectives</i></b><p>

Achieving the ecosystem research goal of improved understanding of 
land-cover and land-use change and changes in terrestrial and 
marine ecosystems will require achievement of several key 
objectives.<p>

<b>Objective 1 - Document the Current Patterns and 
Past Changes in Global Land Cover</b><p>

During FY97, the USGCRP will continue to monitor and inventory the 
current land cover of the Earth at 1-km spatial resolution. USGCRP 
agencies are producing a series of data products documenting 
regional land cover and its relationship to underlying land use with 
data from the Advanced Very High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) 
satellite instrument. This inventory establishes for the first time a 
systematically produced, replicable global database from which 
changes can be measured. This database will continue to be used in 
assessing regional temperature variability associated with coastal 
ecosystem stress.<p>

Additional efforts will be made to classify and inventory the changes 
in land cover in North America and humid tropical forests at finer 
spatial resolutions. Several Federal agencies are cooperating to 
analyze Landsat satellite data (with a resolution of less than 100 m) 
and to classify and inventory the changes in land cover that have 
occurred in North America and the entire equatorial tropics since 
1970. This effort will document changes that affect the functioning of 
ecological systems and provide the global change research 
community and policy makers with valuable and accurate estimates 
of changes such as shifts from forest cover to grass cover.<p>

<b>Objective 2 - Understand Natural and Human-
Induced Influences that Lead to Changes in Land Cover, Land Use, 
Coastal Alterations, and Ecosystems</b><p>

Distinguishing the causes of changes that are occurring and 
developing the ability to predict future changes requires improved 
understanding of the causes and mechanisms of change. The USGCRP 
agencies are working within the United States and with international 
partners in a number of regions around the world to understand the 
factors leading to and controlling land-cover, land-use, and land-
management changes. In support of these efforts, ecological and 
biogeochemical research on the functional consequences of land-
cover, land-use, and land-management changes and climatic 
variability is being conducted, and new efforts will be initiated in the 
vitally important Amazon River basin as the first stage of a multi-
year, multi-partner international campaign known as the Large-Scale 
Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia (LBA).<p>

USGCRP-sponsored research will also examine how ecosystems react 
to change and influence global phenomena. For example, the 
accompanying figure provides an estimate of how future climate 
change may affect the distribution of an important tree species in the 
eastern United States. Research to examine ecosystem responses is 
being coordinated under the interagency programs on Terrestrial 
Ecology and Global Change (TECO) and Land-Margin Ecosystems 
Research (LMER). Program emphases follow: <p>
<ul>
<li>Focus on improving the understanding of how species, ecological 
characteristics and processes, and ecosystems are related to land-
cover and watershed attributes and changes<br>

<li>Enhance capabilities to predict the influences on ecosystems of 
multiple factors (e.g., when the physical environment and ecological 
parameters change simultaneously).</ul><p>

In addition to process-based studies, continental-scale models of 
terrestrial ecosystems are being developed. In coordination with the 
International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP) Global 
Analysis, Interpretation, and Modeling (GAIM) task force, scientists 
are analyzing current models and data, evaluating the capability of 
current models and experimental programs to meet the needs of 
decision makers and of those modeling the global climate and 
biogeochemical system, and advancing understanding of the links 
between global biogeochemical cycles and the hydrologic cycle.<p>

[see <a href="beech.html">Current and Projected Ranges of Beech Trees in the 
U.S.</a>]<p>

<b>Objective 3 - Predict the Extent and Consequences 
of Changes in Land Cover, Land Use, and Ecosystem Processes, 
especially as They Relate to the Sustainability of Natural Resources 
and Economic Development</b><p>

The USGCRP will participate in the international Land-Use/Cover 
Change (LUCC) Core Project. A comprehensive science plan has been 
developed for studying global land cover and land use to determine 
how these have varied over the past and to evaluate the current 
land-cover status. The program will use as a reference a combination 
of global coverage of land cover at 1-km spatial resolution, with 
selected areas represented at higher resolutions. LUCC will identify 
and examine the major human influences contributing to land-cover 
change in different geographical and historical contexts, and project 
changes that may occur over the next few decades - a 
focus that will require development of an understanding of the 
relationships between past changes in land cover and in the 
structure and function of ecosystems. This will include study of the 
societal and economic factors that also appear to be driving 
ecosystem changes.<p>

As part of the USGCRP and the IGBP, the Land-Ocean Interactions in 
the Coastal Zone Program (LOICZ) will focus on the ecological systems 
at the interface of the coastal lands and seas. New and continuing 
studies will assess the linkages to terrestrial and shelf ecosystems 
and the influences of land cover, land use, and material inputs to the 
primary and secondary productivity of our coastal waters and 
estuaries, including the production of fish populations.<p>

<b>Objective 4 - Quantify Exchanges of Trace Gases 
between the Atmosphere and the Terrestrial Biosphere, with 
Particular Emphasis on the Processes Controlling Carbon Sources and 
Sinks</b><p>

A network of stations measuring the uptake and release of 
CO<SUB>2</SUB> will be expanded to include a representative set of 
native ecosystems and a variety of land-use and land-cover types. 
The network of measurements will be coordinated with research on 
processes (often conducted by measuring the isotopic composition of 
CO<SUB>2</SUB>) and with studies of climatic and human factors that 
influence terrestrial systems. Contemporary measurements and 
results from field and laboratory exposures of plants to elevated 
concentrations of CO<SUB>2</SUB> will be used to refine scientific 
understanding of processes determining net carbon uptake by plants 
and soils. Estimates of carbon sources and sinks derived from 
atmospheric concentrations of CO<SUB>2</SUB> will be used to 
improve the accuracy of predictions of future atmospheric 
CO<SUB>2</SUB> concentrations. Results from field studies will also be 
related to observations of changes in land cover, historic records of 
changes in vegetation types, and measurements of carbon storage to 
address scientific issues related to the atmospheric sources and sinks 
of CO<SUB>2</SUB>. The information is needed to provide the 
scientific basis for consideration of response and mitigation options 
for stabilizing atmospheric CO<SUB>2</SUB> concentrations.<p>

<b>Objective 5 - Observe and Document the Current 
Patterns and Past Changes in Chemical, Physical, and Biological 
Activity in the Oceans, especially Those that are Relevant in 
Understanding the Exchange of Carbon Dioxide with the 
Atmosphere</b><p>

As part of the USGCRP and the IGBP, interagency participation in the 
U.S. Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS) will continue. Efforts are 
focused on characterizing the global geographic distribution of key 
biogeochemical properties and rate processes pertinent to the oceanic 
carbon system, as a necessary prerequisite to predicting change in 
the ocean system and its interactions with atmospheric carbon pools. 
The focus of JGOFS in FY97 will be the Southern Ocean around 
Antarctica:<p>
<ul>
<li>The biogeochemical mechanisms that control the forms in which 
carbon moves with and through the water via ocean currents, mixing, 
diffusion, and particle sinking, and the rates of processes 
transforming carbon among dissolved and particulate, living and 
non-living, and organic and inorganic forms<br>

<li>The response of the ocean carbon system to physical and chemical 
forcing from sub seasonal events to decadal changes.<br>

In addition, scientists will gather information on ocean color data in 
order to address coastal issues:<br>

<li>Distinguishing and tracking harmful algal blooms<br>

<li>Tracking coastal and estuarine sediments to determine the fate of 
suspended sediments and land runoff into coastal oceans<br>

<li>Tracking coastal dynamic processes (e.g., ocean circulation 
pattern) to determine dispersal patterns of pollutants and red 
tides.</ul><p>

Results are needed to document how the oceans exchange 
CO<SUB>2</SUB> with the atmosphere as a basis for understanding 
the role that marine ecosystems play in carbon transports, as well as 
to investigate the effects of natural and human-induced climate 
change on marine ecosystems and to assist in applications to coastal 
fisheries and ecosystem management.<p>

<b>Objective 6 - Understand and Analyze the 
Chemical, Physical, and Biological Processes that Regulate Ocean 
Uptake and Release of Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide and that Control 
Biological Productivity in the Oceans, and Develop the Predictive 
Capabilities Needed to Ensure the Sustainability of Marine

Understanding what has happened and predicting what may happen 
requires research to understand chemical, physical, and biological 
processes: <p>
<ul>
<li>The effects of inputs to the coastal ocean of nutrients from land, 
the atmosphere, and the ocean interior via upwelling<br>

<li>The effects of temperature changes that can alter the physiological 
states of marine ecosystems<br>

<li>The effects of changes in incoming UV radiation and the potential 
for changes in UV radiation to affect primary productivity or to 
damage cells<br>

<li>The effects of changes in circulation patterns and other oceanic 
processes that can affect ecosystem structure and function.</ul><p>

The development of models will be encouraged in order to simulate 
the interactions of marine biological communities with their chemical 
and physical environment. Creating coupled physical and 
biogeochemical models of the ocean for the purposes of testing our 
understanding and improving our ability to predict future climate-
related change will be pursued as part of the JGOFS program. When 
validated, these models will be used to predict the consequences of 
physical and biological changes for the exchange of CO<SUB>2</SUB> 
with the atmosphere. Different models will be used to evaluate the 
effects of changes in marine phytoplankton and zooplankton on fish 
populations.<p>

Scientists will begin using basin-wide circulation models and climate-
scale changes in the investigation of how changing physics in the 
ocean will likely affect the distribution, abundance, and productivity 
of marine animals. Under the auspices of the USGCRP and IGBP, 
Global Oceans Ecosystems Dynamics Program (GLOBEC) research will 
continue to link climate variables with plankton productivity, and 
ultimately fish production, on wide time and space scales in order to 
better interpret past changes in animal abundance, as well as predict 
potential future changes in response to global climate change. Sorting 
out natural variability in the physical and biological system from 
that caused by progressive and human-induced changes is vital to 
the assessment:<p>
<ul>
<li>Developing long-term climatologies of the key ocean regions for 
both physical and biological variables<br>

<li>Developing coupled predictive models for ecosystem dynamics<br>

<li>Conducting process research at sites to provide some 
understanding of high-frequency variability in ocean physics and 
ocean animal populations.</ul><p>

The LOICZ program will include research on organic carbon dynamics 
in coastal zones.<p>

<b><i>Links to Users of Information</i></b><p>

Because ecosystems provide such valuable goods and services for 
society, there is widespread interest in understanding how 
ecosystems are changing and what is causing these changes. Within 
the United States, intense attention is being devoted to this issue by 
the land management agencies as they seek to improve capabilities 
for sustainable management of our Nation's land resources. Findings 
on research on these aspects of ecosystems are made available in 
many ways, including through agency planning reports on land-
management practices.<p>

In addition, because changes in carbon storage on land can lead to 
changes in the atmospheric concentrations of CO<SUB>2</SUB>, it is 
essential to have the information and understanding needed to 
understand the relative roles of fossil fuels and biomass conversion, 
and the potential for sequestering carbon in ecosystems. Reporting of 
results relating to the carbon cycle is carried out through studies that 
become the basis for IPCC findings.<p>

[see <a href="box6ch2.html">Highlights of Recent Research on Land 
and Ocean Ecosystems</a>]<p>

<b><i>Agency Contributions</i></b><p>

Research on changes in land cover and in terrestrial and marine 
ecosystems is shared among a number of agencies, each of which 
brings its own particular history and strengths to bear. NSF-
supported basic research on ecosystems and ecological processes has 
provided the scientific foundation on which other agencies' programs 
have been built. Because of its coupled strengths in remote sensing 
and in organizing and contributing to field programs, NASA plays a 
major role in the study of terrestrial and marine ecosystems. NASA 
emphasizes the use of remote-sensing data in landscape, regional, 
and global ecosystem models. New remote-sensing capabilities have 
been especially useful in collaborative studies within the United 
States and with other nations, particularly those working to 
understand and preserve their vulnerable ecosystems. DOE has 
emphasized the interplay of rising atmospheric CO<SUB>2</SUB> and 
physiological processes in ecosystems. USDA, DOI, NOAA, and EPA 
have focused on the implications of global change for their direct 
land-management responsibilities (in the case of USDA and DOI), and 
more broadly on their responsibilities to protect the environment. 
Within the United States, USDA and DOI manage public forest and 
rangelands and have major responsibilities for policies affecting 
privately owned agricultural lands, forests, and grasslands. Agency 
emphases follow:<p>
<ul>
<li>USDA's research program in global change has a primary focus on 
the development of knowledge and understanding about the effects 
of agriculture and forestry on the emissions and sinks of greenhouse 
gases, and how climate change is likely to affect agriculture and 
forestry in terms of production, resource sustainability, and trade. 
USDA supports research on the effects of changes in land use and 
management intensity on agricultural, range, and forest growth, 
structure, and carbon dynamics, in order to understand alternative 
ways we might manage these systems to sequester more carbon, 
increase productivity, and offset high levels of CO<SUB>2</SUB> 
emissions to the atmosphere from fossil fuel use and land-use 
changes. Researchers have developed an integrated model of global 
change effects on forests that will make projections of changes in 
forest productivity and health in response to global change, 
harvesting, disturbance, and succession. Studies explore scales 
ranging from the ecosystem to the organism to, ultimately, the 
molecular.<p>

<li>DOI is responsible for managing large areas of land. To fulfill this 
responsibility, DOI develops, manages, and distributes data needed 
by the scientific and land- and resource-management communities to 
characterize and map the Earth's land surface, model land surface 
processes, and detect changes in the land surface, land use, and land 
cover. DOI has statutory responsibility for archiving, managing, and 
distributing Landsat satellite data. DOI also employs space- and 
ground-based data in studies that provide land and resource 
managers with a scientific basis for addressing a wide variety of 
land-use and land-cover issues (e.g., desertification, wildland fires, 
and spread of noxious weeds in America's rangelands and national 
preserves).<p>

<li>NASA's research promotes the analysis of existing and anticipated 
patterns of land cover and use throughout the world. The program 
develops observational tools and methods, process models, and data 
products that can be used to increase understanding and provide the 
basis for enhancing the production of food, fiber, and other 
renewable resources from a landscape while maintaining an 
adequate area for biodiversity, environmental quality, and climate 
protection. NASA's research also focuses on understanding the 
processes that regulate oceanic uptake of atmospheric 
CO<SUB>2</SUB> and changes in the structure of phytoplankton 
communities. Current efforts include:<p>

<ul> -   Regional studies of the distribution of major 
land-cover types, and the rate of conversion and loss of these cover 
types due to both human activities and climate drivers<p>

 -   Process studies that assess the consequences of 
land-cover and land-use changes and losses for the biogeochemical, 
hydrologic, and biophysical characteristics of a landscape<p>

 -   Global observations of land cover/use that can be 
assimilated into Earth system models to assist in developing a 
comprehensive understanding of the cumulative impacts of human 
activities on the Earth<p>

 -   Development and validation of regional and global 
models of ecosystem processes and their interactions with 
hydrological and atmospheric systems<p>

 -   Development of models and algorithms that use 
ocean color information to characterize the ocean's biological 
productivity.
</ul><p>

NASA also develops land-imaging technology and provides unique 
data sets - such as Synthetic Aperture Radar images 
from the Shuttle-borne Space Radar Laboratory 
(SRL) - that are needed by researchers and land 
managers. NASA is developing Landsat-7 for launch in 1998, as well 
as the EOS-AM1 platform with the Moderate-Resolution Imaging 
Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard to measure characteristics of 
both the land and ocean surface.<p>

<li>DOE programs in terrestrial carbon processes, ecological research, 
and ocean margins research provide scientific knowledge of 
terrestrial and oceanic components of the global carbon cycle. 
Coupled with observations of atmospheric CO<SUB>2</SUB>, these 
activities provide fundamental understanding of biophysical 
processes needed for predicting future atmospheric CO<SUB>2</SUB> 
changes, and the quantification of terrestrial and oceanic sources and 
sinks for excess CO<SUB>2</SUB> produced from energy emissions. 
Experiments with crop and natural ecosystems provide the empirical 
foundation for evaluating consequences and for assessing the 
effectiveness of natural and/or engineered controls on the rate of 
future atmospheric CO<SUB>2</SUB> increase. Effects on ecosystems 
from the simultaneous influence of climate variables, 
CO<SUB>2</SUB>, nutrient status, and air pollutants are also evaluated 
in field experiments. The research contributes to the scientific 
understanding and prediction of consequences related to global 
environmental change.<p>

<li>EPA contributes research that addresses landscape 
characterization and regional-scale vulnerabilities in the United 
States to global climate change, and will initially examine issues of 
regional hydrologic vulnerability and the impacts of climate change. 
EPA supports ecological effects research to evaluate the response of 
terrestrial systems (primarily forests) and freshwater and marine 
aquatic ecosystems to climate variability and change. Research is also 
focused on development of indicator methods, such as ecosystem 
boundary changes, to hasten detection of the ecological effects of 
climate change.<p>

<li>NOAA supports research on coastal regions and marine 
ecosystems, mainly through GLOBEC and JGOFS. GLOBEC is an 
international effort to gain understanding of the factors that 
influence fisheries and the overall biological productivity of the 
oceans; JGOFS is part of an international effort to understand the 
uptake of carbon by the ocean.<p>

<li>NSF supports research to improve the description and 
understanding of the physical, biological, chemical, and human 
processes that result from changes in land use, land cover, global 
economic productivity, and resource sustainability. The focus of the 
research extends from polar regions to the tropics and in ecological 
systems from the deep oceans to terrestrial environments:<p>

<ul> -   Measurement of changes in land use and 
cover<p> 

 -   The magnitude of resource harvesting and changes 
therein<p> 

 -   The effects of land use on the biological and 
ecological diversity of managed and unmanaged ecological systems, 
and the resulting effects of altered diversity on ecosystem 
function<p> 

 -   The influence of social and political institutions on 
land-use practices<p> 

 -   Examination of the relationships among population 
growth, consumption, technological change, and land-use change<p> 

 -   Use of remote-sensing intrumentation to link data 
on human activities and regional environmental dynamics.</ul><p> 

The ultimate goal of the integrated research effort is to understand 
the relationships between changes in land use and cover and 
systemic environmental changes such as climate change or altered 
ecosystem productivity and their influences on the sustainability of 
natural and economic resources in marine and terrestrial 
environments.<p>

<li>Smithsonian Institution research using the Nation's biological and 
physical collections provides the basis for determining natural and 
human-induced changes in the world's ecosystems. The Evolution of 
Terrestrial Ecosystems program at the National Museum of Natural 
History uses both collections and field research to determine changes 
in North American biomes. At the National Air and Space Museum, 
researchers use a variety of satellite data and ground monitoring to 
determine natural changes in drylands and variations in plant cover 
in response to those changes. At the Smithsonian's Ecological 
Research Station in Kenya, the linkages between land surface and 
biological activity are studied using geographic information systems 
to determine feedback effects of biologic and physical forces of 
change. Marine ecosystems are studied in Panama and in the 
southern Caribbean, where researchers are using rates and processes 
of coral reef growth to determine the response of these fragile 
ecosystems to increased human activities. In addition, tropical 
terrestrial ecosystems are studied by the Smithsonian Tropical 
Research Institute in Panama, and by a joint program with Guyana. 
This work concentrates on the effects of forest fragmentation, and on 
social forces that lead to ecosystem modification.</ul><p>

Chapter 3 provides an overview of research and program activities and 
directions for each of these integrative activities and perspectives. For 
additional information on recent progress in several of these areas, the FY96 
edition of <i><a href="/ocp96/toc
.html">Our Changing Planet</a></i> reported on recent research 
accomplishments. Additional detail on planning in each of these areas for the 
next 5 to 10 years will be included in the full National Global Change 
Research Plan, which is being prepared by i
nteragency teams for review by the National Research Council before 
submission to Congress pursuant to the <a href="/gcact1990.html">Global 
Change Research Act</a> of 1990.<p>

<h3><center><a name="obsmon">Observing</a> and Monitoring Global 
Change</center></h3><p>

<b><center>Moving Toward an Integrated Global Observing and Monitoring 
System</center></b><p>

Observations of the global environment are critical for documenting global 
change and for providing the basis for understanding how and why changes 
are occurring. For many centuries, humans had information only about what 
was happening in their immediate 
vicinity. Starting in the 19th century, accumulated historical records and the 
advance of communications technology permitted the assembly of 
information about surface conditions around the world. These capabilities 
have expanded greatly during the 20th c
entury.<p>

During World War II, aircraft and weather balloons began to provide data on 
the state of the atmosphere, and ships and buoys started providing regular 
observations of parts of the ocean. Only now, with the development of 
satellites over the past few decad
es and sophisticated instruments over the past several years, do we have the 
potential to broadly observe and monitor the atmosphere, the oceans, and the 
land surface on a global scale.<p>

Advancing understanding of the Earth system and our ability to predict how 
it will change in the future requires detailed knowledge of the behavior and 
state of the atmosphere, the land and its vegetative cover, the oceans, and the 
polar regions. Systemat
ic monitoring and observation on scales from regional to global are required 
to document climate fluctuations from season to season and year to year; to 
detect changes in climate and the environment over years to decades to 
centuries; to monitor changes i
n the composition and chemical make-up of the atmosphere; and to 
document changes that are occurring in land cover and the state of global 
ecosystems. This will require not only satellite-based observations, but also a 
wealth of diverse, detailed observat
ions from <i>in situ</i> measurements. Only with information from this 
full range of observational efforts will a capability be developed to document 
and understand global change, to determine and understand its consequences 
for humans and ecosystems, and
 to plan and evaluate measures to aid in adaptation to and mitigation of 
change.<p>

<b><i>Observing and Monitoring Program Goal</i></b><p>

<i>The goal of the USGCRP observation and monitoring program is to 
ensure the availability of a long-term, high-quality observational record of the 
state of the Earth system, its natural variability, and changes that are occurring 
over extended time scale
s.</i><p>

This record of the conditions of the atmosphere, oceans, and land surface, and 
their interactions, will provide the basis for understanding and monitoring 
changes in the Earth system. Accomplishing this will require a cooperative 
international effort to s
trengthen and augment the existing observational systems in a manner that 
will provide for the long-term, systematic, global- to regional-scale 
observation and monitoring of the Earth's environment and natural 
resources. To be comprehensive and global, su
ch an integrated observing system must combine remotely and directly sensed 
information from satellites, surface stations, and <i>in situ</i> observing 
platforms such as aircraft, ocean buoys, and balloon soundings, and must be 
coupled to a data managemen
t system that provides ready access to the information gathered and provides 
analyzed information for use in research and applications (see the data 
management section).<p>

We are the first generation capable of implementing such an integrated global 
observing system, observations from which would provide future 
generations with a stronger basis for sustaining development in a manner 
that ensures a healthy environment. Once 
missed, the opportunity for direct observations is lost forever. Delays in 
deploying instruments or temporary cessation of observations would present 
significant obstacles to advances in understanding, delaying the gathering of 
data needed to identify the
 trends and mechanisms causing and influencing environmental change. As 
such, maintenance and enhancement of this observing capability is critically 
important to the international assessments of global change that help guide 
international policy making.<p
>

For example, monitoring of the ozone hole, global ozone depletion, and 
atmospheric levels of ozone-depleting substances is central to the periodic 
assessments of ozone depletion prepared under the auspices of the World 
Meteorological Organization and the 
United Nations Environment Programme. Similarly, observations of surface 
temperature, sea level rise, and other phenomena form the underpinnings of 
the assessments of climate change carried out under the auspices of the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change. Indeed, the significant U.S. contributions to observing the global 
environment and the conditions affecting our Nation must continue if we 
are to avoid being surprised by changes and fluctuations, and if we are to be 
prepared to adapt effectively 
to the changes and fluctuations that occur.<p>


<b><i>Observing and Monitoring Program Objectives</i></b><p>

Many observational programs are currently underway that provide 
information on various aspects of the Earth's environment. Among these are 
the operational and mission-focused systems maintained to support weather 
forecasting [mainly by NOAA, DoD, and the 
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)] and to support resource 
management (e.g., USDA and DOI for land and water resources, and EPA and 
States for air quality). While the observations from these systems are very 
important, many gaps exist in the sets of m
easurements taken related to observing and monitoring global 
environmental change. Systematic global observations of key variables are 
urgently needed to enable the following:<p>
<ul>
<li>Detection and quantification of climate change<br>

<li>Documentation of natural climate variability and extreme climate 
events<br>

<li>Understanding, modeling, and prediction of climate variations and 
change<br>

<li>Elucidation of the causes, magnitude, and impacts of stratospheric ozone 
depletion<br>

<li>Estimation of the potential impacts of environmental change on 
ecosystems and socioeconomic resources and systems<br>

<li>Development and evaluation of possible strategies to diminish 
potentially harmful effects<br>

<li>Provision of seasonal forecasts and assistance to climate-sensitive 
sectors.</ul><p>

The identification and assembly of data needs are important aspects in 
determining the specific observations required of an integrated global 
observing system.<p>

Specific objectives that will be addressed to meet the USGCRP needs for 
observations and monitoring follow.<p>

<b>Objective 1  -  Contribute to the Development of a Strategy that will Lead 
to an Integrated International System for Observing and Monitoring the 
Earth's Environment and Natural Resources</b><p>

During FY96, the Task Force on Observations and Data Management 
(TFODM) of CENR is leading the Administration initiative to move toward a 
cooperative effort to design and implement an international strategy in 
pursuit of an integrated global observing sys
tem. The USGCRP, along with the operational agencies, is closely involved 
with the development of the U.S. contribution to this strategy.<p>

Over the past few years, the scientific community has been considering what 
the needed measurements are and how best to make the observations. The 
major scientific programs, both national and international, have been 
important sources of information. The 
planning efforts undertaken by the international scientific committees for the 
Global Climate Observing System (GCOS), the Global Ocean Observing 
System (GOOS), the Global Terrestrial Observing System (GTOS), and other 
organizations, and the Committee on 
Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS), have been identifying the requirements 
for a global observing system. An international strategy for global observing 
must facilitate a cohesive integration and augmentation of surface, space, and 
in-situ measurement ca
pabilities in a way that serves multiple needs.<p>

The participation of agencies that fund observations for operational weather 
forecasting and research, working with the scientific community, is important 
in the design of a cost-effective and efficient means to acquire the needed data. 
Working in coordin
ation with other agencies, NASA and NOAA are leading the U.S. effort to 
gain international agreement on an approach to developing such an 
integrated strategy. During FY96, two international workshops have been 
organized by CEOS and GCOS to discuss alterna
tive approaches to establishing institutional mechanisms for coordinating the 
space-based and <i>in situ</i> components of this strategy. During FY97, we 
will work with our international partners to take steps to establish a process 
for consultation and c
oordination that will work toward an integrated global observing strategy.<p>

<b>Objective 2  -  Coordinate and Implement the U.S. Satellite Component of 
the International Integrated Global Observing System</b><p>

The U.S. contribution to the satellite component of the integrated global 
observing system will draw upon the satellite resources of NASA, NOAA, 
and DoD. The NASA component will be carried out through the Earth 
Observing System series of satellites, which
 is the centerpiece of NASA's Mission to Planet Earth. MTPE is NASA's 
contribution to the USGCRP and is included within the USGCRP budget. The 
NOAA and DoD contributions to the satellite observing system are made 
through their operational weather satellit
e programs, a future component of which is being coordinated through the 
National Polar-Orbiting Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS) program; 
because their principal justification is for operational applications, these 
efforts are not included within 
the USGCRP budget.<p>

EOS was recognized as the major component of MTPE and received its 
authorization from Congress in 1990. Its fundamental goal and objectives are 
to meet the needs of the USGCRP through the gathering and interpretation of 
observations of the Earth system fr
om the unique vantage point of space. EOS is intended to be part of a long-
term observation program, with systematic, accurately calibrated 
measurement of various Earth system properties over a period of at least 15 
years.<p>

MTPE implementation consists of three phases, the first two of which are 
described here and the third under objective 5. During Phase I (1990-1997), 
NASA established the Pathfinder Program in collaboration with NOAA, 
DoD, and EPA to obtain, calibrate, pro
cess, and make available Earth observations acquired by NASA research 
satellites such as the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS) and 
TOPEX/Poseidon, and NOAA and DoD operational environmental 
monitoring satellites. In addition, NASA and NOAA establ
ished joint projects with the space agencies of Canada, Europe, Japan, and 
Russia to acquire, process, and make available to U.S. scientists the satellite 
environmental data collected by these agencies. Notable successes have been 
observations of stratosp
heric ozone depletion obtained jointly with Russia and Japan; the 
observations of sea ice, ocean currents, and terrestrial ecosystems using 
Synthetic Aperture Radar by Canada, Japan, and Europe; and the observations 
of terrestrial and oceanic ecosystems w
ith Japan. These programs will continue intensively over the next year, and 
are already making extensive data sets available for analysis of trends and 
conditions.<p>

In Phase II (1997-2002), NASA will launch a series of missions, including the 
initial EOS satellites that will, for the first time, obtain a comprehensive range 
of space-based observations of the interactions between the atmosphere and 
the continents and 
oceans, especially the coastal regions. International partners will also play a 
major role during this phase, through their contribution of instruments that 
will be launched on U.S. satellites (Canada and Japan), accommodation of 
U.S. instruments on their
 satellites (Canada, Japan, and Russia), and/or development of joint satellites 
(France, Argentina, and South Africa). The MTPE satellites and instruments 
flown on satellites of our international partners over the next few years 
include the following:<p>
<ul>
<li>TRMM (planned launch in 1997) will provide the first observations of 
precipitation using active remote sensing from space over much of the world, 
especially over the oceans, helping to improve predictions of the global 
hydrological cycle.<br>

<li>The Landsat-7 mission (planned launch in 1998) will provide high-spatial 
resolution visible and infrared observations of the land surface.<br>

<li>The EOS-AM1 and -PM1 missions (planned launches in 1998 and 2000, 
respectively) will provide crucial new measurements or improvements of 
existing measurements to characterize the atmosphere (including clouds, 
aerosols, and the radiation balance), the 
land surface (including ecosystems, land cover, and soils), and the oceans 
(including ocean color and sea ice extent).<br>

<li>The EOS-CHEM1 mission (planned launch in 2002) will provide detailed 
measurements of the chemical composition of the stratosphere and 
troposphere.</ul><p>

The table accompanying this section shows how the planned series of 
measurements from MTPE/EOS satellites will contribute to the research 
needs of the USGCRP's four key environmental science issue areas.<p>

[see <a href="eostable.html">Earth Observing System Contributions to 
USGCRP Research Goals</a>]<p>

With respect to the operational weather satellite programs, an important step 
toward an integrated global observing system is the ongoing convergence of 
the NOAA and DoD satellite programs that gather information for use in 
initializing weather forecast m
odels and other applications. The NPOESS program is setting as its objective 
the deployment of observing instruments that will meet civilian and defense 
weather forecast requirements. These data will go a long way in meeting the 
needs of scientists seekin
g to document, understand, and project global environmental change. Such a 
coordinated effort will result in substantial long-term savings while also 
providing a greatly increased set of observations of a quality suitable for 
studies of long-term environm
ental change.<p>

These satellite missions, together with coordinated and complementary 
missions of our international space partners, will ensure the diverse and 
necessary array of Earth observations needed to document and improve 
predictions of weather, to identify season
al to interannual climate fluctuations, and to document long-term climate 
variability and change.<p>

<b>Objective 3  -  Strengthen the Commitment to and Implementation of an 
Integrated Surface Observing System for Addressing Global Change 
Needs</b><p>

Measurements in and near the surface are critical to understanding the 
environment that people experience and for identifying changes that cannot 
be observed remotely. Such measurements require a strong program of 
airborne, surface, and deep ocean observa
tions to provide critical measurements of quantities that cannot be measured 
with sufficient accuracy from space, and to help calibrate satellite 
measurements, which are based on indirect rather than direct measures of 
many of the quantities. Also, becaus
e satellites cannot measure below the surface of the land or the oceans, it is 
vital to have <i>in situ</i> measurements from buoys and ground 
probes.<p>

Increased coordination of the Nation's environmental monitoring and 
related research networks and programs is being proposed under the auspices 
of the CENR and its National Environmental Monitoring and Research 
Initiative, with which the USGCRP is coopera
ting. We anticipate that this initiative, which is proceeding with both 
national- and regional-level planning activities, will begin a process in FY97 
that will, when fully developed, provide the needed baseline information for 
documenting how ecosystems 
in the United States are being affected by environmental fluctuations and 
changes over periods from seasons to decades and longer.<p>

In support of the needs for weather forecasting, air quality and ecosystem 
monitoring, and natural disaster mitigation, the United States has deployed a 
number of station networks, only very limited aspects of which are funded by 
USGCRP:<p>

<ul>
<li>The network of surface and upper-air meteorological observation stations 
implemented by the United States and other nations under the aegis of the 
international World Weather Watch provides measurements of the 
dynamics and thermodynamics of the lower 
atmosphere. The North American Atmospheric Observing System study 
provides the basis for making sound decisions on a "best mix" of observing 
systems for operational weather forecasting; the needs for observations in 
support of climate research will also b
e considered.<p>

<li>The NOAA, NASA, and EPA networks of observing stations and similar 
facilities implemented by other nations under the aegis of the international 
Global Atmosphere Watch provides observations of the concentrations of 
greenhouse gases and ozone-depleting
 substances. Stratospheric ozone and key ozone-related compounds and 
parameters are measured through remote sounding by the international 
Network for the Detection of Stratospheric Change, sponsored in the United 
States by NASA, NOAA, and NSF. DOE and oth
er agencies are supporting an effort to develop a network of stations that 
measure the land-atmosphere fluxes of carbon dioxide, and its variation over 
seasons and interannually, seeking to improve the information base on 
carbon feedback processes. In add
ition, a succession of extensive field campaigns designed to elucidate the 
mechanisms of global change provide a mosaic of observations on the key 
chemical compounds and processes involved in causing change. 
Augmentation of capabilities for observing aero
sols and adding stations for monitoring over land areas are the most 
important current needs.<p>

<li>An internationally sponsored array of moored and drifting buoys that 
monitor surface and below-surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific Ocean 
help detect the onset of El Ni&#241;o events. The scientific community is 
considering how best this USGCR
P-funded network of buoys might be extended in the Pacific and in other 
oceans to augment operationally funded ocean measurements in order to 
further improve the predictive capability of the seasonal to interannual 
climate fluctuations that so affect agri
culture and water resources in the tropics and higher latitudes.<p>

<li>Extensive USDA, DOI, and EPA networks monitor the conditions of 
forests and other ecosystems, biota (the plants and animals of a region), soils, 
runoff, and water resources. The monitoring stations of these and other 
agencies provide data to fulfill t
heir statutory responsibilities while also providing information for research 
on environmental change. NSF, DOI, USDA, and DOE also support a number 
of ecological research sites that are gathering long records for use in detection 
of trends and for unders
tanding the causes of environmental change. The improved coordination of 
these networks is being considered as part of the National Environmental 
Monitoring Initiative organized by the CENR.<p>

<li>The Surface Radiation Budget Network (SURFRAD) is operated by 
NOAA to provide continuous measurements of the upward and downward 
component of visible and infrared radiation. The network consists of stations 
in Illinois, Montana, Mississippi, and Color
ado that provide information needed for evaluating satellite-based estimates 
of surface radiation and estimates of solar irradiance at the surface. NOAA 
and NASA are contributing to the baseline surface radiation network of the 
World Climate Research Prog
ramme, which is extending these types of measurements globally.<p>

<li>The UV radiation network of stations maintained by USDA, EPA, and 
NSF provide reference measurements for the United States and the polar 
regions that are starting to indicate the effects of ozone depletion. Sustaining 
this new capability is an essenti
al resource for assessment of ecological consequences.</ul><p>

<b>Objective 4-Obtain Observational and Proxy Data to Provide a 
Retrospective of Weather and Climatic Conditions in the Past</b><p>

In addition to strengthening the system for observing the current climate, 
understanding climatic behavior requires that there be a detailed historical 
record of the climate, both over the past few decades and further back into the 
past. While the actual 
state of the atmosphere and oceans will have changed, there are many 
indications of past conditions that can be combined with observations that do 
exist to provide a retrospective picture of the previous climatic states. This 
effort, which is closely tied
 to the data analysis and climate system history efforts of the USGCRP, 
includes efforts to derive measurements for periods ranging from the very 
distant past (e.g., through the drilling of ice cores where ancient air is trapped) 
to the more recent decade
s (e.g., by measuring temperatures in boreholes drilled into the ground and in 
the ocean depths).<p>

These records of past conditions are essential in providing the information 
needed to determine trends in conditions, to identify geographic patterns that 
can indicate the global consistency of changes seen in one or a few regions, 
and to improve understa
nding of the mechanisms leading to changes.<p>

<b>Objective 5  -  Develop and Demonstrate New and More Cost-Effective 
Instruments for Providing Critical Information in the Future</b><p>

While providing very significant information of high societal value, 
observing the full Earth system on a continuing basis is a challenging and 
expensive process. There are many quantities to keep track of, in the 
atmosphere and oceans and over and below 
the land surface. To ensure that the observations are being taken in the most 
cost-effective manner, while still maintaining the quality and continuity of 
measurements needed for scientific purposes, continuing efforts are 
underway to improve and reduce t
he cost of observation systems. Much of this effort is occurring under the 
auspices of NOAA and DoD's operational programs and in cooperation with 
FAA. For example, a number of systems have been in development to 
provide moisture and temperature measureme
nt on a large scale, including new sensors for automated aircraft 
measurements during ascent and descent and improved use of existing 
satellite-based systems.<p>

With regard to development of new satellite measurements - which are the 
most costly, the most comprehensive, and essential for observations at the 
global scale - several new initiatives are underway:<p>
<ul>
<li>The Global Positioning System/Meteorology (GPS/Met) is a very small 
satellite instrument developed and recently launched with funding from the 
FAA, NSF, NOAA, and NASA, and substantial contributions from industry. 
GPS/Met, which weighs only 10 kg (abo
ut 22 lb), receives signals from 24 GPS satellites operated by DoD. Data already 
obtained from this proof-of-concept experiment are demonstrating that 
atmospheric effects on the transmission of signals from the GPS satellites can 
be used to derive three-d
imensional distributions of a combined measure of atmospheric temperature 
and water vapor, which could be useful in both climate research and weather 
forecasting.<p>

<li>To support improvements in Phase III of the MTPE program (2002-2015), 
NASA intends to extend the set of space-based observations by incorporating 
new and emerging technologies and taking advantage of small satellite 
technologies; activities that start
 this process will begin in FY97. For example, NASA's New Millennium 
Program of small satellites is a step to provide opportunities for 
demonstrating new, more cost-effective instrument technologies. NASA's 
Earth System Science Pathfinder (ESSP) program, 
initiated in FY96, will acquire new experimental types of scientific 
measurements over the next few decades.</ul><p>

Regarding <i>in situ</i> data gathering, the Office of Naval Research is 
proposing to continue interagency support for a basin-scale ocean 
measurement program capitalizing on the FY92-96 investments by DoD in 
the Acoustic Thermometry of Ocean Climate (ATO
C) research program. The ATOC studies of acoustic travel-time variability 
along fixed ocean paths were designed to accurately characterize seasonal and 
long-term trends in ocean temperature. It is expected that a system of acoustic 
arrays may provide data
 that could revolutionize understanding of the ocean's interior just as 
GPS/Met could revolutionize understanding of the atmosphere upward from 
the mid-troposphere.<p>

Efforts are also underway among USGCRP agencies to improve 
measurements of various chemicals in the environment and of other 
quantities, generally as part of the field programs that are focusing on how 
Earth system processes are working.<p>

<b><i>Agency Contributions</i></b><p>

Consistent with their respective roles and missions, the Federal agencies are 
supporting a wide array of observing systems that record the state of the 
environment. Many of these systems are provided as part of the operational 
and mission responsibilities
 of various agencies (including, for example, the weather satellites of NOAA 
and DoD, and the surface measuring sites of NOAA, DoD, USDA, DOI, and 
other agencies). Data from these systems, which are maintained primarily for 
other purposes, are provided to
 the USGCRP for research on longer term trends and conditions. In addition, 
in support of their research responsibilities, several of the USGCRP agencies 
support special efforts to gather the wider set of information needed to study 
and monitor seasonal t
o interannual fluctuations, climate change detection and response, terrestrial 
and marine ecosystems, and atmospheric chemistry:<p>
<ul>
<li>NOAA's contributions to the USGCRP observational program are 
focused through its Office of Global Programs, which supports an extensive 
set of oceanic and atmospheric observations. Oceanic observations include an 
array of moored and floating buoys in 
the Pacific Ocean and an associated real-time communication system that 
provides the essential information underlying successful forecasts of El 
Ni&#241;o and seasonal to interannual climate fluctuations. Atmospheric 
observations include the worldwide <i>
in situ</i> and flask-sampling network for greenhouse and ozone-depleting 
gases operated by NOAA's Environmental Research Laboratories, as well as 
ground-based and airborne measurements of stratospheric and tropospheric 
ozone and of key chemically reactiv
e species (gases and aerosols) responsible for ozone change. Through its 
operational programs and in coordination with other countries, NOAA also 
supports the Nation's civilian observing, data assembly and processing, and 
data archival and information sys
tems. While not formally part of the USGCRP, these systems provide 
essential observations and information for USGCRP programs by drawing 
upon the information gathered at a wide number of surface stations, through 
measurements from commercial aircraft, and
 from a wide array of instruments on polar-orbiting and geostationary 
satellites.<p>

<li>NASA's Mission to Planet Earth is the largest of the agency contributions 
to the USGCRP observing and monitoring program. For this effort, MTPE 
includes space-, ground-, and aircraft-based measurement systems to provide 
the information needed to enhan
ce the scientific basis for understanding the Earth system, climate, and its 
variations. NASA's contributions to MTPE include ongoing and near-term 
satellite missions (e.g., UARS, Earth Radiation Budget), approved new 
missions (e.g., TRMM, EOS), and futur
e missions yet to be developed (e.g., via ESSP).<p>

<li>DoD provides an extensive set of measurements through its satellite and 
weather observation systems, many in cooperation with other agencies. To 
further expand the set of available measurements taken by defense systems, 
the MEDEA project has been revi
ewing DoD data sets that may prove valuable in improving understanding of 
the oceans, the land surface, changes in vegetation, and atmospheric 
conditions. DoD also sponsors the ATOC program to measure ocean 
temperatures.<p>

<li>NSF depends on high-quality, well-documented and calibrated, long-
term, and uninterrupted time series of environmental data for the scientific 
research activities that it sponsors. NSF supports three activities that relate to 
this need: (i) Collection
s of special observations required for funded research projects, some of which 
may be long term (NSF, however, does not support the collection or 
processing of long-term observations required by mission agencies for their 
operational needs); (ii) innovati
ve observing techniques and instrument development (such support is 
generally provided for "proof-of-concept" projects of limited duration); and 
(iii) construction of very long time series of past environmental conditions 
and indicators.<p>

<li>DOI sponsors programs addressing the collection, maintenance, analysis, 
and interpretation of short- and long-term land, water, biological, and other 
natural resource data and information, including monitoring of hydrologic, 
biologic, and geologic pro
cesses and resources through nationwide observation networks; research, 
production, and dissemination of land-use and land-cover information, 
including creation of maps and digital data products; and inventories and 
monitoring of biological habitats, reso
urces, and diversity. A series of Water, Energy, and Biogeochemical Budget 
(WEBB) sites are measuring changes in CO<sub>2</sub>, climate, and 
biogeochemistry relating to the terrestrial carbon cycle, nutrient cycles, the 
hydrologic cycle, and the surface 
energy budget. Volcano-monitoring studies are improving baseline estimates 
of emissions of greenhouse gases, sulfurous gases, aerosols, and particles to 
the atmosphere. Monitoring of glacier mass balance provides information for 
sea level and climate impa
ct studies. DOI's monitoring activities contribute not only to global change 
studies, but also to many other activities relating to resource management 
and use.<p>

<li>USDA is taking the lead in providing information on the climatology 
and geographical distribution of UV-B radiation as well as long-term trends. 
This information supports USDA-sponsored research on UV-B radiation 
effects on crops and forests (includin
g research on effects on plants and animals sponsored by other agencies as 
well as human health effects) and provides a basis for the development of 
mitigation strategies if effects research finds that UV radiation is increasing to 
potentially damaging le
vels. The USDA effort involves the establishment of a national climatological 
network of UV-B monitoring sites, of which 10 are in place and an additional 
20 will be installed during the next 18 months. Because the UV-B 
measurement is extremely difficult,
 international efforts are underway to improve instrumentation and 
measurement accuracy. USDA is taking the lead in the U.S. to develop highly 
accurate spectral instruments of high resolution to support research on factors 
controlling surface UV-B radiati
on levels, which will serve as standards for the larger networks of less 
sophisticated instrumentation. In addition, USDA has led the effort to 
establish an instrument calibration facility at NOAA.<p>

USDA also maintains a soil climatic data network with 21 sites throughout 
the United States and Puerto Rico. The system is tied through the SNOTEL 
system, which uses meteor-burst radio communication technology and 
phone links to collect remote site inform
ation. Data monitored includes above-ground climate data and soil 
temperatures, soil moisture, and other below-ground parameters.<p>

<li>DOE supports a number of observation and data management activities 
relating to its cloud-radiation and carbon flux studies. In addition, DOE 
supports the collation, analysis, and quality assurance of carbon dioxide 
emissions data.<p>

<li>EPA is an active participant in programs to monitor the state of the 
Nation's ecosystems and air and water quality. EPA also supports the 
monitoring of UV radiation at urban sites within the United States.<p>

<li>HHS, because of its broader responsibilities for human health, collects a 
significant amount of information on the extent of diseases and the vectors 
(e.g., mosquitoes, rodents) that transmit them. HHS is working with NASA 
on new studies that are incr
easing understanding of how changes in seasonal weather that alter the 
domain and population of these vectors affect the occurrence of various 
diseases.</ul><p>

<h3><center><a name="gcdata">Global</a> Change Data, Products, and 
Information Services</center></h3><p>

<b><center>Meeting User Needs for Full and Open Access to Useful Products 
and Services</center></b><p>

Data and information on the global environment and how it may be varying 
and changing are needed by a wide range of users for a wide range of 
purposes, including, but not limited to, the following:<p>

<ul>
<li>Understanding and predicting seasonal and interannual fluctuations of 
the climate and of long-term trends in ozone concentration and climate<br>

<li>Monitoring and documenting changes in climate, atmospheric chemistry, 
and ecosystems<br>

<li>Investigating Earth system processes<br>

<li>Providing information on global changes to policy makers<br>

<li>Supporting commercial applications by the private sector<br>

<li>Teaching about our home planet by educators<br>

<li>Informing the communications media and the public about the scientific 
progress and accomplishments of global change research.</ul><p>

Basic data and derived data products of importance include everything from 
temperature and pressure in the atmosphere, to currents and salinity in the 
oceans, to vegetation and population over land. Data needs cover the 
physical, chemical, biological, eco
nomic, and social sciences, and can span domains from the center of the Earth 
to the Sun. Time and space scales needed include everything from local 
observations to globally integrated patterns and from instantaneous 
measurements to multi-century trends. 
The spectrum of data sources includes observations taken by satellites, 
aircraft, ships, and surface stations; simulations by models; and 
measurements taken in research studies. The data are generated by any of a 
number of sources, including Federal agenc
ies, international organizations, individual scientists, State and local 
governments, public institutions, and private organizations. The types of user 
needs range from single measurements to specifically designed products that 
can be immediately applied 
in ways that will reduce impacts and improve the human condition.<p>

Given this great diversity, the challenge is to provide a flexible and adaptable 
system that builds from both existing agency capabilities and an underlying 
set of agreed-upon principles. As one example of such principles, the U.S. 
Government has establis
hed a set of data policy statements that govern how the USGCRP approaches 
data management. Fundamentally, the intent is to ensure that data are readily 
available at minimal cost, and are documented and archived so that they may 
benefit not only current us
ers but also future generations.<p>

[see <a href="box1ch3.html">Data Management for Global Change Research 
Policy Statements</a>]<p>

<b><i>Global Change Data, Products, and Information Services Program 
Goal</i></b><p>

<i>The goal of the data, products, and information services element of the 
USGCRP is to provide all users ready and affordable access in useful forms to 
the full spectrum of global change data, products, and information.</i><p>

Achieving this goal will accelerate scientific progress while also greatly 
enhancing public and private sector access to data that can make the economy 
more resilient to changes and fluctuations, help education at all levels, allow 
adaptation to changes, 
and aid resource managers in management and planning.<p>

There are two fundamental components of the data, products, and 
information services efforts that are being implemented. The first component 
involves making the data readily accessible, both now and in the future. This 
responsibility is being met through 
the interagency Global Change Data and Information System (GCDIS), which 
is explained more fully later in this section. The second component involves 
providing useful products (for scientists, for the broader user community, and 
for other Government activ
ities) and is being fulfilled through GCDIS-participating data centers and 
through the efforts of thousands of scientists who gather, develop, and 
assemble new information and transform it into useful data products.<p>

<b><i>Global Change Data, Products, and Information Services Program 
Objectives</i></b><p>

To meet the goal of providing all users ready and affordable access in useful 
forms to the full spectrum of global change data, products, and information, 
the USGCRP agencies are pursuing a number of implementation 
objectives.<p>

<b>Objective 1  -  Provide a Coordinated Means by which Users can Readily 
Find the Global Change Data, Products, and Information They Need</b><p>

There are thousands of possible sources and massive numbers of potential 
individual data and information products. It is critical to a user to be able to 
find the data, products, and information that they need. Over the past few 
years, significant progres
s has been made in addressing this need for information and much of the 
data, products, and information holdings of the Federal agencies can be found 
through the GCDIS Home Page on Internet. The USGCRP, as directed by the 
<a href="/gcact1990.html">Global 
Change Research Act</a> of 1990, has also established the Global Change 
Research Information Office (GCRIO) as the point of contact for all users who 
need help in finding data held by the U.S. Government relating to global 
environmental change. During FY9
7, it is planned that GCDIS will pursue the following:<p>
<ul>
<li>Expand coverage of model data outputs, socioeconomic and biological 
data, and non-Federal sources<br>

<li>Apply developing standards and technology to make possible more 
efficient user searches for data, products, and information<br>

<li>Provide access capabilities tailored to meet the needs of the individual 
program elements of the USGCRP.</ul><br>

<b>Objective 2  -  Ensure that the Data, Products, and Information are Quickly 
Available and Affordable</b><p>

It does no good for a user to find that information exists if it cannot be 
obtained in time to meet the user's needs or if it is more expensive than can 
be afforded. Because of the fundamental value of data to advancing science 
and society, the U.S. Gover
nment has instituted a policy that its global change data should be fully 
available to all at only the cost of distribution. The United States has also been 
very active in encouraging that this approach be taken by international 
organizations, thereby mak
ing available data from many nations around the world. Since the issues 
being studied are global in scope, access to these data sets is essential.<p>

To make sure that data are quickly available, the USGCRP agencies have 
moved rapidly to make their data available over the Internet. At present, 
global change-related data, products, and information from seven agencies 
can be located using Internet access
 to more than 70 of their data centers, libraries, and information service 
nodes. Included are links to the U.S. World Data Centers, which in turn are 
linked to similar World Data Centers around the world. Each of these data 
centers not only archive data 
from many nations, but also provide for its full and open access through the 
policies established for this international cooperative system.<p>

During FY97 it is planned that policies for how to provide interfaces with 
private sector and other non-governmental data, products, and information 
will be developed.<p>

<b>Objective 3  -  Ensure that Data, Products, and Information are 
Documented and Archived</b><p>

The U.S. Government has established responsibilities for long-term archiving 
of global change-related data, products, and information by giving specific 
responsibilities to the National Archives and Records Administration and to 
agencies such as DOC and D
OI. Agreements for some interagency transfers to meet these policies are in 
effect, such as DoD sending relevant data to DOC for archiving and use, but 
others still need to be completed.<p>

Without adequate attention to documenting and archiving data, it is lost or 
rendered unusable to future users - wasting the investments of both funding 
and intellectual effort made for the data to be obtained. Further, without 
documentation of its fundame
ntal properties such as data quality, location, and time, the data from diverse 
sources cannot be used together with confidence, a critical need for study of 
long-term change. Failing to take actions to document and archive is 
tantamount to forgetting the
 past.<p>

During FY97, it is planned that standardized documentation format policies 
will be identified for the USGCRP.<p>

<b>Objective 4  -  Meet the Specific Data, Products, and Information Needs of 
the Scientific Community to Conduct USGCRP-Related Research, 
Monitoring, and Assessment Activities</b><p>

As an integrated and coordinated program, the USGCRP depends upon the 
data, products, and information services component to provide data sets and 
derived products needed to monitor the environment, to understand its 
functioning, to enable predictions, to 
evaluate the consequences of changes, and to estimate the socioeconomic 
impacts of change. Each of the USGCRP's focused programs has its own user 
community that needs data products tailored to meet respective 
requirements.<p>

An important example of such a derived data product is the reanalysis of past 
information. While new measurements of the weather of past years cannot 
be taken, it is possible to use computer models of the atmosphere to process 
all of the available observa
tions, thereby reconstructing a best estimate of past weather. This process, 
called reanalysis, first requires the assembly and careful checking of all 
available data from past measurements taken at the surface, by balloon and 
aircraft, and from satellite
s and ships. With such data assembled, the best models currently available for 
the interpolation and initialization of weather observations for operational 
forecast purposes can be used to adjust for consistency and to interpolate 
observed parameters to r
egions where observations were not available. That this process works quite 
well can be readily checked by leaving out some of the available observations 
and checking how well they are estimated by the reanalysis process. Such 
efforts are underway in both
 NOAA and NASA, as well as cooperatively with the European Centre for 
Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, to cover different periods and different 
regions of the atmosphere. The data provide a very high-quality information 
base for testing all types of models
 and for use in determining the character and causes of past climatic 
fluctuations.<p>

During FY97, it is planned that the data management program will work with 
the focused program elements of the USGCRP to define and begin to produce 
the specific derived data products they most need.<p>

<b>Objective 5  -  Be Responsive to the Data, Products and Information Needs 
Identified by the User Community and its Representatives, Including 
Educators</b><p>

Data are needed by a wide variety of users in addition to the scientific research 
community. In addition to simply providing information on what is 
happening, commercial users of the data provide special products for users 
ranging from the insurance indus
try to agriculture, and from shipping companies to water resource managers. 
Ready access to information is what makes the Nation's economy more 
efficient, allows the optimization of economic activities related to the climate, 
and indicates the degree of r
esilience that must be provided. In addition, given that the information plays 
such an important economic role, the education community needs the data, 
products, and information to train students for jobs of the future - that the 
information is also very 
interesting, and even inspiring, is an additional important benefit.<p>

For several years, GCDIS has worked closely with the National Academy of 
Sciences as a representative of the user community. In addition, a pilot 
evaluation of GCDIS for Internet-coupled schools in Virginia is now being 
completed. These schools spanned th
e K-12 to university education levels.<p>

During FY97, it is planned that GCDIS will expand its on-line user evaluation 
capability and secure critiques by the focused elements of the USGCRP, 
including global change education, as representatives of their user 
communities.<p>

<b>Objective 6  -  Coordinate Global Change Data Management Activities 
with Related Activities being Carried Out by Other Parts of the Federal 
Government and Internationally</b><p>

The data and information collected for understanding global change are part 
of the much larger amount of data and information being collected, accessed, 
and used for other purposes. The needs of the USGCRP cannot be met 
without working with these other en
tities to share data, products, information, and capabilities. Moreover, many 
other Federal programs could be enhanced by having access to USGCRP data, 
products, and information. GCDIS is actively coordinating its activities with 
those of the Federal Geog
raphic Data Committee, the Government Information Locator Service, and 
the National Environmental Data Index. Internationally, global change-
related data systems are being planned by global observational coordinating 
mechanisms such as CEOS, GCOS, GOOS, a
nd GTOS.<p>

During FY97, it is planned that cooperative links to these international global 
observation programs data systems will be expanded. Similarly, it is planned 
to continue and to expand the close working relationships with the National 
Environmental Monitori
ng Initiative in order to improve access to data on the United States.<p>

<b><i>Global Change Data and Information System </i></b><p>

The key to meeting all of these objectives has been the establishment of the 
Global Change Data and Information System. As a system, GCDIS embraces 
the full range of people, infrastructure (e.g., hardware, software, networks, 
telephones, mail), and proced
ures necessary for identifying, assembling, documenting, archiving, and 
disseminating global change data and information. This system builds on the 
mission resources and responsibilities of each agency, and links the data and 
information services of the a
gencies to each other and to an open set of users.<p>

Interagency GCDIS implementation is founded on strong coordination and 
cooperation among the participating Federal agencies, yet recognizes the 
differences in the types and levels of support they provide to the USGCRP. 
This has led to the design of GCDIS 
as a "virtual" system  -  that is, one that provides a view of the diverse Federal 
global change-related data and information holdings, with a minimum of 
cross-cutting new infrastructure to link individual agency data and 
information systems. This compute
rized system is made interoperable (i.e., with the various components capable 
of being used in a reciprocal, complementary manner) through the use of 
standards, common approaches, technology sharing, and data policy 
coordination. GCDIS will emerge through
 coordinated interagency participation, with portions of each agency's own 
data and information system serving as that agency's component of the 
GCDIS. Users can initially enter the data and information system from a 
single point of contact via the Intern
et, through the GCDIS World Wide Web Home Page, using the uniform 
resource locator <a 
href="http://www.gcdis.usgcrp.gov">http://www.gcdis.usgcrp.gov</a>.<p>

While the initial phase of GCDIS implementation focuses on the Federal 
agency systems, the system will be broadened to provide increased access to 
relevant international and State and local holdings. Access to international 
data and information is now pro
vided through existing agency participation in the World Data Center system. 
This system, conceived and fostered by the International Council of Scientific 
Unions (ICSU), is responsible for archiving and exchanging important 
environmental data and informa
tion among almost all nations.<p>

To support widespread access to GCDIS, GCRIO provides information 
resource services to applications users and others outside the research 
community, both nationally and internationally.<p>


<b><i>Agency Contributions</i></b><p>

Each of the participating agencies plays a role appropriate to its agency 
mission, and implements GCDIS consistent with its mission and with 
available funds:<p>
<ul>
<li>USDA depends on data relating to climate and hydrology, biogeochemical 
dynamics, ecological systems, Earth system history, and human interactions 
in fulfilling its responsibilities to support agriculture, forestry, and ranching 
programs that ensure a 
continued and healthy food supply for the Nation and our trading partners 
throughout the world, and protection of private and public lands for future 
generations. USDA is identifying data and information among its holdings 
that are of value to the USGCRP 
and is taking steps to make them available.<p>

<li>DOC, particularly NOAA, gathers data from satellites, ships, aircraft, and 
surface stations on the state of the atmosphere and oceans in support of its 
responsibilities for operational forecasting, detecting and mitigating 
environmental problems, mana
ging natural resources, sustaining the environment, and conducting research. 
NOAA provides user access to global NOAA and DoD environmental data 
and information of value to the USGCRP through the interoperable NOAA 
National Data Centers and World Data Cen
ters. DOC also will provide access to census data and information.<p>

<li>DoD routinely makes unclassified data and information available to the 
appropriate U.S. National Data Centers; agencies receiving DoD data products 
assume the responsibility for GCDIS functions. In June 1995, the Navy 
released all data collected by th
e Geodetic Satellite (GEOSAT-A) into the public domain. Precise geodesy 
mission data from 72&#176;S to 72&#176;N is being distributed by the 
National Oceanographic Data Center operated by NOAA. Further, in 1995, the 
Navy commissioned a subset of MEDEA sci
entists to determine the potential for unique environmental research arising 
from the use of existing classified databases and to identify opportunities for 
collaboration between the civil and Navy science communities. 
Recommendations from the report <i>S
cientific Utility of Naval Environmental Data</i> are currently under 
review. In addition, the President signed an Executive Order on February 24, 
1995, directing declassification of imagery obtained by the first generation of 
photo-reconnaissance satelli
tes. More than 800,000 satellite images collected between 1960 and 1972 will be 
declassified. The public will be able to access these records through the 
National Archives facility at College Park, Maryland.<p>

<li>DOE's mission includes developing efficiency in energy use, diversity in 
energy sources, a more productive and competitive economy, and improved 
environmental quality, making their data critical to the study of global 
environmental change. DOE is work
ing to provide access to data and information from its programs through a set 
of individual data and information systems focused on specific databases to 
which interoperable functionality will be added. DOE, through the Carbon 
Dioxide Information Analysis
 Center (CDIAC), which is a World Data Center for atmospheric trace gases, 
will provide access to a variety of archived data and information including, 
for example, atmospheric trace gases, ocean and soil carbon, atmospheric 
ozone, and climatic data.<p>

<li>DOI Bureaus collect, maintain, analyze, and interpret short- and long-
term land, water, air, biological, geological, and other natural resource data 
and information in support of DOI's USGCRP and mission responsibilities. 
DOI is working to provide acc
ess to data and information from its programs and other sources for which 
the DOI is custodian. GCDIS interoperability initially will be provided at the 
U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Earth Resources Observation System (EROS) 
Data Center, which is one of t
he key U.S. Government data archives.<p>

<li>EPA has data gathered both for USGCRP and related programs and for its 
regulatory responsibilities, much of which may contribute to the 
understanding of global change. EPA is developing the means to access its 
public data through a series of public ac
cess servers and the Envirofacts Database. Global change-relevant data will be 
made available to GCDIS users through these servers and Envirofacts.<p>

<li>NASA is responsible for remotely sensed data gathered as part of its 
satellite and <i>in situ</i> measurement programs. NASA is making all of 
the data and information from its Mission to Planet Earth available through 
EOSDIS, and will seek funding to 
ensure the functional interoperability required for implementation by all 
participating agencies. NASA will also provide for the data and information 
archiving and management, where needed, of socioeconomic data and 
information through its Socioeconomic D
ata and Applications Center.<p>

<li>NSF sponsors a wide array of research activities. Data from these 
activities is made available through a number of publicly accessible archives, 
including the National Center for Atmospheric Research, the Long-Term 
Ecological Research (LTER) program, 
and the Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research. These 
entities provide access to archived data and information through an existing 
data system to which interoperability will be added. An electronic data system 
for data and informati
on from the LTER sites will also be developed. NSF's goal is to have 
sponsored researchers identify and make available their relevant data and 
information to a publicly accessible archive for use by global change 
researchers.</ul><p>

In addition to these agencies, the Department of State and the National 
Institute of Environmental Health Sciences participate in GCDIS planning. 
The Department of State will maintain and coordinate links with 
intergovernmental organizations and UN techni
cal agencies that have programs relevant to GCDIS. A high-priority objective 
is to promote wide adoption of a policy of full and open sharing of global 
change data in multilateral forums, as well as in bilateral agreements.<p>

<b><i>Program Documentation </i></b><p>

The data management issues, policies, and plans of GCDIS have been 
presented in the <i>Data Management for Global Change Policy 
Statements</i>, issued in 1991 by the Executive Office of the President, and in 
a series of three documents published in 1992 b
y the Committee on Earth and Environmental Sciences, in 1994 by the 
Committee on Environment and Natural Resources, and in 1995 by the 
Subcommittee on Global Change Research. Each of these reports has benefited 
significantly from a continuing series of re
ports by the National Academy of Sciences Committee on Geophysical and 
Environmental Data and from core working relationships with its members. 
These policy statements have been widely used internationally, particularly as 
applying to full and open data a
ccess.<p>

Science</center></h3><p>

<b><center>Toward a Predictive Understanding of Variations and Changes 
in the Earth System</center></b><p>

Within the USGCRP, the study of the global aggregate of interactive linkages 
among the major systems that affect the environment is defined as Earth 
system science. Developing a holistic view of the Earth system is essential to 
the development of the comp
rehensive understanding needed to address fundamentally important 
questions about global environmental change and its impacts and 
consequences. Improving overall understanding and building the capability 
to address new questions as they arise in the futur
e depends on continued progress in the traditional disciplines of the 
geophysical and environmental sciences and in the integration-oriented focus 
provided by the development and use of predictive Earth system models. The 
research from these studies contr
ibutes both to the objectives of the four key interrelated USGCRP 
environmental science issues - seasonal to interannual climate fluctuations, 
climate change over decades to centuries, changes in atmospheric chemistry 
and ozone depletion, and changes in l
and cover and in terrestrial and marine ecosystems - and to the overall effort 
to understand the Earth as an integrated system. Earth system science is a 
program-wide integration of scientific activities.<p>


<b><i>Earth System Science Program Goal</i></b><p>

<i>The goal of the Earth system science component of the USGCRP is to 
support the long-term, integrated and exploratory research needed to gain a 
predictive understanding of the interactions among the physical, chemical, 
geological, ecological, and solar 
processes that determine the functioning of the Earth system and its trends 
and fluctuations on global and regional scales.</i><p>

Pursuing this goal provides the basis for continuing advances in fundamental 
understanding of the world around us and helps to identify emerging issues 
and potential changes of low probability but high impact (often referred to as 
surprises). It will cont
ribute to understanding and improving predictive capabilities on each of the 
four environmental science issues.<p>

To make progress toward this goal, the USGCRP is supporting programs of 
ongoing fundamental research by individual and groups of scientists within 
the disciplinary sciences as a means of strengthening the foundation of 
understanding of the Earth system. T
he broad range of studies being undertaken involves observations, analysis, 
theory, modeling, and assessment. The scope of these studies ranges from 
regional to global, and encompasses phenomena and processes within the 
atmosphere, land, oceans, and biosp
here. It includes research on both the current climate and past climates, even 
of the distant past, to provide context for understanding the significance of 
human-induced effects on the climate.<p>


<b><i>Earth System Science Program Objectives</i></b><p>

To provide greater focus to the research and to better match research needs to 
the strengths and disciplines of the scientific community, research is 
organized around the following broad objectives.<p>

<b>Objective 1  -  Gain a Predictive Understanding of the Dynamic, 
Thermodynamic, and Hydrological Processes that Determine Temperature, 
Precipitation, and Other Physical Characteristics of the Earth System and their 
Variability, especially their Extreme 
Values</b><p>

The USGCRP sponsors a number of national and cooperative international 
programs that seek to advance understanding of the physical and dynamic 
aspects of the Earth system. Under the auspices of the WCRP, the United 
States participates in GEWEX, the CLIVAR
 program, the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE), Arctic System 
Science (ACSYS), and international observing programs. A number of these 
programs have important sub-elements, including the GOALS program, 
which seeks to extend seasonal to interannua
l predictive capabilities, and ISLSCP, which aims to improve representation of 
land surface processes and interactions. U.S. agencies in a number of cases 
sponsor programs that have expanded or been incorporated into these 
international programs because o
f their special focus; these include the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement 
(ARM) program, which seeks to understand cloud-radiation interactions, and 
the Atlantic Climate Change Program (ACCP), which focuses on the 
variations in the North Atlantic that st
rongly affect European and North American climate. In addition, the United 
States is active in the overall climate modeling program, including the 
Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP) and the Climate 
Dynamics and Experimental Prediction (CDEP)
 program.<p>

<b>Objective 2  -  Gain a Predictive Understanding of the Chemical and 
Biogeochemical Processes that Determine Atmospheric Composition and the 
Chemical Characteristics of the Earth System</b><p>

The USGCRP sponsors a number of programs nationally and under 
international auspices that focus on understanding changes in the chemical 
cycles of the atmosphere and oceans and interactions with the land surface. 
Internationally, most programs are under t
he auspices of the IGBP. JGOFS focuses on measuring the exchange of carbon 
between the atmosphere and oceans, and is done in coordination with the 
WOCE program. The International Global Atmospheric Chemistry (IGAC) 
program focuses on understanding the che
mistry contributing to the formation of tropospheric ozone and aerosols. 
Significant studies also are conducted to improve predictions of changes in 
stratospheric chemistry; these studies focus on the homogeneous and 
heterogeneous chemical reactions that 
affect stratospheric ozone concentrations and the Antarctic springtime ozone 
hole. The Global Change Terrestrial Ecosystem (GCTE) program includes 
research on biogeochemical cycling of carbon and nutrients within ecosystems 
and IGBP's GAIM project, togeth
er with the ecosystem and hydrologic modeling, focuses on evaluating the 
capabilities of current models to simulate terrestrial components of the 
Earth's biogeochemical cycles. The USGCRP also sponsors a number of 
modeling activities to explore and enhanc
e predictive understanding.<p>

<b>Objective 3  -  Gain a Predictive Understanding of the Biological and 
Ecological Processes that Determine the Distribution, Character, Influence, 
Interactions, and Trends of the Flora and Fauna of the Land and 
Oceans</b><p>

Ecological systems both are affected by their physical and chemical 
environment and affect this environment through their characteristics and 
their uptake and release of chemicals. Internationally, ecological programs 
that study these issues are under the
 auspices of the IGBP. Studies include GLOBEC, which focuses on the marine 
environment, and GCTE, which focuses on the terrestrial environment. 
Within the U.S., TECO, a new interagency program, is focusing on exchanges 
of carbon and other trace gases as w
ell as other cause and effect interactions between terrestrial ecosystems and 
other natural systems associated with global change. Programs have also been 
established to look at the polar regions and their particular ecosystems.<p>

<b>Objective 4  -  Gain a Quantitative Understanding of the History of the 
Earth's Environmental and Biological Systems, and Determine the Full 
Range and Character of Natural Environmental Variability</b><p>

Understanding the past provides context for the future. Internationally, 
research in this area is coordinated under the IGBP-sponsored program on 
Past Global Changes (PAGES). USGCRP-sponsored research is underway to 
contribute to these efforts by determin
ing past rates of climate change, the ecological and biogeochemical 
characteristics of past warm and cold periods, and regional climate patterns 
when the world's climate was different than at present. Model simulations 
are conducted [e.g., under the Paleo
climatic Model Intercomparison Project (PMIP)] in order to test both the 
models and scientific understanding.<p>

<b>Objective 5  -  Gain a Quantitative Understanding of the Geophysical, 
Geochemical, Geological, and Cryospheric Processes that Determine Global 
Sea Level, Volcanic Activity and Intensity, the Dynamics of Ice Sheets and 
Glaciers, and Related Interactions
 with the Earth's Surface Features and the Effects of these Processes upon the 
Global Environment</b><p>

While the USGCRP sponsors some programs relating to the natural 
geological and geochemical aspects of the Earth, the USGCRP relies in many 
ways on the continuation of significant complementary research being carried 
out for many other purposes (e.g., haza
rd assessment, resource identification, seismology). USGCRP research 
generally focuses on natural factors (e.g., volcanic emissions) that accelerate or 
diminish human-induced effects on the global environment (e.g., volcanic 
aerosols can accelerate the oz
one destruction caused by CFCs). A major responsibility is to ensure an 
integrated consideration of the human-induced and natural factors affecting 
the climate.<p>

<b>Objective 6  -  Gain a Predictive Understanding of the Solar and Upper 
Atmosphere Processes that Determine the External Forcing Factors 
Influencing the Biosphere and Climate System</b><p>

The Sun is the major heat source for the Earth. Small changes in its output 
can alter the Earth's climate and affect the biosphere. Solar changes can be 
either direct or indirect: Direct changes are those that change the solar 
irradiance itself, while ind
irect changes are induced as a result of changes in the upper atmosphere that 
result from changes in the solar output. The USGCRP augments the 
extensive research on the Sun through its ongoing basic research programs 
into solar behavior, which seek to und
erstand how solar changes may be amplifying or masking changes resulting 
from human activities.<p>

<b><i>Earth System Intercouplings and Modeling</i></b><p>

The knowledge gained from disciplinary studies in these six areas is being 
applied to the development of predictive capabilities for the USGCRP's four 
key interrelated environmental science issues:<p>
<ul>
<li>Seasonal to interannual climate variability<br>

<li>Climate change over decades to centuries<br>

<li>Changes in ozone, UV radiation, and atmospheric chemistry<br>

<li>Changes in land cover and in terrestrial and marine 
ecosystems.</ul><p>

While each serves as a distinct focus, these areas also are intercoupled, and 
advances in understanding in any area will benefit each of the others. 
Changes in land cover (e.g., deforestation) and terrestrial and marine 
ecosystems influence climate change
. Climate change, in turn, will likely alter the frequency and intensity of short-
term climate fluctuations and their associated extreme events (such as severe 
storms, hurricanes, droughts, and floods). Changes in land cover also will 
alter soil moisture 
patterns, which strongly affect seasonal (summertime) continental climates. 
Stratospheric ozone depletion increases the amount of UV radiation reaching 
the Earth's surface, which in turn may alter terrestrial and marine 
ecosystems. Earth system science th
us provides the paradigm for integrating diverse sets of knowledge developed 
within the elements of the USGCRP to derive a comprehensive natural 
science view of the Earth's environment as a whole.<p>

The integration, testing, and application of existing and new knowledge 
produced by the full suite of USGCRP programs proceeds by means of 
developing, testing, and applying fully coupled and interactive Earth system 
models. We have progressed from relativ
ely simple to highly sophisticated coupled atmosphere-ocean models that 
include plausibly realistic representations of land-surface and sea ice 
processes. These models are now being used to make simulations lasting 
centuries and longer, an order of magnit
ude longer than was possible with the simpler models of several years ago. 
While the results of these climate simulations still include significant 
simplifications and shortcomings, the newest models do provide quite 
realistic representations of many atmo
spheric, oceanic, and land-surface processes and features of the observed Earth 
system. Work is in progress to include direct human-induced changes in land 
cover, dynamic ecological succession, and tropospheric chemistry, and 
representation of biogeochemi
cal cycling, into Earth system models. The USGCRP is committed to creating 
an Earth system modeling structure that will provide for a suite of cutting-
edge models capable of making increasingly credible predictions of 
environmental changes.<p>

<b><i>Agency Contributions</i></b><p>

Earth system science provides a context for physical, chemical, biological, and 
geological research relating to the atmosphere, oceans, land surface, and the 
overall environment. The research of all participating agencies contributes to 
Earth system scien
ce, both through programs formally within the USGCRP and those carried 
out by the agencies in related fields that contribute less directly to the 
USGCRP. Primary emphases of the agencies follow:<p>
<ul>
<li>NSF sponsors research on all aspects of the Earth system, focusing 
particularly on the atmosphere, the oceans, the land surface, the polar 
regions, solid Earth, and solar physics. Many of the scientists supported by 
NSF participate in the internationa
l programs of WCRP and IGBP, while others explore the many questions that 
remain about atmospheric and oceanic dynamics, terrestrial and marine 
ecosystems, atmospheric chemistry, Earth system history, and the factors 
contributing to environmental change. 
NSF sponsors a major Climate System Modeling program that is 
intercoupling the atmosphere, ocean, and land-surface domains.<p>

<li>NASA sponsors research on the atmosphere, oceans, polar ice, and land 
surface relating to processes that can be sensed remotely from space and from 
aircraft. Research focuses particularly on processes that are tied to specific 
instruments and missions
, including stratospheric and tropospheric chemistry, precipitation, solar and 
terrestrial radiation, clouds, and the land surface. Earth system models are 
used to test the consistency of the data sets that are gathered and to explore the 
climatic effects
 of various changes in radiative forcing.<p>

<li>NOAA research focuses on the atmosphere and oceans, most intensely 
on those aspects that would lead to near-term improvements in the ability to 
predict seasonal to interannual fluctuations in the climate and the 
mechanisms controlling longer term chan
ge. NOAA modeling research focuses on the coupled atmosphere-ocean 
system.<p>

<li>DOE research focuses on specific processes that are creating significant 
uncertainties in predicting the climatic impacts of emissions from energy 
generation and use. Thus, DOE sponsors the ARM program - to examine 
cloud-radiation interactions - and r
esearch on the carbon cycle and terrestrial ecosystems, including the effects of 
an increased CO<sub>2</sub> concentration on plant growth. DOE modeling 
research focuses on understanding the differences among models and in 
exploring the uncertainties that
 exist in model simulations. DOE's Program on Ecology and the Terrestrial 
Carbon Processes focuses on biogeochemical and ecological responses related 
to global change.<p>

<li>USDA research focuses most on managed ecosystems, including 
agricultural lands, range, and forests. The USGCRP component of this 
research examines the additional effects of global environmental changes on 
such ecosystems' productivity in the context o
f the many other stresses that affect renewal and sustainability.<p>

<li>DOI research focuses on the effects of global environmental change on 
natural ecosystems and watersheds. In addition, DOI studies of past climates, 
based on the evidence drawn from the geological record, provide essential 
insights into past changes in
 climate and terrestrial ecosystems.<p>

<li>Smithsonian Institution research focuses primarily on ecosystem 
behavior, particularly aspects relating to the rich mix of species. The 
Smithsonian Institution also, on behalf of the USGCRP, monitors solar 
radiation and conducts research to understand
 variations in solar irradiance.<p>

<li>DoD basic research is keyed to Defense requirements, with a modest 
USGCRP component focused primarily on mechanisms that drive seasonal to 
interannual fluctuations of the global ocean and atmosphere.</ul><p>

<h3><center><a name="human">Human</a> Contributions and Responses 
to Global Change</center></h3><p>

<b><center>Toward an Understanding of the Human 
Dimensions</center></b><p>

Humans are an important component of the global environment - their lives 
and activities are not only affected by it, they are also reshaping it. Humans 
depend on the environment for their food, fiber, forest products, water, and 
habitat. Human activities
 alter local, and even the global, environment through the long-term 
cumulative effects of individual and collective actions, which are influenced 
by social and economic institutions throughout the world. Understanding the 
relationships between human acti
vities and environmental systems is essential in coming to terms with the 
meaning of global environmental change for society, as well as for gaining 
insight into the potential effectiveness of measures to mitigate or adapt to 
change.<p>

To gain more knowledge about the human contributions to global change, as 
well as about possible human consequences and responses, the USGCRP 
undertakes research on the human contributions and responses to global 
change. This research is being conducted b
y leading researchers in universities, research institutions, and Government 
laboratories all over the United States, in both basic and applied settings. It 
will enhance our ability to understand the implications of global change, and 
the advantages and r
isks of different strategies for responding to it. Research on the human 
dimensions of global change will accomplish the following:<p>
<ul>
<li>Improve our understanding of the factors affecting future trends in 
population growth, economic development, technological change, and other 
forces influencing the use of natural resources. This information will assist in 
improving projections of the 
demands that are likely to be placed on the environment and human systems 
that extract resources from it. These globally important driving forces include 
emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols, changes in land use and cover, 
intensification of resourc
e use, and other patterns in both developed and developing countries.<p>

<li>Lead to a better understanding of potential impacts, both positive and 
negative, in food production, water resources, infrastructure (especially in 
coastal zones, deltas, and other highly sensitive locations), financial services, 
economic activities d
ependent on natural resources (e.g., forestry, tourism), and human health. 
Understanding the potential importance of global change for U.S. 
communities requires not only looking at the local and regional scales in the 
United States, but also at global tre
nds and flows of resources (such as international trading patterns) which 
have an ever-increasing effect on the well-being of U.S. communities. This 
information will assist in improving bottom-line estimates of the potential 
effects of global change on ec
onomic productivity and growth.<p>

<li>Enable us to improve estimates of the potential economic effects of 
options for anticipating and responding to global changes. Economic 
estimates for reducing the impact of human activities on the environment 
(e.g., by reducing greenhouse gas and aero
sol emissions through improvements in energy efficiency or development of 
alternative sources of energy) range from large costs to large benefits. This 
research will contribute to making these estimates more precise by improving 
our understanding of techn
ology change and barriers to diffusion of new technologies, factors that affect 
adaptation and resource management, and paths for economic development 
in developing countries that can have a low impact on the environment, 
enhance their economic and social
 prospects, and provide improved commercial opportunities for U.S. 
firms.</ul><p>

Success in this area of research requires the talents and contributions of the 
full range of agencies involved in the USGCRP. It requires fundamental 
advances in the social and economic sciences (e.g., to improve our 
understanding of the factors that affe
ct the demographic transition from high to low birthrates), in 
interdisciplinary research linking ecological and physical sciences with 
economics and other social science disciplines (e.g., to better account for the 
value of goods and services provided by
 ecosystems that are not traded in the marketplace), and in modeling to better 
integrate the diverse dimensions of global change and to improve our 
estimates of the sensitivity of global environmental systems to changes in 
human management and behavior.<p
>

Research on these issues of human contributions and responses is a small, 
but critical and growing, research component of the USGCRP. As described 
below, the USGCRP agencies are developing an interesting and diverse range 
of research programs to contribut
e to improved understanding of the human dimensions of global change.<p>


<b><i>Human Contributions and Responses Program Goal</i></b><p>

<i>The goal of this USGCRP activity is to identify, understand, and analyze 
how human activities contribute to changes in natural systems, how the 
consequences of natural and human-induced change affect the health and 
well-being of humans and their instit
utions, and how humans could potentially respond to problems associated 
with environmental change.</i><p>

Progress toward this goal will provide an improved scientific basis for 
decision makers considering how society should respond to global-scale 
environmental change. USGCRP priorities for research on the human 
dimensions of climate change follow:<p>
<ul>
<li>Observe, analyze, and predict the processes through which population 
growth, migration, and technological, social, and economic change affect 
natural and managed systems at all scales in ways that influence the global 
environment<p>

<li>Observe, analyze, and predict the impacts of changing environmental 
conditions on the health and well-being of individuals, institutions, and 
societies<p>

<li>Identify the processes through which individuals and institutions 
anticipate, adapt, mitigate, and respond in other ways to global change, 
including the development and adoption of industrial, energy, and 
environmental technologies<p>

<li>Develop improved methods for monitoring, modeling, and predicting 
critical interactions between human and natural systems, including the 
refinement of integrated assessment models and the enhancement of 
methods to study varied strategies for respondin
g to long-term environmental change<p>

<li>Improve the scientific infrastructure supporting research and 
management capabilities.</ul><p>

U.S. research in these areas is coordinated with related efforts in other nations 
through such mechanisms as the International Human Dimensions of Global 
Environmental Change Programme (IHDP), thus providing a broader 
capability for considering the comple
xity of the global social and economic structure.<p>


<b><i>Human Contributions and Responses Program 
Objectives</i></b><p>

In order to develop an enhanced capability to address certain fundamental 
issues, research on human contributions and responses to global change will 
address the following objectives.<p>

<b>Objective 1  -  Understand How Human Activities Interact with Natural 
Ecological Systems and Managed Natural Resource Systems in Ways Related 
to Global Environmental Change</b><p>

In the coming century, activities aimed at maintaining and raising living 
standards for a growing human population will contribute to global 
environmental change. Currently, in some locations, resource degradation 
and shortages interact with increased dem
ands, thereby seriously straining local and regional environmental systems 
and human institutions. Developing an improved understanding of the 
dynamics that contribute to these trends is important both for projecting 
future change and ultimately for under
standing how best to reconcile attainment of human needs and wants with 
protection of the long-term ability of environmental systems to renew 
themselves. Research focuses on the following:<p>
<ul>
<li><i> Process through which Humans Affect Natural Systems</i>: An 
important line of research on human-environmental interaction is the 
identification and analysis of the dynamics of human systems that affect 
natural systems. Human impacts on natural sys
tems are manifest in many ways, including land-use change, industrial 
metabolism (production processes from extraction and use of resources 
through to emissions and waste products), agricultural and forest 
management system change, and the emission of air
 and water pollutants. Research focuses on assessing the socioeconomic 
factors that influence both the emissions of greenhouse gases, aerosols, and 
other species, and changes in land cover and use.<p>

<li><i>Impacts of Changing Environmental Conditions on the Health and 
Well-Being of Individuals, Institutions, and Societies</i>:  Important lines of 
research on the consequences of global change on the health and well-being of 
individuals and institution
s, thus on society, include effects of global change on different economic 
sectors and managed resources, such as water resources, agriculture, forestry, 
fisheries, energy, transportation, financial and insurance services, and coastal 
infrastructure; huma
n health effects including the effects of UV radiation on disease and organs 
(especially the eyes and skin), the effects of UV radiation on photosensitivity 
of people using commonly prescribed medications, and the effects of changes 
in natural systems on 
the incidence of diseases; and analyses of vulnerability to environmental 
change, particularly of the interacting factors that increase or decrease societal 
vulnerability to environmental variability and change.<p>

<li><i>Fundamental Human Processes that Underlie the Complex Mix of 
Human-Environmental Interactions</i>:  Important lines of research, 
conducted primarily by the NSF Human Dimensions of Global Change 
(HDGC) program, include studies that emphasize advanci
ng basic understanding of the ways that human activities affect and respond 
to changes in natural systems, including economic processes affecting and 
affected by global change, resource impacts and adaptation, the value of 
information and decision making 
under uncertainty, socioeconomic forces shaping technology and practice 
linked to global change, and comparative analysis of different types of policies 
and policy instruments.</ul><p>


<b>Objective 2  -  Understand How Individuals and Institutions Anticipate, 
Adapt, Mitigate, and Respond in Other Ways to Global Change</b><p>

Throughout history, people have shown the capacity to alter their behavior 
when they perceive their activities to be hazardous or detrimental to their 
own interests. An important facet of research on human contributions and 
responses to global change is t
he identification and analysis of current and proposed strategies for 
responding to environmental change.<p>

A special form of human response is the development and implementation 
of environmental policies by governments and other institutions. As part of 
NSF's ongoing leadership of an interagency-initiated human dimensions 
research thrust, NSF includes a specia
l Policy Sciences program component within its HDGC program. This activity 
emphasizes studies to enhance methods and knowledge used in 
environmental policy analysis.<p>

The broader set of USGCRP agencies focus their programs on specialized 
response frameworks and strategies closely related to their missions:<p>
<ul>
<li>Analysis of feasibility, costs, benefits, and efficacy of response 
strategies<br>

<li>Research on social values, including examination of valuation, 
intergenerational issues, and environmental justice<br>

<li>Research on technological innovation and diffusion<br>

<li>Research on how changes in social and economic conditions influence 
adjustment options<br>

<li>The role of information in decision making.</ul><p>

<b>Objective 3  -  Understand How Methods for Monitoring, Modeling, and 
Predicting Critical Interactions between Human and Natural Systems can be 
Improved</b><p>

The advancement of knowledge about human contributions and responses to 
global change requires significant progress in essential research capabilities 
and methods, especially data assembly and methods for comprehensive 
analysis.<p>

Identification, collection, and archiving of critical human systems data 
needed for research on the human contributions and responses to global 
change and on interactions among human and natural systems is carried out 
by the Consortium for International E
arth Science Information Network (CIESIN) and major NSF-sponsored data-
collection efforts, as well as through the efforts of many individual 
researchers.<p>

Research on integrated modeling and assessment of human-environment 
interactions includes a range of approaches for examining the complex 
interactions among Earth's physical, biological, and human systems. The 
integrated assessment approach uses quantitat
ive models and other methods to understand individual component systems 
and their interactions, with particular emphasis on how changes in one or 
more component systems will affect other systems. Research is supported on 
a variety of proposed approaches, 
ranging from quite general to regionally and sectorally specific.<p>

<b>Objective 4  -  Understand How the Infrastructure Supporting Research 
and Management Capabilities Related to Human Contributions and 
Responses to Global Change can be Strengthened</b><p>

In addition to conducting and sponsoring research, agencies participating in 
the USGCRP work together to support an infrastructure that encourages the 
active exchange of ideas and the development of research agendas that deal 
with human contributions and 
responses to global change:<p>
<ul>
<li>National efforts to stimulate research on the human contributions and 
responses to global change, including work of the National Academy of 
Sciences/National Research Council Subcommittee on the Human 
Dimensions of Global Change<br>

<li>Efforts to strengthen international research collaborations, such as the 
International Human Dimensions Programme and the Global Change 
System for Analysis, Research, and Training<br>

<li>Activities linking fundamental research and users of research results<br>

<li>Activities to build research capabilities in different research 
communities.</ul><p>

<b><i>Agency Contributions</i></b><p>

Several USGCRP agencies support research on issues of human contributions 
and responses to global change:<p>
<ul>
<li>NSF's major contribution to research in this area is its Human 
Dimensions of Global Change program, which is the largest component of the 
NSF programs in environmental social science. HDGC supports fundamental 
research that emphasizes basic understand
ing of the ways that human activities affect and respond to changes in natural 
systems. HDGC grant awards are primarily for research on economic processes 
affecting and affected by global change; resource impacts and adaptation; the 
value of information a
nd decision making under uncertainty; socioeconomic forces shaping 
technology and practice linked to global change; and comparative analysis of 
different types of policies and policy instruments. In addition to the support 
of individual investigators, NSF
 has established the National Center for Environmental Decision making 
Research and a consortium of centers and teams on HDGC research. As part 
of its policy sciences activities, NSF collaborates with EPA to support research 
on valuation and environmental
 policy. Methods and Models for Integrated Assessment (MMIA), a separate 
focused area of the NSF Global Change program, supports research that 
advances the development of tools and models for the framing and conduct 
of integrated assessments.<p>

<li>DOE supports research on integrated assessments, involving the use of 
quantitative models and other methods to understand the interrelated 
components of human-environmental interaction, including the cost-benefit 
tradeoffs of climate change response s
trategies. DOE's National Institute for Global Environmental Change 
supports focused applications of these methods and models.<p>

<h3><center><a name="intres">International</a> Research 
Cooperation</center></h3><p>

<b><center>U.S. Commitment to Leadership and 
Coordination</center></b><p>

The USGCRP seeks to improve understanding of global change and to 
improve capabilities for predicting and dealing with such change in response 
to new trends and challenges. This objective, common to many nations, can 
best be achieved through cooperative i
nternational programs that aggregate and coordinate the capabilities and 
resources of various nations. In support of this cooperative effort, the 
USGCRP participates in and supports the three major international global 
change research programs that have b
een initiated within the scientific community: The World Climate Research 
Programme; the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme; and the 
International Human Dimensions of Global Environmental Change 
Programme. Coordination of funding for these progra
ms is provided through the informal International Group of Funding 
Agencies, which matches available funding to the set of proposed 
activities.<p>

Cooperation depends on open communication. Improved communications 
systems enable U.S. scientists to interact directly with foreign colleagues on a 
daily or even an hourly basis. Progress is greatest when there is an ability to 
exchange data and results o
f studies openly and rapidly. Recently, however, some countries have 
subordinated the interests of long-term basic research to shorter term 
objectives relating to recovery of data-collection costs through sale of data and 
products. U.S. scientists and age
ncies are thus finding it necessary to undertake new efforts to maintain the 
long-standing policy of full and open international exchange of data.<p>

The USGCRP has also developed a range of global, regional, and bilateral 
mechanisms to provide a framework within which U.S. scientists and 
colleagues in other countries cooperate to address specific research issues and 
to study specific regions of mutual
 interest. The value of such cooperation is well illustrated by international 
contributions to NASA's Mission to Planet Earth program, which are 
estimated to exceed $3.5 billion between 1995 and 2002.<p>


<b><i>International Research Cooperation Goal</i></b><p>

<i>The goal of the international research cooperation element of the 
USGCRP is to support and assist the program and its participating scientists 
and agencies in their interactions with related international research, 
observing, and assessment activities 
and in the full and open international sharing of data and research findings. 
</i><p>

Progress toward this goal will enhance the cooperative effort to improve 
understanding of global change, which can best be achieved by aggregating 
and coordinating the capabilities and resources of various nations.<p>

<b><i>Key Examples of International Cooperation</i></b><p>

This section provides examples of significant international cooperative 
research activities in which the USGCRP and its participating agencies are 
currently active.<p>

<b>Example 1  -  Participate in the International Research Institute: A Global 
Concept with Regional Applications</b><p>

The USGCRP, with NOAA leading this effort, is working with the scientific 
community, international research and development organizations, and 
governments to develop the International Research Institute, a critical 
component of the seasonal to interannual
 climate variability thrust of the USGCRP. The IRI will provide an integrating 
point for modeling, observations, process studies, and social science research 
conducted by many nations, including many activities sponsored by the 
USGCRP, with the following 
specific objectives:<p>
<ul>
<li>Continually develop dynamic and thermodynamically consistent coupled 
models of the global atmosphere, ocean, and land system to serve as a basis 
for improved climate prediction<br>

<li>Systematically produce useful experimental climate forecasts on time 
scales of several months to several years<br>

<li>Receive, analyze, and archive global atmospheric and oceanic data to 
improve the scope and accuracy of forecasts<br>

<li>Shape and augment experimental forecasts by incorporating additional 
physical, agricultural, economic, and other appropriate data in order to 
provide explicit social and economic benefits to societies<br>

<li>Explore systematically the predictability of climate anomalies on time 
scales of up to a few years.</ul><p>

At the widely attended "International Forum on Forecasting El Ni&#241;o: 
Launching an International Research Institute," held in Washington, DC, in 
November 1995, the United States offered to provide a site for the core facility 
of the IRI. Regional appli
cations activities will be developed through existing networks, such as the 
Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research (IAI), the European 
Network for Research in Global Change (ENRICH), the Asia-Pacific Network 
(APN), and the Global Change Syste
m for Analysis, Research, and Training (START).<p>

<b>Example 2  -  Develop Scientific Input to the International Policymaking 
Process</b><p>

Descriptions of two key assessment activities in which the USGCRP is 
intimately involved follow:<p>
<ul>
<li><i>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</i>:  The IPCC has 
recently completed its Second Assessment Report. U.S. scientists joined with 
colleagues from many other countries in developing and extensively 
reviewing this major comprehensive asse
ssment. As amplified in the box on pages 30-33, the IPCC Second Assessment 
Report concludes that human activities are likely to have affected the climate 
over the past century; that climate change is likely to become more 
pronounced over the next several 
decades; and that many natural ecological systems and managed natural-
resource systems are vulnerable to climate change. While the IPCC 
assessment identified some potential strategies to assist adaptation to climate 
change, it concluded that adverse ecolo
gical and socioeconomic impacts may result from not mitigating, or slowing, 
climate change.<p>

Internationally, consideration is being given to undertaking a Third 
Assessment Report for completion in the year 2000. In addition, the 
Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice of the UNFCCC has 
recently asked the IPCC to prepare over the 
next 6 to 18 months a number of special assessments to clarify issues under 
negotiation in the UNFCCC or to further articulate and integrate the 
vulnerability assessments presented in the Second Assessment Report.<p>

The United States has served as co-chair of the IPCC Working Group II, and 
the USGCRP provided the resources to support Working Group II's Technical 
Support Unit.<p>

The U.S. Government coordinates its IPCC-related activities on an 
interagency basis. USGCRP research programs and USGCRP-supported 
scientists provide scientific and technical input to the assessments. A number 
of U.S. scientists served as lead authors for
 chapters of the Second Assessment Report and many U.S. scientists served as 
co-authors, contributors, and reviewers. The U.S. Government, in developing 
its comments on this report and its individual chapters, invited input from a 
wide variety of sources,
 including many non-governmental organizations.<p>

<li><i>The International Ozone Assessment</i>:  During 1994, the United 
States served as a leader in the preparation of the international <i>Scientific 
Assessment of Ozone Depletion, </i>continuing a series started in the 1970s. 
This assessment compiled i
nformation about emissions of ozone-depleting substances, observed and 
predicted changes in ozone concentrations, the effects on the ozone layer of 
recent volcanic eruptions, the development and character of the Antarctic 
ozone hole, the increases in UV r
adiation that result from ozone decreases, the effects on the radiation balance 
(and thereby on climate) of changes in ozone concentrations, and the build-up 
and expected effects of substitute compounds. The ozone assessments have 
provided crucial scienti
fic information to those who negotiated the <i>Montreal Protocol on 
Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer</i> and its subsequent amendments 
and adjustments.<p>

As a follow-up to the overall assessment, a special assessment on the effects of 
subsonic and supersonic aircraft is currently underway under the leadership 
of NASA. It is expected that the next assessment in this series will be 
completed in 1997.</ul><p>


<b>Example 3  -  Bilateral Arrangements</b><p>

The USGCRP agencies participate in a large number of bilateral arrangements 
for research collaboration:<p>
<ul>
<li><i>TOPEX/Poseidon - Studying Ocean Circulation and Sea Level Trends 
with France</i>:  TOPEX/Poseidon is a joint space flight mission between 
NASA and the Centre Nationale d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES) under the 
Mission to Planet Earth program. This joint 
mission observes ocean circulation to a high degree of precision; maps ocean 
currents and sea surface topography; and monitors mean sea level trends for 
evidence of global warming. The mission will include scientific studies of the 
interactions between th
e tropical ocean and interannual climate variability - especially the tropical 
Pacific Ocean anomaly known as the El Ni&#241;o, which contributes to 
climatic anomalies on a planetary scale.<p>

<li><i>TRMM - The U.S.-Japan Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission</i>:  
Under the 1995 agreement on TRMM between NASA and Japan's National 
Space Development Agency (NASDA), NASA is building the TRMM 
spacecraft and four scientific flight instruments. These 
instruments will obtain data on tropical precipitation, thus improving 
understanding of global energy and water cycles. NASDA is building the 
primary scientific instrument, a Precipitation Radar, and will launch TRMM 
in 1997. The collected data will be sh
ared with the world scientific community quickly and inexpensively.<p>

<li><i>Improving Models for Global Change Research with China</i>:  U.S. 
scientists sponsored by DOE are initiating joint research efforts with their 
counterparts at the Chinese Meteorological Administration (CMA) and the 
Chinese Academy of Sciences, unde
r the Science and Technology Agreement between the People's Republic of 
China and the United States. Research with the CMA will focus on regional 
climate models, meteorological observations to verify models, and impacts of 
climate change.<p>

<li><i>Research on Smoke, Clouds, and Radiation - A Joint Brazilian-U.S. 
Effort</i>:  In 1995, NASA, the Brazilian Space Agency, and Brazil's National 
Institute of Space Research conducted the successful Smoke, Clouds, and 
RadiationBrazil (SCAR-B) campai
gn. The campaign relied on both <i>in situ</i> and remote-sensing 
platforms to study physical and chemical properties of atmospheric aerosols 
to learn more about the impact of biomass burning on the tropics. SCAR-B 
also enabled the two countries to gain n
ew insights into the global cooling/ heating effect of these aerosols.<p>

<li><i>U.S.-Japan Planning for Cooperative Research on Land-Use and Land-
Cover Change</i>:  The fourth bilateral workshop on global change research, 
held in early 1996, focused on this subject and resulted in a series of 
recommendations for future coopera
tive research in areas such as comparative analyses of land-management 
institutions; strategies for development of new databases; resolution of data 
management issues, such as standards and access; and improvement of 
models.<p>

<li><i>ADEOS  -  The Advanced Earth Observing Satellite</i>:  As part of the 
international earth observing system, Japan is leading a cooperative mission 
to observe surface visible and near-infrared radiance/reflectance, 
scatterometry, and tropospheric an
d stratospheric chemistry. NASA is providing the scatterometer. ADEOS is 
scheduled for launch in the summer of 1996. France also participates in this 
mission.<p>

<li><i>U.S. Country Studies Program</i>:  The U.S. Country Studies 
Program (USCSP) is an important example of how USGCRP research and 
related U.S. capabilities have been made available to other nations to enable 
them to improve their understanding of clim
ate change, strengthen their participation in the IPCC process, and assist in the 
development of their national communications as called for under the 
UNFCCC. Developing from a commitment by President Bush in 1992, the 
USCSP has assisted 56 developing cou
ntries and countries with economies in transition around the world to 
estimate their greenhouse gas emissions, assess their vulnerability to climate 
change, evaluate adaptation and mitigation options, and develop climate 
change action plans. The program h
as prepared more than 20 peer-reviewed publications documenting 
preliminary results from the 56 countries, and will be releasing several major 
synthesis reports and databases in the near future. In addition, the USCSP has 
provided training and analytical 
support to more than 1,000 analysts from other countries.</ul><p>

<b>Example 4  -  Observations and Data for Global Change Research</b><p>

Examples of new efforts to enhance international cooperation and 
collaboration follow:<p>
<ul>
<li><i>Exchanging Global Change Data with Japan  -  A Precedent for a Global 
Network</i>:  In 1995, the United States and Japan announced a plan for a 
Global Observations and Information Network (GOIN) that will enable users 
on both sides of the Pacific t
o access data from the other side by computer. NOAA is leading this effort for 
the USGCRP. This network will make it easier and faster to share critical data 
for predicting, preparing for, and responding to natural disasters. GOIN is also 
expected to help
 provide the basis for a global information infrastructure.<p>

<li><i>Moving Toward a Global Observing System</i>:  The United States is 
working with our international partners to develop a strategy for planning 
and moving toward a comprehensive global observing system. The United 
States has developed a white paper o
n how to improve coordination:</ul><p>
<ul>
 -   Recommendations of user groups for multi-purpose observing and data 
systems<br>
 -   National commitments to long-term implementation of the various 
components of a coherent global system<br>
 -   Efforts of operating agencies involved in space-based and <i>in situ</i> 
observing systems and data management.</ul><p>

This strategy is intended to contribute to development of an international 
effort to organize systematic programs for global observation of atmospheric, 
oceanic, and terrestrial variables from the surface, space, and <i>in 
situ</i>.<p>

<b>Example 5  -  The Inter-American Institute for Global Change 
Research</b><p>

Seventeen countries, including the United States, have signed an agreement 
to establish the Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research. 
Following the entry into force of the agreement in 1994, the IAI Conference of 
the Parties selected a Scientif
ic Advisory Committee, an Executive Council, an IAI Director, and a site for 
the IAI Directorate (at the National Space Research Institute of Brazil). The 
Director officially assumed his position and the Directorate was inaugurated 
in March 1996.<p>

The IAI has issued two calls for scientific proposals, and grants are currently 
being awarded. The results of these awarded proposals will serve as the first 
examples of IAI-fostered regional cooperation, which is expected to promote 
optimal use of availa
ble resources for global change research and to augment the scientific capacity 
of the region. Scientific data and information provided by IAI researchers will 
be managed as a common resource for the region and should provide 
baseline information for use 
in regional planning.<p>

<b>Example 6  -  Capacity-Building</b><p>

START is a joint effort of the IGBP, IHDP, and WCRP. The United States 
continues to provide strong leadership and funding support for START, 
which reflects our international commitment to build capacities for global 
change research in the developing world
. START regional research networks promote focused research and training 
on regional issues of global relevance, integrate and synthesize results, and 
provide input to decision makers at national and regional levels. START 
networks in Asia and Africa have
 initiated studies on land-use and -cover change; climate variability and 
agriculture; and regional modeling of climate and biospheric changes. START 
regional centers have been established in Beijing, Bangkok, New Delhi, and 
Accra. Scientific assessments 
on global change issues of relevance to regional decision makers have been 
initiated, and science policy forums are being conducted.<p>

<h3><center><a name="gcedu">Global</a> Change Education and 
Communication</center></h3><p>

<b><center>Encouraging Global Change Science Literacy</center></b><p>

Global environmental change is, increasingly, an essential part of the context 
in which social, economic, and technological development take place. From 
now on, choices about these activities will be influenced by environmental 
considerations and, in turn
, will affect the global environment. Societal decision making will need to be 
based on an informed understanding of the factors driving global change, 
how the changes may manifest themselves, and how society can most 
effectively adapt to or limit future 
changes.<p>

Global change education and communication seeks to provide useful 
information on the results of scientific research. In addition, it is an effort to 
help lay the underlying foundation for the understanding that is needed in 
order to interpret and apply sc
ientific findings appropriately. The application of knowledge from research 
and assessments to the challenges faced by society calls for a broad-based 
public understanding of global change.<p>

In addition, society has a vital interest in the education of talented young 
scientists who can question, investigate, and develop the ability to carry 
forward the development of scientific understanding. For scientific ability to 
achieve its full potenti
al, interests and skills must be developed early in life.<p>

Thus, the education and communication component of the USGCRP is 
responsible for fostering public understanding and the development of the 
next generation of scientists.<p>

<b><i>Global Change Education and Communication Goal</i></b><p>

<i>The goal of the education and communication component of the USGCRP 
is to increase public awareness of the Earth system and how it is changing and 
to promote global change education.</i><p>

Progress toward this goal will help ensure that societal decision making is 
based on an informed understanding of global change, and will serve society's 
vital interest in the education of young scientists.<p>

To achieve this goal, the USGCRP has a multi-pronged approach to reach a 
diverse set of information users. To train the next generation of scientists, 
USGCRP supports undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctoral participation in 
ongoing scientific research 
activities. To meet the needs of formal educators, the USGCRP provides 
resources for statewide action planning, teacher enhancement, curriculum 
support, and select student support programs.  Informal education is another 
approach to reach a broad communit
y with the results of global change research. Multimedia communication 
resources provide a valuable mechanism for communicating the complex, 
interdisciplinary nature of global change science.<p>

In global change education, the emphasis of the individual agencies has 
historically been aimed broadly at the university undergraduate and graduate 
level. Our current programs, while continuing the focus on higher level 
education, are working more compre
hensively to make available educational resources at levels from 
kindergarten onward, not only to inspire students to undertake scientific 
careers but also to stimulate non-career scientific literacy.<p>

<b><i>Global Change Education and Communication 
Objectives</i></b><p>

USGCRP leadership in global change education is working to promote 
coordination among participating Federal agencies and to enhance the 
effectiveness of available resources.<p>

<b>Objective 1  -  Promote the Dissemination and Use of Global Change 
Research and Information</b><p>

The USGCRP has established infrastructure and capability for communication 
through the Global Change Research Information Office, which is mandated 
by the <a href="/gcact1990.html">Global Change Research Act</a> of 1990, 
"...to disseminate to foreign gove
rnments, businesses, and institutions, as well as to citizens of foreign 
countries, scientific research information available in the United States which 
would be useful in preventing, mitigating, or adapting to the effects of global 
change." In addition, 
the USGCRP has developed unique products and resources with specific 
target audiences in mind.<p>

USGCRP agencies have produced a number of global change education and 
communication products, including the Global Change Education Resource 
Guide, videotapes, overhead transparencies, and a CD-ROM; the NOAA 
Monograph Series, Journalist Guide, and Interne
t Activities Using Scientific Data; NASA lithographs depicting remotely 
sensed and visualized images, and NASA global change education national 
video conferences; the USDA Global Change Information Packet; the 
DOI/USG Global Change Teaching Packet and His
torical Landsat Data Comparisons monograph; and exhibits at national 
professional conferences such as the National Science Teachers 
Association.<p>

These activities promote interagency coordination and leveraging of 
communication resources, and promote the accurate and timely transmission 
of relevant and age-appropriate information to public information users. For 
additional information, the USGCRP W
orld Wide Web Home Page may be accessed at <a 
href="http://www.usgcrp.gov">http://www.usgcrp.gov</a>.<p>

<b>Objective 2  -  Promote the Development of the Next Generation of 
Scientists, and Ensure an Understanding of the Multidisciplinary Nature of 
Global Change Science for All through Real-World Experiential Learning 
Activities</b><p>

Students today are both interested and concerned about the state of the 
environment. One way to encourage and empower them to participate in 
problem-solving and to become comfortable with science is to engage them in 
the process of authentic scientific in
vestigation. Active participation in the ongoing investigation of Earth and 
the environment in a global context is applicable at differing levels of 
sophistication for children in elementary school through post-doctoral 
graduate research programs.<p>

The Global Learning to Benefit the Environment (GLOBE) program has 
multi-agency support, and has established school and private sector 
partnerships to offer a long-term, hands-on environmental monitoring 
program on global change for students worldwide.<p>


The International Science and Engineering Fair, offered a new category of 
projects on global change in 1995, supported by the USGCRP. Students in 
grades 9-12 in every school district in the United States and in countries 
around the world were encouraged t
o design experiments related to global change research. The USGCRP again 
provided support for this effort in 1996, while seeking to obtain private sector 
support for continuing this activity. Students from 20 countries and all 50 
States participated in th
e 1996 Fair, culminating in Tucson, Arizona. The global change division of 
the Fair had 114 entrants (10&#37; of all participants).<p>

Graduate and post-doctoral fellowships continue to be a major budget 
allocation for agency education efforts. Graduate and post-doctoral fellows 
contribute to the research and knowledge base about global change and 
promote the development of a cadre of sc
ientists who cooperate with educators to translate scientific information for 
diverse audiences.<p>

<b>Objective 3  -  Integrate Global Change Information into the Existing 
Formal and Informal Educational Systems</b><p>

This effort builds on the USGCRP relationship with Global Change Education 
State Teams (initiated in 1994 at the National Educators Conference on Global 
Change), and action plans developed by each State at NASA-sponsored 
regional forums in 1995. The aim i
s to integrate global change content into statewide core curricula, professional 
and association meetings at regional and national levels, and programs 
conducted in museums, science centers, and community groups.<p>

<b>Objective 4  -  Support Professional Development Programs for Educators 
on Earth Eystem Science</b><p>

Educating educators is a highly effective method for translating complex 
scientific research for use by non-technical audiences. Educators in both 
formal and informal programs identify training as a primary need for 
increasing the probability that materia
ls will actually be used.<p>

The USGCRP agencies have developed and supported complementary 
teacher training programs for in-service education. NOAA supported a 4-year 
national train-the-trainers effort for informal educators through the Sea 
Grant College Program. NASA funds teacher 
training programs through universities along with projects like Discover 
Earth and Classroom of the Future. DoD promoted education of minority 
teachers and teachers of minority students through Operation Pathfinder. 
NSF supports teacher training in global
 change education through grants for national and regional programs.<p>

Pre-service education has been identified as an approach to train emerging 
teachers from schools of education. NASA's Project NOVA is an example of 
providing support to university teams (from Education and Science 
Departments) to develop courses and/or co
urse modules for students seeking teacher certification.<p>

A</title></head>
<body>



<center><h2>Appendix A</center></h2><p>

<center><h3>The Proposed USGCRP Budget for FY97</center></h3><p>



<p>

The proposed FY97 USGCRP budget totals $1.73 billion. After adjusting so that 
comparable programs are included in the compilation (see discussion of 
NOAA budget below), the FY97 request is down slightly (0.7&#37;) from the 
FY96 budget request. The FY97 request is up slightly (0.5&#37;) from the actual 
Congressionally approved funding level for FY95.<p>

Since the FY96 Congressionally approved budget is estimated to result in a 
reduction of $110.3 million (6.3&#37;) below the actual funding level for 
FY95, the FY97 request is, in effect, proposing a restoration to the approved 
FY95 spending level.<p>

Of the $122.7 million (7.5&#37;) proposed increase from the FY96 to the FY97 
budget, $112.8 million is to restore the NASA Mission to Planet Earth 
program to approximately the FY95 funding level. The budget request also 
includes an $11.1 million increase from FY96 for DOC/NOAA.<p>

As outlined in this edition of <i>Our Changing Planet</i>., the USGCRP 
budget 
supports scientific research on key global change environmental issues, 
including seasonal to interannual climate variability; climate change over 
decades to centuries; changes in ozone, UV radiation, and atmospheric 
chemistry; and changes in land cover and in terrestrial and marine 
ecosystems. The USGCRP budget  supports global change research integrating 
activities, including observing and monitoring global change and global 
change data, products, and information services; research on Earth system 
science and on human contributions and responses to global change; and 
program responsibilities including international research cooperation and 
global change education and communication.<p>

The figures in Appendix A indicate broadly, for each of the principal program 
thrusts and program integration activities in the USGCRP budget, which 
agencies make a "major" contribution in that area and which additional 
agencies also participate by making a more "focused" contribution. The tables 
show the USGCRP budgets for FY95-FY97 and also the budgets by Budget 
Function.<p>

For comparison with budgets of earlier years, a few changes deserve 
attention:<p>
<ul>
<li>In the FY96 <i>Our Changing Planet</i>., DOC/NOAA included funding 
for the 
NOAA fleet of oceanographic vessels, the NOAA Corps, the NOAA 
laboratories, the National Undersea Research Program, and the VENTS 
program as part of the USGCRP budget. For FY97, DOC/NOAA has 
redesignated these activities out of the USGCRP. The DOC/NOAA FY95 and 
FY96 USGCRP budget figures in the current edition of <i>Our Changing 
Planet</i>. 
have been adjusted accordingly, in order to focus on the NOAA global change 
research programs that have been a continuing part of the USGCRP budget.

<p>

<li>The Department of Transportation and the Tennessee Valley Authority, 
two USGCRP-participating agencies that have funded global change research 
in the past, are not requesting any funding for global change research in FY97. 
This reduces the number of USGCRP agencies that fund global change 
research from 12 to 10.</ul><p>

Of the 10 remaining agencies, in the FY97 request, NASA accounts for 
72&#37; of the total USGCRP budget. The global change research budgets of 
NASA, NSF, DOE, DOC, and USDA together account for just over 95&#37; of 
the USGCRP total. The USGCRP budgets of NIH, DOI, EPA, DoD, and the 
Smithsonian Institution together account for the remaining portion.<p>

It should be noted that the $1.852 billion FY97 request for global change 
research in the President's Budget<a href=fnappa.html><sup>5</sup></a> is 
not equivalent to the $1.73 
billion 
USGCRP budget  presented in <i>Our Changing Planet</i>.. There are 
several reasons 
for this difference. Most of the difference is accounted for by the NASA 
budget; the USGCRP budget does not include launch services as global change 
research in <i>Our Changing Planet</i>., whereas the President's Budget 
Supplement 
does. <i>Our Changing Planet</i>. includes global change research at DoD 
and 
DOC/NIST, as designated for the USGCRP by these agencies. The USGCRP 
budget also includes corrected or updated figures for DOT, EPA, Smithsonian, 
and TVA, as designated by these agencies. More detailed information is 
available from the Office of the USGCRP on request.<p>

<center><h3>FY95-FY97 USGCRP Budget by Program</center></h3><p>

The allocations of resources by program within an agency that are 
reflected in these tables for FY96 and FY97 serve as an estimate 
only, and are subject to change based on decisions on scientific and 
programmatic priorities among USGCRP agencies, their advisory 
bodies, and the input of the national and international scientific 
communities.<p>

These budgets are for programs designated by participating agencies 
for inclusion in the USGCRP. The budget pages for individual agencies 
that follow include a listing of these programs, as well as a general 
description of each agency's "Areas of Global Change Research." In 
addition, the agencies conduct a broad range of "Related 
Research," which is outlined on the budget pages but funding of which 
is not part of the USGCRP budget because the research is conducted 
primarily for other purposes.<p>

Each agency budget page also includes a "Mapping of Budget Request 
to Appropriations Legislation." These entries point to the locations in 
the various Appropriations Bills (and, in some cases, Appropriations 
Committee Reports) of funding for USGCRP activities. Note that it is 
common for global change research to be funded within 
Appropriations accounts that also include funding for other activities, 
so that Appropriations Bills and Committee Reports do not 
necessarily designate funding specifically for global change research. 
Thus, the actual funding level for global change research activities 
must be determined, in part, by decisions within agencies about how 
to allocate appropriated funds. It should also be noted that USGCRP 
activities are funded by eight different Appropriations Bills, as well 
as by a varying number of Budget Authorization Bills. Thus, the 
relationship between the USGCRP budget and the Appropriations 
process is complex and not easily summarized.<p>

It should be noted that the budget totals for individual agencies are 
in some cases not equivalent to the totals presented in the FY97 
request for global change research in the President's Budget, as 
discussed in <a href="appA.html">Appendix A</a>.<p>

</title></head>

<center><h2>Appendix C</center></h2><p>

<center><h3>History of the USGCRP</center></h3><p>

The U.S. Global Change Research Program was established in 1989, to 
combine and coordinate the research and policy development 
interests of 15 departments and agencies of the U.S. Government and 
Executive Offices of the President. The USGCRP is organized under the 
auspices of the Subcommittee on Global Change Research (SGCR), 
which is one of the seven environmental issue subcommittees 
established by the Committee on Environment and Natural Resources 
(CENR) [which has replaced the Committee on Earth and 
Environmental Sciences (CEES)]. In turn, the CENR is one of the nine 
committees organized under the National Science and Technology 
Council (NSTC).<p>

The SGCR includes representatives of the Departments of Agriculture, 
Commerce (the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 
and National Institute of Standards and Technology), Defense, Energy, 
Health and Human Services (the National Institute of Environmental 
Health Sciences), Interior, Transportation, and State as well as the 
Environmental Protection Agency, the National Aeronautics and 
Space Administration, the National Science Foundation, the 
Smithsonian Institution, the Tennessee Valley Authority, the 
intelligence community, the Office of Science and Technology Policy, 
the Council of Economic Advisers, and the Office of Management and 
Budget.<p>

To implement the activities described in the USGCRP research 
framework, the SGCR has established Working Groups that bring 
together representatives of the participating agencies for regular 
consideration of program coordination, review of program plans, and 
development of plans for new projects and activities. The Chairs of 
these groups, along with the Chair and Vice-Chairs of the 
Subcommittee, form the Executive Committee of the USGCRP. To 
ensure effective program integration across these activities, the SGCR 
established the Office of the USGCRP in July 1993. This office, which 
is staffed by the participating agencies and departments, is 
responsible for drafting the annual edition of<i> Our Changing Planet 
</i>and periodic research plans, as well as facilitating the
year-to-year planning and day-to-day coordination and communication 
needs of the program.<p>

The planning, coordination, and execution of USGCRP research activities are 
carried out in close association with and in support of the science priorities of 
the international research community-particularly those put forth by the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the World Climate 
Research Programme, the International Human Dimensions of Climate 
Change Programme, and the International Geosphere-Biosphere 
Programme. These efforts underpin U.S. participation in and 
contribution to the international assessments related to aspects of 
global change.<p>

The USGCRP maintains an active interaction with the National 
Academy of Sciences through its Board on Sustainable Development, 
its Committee on Global Change Research, and several other boards, 
committees, and panels of the National Research Council that 
interface with many of the international scientific research 
programs.<p>

<center><b>Program Evaluation</center></b><p>

The overall USGCRP is evaluated periodically for scientific merit and 
continued relevance to the policy process, both domestic and 
international, by the National Academy of Sciences. Their 1995 
review drew representatives from academic, institutional, and 
industrial groups conducting global change research; the results of 
this 1995 review are described on pages 15-17.<p>

Proposed and existing agency programs within the USGCRP are 
evaluated based on (i) their relevance and contribution to the overall 
USGCRP goal and objectives, including the needs of decision makers; 
(ii) scientific merit as documented by peer review; (iii) readiness for 
implementation and likelihood of early results; (iv) potential for 
and&#47;or progress toward meeting program milestones; (v) agency 
approval for inclusion in the USGCRP; and (vi) conformity to data and 
information management policies. The framework and evaluation 
criteria are an essential part of the program and budget development 
strategy of the USGCRP. They provide the structure through which 
the USGCRP evaluates and develops (i) essential, high priority 
national and international components of the USGCRP in each fiscal 
year; and (ii) the recommended budgets to support those critical 
components.<p>

In addition to USGCRP review of the overall set of agency research 
programs, each agency is responsible for the review of individual 
projects within its programs. These reviews are almost exclusively 
based on an external peer-review process, which is deemed an 
important means of ensuring continued program quality.<p>

<body>


<h3>About the National Science and Technology Council</h3><p>

President Clinton established the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) by Executive Order on November 23, 1993. This cabinet-level council is the principal means for the President to coordinate science, space, and technology policies across the 



Federal Government. The NSTC acts as a "virtual" agency for science and technology to coordinate the diverse parts of the Federal research and development enterprise. The NSTC is chaired by the President. Membership consists of the Vice President, the Ass



istant to the President for Science and Technology, Cabinet Secretaries and Agency Heads with significant science and technology responsibilities, and other senior White House officials.<p>

An important objective of the NSTC is the establishment of clear national goals for Federal science and technology investments in areas ranging from information technology and health research, to improving transportation systems and strengthening fundamen



tal research. The Council prepares research and development strategies that are coordinated across Federal agencies to form an investment package that is aimed at accomplishing multiple national goals.<p>

To obtain additional information regarding the NSTC, contact the NSTC Executive Secretariat at 202-456-6100 (voice).

<CENTER><H2>INTRODUCTION 
<a name="intro1"></a>
</H2></CENTER><H3>Overview 
</H3><P>The Federal government supports a diverse array of research and  
development (R&amp;D), providing the scientific and technical information  
needed to address environment and natural resources issues from global  
climate change to toxic waste remediation. Research that is critical to making  
sound decisions regarding air and water quality, ecosystem protection, and  
natural disaster reduction is supported by many Federal agencies through  
extramural funding to colleges, universities, and other research institutions,  
as well as through research conducted at Federal laboratories. 
<P>Agencies that have major R&amp;D programs in environment and 
natural  resources include the National Science Foundation (NSF), the  
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Department of Commerce's  
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (DOC/NOAA), the  
Department of the Interior (DOI), the Department of Energy (DOE), the  
Department of Agriculture (USDA), the National Institute of Environmental  
Health Sciences (NIEHS), the National Aeronautics and Space  
Administration (NASA), and the Department of Defense (DoD). 
<P>In 1994, an estimated $5.1 billion was spent by the Federal government on  
environment and natural resources R&amp;D. More than 50% was used to  
support R&amp;D efforts outside the Federal agencies (see Figure 1). The  
remainder provided resources for research conducted at Federal laboratories. 
<P>

<p>
 Figure 1. FY94 Distribution of Federal Funding for 
Environment and Natural Resources R&amp;D 

<P>Science funding agencies such as NSF, NIEHS, and NASA have a larger  
portion of their funds devoted to extramural research than agencies with  
resource management functions such as USDA, DOC, and DOI, or regulatory  
functions such as EPA. However, some of these agencies (e.g., EPA) are  
shifting to focus more of their funding on extramural research grant  
programs. 

<p>

<a name="intro3"></a>
<H3>Competition, Review, and Evaluation
</H3><P>The U.S. Government has a general policy of encouraging full, 
open,
and fair  competition for research supported by Federal funding (e.g., the
Competition  in Contracting Act of 1985).  Competition helps ensure that
the highest  quality, most cost-effective research projects are selected
for funding.
<P>For example, the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC)  
Committee
on Environment and Natural Resources (CENR) strategy <i> Preparing for 
the 
Future
through Science and Technology: An Agenda for  Environment and Natural 
Resources
Research</i> (March 1995) states  "...improve the quality and effectiveness of
their R&amp;D programs by increasing  the use of external peer and merit
review, increasing the use of open  competition to award funds, and by
strengthening their extramural academic  research programs where feasible."
Indeed, the FY96 and FY97 R&amp;D guidance  to the agencies from the Office
of Management and Budget (OMB) and the  Office of Science and Technology
Policy (OSTP) identifies competitive  selection, merit review, and peer
evaluation as broad R&amp;D policy principles.
<P>Merit review for research proposals by Federal agencies includes the
 following:
<OL><LI>Scientific peer review for technical soundness
<LI>Evaluation of the relevance of the proposal to agency programs and
 priorities, societal needs, and policy goals.
</OL><P>In addition to prospective merit review, Federally funded research
also  undergoes performance reviews which are conducted to evaluate the 
progress, contributions, responsiveness, and relevance of ongoing or  
completed
R&amp;D activities.

<center><H2>OPPORTUNITIES BY AGENCY
</H2></center><P>This section describes the types of environment and 
natural 
resources
R&amp;D  currently supported by Federal agencies, potential opportunities
for funding,  and points of contact. This <i>Program Guide</i> is meant to 
provide
the reader  with an understanding of the scope of federally funded 
environment
and  natural resources research opportunities. While every effort was made
to  ensure completeness in the programs described here, there may be 
additional
 programs that are not included. The CENR intends to update this 
<i>Guide</i> 
routinely, and add any programs that have been omitted.
<P>For additional or more detailed information on the programs described
 below, the reader should communicate with the point of contact listed. 
 Further, agencies are required to advertise their research opportunities
prior  to issuing a solicitation in the <i>Commerce Business Daily,   </i> 
which is
available  electronically. Some agencies, such as NASA, advertise 
solicitations
via the  Internet. These on-line sources can be accessed through the
White House Home Page <A 
HREF="http://www.whitehouse.gov">(http://www.whitehouse.gov)</A>.
<P>Although many of the deadlines for submitting FY96 proposals have 
passed,
 they have been left here for informational purposes. Many of the research
 areas noted for 1996 will continue in 1997.

<P>
<H2>National Science Foundation
</H2><P>The National Science Foundation (NSF) supports fundamental 
research
 across the entire range of science and engineering disciplines. NSF does
not  operate laboratories. All of its funding is devoted to extramural 
research.
NSF  makes approximately 20,000 awards per year -- through 
competitive
merit  review -- to more than 2,000 colleges, universities, and other
research  institutions in all parts of the U.S.
<P>NSF supports research and education to enhance understanding of the  
complex
dynamics among natural and human systems; to generate  knowledge needed 
to
preserve, manage, and enhance the environment; and  to support national 
and
international policymaking activities.
<P>NSF seeks to draw on the participation of relevant science and 
engineering
 disciplines to promote interdisciplinary research necessary for improved
 understanding of complex environmental and global change processes. To
 accomplish these goals, NSF environment and natural resources activities
 involve support of basic disciplinary research, focused interdisciplinary
 research, and a broad range of educational and outreach functions that cut
 across the entire portfolio of environment and natural resources scientific
 interests.
<P>
<A name="nsf1"></A>
<H3>Types of Environment and Natural Resources Research Supported
</H3><P>Examples of the types of research that NSF contributes to the U.S.
Global  Change Research Program (USGCRP) follow: Research on climate 
processes
 and interactions, and seasonal to interannual variability; monitoring and
 research on ozone depletion and ultraviolet (UV) radiation; modeling of
 oceanic, atmospheric, vegetative, economic, and other components of the
 whole Earth system as well as research to integrate those components in
an  integrated assessment framework; research on ecological diversity, 
ecosystem
 dynamics, and terrestrial ecology; and research on the human dimensions
of  global change, including research on social dynamics, human interactions,
 and influences, as well as research on policy sciences and options for
 responding to environmental change.
<P>NSF has also been serving as a major catalyst for related research on
other  important environment and natural resources issues within the 
context
of  the CENR. NSF actively supports research activities across a broad 
spectrum
 of scientific disciplines to address issues related to the preservation,
 management, and enhancement of the environment. Several specific areas 
of
 interest include air quality, biodiversity and ecosystem dynamics, 
environmental technology, natural disaster reduction, water and watersheds
 research, and risk assessment.
<P>The Directorates for Biological Sciences (BIO); Education and Human  
Resources
(EHR); Engineering (ENG); Geosciences (GEO); Mathematics and  Physical 
Sciences
(MPS); and Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences (SBE);  and the Office
of Polar Programs (OPP) all contribute to environment and  natural resources
activities. International research activities can be supported  by any of
the directorates; those involving collaboration with international  partners
are also eligible for support from the Division of International  Programs
(INT). The combined environment and natural resources activities  seek to
encourage scientific understanding of our environment through  support of
unsolicited investigator-initiated research and activities in the  following
categories:
<UL><LI><STRONG>Understanding Fundamental Processes</STRONG>: 
The bulk of
environment and  natural resources support helps fund research efforts 
focused
on  understanding fundamental processes involved in physical system, 
biological
 system, and human system interactions.  These analyses might include any
 disciplinary or interdisciplinary effort that seeks to deepen or broaden
 understanding of different elements or interactions of a particular system.
 Research that focuses on the interactions among those systems is also 
supported. Several examples of environment and global change basic research
 focused on the understanding of fundamental processes include ecosystem
 dynamics, cell function, atmospheric chemistry, political or economic
 institutional processes, chemical and biogeochemical dynamics, Earth system
 history, solar influences, and the study of the interactions responsible
for the  ozone hole. Many other fields of research contribute to the
understanding of  fundamental processes.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>Observation Systems and Data Management</STRONG>: 
These activities
include  long-term observation platforms supported by NSF (e.g., long-term
ecological  research sites, the National Center for Ecological Analysis and
Synthesis,  seismic networks, ocean lines, and other facilities and activities
to promote  the continuous and continued collection of relevant data sets).
In order to  support and facilitate environment and global change research
by individual  scientists, NSF also provides funds for the maintenance and
management of  important databases such as climatic data bases at the 
National
Center for  Atmospheric Research (NCAR) and other networks or activities
to encourage  access, maintenance, and sharing of data.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>Modeling Activities</STRONG>: To enhance 
understanding of Earth,
biological,  and human systems and processes, NSF also supports diverse 
modeling
 activities. This emphasis includes research on modeling approaches, model
 enhancement, and model integration. Examples of modeling activities  
supported
by NSF include economic modeling, vegetative modeling, weather  and 
climate
modeling, geochemical modeling and methods and models for  an integrated
assessment  program.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>Analysis and Development of Mitigation, Harm Avoidance, 
and 
Response Options</STRONG>: This category includes research and analyses 
of
possible  human and technological responses to environmental changes. 
Examples
of  activities in this category include the study of economic evaluation
and  impact methodologies, mitigation and risk assessment approaches, 
policy
 sciences analysis to evaluate the tools and options for decisionmakers,
and  engineered technologies to avoid, alleviate, or minimize environmental
 harms.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>Education and Outreach</STRONG>: In addition to 
research activities,
NSF also  seeks to advance science education and human resource 
capabilities.
NSF  supports science education and science literacy related to the 
environment
 using a diverse set of approaches. Other programs supported by EHR  
encourage
participation by traditionally under-represented groups and  provision of
quality science education experiences for all students at all levels.   Among
these are the science, mathematics, and engineering programs that  support
graduate and undergraduate studies as well as programs designed to  enhance
elementary, secondary, and informal educational opportunities.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>International Research Infrastructure</STRONG>: NSF 
environment
and natural  resources programs also involve international collaborations,
participation in  international scientific field experiments, research 
networks,
and  coordination activities. For information on funding activities through
INT,  request NSF Publication 96-14. In addition, NSF has been the lead 
agency
for  the Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research (IAI) within
the U.S.  For additional information, contact Dr. Paul Filmer, IAI Program
Director, at  703.306.1515.
</UL><P><A name="nsf2"></A>
<H3>Research Funding Opportunities
</H3><P>General information on NSF-supported environment-related 
activities
is  available in the <i>NSF Guide to Programs</i> (NSF Publication 95-138). 
The
<i>NSF  Grant Proposal Guide</i> (NSF Publication 95-27) provides 
necessary 
forms
and information for the submission of proposals. Copies of either publication
can  be requested by calling the NSF Publication Unit at 703.306.1130, or

<P>
<H2>Environmental Protection Agency
</H2><P>To fulfill its statutory mandates, the Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA)  is involved in a broad range of environmental science 
activities. EPA's R&amp;D  program provides the scientific and technical 
basis for the Agency's  decisionmaking, and complements the more 
fundamental research  supported by agencies such as NIEHS and NSF.
<P>
<A name="epa1"></A>
<H3>Types of Environment and Natural Resources Research Supported
</H3><UL><LI><STRONG>Risk Assessment:</STRONG> EPA develops 
risk assessment methodologies for  both human health and ecological 
systems, as well as the complex data  needed to reduce scientific 
uncertainties 
for decisions. The human health  research programs provide critical support 
needed to develop more refined  assessments of pollutant effects on human 
health and more realistic exposure  estimates. The focus of EPA's ecological 
risk assessment program is to reduce  uncertainty at the watershed, regional, 
and national scales through  monitoring, modeling, and assessment 
activities.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>Ecology:</STRONG> EPA is developing place-based 
ecosystem protection  approaches for more effective management of 
ecosystems in the Pacific  Northwest, the Great Lakes, and South Florida; is 
developing methodologies  for both ecological and biodiversity risk 
assessment; and conducts research to  develop ecological indicators of 
resource condition.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>Monitoring and Data Management:</STRONG> The 
Agency develops, evaluates,  and demonstrates a variety of new field 
instrumentation for monitoring and  sampling of pollutants and 
environmental conditions in the atmosphere,  surface waters, sub-surface, 
biota, and human microenvironments.  EPA has  developed and manages the 
Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) - an  on-line 
database used 
world-wide for human health risk assessment  information. EPA focuses on 
user-friendly distribution of data to the state and  local governments and 
other industrial and community groups.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>Environmental Technology:</STRONG> In addition to 
applied R&amp;D to support  specific environmental programs, EPA's 
Technology Research, Development,  and Demonstration Program, which 
includes both engineering and policy  studies, is shifting its emphasis to 
pollution prevention. This research  addresses all media and includes the full 
range of prevention, monitoring,  control, and remediation technologies and 
approaches.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>Socioeconomic Research:</STRONG> The Agency has 
increased its emphasis on  socioeconomic R&amp;D directed at accurate 
valuation methods, integrated  assessment tools, and data and methods for 
addressing environmental justice  issues. These efforts emphasize 
information on consequences of changes in  environmental regulations to 
the size, structure, and performance of  economic markets and impacts on 
individual behavior. Another research  focus is the continued development 
and appropriate use of such methods  (e.g., contingent valuation) for 
ascribing 
value to environmental services.

<H3>Research Funding Opportunities
</H3><P>EPA has made a major commitment to include the best scientists 
from this  country's universities, colleges, and research institutions in its 
research  program. The EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD) has 
made  major changes during the past 2 years, and as part of those changes has 
started  the Science to Achieve Results (STAR) Program, consisting of the 
following  three components:
<OL><LI><i>Focused Requests for Applications (RFAs)</i> are targeted at 
specific  
research topics defined by the ORD Strategic Plan that address the science  
needs of the EPA program offices and regions. This component supports  
investigators from universities and other not-for-profit research institutions  
who complement the expertise in ORD laboratories. A portion of the program  
is conducted jointly with other Federal agencies.
<P>
<LI><i>The Exploratory Research Grants Program</i> provides support for 
(i)  
investigator-initiated grants in broad areas such as environmental chemistry  
and physics, and health and ecological effects of pollution that are not 
covered  
by the RFAs; and (ii) Early Career Research Awards, which recognize  
outstanding scientists and engineers at the onset of their careers.
<P>
<LI><i>The Graduate Fellowship Program</i> provides support for masters 
and  
doctoral students in environmental sciences and engineering. This program  
supports development of the Nation's environment and technology base that  
will provide the expertise needed to address environmental concerns in the  
future. This program is announced nationally and provides broad  
opportunities to apply. Applicants are judged by external peer reviewers and  
are selected based on their record and potential for the future.
</OL><P>Applicants for STAR grants must propose relevant research based 
on  excellent science, as determined through external peer review by experts  
drawn from throughout the national scientific community. Information on  
STAR competitive research grants is available from the EPA at the following  
address:

grants in  research categories of special interest to the EPA mission. Some of 
the  opportunities listed below had closing dates that have already past, but 
are  included to provide a description of the Agency's areas of interest and 
contact  points for those areas. It is likely that many of these will be 
ongoing

<P>
<H2>Department of the Interior
</H2><P>As the Nation's principal conservation agency, the Department of
the Interior  (DOI) has responsibility for most of the nation's nationally
owned public  lands and natural resources. This includes fostering sound
use of the Nation's  land and water resources and assesses energy and mineral
resources.
<P>

<A name="doi1"></A>
<H3>Types of Environment and Natural Resources Research Supported
</H3><P>The major focus of DOI R&amp;D efforts is to provide the scientific
basis for  natural and cultural resource policy and management decisions:
<UL><LI><STRONG>Biodiversity and Ecosystems:</STRONG> R&amp;D is 
supported
to provide information  on the abundance, distribution, and health of 
biological
resources and to  develop predictive capabilities of the interactive processes
that regulate and  influence biodiversity and ecosystem integrity. This 
includes
the functioning  of biological systems and their relationship and 
interdependence
to physical,  chemical, geologic, and hydrologic factors and their response
to human and  natural environmental stresses through research focused on
species,  population, and ecosystem research. Inventory, monitoring, and
 conservation of living resources and their ecosystems, as well as research
 toward their sustainable development are high priority programs.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>Global Change Research:</STRONG> Research is supported 
to improve
 understanding of the processes associated with terrestrial-oceanic and
 terrestrial-atmospheric exchanges of water, energy, carbon, and nutrients;
to  describe, analyze, and monitor past and contemporary states, changes,
and  processes in the Earth's physical, biological, geological, chemical,
and  ecological systems; to facilitate access to and use of global change
information  for policy decisions, resource management, research, and 
education;
and to  develop the ability to predict the effects of global change on public
lands and  natural resources.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>Natural Disasters Reduction:</STRONG> Basic research is 
conducted
on geologic  (earthquakes, volcanoes, and landslides) and hydrologic hazards
(floods,  droughts, subsidence, and dam safety). DOI research also provides
hazard and  risk assessments on national, international, regional, urban,
and local scales  and develops monitoring networks and geographic 
information
systems. The  Department is also responsible for transferring technology
needed to enhance  professional skills and expand technical capacity for
mitigation, preparedness,  emergency response, and recovery; and the 
organization
and conduct of post- disaster investigations.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>Geological, Mineral, and Energy:</STRONG> Resource 
assessments
and  environmental  studies of the ecological, economic, and social factors
 involved in the development and management of offshore oil, gas, and  
mineral
resources are supported. DOI research includes development of new  mineral
recovery concepts that will safeguard workers and prevent  environmental
harm, and research to conserve resources through recycling  and preventing
environmental problems or damage to the infrastructure.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>Toxic Substances and Hazardous and Solid Waste 
Research:</STRONG>
DOI  conducts research primarily directed toward improvements of
waste-disposal and clean-up practices and the mitigation of contamination 
problems 
by
 addressing major types of contamination, by developing new methods to  
reduce
the volume and toxicity of processing wastes from mining and  minerals
operations, and by assessing the impact of contamination on fish,  wildlife,
and the environment.  DOI also conducts research to understand the  fate,
transport, and effects of contaminants through ecosystems and the role of
 biological processes in the control and mediation of chemical speciation;
and  the development of risk-based action levels of contaminants.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>Air Quality Research:</STRONG> These studies collect data 
on
air quality  conditions and trends in national parks and wilderness areas;
effects of air  pollution on resources; the pollutants responsible for 
resource
damage;  sources of pollutants; and the effect of reducing emissions at these
sources.   Present monitoring and research programs are focused on acid
deposition,  ozone, and fine particles as they affect visibility including
understanding and  predicting the transport and chemical transformation of
air pollutants.

<P>U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)<br>
<P><EM>National Cooperative Geologic Mapping Program (NCGMP)</EM>
<P>The external research program of the NCGMP consists of two 
parts -- State
 Geological Survey Mapping (STATEMAP) and Education Geologic Mapping  
(EDMAP).
Funding announcements for both of these programs are issued  each year. A
competitive proposal process is used to distribute funds. Federal  funding
in both programs is equally matched by the recipients of the  cooperative
agreements. The cooperative agreements meet guidelines set out  in the 
annual
announcements, which also detail the type of products required  for the 
program.
Panels of State geologists, geology professors, and NCGMP  staff review the
proposals and make funding recommendations to the  NCGMP.
<UL><LI><i>STATEMAP</i> is only open to state geologists of the 50 States. 
The
State  Geological Surveys, in concert with a State geologic mapping advisory
 committee, typically focus their requests on environmental and societally
 important issues and, to a lesser degree, economic issues such as 
infrastructure minerals, economic mineral deposits, and oil and gas  
resources.
Coordination with ongoing studies by USGS geologists is  encouraged and 
many
of the STATEMAP projects involve NCGMP  geologists.<STRONG>

<P>
<LI><i>EDMAP</i> is open to any U.S. college or university that has a
graduate-level geoscience program. Emphasis is on support of masters and 
doctoral
 candidate work that has an element of geologic mapping in the United States.
 Awards are based on a competitive proposal system and the proposed areas
of  study must be coordinated with either the State Geological Survey
NCGMP priorities.  This program, started in FY96, has an anticipated funding
of at least 25 awards  of a maximum of $15,000 for each student.  Geologic
maps produced by the  graduate students will be published either through
the NCGMP or through  the State Geological Survey, and the geologic map 
data incorporated into the  National Geologic Map Data Base.

<P><EM><i>Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program (EHRP)</i></EM>
<P>The External Grants program of the EHRP issues two annual 
announcements that describe research opportunities in the External Grants 
Program and the  Regional Seismic Networks Program. The grants 
component is 
fully
 competitive, while the regional seismic network component is a closed
 competition between universities that have developed seismic monitoring
 networks in seismically active areas of concern to the EHRP. The regional
 seismic networks are awarded as cooperative agreements because of the  
strong input from the USGS in data collection and analysis.
<P>This program funds a limited number of unsolicited proposals. It makes
the  vast majority of its awards competitively. In FY95, 150 competitive
grants  were awarded, and three unsolicited non-competitive awards were 
made.
No  unsolicited proposals were funded under the Regional Seismic Networks
 Program. Grant applications are made according to the rules published in
the  annual announcements.
<P>EHRP sponsors a wide range of studies that can be applied to reduce 
earthquake risk in the United States. Funding decisions are made by six 
regional panels. Each panel sponsors research aimed at any of five program
 elements: 1) Evaluating national and regional hazard and risk; 2) evaluating
 urban hazard and risk; 3) understanding earthquake processes; 4) providing
 real-time hazard and risk assessment; and 5) providing geologic hazards
 information services. The program emphasizes certain geographic regions
 based upon specific earthquake hazards and associated societal risks in
them.
<P>In response to guidance from Congress, EHRP places high priority on
 investigations in four areas where large populations are exposed to 
significant
 seismic risk: Southern California, Northern California, the Pacific 
Northwest,
 and the Central United States. Studies in other earthquake-prone regions
of  the United States are also sponsored by the National-International Panel.
In  addition, the Process, Laboratory, and Theoretical Panel supports basic
and  applied research that can lead to new tools for earthquake hazard 
reduction
 nationwide. Each proposal should be addressed to a specific regional peer
review panel, as  listed below:
<UL><LI><STRONG>Southern 
California</STRONG> - From the Carizzo 
Plain
south to the
 international border with Mexico
<LI><STRONG>Northern California</STRONG> - From
Cape Mendocino south to Parkfield,  including the San Francisco Bay area
<LI><STRONG>Pacific 
Northwest</STRONG> - Washington, Oregon, and 
California
north
of Cape  Mendocino (Cascadia) and Alaska
<LI><STRONG>Central United States</STRONG> - The
New Madrid seismic zone and  surrounding areas
<LI><STRONG>National-International</STRONG> - All 
earthquake-prone
geographic areas not 
included in the above four regions above
<LI><STRONG>Processes, Laboratory, and
Theoretical</STRONG> - Basic and applied research  
having the potential
earthquake
for hazard reduction in many geographic  areas.

<P>National Biological Service (NBS)
<P>NBS works with others to provide the scientific understanding and 
technologies needed to support the sound management and conservation of 
the Nation's biological resources. NBS develops scientific and statistically
 reliable methods and protocols to assess the status and trends of the
Nation's  biological resources. The agency uses tools from the biological,
physical, and  social sciences to understand the causes of biological and
ecological trends and  to predict the ecological consequences of management
practices. NBS  develops and uses technologies to synthesize, analyze, and
disseminate  biological and ecological information.
<P>
<P><i>Species at Risk Initiative (SAR)</i>
<P>SAR develops scientific information on the status and trends of sensitive
 species, particularly with respect to the relationship of species abundance
and  distribution to habitat conditions, stresses, etc.  The initiative 
provides
an  opportunity for investigators to participate through research, inventory,
and  monitoring activities to fill biological information gaps and to provide
 resource managers, regulators, and private landowners definable scientific
 information from which prudent decisions can be made regarding the  
management
of biological resources. Successful SAR projects lead to  conservation options
and actions that reduce the need for listing species as  threatened or
endangered.

<P>Small awards are available (only to NBS scientists in FY96) for research
on  vulnerable populations, with the goal of improving the ability to predict
 when populations may decline to the point where protection is necessary
or  to diagnose the causes of observed declines. Most awards are made on
species  or groups of species accorded high priority by DOI resource managers.
 Priorities are updated annually through DOI's Bureau Information Needs 
Process, and current priorities are included in announcements.

 Minerals Management Service. These studies assess the effects of offshore
oil  and gas development on the marine biota of the Outer Continental Shelf
 (OCS). Studies target benthic biota, marine mammals, coastal environments,
 and commercial and sport fisheries. Investigations have also involved  
sublethal
toxicity analyses, assessments of physical and chemical  oceanographic 
regimes,
and seabird distribution and abundance estimations.

<P>
<P><EM>State Partnerships</EM>
<P>One of the key themes in the development of NBS was the concept of a
 "national partnership" among the broad diversity of agencies and 
individuals involved in biological science for natural resource management. 
States play key roles in both natural resource science and management. The 
NBS State Partnership initiative seeks to enhance and strengthen working 
relationships between NBS and States. The initiative seeks to build upon 
existing relationships -- many of them strong and of long 
duration -- between elements of NBS and State fish and 
game agencies, heritage programs, natural
 history museums and biological surveys, and other agencies. NBS also seeks
 to expand its ties to include States with which it does not have historic
ties,  and to develop relationships with a broader range of agencies than
was  historically the case.
<P>In FY96, approximately $450,000 is available through this initiative.
About  half the funding will be provided to States, with the remainder being
 provided to NBS units for activities that complement State efforts.<BR>

<P>Minerals Management Service (MMS)
<P>The MMS uses a number of vehicles to announce research opportunities.
 Most research projects are competed in a restricted fashion and are 
advertised
 in the <i>Commerce Business Daily</i> -- inviting 
proposals on 
narrow, 
well-defined topics. While MMS does accept unsolicited proposals, few are 
funded
 due to limited resources. In the last 2 years, the use of Broad Area
 Announcements (BAAs) has been employed. This procurement mechanism  
is widely
advertised through the <i>Commerce Business Daily</i> and requires 
submission of
a short "white paper" on proposed research responsive to a  series of broad
research topics.
<P>
<P><EM>Environmental Studies Program (ESP)</EM>
<P>Research is supported to provide information needed to predict, assess,

 environments. Studies are supported on the fate of potential OCS-related
 pollutants (e.g., oil, noise, drilling muds and cuttings, products of fuel
 combustion) in the marine environment and atmosphere. Large-scale  
oceanographic
circulation studies and modeling are supported to provide  information for
oil spill trajectory analyses.  Socioeconomic research is  supported to 
develop
an understanding of how OCS activities affect  community composition and
infrastructure, employment, and culture. FY96  opportunities follow:

<H2>Department of Commerce/National Oceanic and Atmospheric  
Administration
</H2><P>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) 
mission
 includes two equally important components: 1) Promoting global  
environmental
stewardship to conserve and wisely manage the Nation's  marine and coastal
resources; and 2) describing, monitoring, and predicting  changes in the
Earth's environment.
<P>
<A name="doc1"></A>
<H3>Types of Environment and Natural Resources Research Supported
</H3><UL><LI><STRONG>Long-Term Monitoring of the Oceans and
Atmosphere:</STRONG>  NOAA  provides both satellite and <i>in situ</i>
observations,
data, and information  necessary to understand the Earth system, to assess
changes to that system,  and to predict future changes. NOAA's polar-orbiting
and geostationary  satellites provide continuous, long-term, quality
environmental observations  of the high seas, upper and lower atmosphere,
and land areas to sustain  major science programs involving global 
monitoring,
sustainable  development, climate change, coastal and marine resources, and
natural  disasters. NOAA data and observations will comprise a significant
 component of the U.S. contribution to an international global observing
 system, for which the CENR Task Force provides the U.S. Secretariat.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>Forecasting and Predicting the Future State of the
Atmosphere:</STRONG>  Air quality research focuses on gaining a 
fundamental
understanding of the  atmospheric processes that must be characterized for
credible and useful  predictions. The primary issues that NOAA addresses
are surface-level ozone,  acidic deposition, and visibility. NOAA addresses
two important research  aspects of global change -- climate 
change and
ozone depletion. NOAA has a  significant role in operational observation,
research, prediction, and  information management efforts for the national
global change effort.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>Social and Economic Sciences Research:</STRONG> This 
area of
study focuses on  the human dimensions of global change and the 
relationship
of near-term  climate forecasts and their impact on the economy. NOAA 
provides
forecasts  and warnings of various natural hazards related to the atmosphere
and  ocean, to better understanding of the underlying environmental 
processes
 and predictive methodologies of natural hazards. NOAA provides river and
 flood and hydrological forecasts and warnings for the protection of life
and  property.  Research is geared to advanced water quantity forecasting.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>Monitoring Renewable Marine Resource Base and Their 
Attendant
 Uses: </STRONG>NOAA pursues a multidisciplinary approach to enhance 
the
ability of  scientists and managers to identify, understand, and manage
anthropogenic  impacts to marine ecosystems against a background of natural
system  variability.  NOAA's social and economic sciences research focuses
on the  social and economic impacts of fisheries management and damage 
assessment methodologies.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>Coastal and Marine Observations, Modeling, Assessment, 
Ecosystem
 Prediction, and Information Management:</STRONG> Ongoing research 
includes
remote  sensing, modeling of oceanic and near-shore processes, developing
key  indicators of coastal and marine ecosystem health, effects of cumulative
 impacts on coastal and marine environments, and environmental valuation
 and human dimensions research.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>Research on and Management of Marine Ecosystems and 
Their
 Biodiversity:</STRONG> Research in this area includes surveying and 
monitoring
the  abundance of and trends in marine biota; measuring and evaluating the
 impacts of pollution, exotic species, and habitat degradation on marine
 biodiversity and ecosystem integrity; and understanding and generating 
models to simulate large-scale marine ecosystems.  NOAA's role extends to
 the restoration of degraded ecosystems and establishment and management
 of marine and estuarine sanctuaries and reserves.
</UL><P>
<A name="doc2"></A>
<H3>Research Funding Opportunities
</H3><P>Coastal Ocean Program
<P>The Coastal Ocean Program (COP) Office regularly issues funding  
announcements
to support multi-investigator, multidisciplinary projects of  modeling, 
process
studies, observations, and synthesis. The goal of these  efforts is to improve
understanding and management of coastal and living  resources, particularly
in the context of integrated resource management, and  to improve 
predictions
of extreme weather and ocean conditions. These AOs  are distributed widely,
electronically and otherwise, to Government agencies,  academia, and to the
general scientific and management communities; they  are also posted on the
COP Home Page <A HREF="http://hpcc.noaa.gov/cop/cop-
home.html">http://hpcc.noaa.gov/cop/cop-home.html</A>.  Detailed
instructions
are included in each announcement on  project goals, how to apply and 
application
requirements, and points of  contact for additional information. The COP
Office does not accept unsolicited  proposals.
<P>Coastal and marine ecological research studies focus on regional-scale
 systems, investigate high-priority coastal ecosystem issues, and develop
tools  and information for use in management and policy decisions. These
projects  focus on understanding the factors that influence fish population
levels; on  understanding the cumulative effects of multiple stressors on
coastal  ecosystems; and on ecosystem-specific issues. The general life-cycle
designs of  the projects are 4 to 6 years, and are intended to develop a
fundamental  understanding of ecosystems or processes; relate that 
understanding
to  decisionmakers; and develop useful methods or tools for application of
that  scientific understanding. Present and planned efforts follow:
<UL><LI><i>Pacific Northwest Coastal Ecosystem Study</i> will develop 
and
evaluate  ecosystem models that relate the effects of land use, ocean 
dynamics,
and  natural and anthropogenic stressors on coastal-dependent resources.
<P>
<LI><i>The Bering Sea Fisheries Oceanography Coordinated Investigation
(BS- FOCI)</i> is being conducted both to define the stock structure of Bering
Sea  pollock through investigation of basin circulation and to reduce 
uncertainty
 in pollock stock forecasts. Pollock is currently the largest single-species
fishery  in the world. This study focuses on larval transport patterns in
relation to  oceanographic phenomena, DNA studies, and numerical 
modeling.
COP will  extend this effort to an additional study on the linkage among
environmental  factors, recruitment, growth rates, predation, and distribution
of key  ecosystem components. This planned Bering Sea Ecosystem Study 
expansion
 will complement the ongoing fisheries oceanography project by developing
a  focus on ecosystem-wide resource dynamics.
<P>
<LI><i>Georges Bank,</i>  off the New England coast, COP-sponsored 
research
is  examining the ecosystem characteristics that affect efforts to restore
cod and  haddock populations, including the feeding behavior of predators
and the  availability and distribution of food for commercial species. This
Georges  Bank Predation and Ecosystem Structure Study ties closely with the
joint  NSF/NOAA Georges Bank Global Ecosystems Dynamics (GLOBEC) 
study. 
 GLOBEC is a large multidisciplinary, multiyear oceanographic effort to 
predict
 changes in the distribution and abundance of other key species as a result
of  changes in their physical and biotic environment, as well as to anticipate
how  their populations might respond to climate change. The effort includes
broad- scale surveys of the entire Bank, process studies, and modeling.
<P>
<LI><i>The South Atlantic Bight Recruitment Experiment (SABRE)</i> is 
focusing
 on understanding the relationship between environmental variation and
 recruitment of Atlantic menhaden, the most economically important fishery
 in the South Atlantic Bight, as well as other estuarine-dependent species.
 Estuarine ecosystems are known to influence not only the productivity of
 commercial and recreational resources but also the movements of species,
 nutrients, and toxic contaminants. The COP plans to implement a second
 program -- the Land Use Coastal Ecosystem 
Study -- to 
develop better
data and  information to link anticipated changes in human populations and
land-use  activities to the transport, fate, and biological effects of 
nutrients
and  contaminants; the ecological health of coastal rivers, estuaries, and
near- coastal areas; and productivity of living marine resources.
<P>
<LI><i>The Gulf of Mexico Nutrient Enhanced Coastal Ocean Productivity
 Study (NECOP)</i> has researched the physical, chemical, biological, and  
geological
processes that relate anthropogenic nutrient enrichment in the
 Mississippi/Atchafalaya River outflows to productivity in the Gulf of 
Mexico.
  NECOP has demonstrated that seasonal hypoxia is driven by river nutrient
 load, and a preliminary water quality computer model has been developed
 that predicts the response of primary productivity and dissolved oxygen
to  changes in nutrient loadings.
<P>
<LI><i>Florida Bay Study</i> is part of a larger interagency effort to restore
water  quality and ecosystem integrity to all of South Florida.  COP's Florida
Bay  research focuses on hydrographic linkages between the Bay and 
surrounding
 environments; atmospheric models of interactions between coastal and 
terrestrial weather systems; effects of long-term sea-level change; the 
nursery
 areas for coastal fisheries; modification of trophic relationships; and
 measurement of toxic contaminant levels in the Bay's water supplies.
<P>
<LI><i>Florida Keys Study</i> is developing stress indicators for key 
organisms
 and ecological processes and characterizing the effects of these stressors.
Both  human-induced and natural stressors will be studied with particular
 attention to overfishing, temperature, salinity, coastal storms, turbidity
and  sedimentation, and nutrients. The goal is to integrate this information
into a  process-oriented, ecosystem-level model useful for management.
<P>
<LI><i>Great Lakes Areas of Concern</i> have been identified by the 
International
 Joint Commission. Major factors in the degradation of the Great Lakes are
 nutrient enrichment, sedimentation, and toxic contamination. The planned
 NSF/COP program will develop and test strategies for assessing and  
predicting
impacts of multiple stressors with an evaluation of the importance  of non-
point
source pollution and episodic events, a model of ecosystem  behavior under
stress, and a management model for resource and habitat  issues.
<P>
<LI><i>The Patuxent River Ecosystem Study</i> will develop a framework 
for
 understanding, predicting, and managing the effects of multiple stressors
on  this degraded sub-estuary of the Chesapeake Bay. This study uses large
field  enclosures and laboratory experiments to test the combined effects
of major  contributing stressors, such as inorganic toxic compounds and
nutrients.
</UL><P>
<P>In addition, COP also is committed to developing technical support for
the  above studies. This includes providing for development of Coastal 
Remote
 Sensing, NOAA Coast Watch, Ocean Color, Coastal Forecast 
System - Great

ecosystem
change, and management in relation to ecosystem health.
<P>
<LI><i>The Land Use Coastal Ecosystem Study</i> is focused on establishing
a  functional understanding of environmental and socioeconomic trends that
 characterize the southeastern U.S. coastal region. It will fill critical
 information gaps that currently limit the identification of links between
 population and development trends, and their effects on the region's 
ecosystems. An announcement of funding opportunity is tentatively planned
 for FY97 to support compilation of extant South Carolina and Georgia coastal
 ecosystem data, identification of information gaps, and evaluation of the
 reliability of existing information and land use-ecosystem models.
<P>
<LI><i>The Great Lakes Regional Ecosystem Study,</i> which is being 
developed
 jointly with NSF, will focus on developing the tools and capabilities to
 improve management of coastal and Great Lakes ecosystems. An

training, and advisory service activities in order to increase the 
understanding, development, and wise use of ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes
 resources. The Secretary of Commerce, through NOAA, awards grants on a
 competitive basis for these purposes. One-third of the total grant award
must  come from non-Federal matching funds. The Federal appropriation for
FY95  was $54.3 million. The core of the program is carried out through a
network  of 29 Sea Grant College Programs, located in coastal and Great Lakes
states,  involving hundreds of universities nationwide. Applicants should
contact  the Sea Grant College Program in their area or the National Sea
Grant Office  in NOAA:

</BLOCKQUOTE><P>The National Sea Grant College Program supports a 
broad variety of 
research,
 education, and outreach activities related to the environment and natural
 resources, as described below.
<P>
<P><EM>Economic Leadership</EM>
<P>Sea Grant research, education, and advisory programs will produce the
 scientific knowledge and technology required to strengthen U.S. leadership
in  ocean and marine-related industries and to enhance the social, 
environmental, and economic well-being of coastal communities:
<UL><LI><i>Commercial Biotechnology</i> : Sea Grant contributes to the  
pharmaceutical,
chemical, and seafood industries by using the tools of  biotechnology. 
Research
and technology transfer programs develop  fundamental knowledge of 
natural
products and processes of marine  organisms to provide models for new 
commercial
products and new  approaches to industrial processing and bioprocessing.
<P>
<LI><i>Environmental Technology</i> : Sea Grant develops technologies 
that
 enhance environmental monitoring and assessment required to improve
 policymaking, to prevent and control pollution, and to restore polluted
areas.  Emphasis is on development of instrumentation and autonomous 
platforms
 for remote sensing and sampling of environmental features; technology and
 biotechnology that reduces or eliminates pollutant discharge in waste 
streams
 from seafood processing and aquaculture facilities; and processes that 
restore
 or remediate contaminated Great Lakes and coastal waters and sediments.
<P>
<LI><i>Ecosystem-Based Fisheries Management</i> : Assessing the status of 
fisheries resources and predicting the maximum catch for sustained  
profitability
must incorporate knowledge of ecosystems because traditional 
species-by-species
approaches lack the ability to account for ecosystem changes.  Sea Grant
research is focused on improving prediction of future fishery yields  through
development of better assessment tools to account for population  changes,
natural and human causes of change in the environment, and  species 
interaction.
<P>
<LI><i>Assessing the Social and Economic Aspects of Fisheries 
Management</i> 
 : Declining stocks have led to increased competition for available resources.
 Identification of feasible and effective management tools is a high priority.
 Sea Grant, through research and information transfer, will help fisheries
 managers, industry, and coastal communities understand the social,  
economic,
and legal impacts resulting from new management strategies.
<P>
<LI><i>Minimizing Bycatch</i> : Although the ecosystem implications of 
fishery
 bycatch are not understood, there may be waste caused by bycatch in some
of  the Nation's fisheries. In addition, there is the unwanted capture of
marine  mammals, endangered or threatened species, and commercial fish 
allocated
 to other fisheries. Sea Grant research continues to evaluate the efficacy
of  devices and practices designed to minimize bycatch, to improve the 
economic
 return to the industry by more effective harvest of target species, and
to  conserve protected species.
<P>
<LI><i>Enhancing Wild Stocks through Aquaculture</i> : Sea Grant 
research is
 focused on developing technology for using aquaculture to enhance natural
 populations of key aquatic species and on evaluating the technical and 
economic feasibility of this approach to stock restoration.
<P>
<LI><i>Improve Aquaculture Production Systems</i> : Coastal aquaculture  
industries
are confronted by limited water supply and quality, competition  from other
resource users, and a host of environmental obstacles. Sea Grant  research
will focus on aquaculture systems -- including offshore cages 
and  
pens,
high-density recirculating systems for onshore production, and practices
 required to reduce harmful impacts on coastal systems -- to 
provide
sustained  water quality and reduce nearshore conflicts.
<P>
<LI><i>Improve Aquaculture Husbandry</i> : Sea Grant research to 
improve brood
 stock and to meet the demand for reliable seed stocks targets genetics,
 physiology, disease diagnosis and control, nutrition, biotechnology, and
 systems management.
<P>
<LI><i>Seafood Quality and Safety</i> : Sea Grant works with seafood 
processors
to  develop techniques that will decrease costs and ensure high-quality 
products.
 These include implementation of efficient manufacturing processes, use of
 biochemical techniques to determine food quality, and education of  
consumers,
media, and public health officials on issues of seafood safety.
<P>
<LI><i>Seafood Processing Technology and Practices</i> : To remain 
competitive,
 domestic processors must increase efficiency through technological  
improvements
in processing, storage and transportation, and control of costs  through
improved worker efficiency and reduced accidents and lost time.   Priority
research topics include improving energy and processing efficiency in  
production
of fresh, frozen, and canned products; using automation in  production; and
improving technology for storing and transporting seafood.
<P>
<LI><i>Seafood Waste Management and Byproduct Recovery</i> : New 
techniques
 are required to cut down the wastes from processing, including those for
 increased byproduct recovery and for treatment of residual waters. Sea Grant
 develops technology for water conservation, waste management, effluent 
control, and recovery of byproducts such as enzymes, hormones, and  
aquacultural
feed.
<P>
<LI><i>Seafood Product Development</i> : Cultured and wild-harvested 
living
 marine resources provide opportunities to expand the market for seafood
by  developing new products and new product forms. Sea Grant researchers
 develop technology for producing high-quality products from under-utilized
 and mixed species, especially those with potential as replacements for 
depleted traditional species.
</UL><P>
<P><EM>Coastal Ecosystem Health and Environmental Safety</EM>
<P>Sea Grant strives to protect and enhance coastal ecosystem health as the
basis  for sustained growth of the coastal economy. Goals include improved
water  quality in coastal and Great Lakes ecosystems; high-quality habitats
for living  marine resources; a prosperous and environmentally sound 
seafood
 production and processing sector; and the integration of the physical, 
natural,
 and social sciences in the development of resource management policies:
<UL><LI><i>Contaminants</i> : Control of toxic substances and their 
elimination
from  the environment is a fundamental requirement for sustaining coastal
 ecosystems and their resources. Sea Grant emphasizes programs on  
contaminant
sources, trends, transport, fate, and effects.
<P>
<LI><i>Eutrophication</i> : Sea Grant researchers continue to investigate 
the
 causes and consequences of eutrophication in coastal and estuarine waters
 and to work with policymakers to identify cost-effective alternatives for
 control.
<P>
<LI><i>Biotoxins</i> :  Sea Grant, in close collaboration with public health
officials,  seeks to develop new methods for detecting these toxic compounds
and for  conducting the ecological research needed to predict and mitigate
outbreaks.
<P>
<LI><i>Habitat Loss and Modification</i> : Sea Grant, in collaboration with
 scientists from the National Marine Fisheries Service and regional and State
 resource agencies, seek a better understanding of the role estuarine and
 coastal habitats play in maintaining the health of living marine and Great
 Lakes resources.
<P>
<LI><i>Nonindigenous Species</i> : Using tools from engineering, 
biotechnology,
 ecology, and genetics, Sea Grant researchers help identify these organisms
and  their life cycle and ecological relationships. With outreach specialists,
Sea  Grant entrains Government and industry participation to develop cost-
effective, environmentally sound management strategies.
<P>
<LI><i>Coastal Development</i> : Population density and growth continues 
to
 place extraordinary demands on coastal communities. To help minimize the
 impact of coastal hazards, Sea Grant evaluates alternative policies (e.g.,
 building codes, legal provisions, economic incentives) and works closely
with  community leaders to assess their role in hazard reduction.
<P>
<LI><i>Human Dimensions of Coastal Change</i> : Sea Grant develops new  
approaches
for evaluating the effectiveness of policies and management  approaches to
coastal resources; assesses the usefulness of new tools and  management
approaches; analyzes and provides alternatives for the  resolution of 
conflicts
between coastal resource users; and assesses the capacity  of legal and
management schemes to deal with the issues critical to sustaining  coastal
ecosystem health and economic vitality.
</UL><P>
<P><EM>Education and Human Resources</EM>
<P>Sea Grant draws on its partnership of people, universities, government,
and  business to inform and educate citizens about the oceans and their
resources,  and to provide the advanced education required to ensure the
contributions  of a technically trained work force. Two strategic needs have
been identified -- the first for development of a highly 
trained work
force, and the other,  enhanced scientific and environmental education. To
address these needs,  Sea Grant focuses on four main audiences: 1) Precollege
teachers; 2) students  in undergraduate and graduate science, engineering,
and policy programs; 3)  adults whose occupations are tied to marine and
coastal resources  (commercial and recreational fishers, resource planners,
coastal developers,  government decisionmakers); and 4) the general public:
<UL><LI><i>Scientists and Engineers</i> : The Nation requires a reliable 
supply
of  qualified scientists and engineers in marine and coastal fields, and
Sea Grant  provides fellowships and research assistantships to highly 
qualified
students.  In addition, Sea Grant has initiated an industrial fellowship
program in  which qualified graduate students conduct research within a 
corporate
setting  under both academic and industrial supervision.
<p>
<LI><i>Resource Managers</i> : To meet the growing need for policy and 
resource
 managers at all levels of government, Sea Grant is increasing the number
of  decisionmakers with post-graduate education in natural resource  
management;
developing workshops that teach integrated ecosystem  management 
techniques
to local decisionmakers using advanced  technologies; and developing 
outreach
programs to address merging coastal  resource issues such as habitat 
restoration
and water pollution.
<P>
<LI><i>Technical Training</i> : With realignment of the U.S. economy 
away from
 primary manufacturing and natural resource extraction, a need exists to
focus  human resource development on the emerging industrial and service
sectors  related to marine industry. Sea grant develops training, retraining,
and job-to-work programs for employees of marine industries (such as boat
building,  marine electronics, aquaculture, and recreation and tourism).
<P>
<LI><i>Precollege Education</i> : The precollege (K-12) educational system
has not  met the U.S. need for informed graduates in science and 
mathematics.
During  the coming decade, Sea Grant educators will design, implement, and
assess  education programs to complement the national systemic initiatives
to  improve K-12 education. The goal is to provide current research-based
 marine and coastal information and curricula that reflect a multidisciplinary
 base, as well as a focus on issues relevant to local communities and 
ecosystems.
</UL><P>Sea Grant marine education has always stressed the natural 
sciences but
 included other disciplines such as the social sciences, humanities, and
the  arts. The main strategy for transferring this knowledge concentrates
on  teaching the teacher through training and direct outreach to classrooms.
  Through programs such as Operation Pathfinder, Sea Grant  makes special
 efforts to include minority teachers, teachers of minority students, and
 particularly students from economically disadvantaged backgrounds.
<P>
<P>National Undersea Research Program
<P>The National Undersea Research Program (NURP) provides support to  
scientists
and engineers to study biological, chemical, geological, and physical  
processes
in the world's oceans and lakes. The overall program is focused on  processes
and change over space and time. NURP assists researchers in  conducting 
what
are considered by NOAA and the marine community to be  crucial research 
programs.
To execute these programs, NURP provides  investigators with modern 
undersea
facilities, including submersibles,  habitats, air and mixed gas scuba, and
remotely operated vehicles. The Federal  appropriation for FY95 was $14.4
million.
<P>A major part of the research program is carried out by a network of 
National
 Undersea Research Centers. These Centers serve as extensions of the 
National
 Office, and are located strategically to develop and execute the field 
programs,
 which are formed of individual research projects from research proposals
 submitted to NURP. Supported by the National Office, the Centers offer
 scientists facilities for research primarily in the U.S. Exclusive Economic
 Zone. Depths of the research projects range from shallow to 6,000 m. Some
of  the ecosystems being studied are associated with hardgrounds, sediments,
 coral reefs, seamounts, volcanoes, vents, and the water column.
<P>The National Office is responsible for the architecture, management, and
 direction of the program. Programs of wide societal impact are administered
 directly by NURP. These include diving safety and physiology, 
improvements
 in the technology and development of submersible platforms, and outreach
 activities. Annual operation of the submersible <i>Alvin</i> 
    is partially 
funded
by  NURP. In addition, NURP provides the civilian science community access
to  the U.S. Navy deep sea assets such as the submersibles <i>Sea Cliff</i>  
  and
<i>Turtle</i>  and a 6,000-m remotely operated vehicle.
<P>Requests for support may be made by scientists and engineers at 
universities
 or research institutions. For further information, applicants should contact
 the NURP National Undersea Research Center in their region or the NURP 
National Office in NOAA. NURP also maintains a Home Page that

</BLOCKQUOTE><P>NURP is an integrated program focusing on research 
associated with  
processes
in the world's oceans and the Great Lakes in order to understand  the global
ecosystem that will lead to predicting changes in that system. The  program
promotes studies relating to the use of ocean and lake resources to  the
ecosystem. NURP provides underwater stock assessments of  commercially 
valuable
species for comparison with assessments from  traditional methods; 
determines
the function of habitats as refuges,  reproductive areas, recruitment zones,
and nursery areas for exploited species;  investigates environmental factors
influencing recruitment; determines  habitat requirements; assesses the 
effects
of commercial fishing gear on  habitat productivity, biodiversity, and 
ecosystem
stability; and develops non-destructive stock assessment methods. Specific
areas of research follow:
<UL><LI><i>Ecosystem Health and Coastal Processes</i> : NURP assesses 
the 
effects
on  coastal and Great Lakes environments, particularly coral reefs and
 contaminant and nutrient cycling; distinguishes natural from human-
induced
influences on stressed ecosystems; and contributes to understanding  the
relationships between habitat complexity and biodiversity.
<P>
<LI><i>Seafloor Processes</i> : NURP studies the occurrence and 
significance
of  sea-bottom fluid vents to global climate change and ocean temperature;
 quantifies sea-bottom greenhouse gas sources and contributions; determines
 paleoclimatic records from coral reef cores; predicts environmental impacts
of  marine crust mining; and investigates processes leading to commercial
 mineral deposits.
<P>
<LI><i>Undersea Technology</i> : NURP develops sampling and diving  
technologies
to improve scientific capability, including enhanced optical and  acoustic
imaging systems; hard rock submersible-mounted drills; underwater  
elevators
for large sample retrieval; standardized mounting and power  sources for
samplers leading to interchangeable submersible equipment  packages; 
improved
biological samplers; and new technology and procedures  for divers.
<P>
<LI><i>Diving Safety and Physiology</i> : NURP improves decompression  
procedures
for nitrox diving; collects and disseminates information on  diving-related
accidents and diving accident management; develops safer  certification and
training standards for air and nitrox diving; and improves  understanding
of hyperbaric physiology.
</UL><P>
<P>National Ocean Service
<P>Section 315 of the Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) of 1972 
authorized
 the establishment of "estuarine sanctuaries" to serve as field laboratories
for  the conduct of research and education related to enhancing coastal
 management. In 1974, DOC/NOAA designated South Slough the first  
estuarine
sanctuary. In 1985, Congress amended the CZMA, changing the  name to the
National Estuarine Research Reserve System (NERRS) and  increasing the 
research
dimension of the program. Over the past 2 decades,  approximately one new
reserve has been designated per year. As of February  1996, 22 research 
reserves
have been designated, placing nearly 440,000 acres of  estuarine waters,
wetlands, and uplands into active management and  stewardship.
<P>The National Ocean Service (NOS) Sanctuaries and Reserves Division 
(SRD)
 of the Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management solicits competitive
 research proposals for management-related projects that enhance scientific
 understanding of Reserve environments; provide information needed by  
Reserve
Managers and coastal zone decisionmakers; and improve public awareness of
estuaries and estuarine management issues. Research projects may be 
oriented
to specific Reserves; however, projects that involve or  benefit more than
one Reserve in the national system are given higher  priority.
<P>The primary research objective for NERRS is the study of the causes and
 effects of natural and anthropogenically induced change in the ecology of
 estuarine and estuarine-like ecosystems. All research funded through SRD
is  designed to provide information of significant value to the development
and  implementation of resource management policy governing the U.S. 
coastal
 zone, for which NOAA's Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management 
has management and regulatory responsibilities. In FY93, SRD established
a  series of 2-year research priority categories to serve as foci for the
SRD  competitive research program. The FY96 research priority is habitat
 restoration.
<P>Research funding opportunities are announced annually in the 
<i>Federal Register</i> in the form of a Request for Proposals (RFP). 
Interested parties
may  apply for funds by submitting a research proposal in response to SRD's
RFP.  Occasionally, SRD funds an unsolicited proposal, but only if it 
addresses
an  emergency research need at one of the Reserve sites within NERRS.
<P>SRD is in the process of revising the competitive research program to
fund  graduate assistantships instead of projects. The graduate assistantships
will be  funded competitively through an open competition. Further details
are being  developed, and will be included in an RFP slated for release late
in 1996.<BR><STRONG>Contacts:</STRONG> <BR>Randall

<P>
<H2>Department of Agriculture
</H2><P>USDA is responsible for ensuring a safe, healthy, abundant, and
affordable  food and fiber supply, while sustaining and enhancing the 
resource
base.   Over the last decade, USDA has faced challenges in the areas of water
quality,  biodiversity, and pest and disease control that have required new
approaches  to food production and renewable natural resource management.
In response  to these changing needs, opportunities have surfaced in new
uses for  agricultural and forestry products, biofuels and biomass energy,
and recycling  technologies.
<P>
<A name="doa1"></A>
<H3>Types of Environment and Natural Resources Research Supported
</H3><UL><LI><STRONG>Global Change:</STRONG> USDA focuses on 
understanding
 atmosphere/biosphere gas and energy exchange, altered carbon storage, 
effects
 of increased incidence of fire, insect and disease disturbance in forest
 ecosystems resulting from global change, and the response of terrestrial
and  aquatic ecosystems to physical and chemical changes in the atmosphere.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>Biodiversity and Ecosystems:</STRONG> USDA supports 
research
to understand  how community composition and structure relate to function
and  sustainability. Specific research needs are to understand the interaction
of the  biological community, including its environment, and to identify
sustainable  management practices for forest, range, crop, and aquatic
ecosystems.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>Toxic Substances/Wastes: </STRONG>USDA conducts and 
supports
research on  alternatives to chemical pesticides, such as crop rotations,

<P><EM>Forest Service</EM>
<P>The Forest Service supports research to develop scientific information
and  technology needed to protect, manage, use, and sustain the Nation's
1.6  billion acres of public and private forest and rangelands.
<P>The Forest Service conducts research through a network of seven 
regional
 Forest Experiment Stations, a national Forest Products Laboratory, and the
 International Institute of Tropical Forestry.  Approximately 600 research
 scientists, supported by over 2,000 staff, are organized into Research Work
 Units at 70 locations. Programs are organized under four broad research
areas,  each of which includes several activity categories:
<UL><LI> <i>Vegetation Management and Protection</i> : This activity 
involves 
long-term studies of management practices; alternative management for 
major  
forest
types; growth, yield, and cultural practice; cost reduction and  environmental
impact of forest operations; and ways to reduce the impacts of  unwanted
fires, insects, and diseases. Categories requiring attention include  
fundamental
plant sciences, silvicultural applications, quantitative analysis of  forest
vegetation, rangeland ecology, forest operations, insect ecology, and  
prevention
and control of insects and diseases.
<P>
<LI><i>Wildlife, Fish, Water, and Air Sciences</i> : This activity involves 
research
 to increase understanding of organisms, ecosystems, and ecological processes.
 General areas of high-priority research include the analysis of watershed
 processes and functions; the analysis of freshwater aquatic communities
and  habitat; the effects of management on habitat condition for recovery
of  threatened, endangered, and sensitive plant and animal species; ecosystem
 response to atmospheric factors such as temperature, precipitation, and
 chemical composition; and analysis and restoration of riparian communities.
 Activity categories within this area include wildlife habitat, aquatic 
habitat,
 watershed, and atmospheric sciences.
<P>
<LI><i>Resource Valuation and Use</i> : Research is supported to assess the  
conditions,
trends, and capability of forest and rangeland resources; to  estimate current
and anticipated demands for these resources; and to integrate  social, 
economic,
and biological factors to ensure sustainability of the natural  resource
while meeting people's needs. Activity categories within this area  include
renewable resources economics; urban forestry; wilderness,  recreation, and
cultural heritage resources; and forest product use and safety.
<P>
<LI><i>Resources Inventory and Monitoring </i> : The Forest Service 
conducts a  
Forest
Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program to periodically quantify the  timber
supply and the status of forests across all land ownership in the U.S.  
Activity
categories within this area include forest inventory and analysis,  forest
health monitoring, and inventory and monitoring techniques.
<P>
<LI><i>Global Change Research</i> :  The Forest Service is an integral 
participant
in  the U.S. Global Change Research Program. Forest Service research efforts
 relative to global change are highly integrated and consist of a broad 
spectrum
 of studies relating to forest and range ecosystems.
</UL><P>In FY95, the Forest Service provided $25.8 million to support 963
grants,  cooperative agreements, and contracts to colleges, universities,
States, and  other research organizations. In addition, grants and agreements
totaling $3.5  million were awarded for studies under the global change 
program.
<P>Cooperative agreements are used to form partnerships to more efficiently
 conduct mission-related research. These agreements are generally 
determined
 on a scientist-to-scientist basis where funding, need, and expertise co-
exist.
 Cooperative agreements are intended to complement internal Forest Service
 research efforts, with funding generally deployed for short-term studies
and  to acquire specific expertise or resources. Cooperators must submit
progress  reports, approval of which is usually a condition for continued
funding.  Funding decisions are made by Research Work Unit Project Leaders
in  coordination with Forest Experiment Station headquarters.
<P>Research grants and contracts are solicited on a competitive basis. 
Funding
 decisions are made by Forest Service scientists and Experiment Station
 management in accordance with applicable regulations.
<P>Formal RFPs are issued annually for targeted research on the global 
change
 issue. The request for and competitive selection of research proposals is
 coordinated nationally, but RFPs are issued separately for the northeast,
 southeast, southwest, and northwest regions of the country.
<P>Information on cooperative agreements, grants, and contracts, as well
as the  Forest Service Global Change program can be obtained by contacting

<P><EM>Agricultural Research Service</EM>
<P>The Agricultural Research Service (ARS) mission is to provide access to
 agricultural information and to develop new knowledge and technology  
needed
to solve technical agricultural problems of broad scope and high  national
priority to ensure adequate availability of high-quality, safe food and 
other agricultural products to meet the nutritional needs of the American
 consumer; to sustain a viable and competitive food and agricultural  
economy;
to enhance quality of life and economic opportunity for rural  citizens and
society as a whole; and to maintain a quality environment and  natural 
resource
base.
<P>ARS serves a multitude of customers and stakeholders, including USDA 
and
 Congress. Within USDA, ARS serves the Secretary of Agriculture, operating
 as the Department's research arm to respond to the Nation's critical
 agricultural challenges. ARS scientists, technicians, and support personnel
in  laboratories strategically located throughout the country are at the
disposal of  the Secretary to investigate and solve technical problems that
face American  agriculture today.
<P>ARS frequently establishes partnerships with companies and other  
institutions
to develop new technologies through Cooperative Research and  
Development
Agreements (CRADAs) and patent licenses. These cooperative  endeavors 
have
dramatically speeded commercialization of agricultural  technologies.
Approximately 550 CRADAs have been set up with industry to  date; some of
these have already led to new commercial products and  processes. Under 
these
agreements, industry provides marketing information  essential for the 
successful
commercialization of the product/process, and  other information to help
guide ARS research. In turn, the first right to an  exclusive license on
the product/process emerging from the agreement is  awarded to the industry
partner.
<P>Nearly 200 licenses of ARS-developed technologies are currently in place.
 These primarily involve licenses to industry to make, use, and sell ARS-
patented products/processes. Patents are an important component of USDA's
 technology transfer program. ARS typically receives 50 to 60 patents each
year;  it has received more than 1,200 patents since 1970.
<P>ARS technology transfer has had a positive impact on small and rural
 businesses. In keeping with the intent of the Federal Technology Transfer
Act  of 1986, ARS gives first preference to exclusive licenses of its 
technology
to  small businesses, many of which are in rural agricultural locations.
More  than half of ARS' current licenses and CRADAs are with small, rural,
and/or  minority- or women-owned businesses. More than 50 small and/or 
rural
 companies were created based on patented ARS
technologies.<BR>

The Division of Extramural Research and Training of the National 
Institute  of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) is responsible for the 
Institute's  scientific, fiscal, and administrative management of
grant-supported research  and training programs. These programs are focused 
on 
understanding direct  relationships between human exposures to 
environmental agents and  potential effects on health. Research is supported 
at universities, medical  centers, research institutions, and other research 
organizations throughout  the U.S. and the world.
<P>The Chemical Exposures and Molecular Biology Branch administers 
research  programs in molecular biology; carcinogenesis; biomarkers of 
chemical  exposures and doses, individual susceptibility, and effects; and  
environmental epidemiology. The Organ and Systems Toxicology Branch  
supports mechanistic-based research focused on examining non-cancer  
endpoints of exposures to environmental toxicants. Research supported is  
concentrated on the molecular mechanisms by which environmental factors  
disrupt cellular function within target tissues and lead to human health  
problems. Much of the research involves studies at the intracellular and  
genetic levels; however, population-based research projects are also supported  
to identify environmental substances that cause or exacerbate human health  
problems.
<P>The Division's Worker Education Training Program supports the  
development of training programs for workers and their supervisors  
involved in hazardous waste management and remediation. The model  
program encourages innovation in training methods and enhances private  
sector training by demonstrating new and cost-effective training techniques

<P>
<H2>Department of Energy
</H2><P>The Department of Energy (DOE) has multiple missions that 
contribute
to the  environment and natural resources R&amp;D portfolio. These 
mission
areas  include basic science and technology, environmental quality, energy
 resources, national security, and industrial competitiveness.
<P>
<a name="doe1"></a>
<H3>Types of Environment and Natural Resources Research Supported
</H3><UL><LI><STRONG>Energy Resources:</STRONG> DOE conducts 
extensive R&amp;D
in the areas of energy  efficiency and renewable energy resources and other
advanced energy supply  and demand technologies. These various R&amp;D 
programs
are targeted at  achieving diversity and efficiency in energy use, efficiency
in its generation,  and a more secure national economy. At the heart of some
of DOE's programs  is the concept of sustainable development. Many of these
programs are linked  under a conceptual framework that supports pollution
avoidance, rather than  the traditional end-of-the pipe controls for 
industrial
processes.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>Environmental Quality:</STRONG> DOE supports 
substantial R&amp;D
in the area of  environmental cleanup and remediation technologies.  
Because
of the  Department's enormous cleanup mission, DOE is sponsoring some of
the  most extensive and advanced R&amp;D nationally and internationally to
 determine safer, cheaper, faster, and more effective ways to clean up
 contaminated environments, and to reduce or prevent the emission of
 environmental pollutants. An area of particular R&amp;D interest is 
radioactive
 mixed wastes. Technology leveraging with the private sector results in
cost-shared risk through dollar leveraging.  The result is innovative 
technology
 systems to be transferred to the private sector for commercialization.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>Fundamental Science:</STRONG> DOE programs in science 
and technology
 include significant contributions to global change research.   Research
into the  underlying phenomena -- ranging from sophisticated 
modeling
of global  climate to extensive field programs to gather data on critical
processes -- are all  part of DOE's efforts in this area.  Advanced 
sensors
are being developed to  further the accuracy and precision of key climatic
measurements. These  activities are conducted in response to DOE's need for
assessing the  environmental consequences of energy production and use.
Additionally, the  Department conducts significant research into local air
quality and air  pollution phenomena, providing a basic science perspective
into urban air  pollution issues, as well as providing analytical tools that
support the  prediction and mitigation of consequences from natural 
disasters.
</UL><P>
<a name="doe2"><a/>
<H3>Research Funding Opportunities
</H3><P>DOE uses various competitive procurement processes. In addition,
DOE  accepts and funds unsolicited proposals, establishes grants, and 
encourages
 work with its national laboratories through competitive procurement
 opportunities announced at each laboratory.
<P>The following list is partial and, especially for the year FY97, should
be  viewed as preliminary. Continuing budget uncertainties requires such;
it is  recommended that you contact the identified individuals for more 
current
 information.
<P>
<P><EM>Resource Management</EM>
<P>The Office of Fossil Energy sponsors R&amp;D in the area of resource
utilization  and management, specifically in the category of assessing 
resources
and their  use. These multi-year projects apply to both FY96 and FY97. 
R&amp;D
activities  follow:
<UL><LI>Develop and demonstrate economical and efficient tools and  
techniques
for recovering natural gas from geologically complex low  permeability 
reservoirs
containing large volumes of natural gas
<P>
<LI>Develop techniques for removing large quantities of impurities from 
raw natural gas, thus upgrading the quality of the gas to a more pure stream
 of methane and without poisonous concentrations of hydrogen sulfide
<P>
<LI>Maximize oil recovery in an environmentally sound manner by  
providing
an understanding of reservoir architecture, reservoir geometry  dimensions,
boundaries, fluid/rock properties, and fluid flow characteristics  within
the reservoir
<P>
<LI>Promote crude oil extraction simulation by developing process models,
 reservoir models, economic models, and tracer models suitable for use by
 independent oil companies; by developing improved oil recovery  
stimulation
methods that support water flooding, pressure maintenance,  sweep 
improvement,

<H3>Types of Environment and Natural Resources Research Supported
</H3><P>The Department of Defense (DoD) invests resources in 
environment and  natural resources R&amp;D to meet its responsibility to 
the Nation to clean up its  facilities, to move toward forces and 
infrastructure 
that are non-polluting, to  husband the lands and resources under its control, 
and to be compliant with  Federal, State, local, and international 
regulations. 
In addition, the  Department's operational needs lead to investments in 
R&amp;D to understand  and predict the state of the operating environment 
(e.g., weather,  oceanography, terrain) and its effects upon people, 
platforms, 
sensors, and  weapon systems. Knowledge of these environmental effects 
leads directly to  tactical and strategic military advantage, which can 
significantly alter the  outcome of conflict.

<P>
<H2>National Aeronautics and Space Administration
</H2><P>NASA brings to environment and natural resources research the 
ability to  view the Earth in its entirety from space. This unique position 
has 
led NASA  to focus on the study of the Earth as a integrated system, 
examining physical  climate systems, biogeochemical cycles, and the linkages 
between the two.
<P>
<A name="nasa1"></A>
<H3>Types of Environment and Natural Resources Research Supported
</H3><P>NASA seeks to further understanding of the total Earth system, 
and the  effects of natural and human-induced changes on the global 
environment.  The pursuit of Earth system science would be impractical 
without the  continuous global coverage provided by satellite-borne 
instruments. NASA's  unique ability to develop advanced, space-based 
research platforms -- converging with the national interest in the 
basic sciences and their practical  benefits -- has led to the Mission to 
Planet Earth (MTPE) Program.
<P>Mission to Planet Earth is composed of an integrated slate of spacecraft 
and <i>in situ</i> measurement capabilities; data and information 
management 
systems to  acquire, process, archive, and distribute global data sets; and 
research and  analysis programs to convert data into new knowledge of the 
Earth system.  Myriad users in academia, industry, and Federal, State, and 
local government  tap this knowledge to generate products and services 
essential to achieving  sustainable development. Mission to Planet Earth is 
NASA's contribution to  the USGCRP, an interagency effort to understand 
the processes and patterns  of global change. The Earth Observing System 
(EOS) -- the centerpiece of  Mission to Planet Earth -- is a 
program of multiple spacecraft and  interdisciplinary investigations to 
provide a 15-year data set of key parameters  needed to understand global 
climate change. Balancing the state of Earth system science with NASA 
capabilities, funding  constraints, USGCRP research priorities, and the needs 
of external  communities, the MTPE Program has established the following 
unifying  themes for MTPE science and missions over the period 1996-2002:
<UL><LI><STRONG>Land-Cover Change and Global 
Productivity:</STRONG> This area of emphasis  involves documenting and 
understanding the trends and patterns of change  in regional land cover, 
biodiversity, and global primary production.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>Seasonal-to-Interannual Climate Prediction:</STRONG> 
The MTPE Program seeks  to provide global observations and scientific 
understanding to improve  forecasts of the timing and geographic extent of 
transient climate anomalies.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>Long-Term Climate Variability:</STRONG> This unifying 
theme serves to provide  global observations and scientific understanding of 
the mechanisms and  factors that determine long-term climate variations and 
trends.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>Atmospheric Ozone: </STRONG>This focus continues 
studies into the detection,  causes, and consequences of changes in 
stratospheric ozone.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>Natural Hazards:</STRONG> This category applies unique 
MTPE remote-sensing  science and technologies to disaster characterization 
and risk reduction from  earthquakes, fires, floods, and droughts.
</UL><P>Other MTPE research efforts in such areas as global climate and 
Earth system  modeling, solid Earth dynamics, and ocean topography combine 
with these to  form an integrated approach to the advancement of Earth 
system science.

measurement capabilities. These objectives are critical to meet the advanced  
technology needs and projected life-cycle cost savings resulting from the
mid-1995 "reshaping" of the EOS Program. Actual science investigations may 
be  
accomplished, but only as a secondary objective and largely as a result of  
successful demonstrations of the technologies. Plans are for the NMP Earth

<UL><LI><i>General Circulation and Coupled Modeling</i> : The goal of 
this 
effort 
is to  use models and model-assimilated data sets to assess global climate 
system  variability and trends on seasonal-interannual through century time 
scales.  The strategy behind this program element is to develop, improve, and 
test  global atmospheric climate models and their couplings to models of 
other  parts of the Earth system, and to use them to diagnose and predict 
climate  variations and trends, with the objective of providing analytic and 
predictive  capability for assessments of global climate and Earth system 
behavior. This  element also seeks to develop, improve, test, and assist in 
implementing a  near-real-time model-driven data assimilation system that 
will have the  capability of ingesting EOS and other remotely sensed 
observational data  along with conventional data, with the objective of 
providing the best  possible synthesis of observational information and 
model skill, in the form  of research-quality climate data sets for community 
use.<BR> 	<STRONG>Contact:<BR></STRONG> Ken Bergman

<LI><i>Land-Cover and Land-Use Change</i> : The goal here is to develop 
the  
capability to perform repeated global inventories of land-cover and land-use  
from space, and to develop the scientific understanding and models necessary  
to evaluate the consequences of the observed changes. The strategy behind  
this program element is to develop methods and techniques, and to conduct  
research to evaluate impacts and the consequences of land-use change; to  
establish ways to quantify them; and to develop the capabilities to explore  
alternative land-use and monitoring strategies. The program will consist of a  
combination of satellite and field-based studies. The broader challenge of  
accurately accounting for land-use and land-cover change and the underlying  
research to interpret it will require a partnership with many scientific and  
natural resource management institutions around the world. Emphasis will  
be on the regions of the world currently undergoing the most stress, and  
where stresses from human activities are sure to increase the most 
rapidly.<BR> 	<STRONG>Contact:</STRONG> <BR>Anthony

<LI><i>Global Data Integration and Validation</i> : The goal here is to 
support 
the  
interdisciplinary interpretation of remote-sensing data from a variety of U.S.  
and foreign satellites in order to validate atmospheric remote-sensing  
algorithms, and to study the time and space variations of the derived  
geophysical parameters. The strategy behind this program element is to  
acquire appropriate satellite and <i>in situ</i> data to validate algorithm  
performance in regional-global intercomparisons and field experiments for  
the study of physical interactions between the atmosphere and the land,  
ocean, or ice surfaces below; to refine the remote-sensing algorithms until  
their outputs serve as base environmental states and as measures of the  
natural variability of specific parameters; to provide the determined  
environmental states, variability, and trends to models for characterizing  
model performance and validating retrospective model runs to the present;  
to determine the variability of atmospheric moisture, energy and water cycles,  
surface fluxes from the oceans, and changes in water vapor radiative forcing;  
to establish remote measurement capabilities for difficult variables like  
precipitation, cloud liquid water, water vapor varying with height, and
in-cloud particle type effects; and to contribute to assessments of global and  
regional variability of atmospheric water source availability.<BR>

<LI><i>Land Surface and Hydrology</i> : The goal of this effort is to develop 
a  
predictive understanding of the role of water in land-atmosphere interaction  
and to further the scientific basis of water resources management. The  
strategy behind this program element is to develop process models for  
describing mesoscale coupling of atmospheric motion and the exchange of  
water, energy, and momentum at the land surface; to develop new or  
improved technology and techniques for measuring hydrologic variables and  
seek new applications to hydrologic problems; and to formulate new theories  
about the role of land-atmosphere interactions in regional and global 
climate.<BR> 	<STRONG>Contact:</STRONG> <BR>Ming-Ying

<LI><i>Atmospheric Dynamics and Remote Sensing</i> : The goal here is to  
develop an improved understanding of the physical processes important in  
establishing the circulation of the atmosphere on all scales, ranging from the  
cloud, regional, and mesoscale to the global scale. This includes not only a  
comprehensive understanding of the distributions and variations of mass,  
energy, momentum, and water vapor in the troposphere at all scales, but also  
a complete understanding of the coupling between the dynamical and  
thermodynamical processes with the hydrological and radiative processes. To  
accomplish this goal, it is necessary to monitor the physical variables that  
characterize the state of the atmosphere. Therefore, the research programs  
pursued include the development of ground-, airborne-, and space-based  
remote-sensing techniques; participation in field experiments to obtain  
comprehensive data sets; advanced process modeling studies such as  
interscale energy transitions; and development of parameterizations for  
moist convective systems frontal zones, internal gravity waves, clouds, and  
radiative transfer. <BR><STRONG>Contact:<BR></STRONG> Ramesh

gravity field as a means of detecting lithospheric and mantle structure and  
dynamics, cryospheric and hydrological mass flux, and atmospheric  
circulation with times scales of months and longer.  This also involves  
observing the dynamics of the Earth's magnetic field as a means of  
characterizing the core processes that generate the Earth's main magnetic  
field, the mechanisms leading to main field polarity reversal, and the  
structure, composition, and evolution of the mantle and lithosphere, and of

technology related to the dynamics of the solid Earth and its interactions 
with  
the oceans and atmosphere. This program includes the development of  
geodetic techniques to measure deformation of the solid Earth, including  
Global Positioning System (GPS), Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI),  
and Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) technology. The strategy behind this  
program element is to observe, understand, and predict the dynamics and  
evolution of the Earth's lithosphere in order to mitigate the danger of  
earthquakes, to understand land subsidence, and to locate and access natural  
resources with time scales of hours and longer. Other objectives include  
observing and understanding the dynamics in the Earth's orientation and  
rotation as a comprehensive indicator of Earth system dynamics including  
paleoenvironment, oceanic and atmospheric circulation, internal core and

that  contribute to its environment and natural resources R&amp;D portfolio.  
Contributions to overall DOT research and development are provided by the  
Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), the Federal Transit  
Administration (FTA), the Research and Special Programs Administration  
(RSPA), the Maritime Administration (MARAD), the U.S. Coast Guard, and  
the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).
<P>
<A name="dot1"></A>
<H3>Types of Environment and Natural Resources Research Supported
</H3><UL><LI><STRONG>Highways and Air Quality:</STRONG> 
Modeling and analytic compliance research  is supported, including travel, 
emission, and dispersion modeling techniques  to provide information and 
technical guidance to Federal, State, and local  officials as well as the 
public at 
large on the new requirements and methods  for compliance.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>Highways and Water Resources:</STRONG> Previous 
research sponsored by  FHWA has provided tools to State and local 
transportation  officials for  assessing potential water quality impacts of 
transportation improvements,  and has developed mitigation techniques to 
lessen the pollution effects of  stormwater runoff. Ongoing studies and those 
planned for the future address  the continuing concern over nonpoint water 
pollution from highway  facilities and the ever-present need to meet statutory 
and regulatory  requirements. Research is being supported to develop 
improved methods,  techniques, tools, models, and procedures to evaluate 
the water quality  impacts of highway development and operation activities, 
particularly  stormwater runoff and changes in hydrology, and to identify and 
develop  innovative best management practices, devices, and other 
mitigation  measures.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>Improving Knowledge of Wetland Resources:</STRONG> 
The construction, use,  and maintenance of highway systems have potential 
primary and secondary  impacts on wetlands resources and other ecosystems.  
Research is supported  to develop improved methods, tools, and techniques 
to identify and delineate  wetlands, to assess wetland impacts, and to 
evaluate 
wetland functions; to  improve the effectiveness of compensatory mitigation 
through better  techniques of wetland restoration, enhancement, and 
creation; and to  improve and enhance the use of mitigation banking as a 
viable, effective tool  of choice in situations where compensatory mitigation 
is necessary.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>Historic and Archeological Preservation and 
Aesthetics:</STRONG> Historic and  archeological preservation research 
addresses the procedural, technical, and  legal issues associated with 
resource 
identification, evaluation, and  rehabilitation in the highway and 
transportation context. Research is  supported to provide the tools necessary 
to meet technical and procedural  requirements for historic preservation, as 
well as visual impacts and their  associated assessment techniques. 
Information will be developed to identify  the viability and the manner in 
which the various methods can be used to  effectively determine the visual 
impact of highway project proposals. Also,  this program includes the various 
cultural practices of roadside maintenance  that can benefit visual quality 
such as the use of wild flowers and other native  plant species.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>Alternative Fuels:</STRONG> FTA conducts R&amp;D to

disaster on 
the national transportation system,  as well as effective tracking of the flow 
of 
critical relief supplies during the  response phase.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>Innovative Tools in Response Training and Preparedness 
Evaluation:</STRONG>  Research is being conducted to develop training 
methods for oil and  hazardous material spill response teams, as well as 
measurement methods to  evaluate response team performance.  Research is 
also supporting  development of a portable pollution incident control and 
evaluation system.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>Oil Spill Countermeasures: </STRONG>Researchers are 
attempting to improve  methods to mitigate oil spills, with a focus on 
improving mechanical  collection systems and alternative countermeasures, 
such as <i>in situ</i> burning,  and on the use of sensing technologies (e.g., 
infrared) 
to detect accidental and  deliberate spills. Research is also conducted on 
weathering effects on spilled  oil to improve predictive capabilities, thus 
enhancing input to response  strategies.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>Prevention Through People:</STRONG> Research has 
shown that up to 80% of  marine accidents are attributable to human activity.  
Research is being  conducted on human factors and performance (e.g., crew 
size, bridge design,  fatigue).
<P>
<LI><STRONG>Waterways Safety:</STRONG> This focus area seeks to 
provide improved  navigational capabilities and navigation resources for the 
mariner, including  positioning methods and aids to navigation.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>Pollution Prevention:</STRONG> DOT funds research on 
methods to minimize  the use of hazardous materials, to reduce the amount 
of solid and hazardous  materials generated by Coast Guard units, to 
determine the most cost-effective  and efficient methods for hazardous 
materials management, and to identify  the best technologies for remediation 
of Coast Guard hazardous waste sites.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>Non-Indigenous Species:</STRONG> Research is being 
conducted on the  introduction of non-indigenous aquatic nuisance species 
into U.S. waters  through shipping activities, and various control options.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>Aircraft Noise Reduction and Control:</STRONG> The 
FAA  researches technology  advances in source noise reduction. This 
includes engine design parameters,  advanced acoustic absorption materials, 
and active noise control devices.  Aircraft technology advances will include 
high-lift devices and methods to  reduce airframe-generated noise.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>Aircraft Engine Emissions Control:</STRONG> In 
collaboration with other  agencies, DOT investigates the aviation effects on 
the atmosphere. The results  of these studies are used in developing future 
engine emissions regulations  and international standards.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>Aviation Environmental Analysis:</STRONG> Research is 
supported to develop  various tools and methods used to evaluate the 
environmental impact from  alternative aviation policies and strategies. 
Projects include continually  updating and improving the integrated noise 
model, the heliport noise  model, the emissions and dispersion modeling 
system, and other models to  assess the impacts from FAA policies and 
actions.

<P>Federal Aviation Administration 
<P>FAA provides a safe, secure, and efficient global aviation system that  
contributes to national security and the promotion of aviation. As the leading  
authority in the international aviation community, FAA is responsive to the  
dynamic nature of customer needs, economic conditions, and environmental  
concerns. The future aviation system envisions one that is a "good neighbor."  
The challenges revolve around issues associated with how this good neighbor  
policy is implemented. The FAA's goal is to provide strong leadership in  
mitigating aviation's adverse impact on the public consistent with an  
effective aviation system. FAA is participating with NASA in a series of joint 
noise and emission  reduction research initiatives, including continued 
implementation of the  joint subsonic airplane noise reduction technology 
research program and  assessment of quiet aircraft technology for
propeller-driven airplanes and  rotorcraft. FAA also participates in the NASA 
Atmospheric Effects of  Aviation Project to develop a scientific basis for 
assessment of the impact of  aircraft emissions, particularly on the ozone 
layer 
and global climate change.  FAA and NASA also began a cooperative program 
for the development of  engine exhaust emissions certification standards and 
procedures for future  subsonic turbojet engine technology. Information on 
these joint programs  and other FAA research funding opportunitites should 
be directed to the  Director of the Office of Environment and Energy:

Climate Change Conference-James C. White</title></head>
<body>

 <center><h1>                            Preface </h1></center>

<p>





     Sustainable development, over coming generations, is

confronted with formidable obstacles.  The world's fundamental

problem is the dramatic increase in population and the concurrent

need for more energy to support desired standards of living.  We

have been largely unaware of the great increase in atmospheric

greenhouse gasses over the last 150 years, almost entirely due to

the burning of fossil fuels.  We are now attempting to control

emissions but these gasses continue to accumulate and threaten

the functions of present natural systems.

<p>

     Global climate change is a direct result of this

accumulation of gasses and is now officially recognized by the

Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) as human-

influenced and in need of coordinated global strategies to

mitigate or adapt to likely effects.  The IPCC, sponsored by the

World Meteorological Association and the United Nations

Environment Programme, based its findings on the work of 9,000

scientists from around the world.

<p>

     Because more energy is being trapped on our planet, threats

to our society can be anticipated in the form of impacts on

agricultural production, increased frequency and intensity of

storms, sea level rise, loss of biological diversity and human

health problems.

<p>

     This book contains papers, written by some of the world's

most eminent scientists in the field of climate change phenomena,

presented at a conference held in Washington, D.C., December 4 &

5, 1995.  The conference was part of an annual series sponsored

by the Center for Environmental Information in Rochester, N.Y.,

publisher of the GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE DIGEST, and cosponsored by

thirty-five professional, academic, environmental, and business

organizations and governmental agencies.

<p>

     The conference papers begin with descriptions of new

findings in the current IPCC assessment and their implications

for sustainable development.  Other papers examine mechanisms for

assessing the linkages and the conflicts between sustainable

development strategies and emerging findings about impacts,

adaptation and mitigation of global climate change effects.

<p>

     We thank the members of the program steering committee for

the selection of topics and the excellent recommendations for

speakers.  We were especially fortunate to be able to schedule

Dr. Bert Bolin, Chairman of the IPCC, as the keynote speaker.

<p>

     Special thanks are due to the associate editor, William

Wagner for patience and consideration shown the editor during the

preparation of this manuscript.  Wendy Petry, CEI's conference

manager, did a stellar job in coordinating the many aspects of

conference arrangements and presentations in conjunction with CEI

staff and volunteers.

<p>

     We hope this book, which is being distributed on the

Internet under the auspices of the U.S. Global Change Research

Program, will be widely used and of value to those concerned with

the problems associated with global climate change.

<center><h1>The IPCC Assessment---An Overview</h1>



<b>Bert Bolin    <br>

Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change </b></center>

<p>



     The IPCC is just completing its second assessment.  The

first one, as you all know, was completed in 1990.  By now, the

three Working Groups, One, Two and Three, have all approved their

policy makers' summaries and have accepted the underlying

material from the scientific community as the basis for their

conclusions.

<p>

     What remains now is the approval of a synthesis report,

which will provide the basic knowledge to assist in the political

process of trying to see what to do in view of what is said in

the second article of the Climate Convention.  That is, we must

aim for a stabilization of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere in

order to avoid undue changes of the environment, and do it in a

manner that does not jeopardize sustainable development for the

world as a whole.

<p>

     That report is up for final consideration in Rome in

December 1995 and we shall see how that goes.  I will have to be

a little restrained with regard to what I am going to say on that

matter, because it is essential that I keep to the key findings

as finally reported in the IPCC document, and do not go beyond

that in individual speculation.

<p>

     Of course, the joint effort of the scientific community as

reflected in the IPCC report is of fundamental importance in this

context.  Frankly, I don't think there has been that serious an

effort internationally before to try to express the knowledge of

the scientific community in a comprehensive and a careful manner

to serve a political process.


<p>

     It is not perfect, but it is indeed a very major effort. 

You should know that the present report, the second assessment

report, will consist altogether of 50 chapters, each one of them

of quite some length and each one of them with some 300 or 400

references.  Altogether, there are probably 10,000 references in

these documents, which probably will be somewhere between 1,500

and 2,000 pages.

<p>

     One may wonder why we do all that, because no politicians

will ever read it all, and of course they shouldn't.  What it is

supposed to do is provide the basis for the conclusions contained

in the Summary for Policy Makers that are based on a careful,

comprehensive and well-reviewed report, consistent with the

common view of the scientific community.

<p>

     You can never agree fully on single numbers in an effort of

this kind.  The ranges of uncertainty as they appear are supposed

to reflect the kind of uncertainties that exist in the problem,

and also the different scientific judgments that necessarily must

go into a complex issue of this kind.  Still, there are some that

do not accept the IPCC report, at least not all of the details. 

I welcome comments and critics, because that will only add to the

status of the report, provided it is scientifically founded.  I

regret to say, this is not always the case.

<p>

     It is to be remembered also that the bulk report, those

2,000 pages, is not approved by the IPCC.  It remains as the

scientific responsibility of the key authors.  That is very

essential, because it is impossible to approve documents of that

kind.  It should be reflecting the scientific community as well

as can be worked out between scientists.  The lead authors, and

there are about 300 or 400 of them that are engaged in writing

these chapters are obliged to consider carefully the reviews and

comments produced by other scientists, and also, in the final

round, by government representatives.

<p>

     Thus, when you see in the newspaper that the IPCC must say

so-and-so, there are no IPCC models.  What we provide is the

synthesis of all available models that are credible, to see what

they altogether tell us with regard to present knowledge.  That

is quite a different story.  I am afraid this is not recognized

fully by the public, and is used occasionally to discredit some

of the work of the IPCC.

<p>

     Within the setup as we have it, we indeed try to accommodate

different views as they are brought forward.

<p>

     There was an indication, I think it was in a committee in

Congress, that IPCC withheld information.  That is completely

wrong.  A paper that was published in Nature wasn't available but

we have 10,000 pages of reference.  The IPCC has nothing to do

with the way publication is handled by the individual authors,

certainly not.  It is important to distinguish the true roles of

the IPCC.

<p>

     The Policy Makers' Summary is a proposal by the IPCC Working

Group bureaus to these plenary sessions in which representatives

of government participate, of what scientists think might be of

interest to the politicians.  In the final sessions of the

Working Groups, which approved the Summary for Policy Makers,

there are a number of changes.  The outcome is occasionally

colored also to some extent, but not too badly, by non-scientific

views as they are brought forward by individual countries.  After

all, it is difficult for all of us, for you and for me, to

completely separate scientific comments and value judgments.  But

hopefully, the outcome is reasonably clear.  

<p>

     I am sure, it is useful for the policy makers.  As a matter

of fact, it is very clear since the special committee that was

appointed in Berlin to negotiate possible reinforcements of the

original Climate Convention agreed that present commitments by

nations are inadequate.  This is a formal statement by the

parties of the Convention.

<p>

     Therefore, they appointed a committee to negotiate what

possible further agreements could be reached on this issue.  The

Convention has a subcommittee, the Subcommittee on Science and

Technology, which is the linkage to the pure political process of

final negotiation. 

<p>

     The IPCC is requested to report both to the Berlin mandate

committee and to the subcommittee subsidiary body for science and

technology.  In that sense it is serving in an advisory function

to the Convention.

<p>

     But remember, we do not propose one or the other policy

principle to be adopted.  The IPCC role is to expose alternative

possibilities and what they imply.  For example, we have

requirements for stabilization, depending upon whether we wish to

stabilize at 350, 450, 550, 750, or 1,000 parts per million of

carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere.  Of course, these

requirements differ very much.  Which level to stabilize at is a

policy issue based on knowledge of impacts, and not only of

impacts of Climate Change, but also possible economic

consequences of taking drastic action.  We do have two sides of

this coin, and we recognize that fully.

<p>

     Well, after this preaching on how good the IPCC is, which it

is not in all regards, let us turn now to some more specific

issues.  I will now briefly try to bring home some of the key

things as they are reported on by the three Working Groups.  I

will put most of my emphasis on Working Group One, because it is

closest to my own competence, but I will address the other two to

a certain degree.

<p>

     There are a lot of things which are reconfirmed with regard

to the climate system and its behavior, and also with what man is

doing with regard to emissions into the atmosphere and the

consequences.  But there are some very important things which are

a considerable step forward in our present understanding of the

system and its way of responding to man's interventions.

<p>

     The greenhouse gasses are the same as they have always been. 

Of course, there are a few added of a more exotic nature, but I

think those are not crucial for a conclusion, except a substance

like CF-6 is mentioned now for the first time by some policy

makers as having a lifetime of 50,000 years, which means that it

will be there from our point of view forever.  These kind of

absolutely irreversible processes, as far as we can judge, are

important to point out, although play no role whatsoever with

regard to the amounts presently in the atmosphere.

<p>

     There are other aerosols emitted by burning, particularly

grassland and forest burning.  The indirect effects are

unspecified as of a year ago, but I should say that by global

climate change models, one of the present values for the joint

effects of this, is somewhere between .5&#176; and 1.0&#176; C for the global

average effect, even though one should remember that the effect

of these aerosols is very regionally different.  When including

aerosols, you get a forcing picture with very clear, almost

negative forcing in areas of industrialization, where sulfur is

emitted by burning fossil fuels, that is, oil and coal

particularly.  Gas of course has hardly any sulfur in it.  This

forces the atmosphere of the climate system in a patchy manner.

<p>

     It is to be remembered, however, that the effect of these

aerosols is not reflected in patterns of climate change that are

corresponding more or less exactly to this forcing.  The climate

system is a dynamic one, and the patchy forcing sets up

interactions dynamically in the Climate Change system.  The final

effect can be considerably different.

<p>

     It is however clear that of sulfate aerosols, 90 percent are

emitted in the Northern Hemisphere.  There is therefore to be

expected a clear difference between the two hemispheres in man's

emissions of greenhouse gasses and aerosols into the atmosphere.

<p>

     The greenhouse gasses on the other hand have lifetimes of

more than ten years.  We can assume they are essentially

homogeneously distributed over the globe and because there are

different effects dependent upon the prevailing climate, there is

more warming due to greenhouse gasses in the tropical regions, or

more forcing in tropical regions than in north polar and south

polar regions.

<p>

     There are the patterns here.  In the report from 1990 there

is a clear change of somewhere between 0.3 and 0.6 degrees

Celsius over the last 100 to 130 years.  We also said that this

could be partly a result of man's interventions.

<p>

     But in order to draw that conclusion, we must know something

about the temporal variability of the climate, the natural

variability of the climate system.  We do not know the natural

variability on the time scales of half a century to a century or

more with the precision to exclude, simply and directly, that

this is not a natural variability.   But we say it is not in

conflict with the idea that some of it, at least, might be caused

by man.

<p>

     Now, this is this question about detection and attribution.

Let me only very briefly summarize what is expressed now in the

Working Group One Policy Maker Summary.

<p>

     The question is to see if there are characteristic features

of climate change due to man's intervention as compared with the

natural variability:  to see if there are particular patterns

that emerge that could not be viewed as natural variability, or

rather, is unlikely to be natural variability.  That is what is

now being recognized.

<p>

     In the 20-year period from 1964 to 1984 there was generally

some warming, probably about three-tenths of a degree, but there

is a very clear patchy nature of the change over those 20 years.

<p>

     Now, this is observed.  We can run the climate models in the

transient mode in the two centers, the Hadley Center in Britain

and the Max Planck Institute in Hamburg, beginning in the 19th

century, 1850 or so, to see the pattern of the known emissions of

the various greenhouse gasses and estimated sulfate emissions

during this period.

<p>

     You get the correlation of about .3, which is not big but

still, it is not significantly different from zero, but there are

similarities between the observed pattern and what models

predict.

<p>

     The fact that the correlation is not bigger to a

considerable degree depends upon natural variability.  But the

similarity here means that there are similarities in the models

and the actual observed changes in the last 30, 40,or 50 years.

<p>

     It is interesting to see that in the course of time, this

similarity improves, so it is better in 1990 than in 1960.

<p>

     Now, there is one more thing which is interesting.  There

are other so-called characteristics of the change due to the

emissions of greenhouse gasses, which is illustrated by the

cross-section of temperature changes during the latter part of

this century.  There is not only carbon dioxide in the model, but

the models also include greenhouse gasses and sulfate aerosols. 

There is a difference between the two hemispheres with regard to

the distribution.

<p>

     There are similarities, particularly if you take the

Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere and the stratosphere

troposphere.  None of these similarities would exist if the

observed changes were due, for example, to volcanic eruptions or

changes of variation, which are the two prime contestants here to

explain the variability in the past.  Of course, there is a major

component of natural variability, which is stochastic, and is in

principle unpredictable.  At least so far, we have not been able

to reproduce that in a model, except in a statistical sense.

<p>

     The change of precipitation is also defined in the report in

terms of grid point values all over the land surfaces; there are

inadequate observations over the sea.  There are definite

differences between the hemispheres but we cannot yet use these

data for validation or verification of models.  There is, on the

whole,some intensification of the hydrological cycle.  But even

that is marginally detectable.

<p>

     Now, this fact that there is some correspondence permits us

draw conclusions.  I think I would like to read out precisely

what is said here, in order to really be careful in what I say,

and not be accused of anything.

<p>

     The last paragraph with which we are concerned here says,

our ability to quantify the human influence of global climate is

currently limited because the expected signal is still emerging

from the noise from natural variability, and because there are

uncertainties in key factors.  These include the magnitude and

patterns of the long term natural variability and the time

evolving pattern of forcing by and a response to changes in

concentrations of greenhouse gasses and aerosols and land surface

changes.

<p>

     Nevertheless -- and that is the final concluding sentence --

the balance of evidence suggests that there is a discernible

human influence on global climate.

<p>

     This is an exceedingly important conclusion.  First of all,

you introduce more realism into the temperature achievements. 

Secondly, it is also implicitly a first validation of climate

models against observed changes.  You also can trust the models a

little better.  I wouldn't say they are perfect in any way, but

they are somewhat more reliable.  Therefore, projections for the

future become somewhat more reliable.  There is a lot more to be

done to see where in the uncertainty range we actually are.

<p>

     The 1990 report said that the sensitivity of the global

climate system is such that a doubling of carbon dioxide would

yield a change of the equilibrium surface temperature average

around the globe of somewhere between 1.5 and 4.5 degrees

Celsius.  There is considerable uncertainty in the range, and

that was fully justified at that time.  It may still be so, but

there are some answers that may be important.

<p>

     It is to be remembered that none of the models that were run

at that time showed a smaller value than 1.9.  But there were

actually two that were above 5.2, about 5.  The fact that we

chose a little lower range and also a central value of 2.5, and

there was just one out of four of the models that showed less

than 2.5, was the discrepancy between this range and what had

happened so far regarding temperature changes, which indicated

that maybe after all we should be in the low range.

<p>

     Now it seems to become clear that the slower increase which

has been observed may well be due to aerosols. This then means

that the sensitivity of the climate system maybe is more properly

between 1.5 and 4.5, and some may even wish to say the central

value should be three rather than 2.5.  This is not included in

the report, but you can sense the way we change somewhat the view

of the sensitive characteristics of the climate system to man's

impacts.

<p>

     I now would like to mention some information reported in the

IPCC report from transient runs by the Max Planck Institute and

the Hadley Center.

<p>

     As a result of increasing carbon dioxide concentrations in

the atmosphere by 2100 there will be a rise of about three and a

half or a little more than three degrees increase from the

present.  But there has been an increase on the order of half a

degree from the middle of last century.

<p>

     But if you include aerosols, both these drop down.  The two

models show about the same temperature changes.  It is just a

coincidence, because they use different assumptions about some of

the parameters, particularly cloud, there is more of a range of

uncertainty than is shown by these two models, for sure.  So

don't take this as a proof in any way that we now know the change

of the average temperature of the globe over the next hundred

years; by no means.  I'll come back to that in just a moment.

<p>

     Thus, this is a step forward.  Now, how we wish to use that

is another matter, and what conclusions do we draw?

<p>

     There is also this, by the year 2050 only 70 percent of the

potential effect of increased carbon dioxide will actually be

realized because of the inertia of the climate system.  It takes

time to heat ocean waters.

<p>

     With respect to the change of response of the sea level due

to the emissions and the heating, the values are reduced, as

compared to previous estimates, from an average of about 65

centimeters to about 50, with an uncertainty range of between 10

and 15 centimeters only, up to 95, a huge range of uncertainty.

<p>

     But one should remember in this context that the lower

ranges to which the IPCC referred in its conclusions here refer

to scenarios of the future which are called C and D, with low

values of change of temperature or sea level over the next

century, brought about by having population increases to nearly

6.3 billion people during the next century.  It is likely that we

will pass that number just a little after the turn of the

century.  The population numbers are very low in these scenarios,

trying to show lower limits of what might happen in the future.

<p>

     Finally, very briefly with regard to Working Group One,

stabilization.  We may need to stabilize carbon dioxide.  How

much and when is to be decided by others in the IPCC.  There are

alternative scenarios in which we end up with stabilization

between 350 and 750 ppm.

<p>

     The question is how quickly can we turn around, 450 requires

emissions below present within about 35 years, and a rather quick

turnaround.  That is my personal view.  It is not very likely

that a 450 stabilization of carbon dioxide will be possible,

unless very drastic measures are taken.  I am simply doubtful. 

There are no signs at present that such attitudes to the issue

are evolving.

<p>

     Let us turn to the two other Working Groups which have

already completed their work, the important conclusions in their

Summaries for Policy Makers.  It will be very superficial. 

Working Group Two will deal with that more in detail.

<p>

     With regard to sea level rise, there are of the order of a

hundred million people living in the regions which will be

directly influenced by sea level rise of the magnitude that is

being foreseen here.  There is some time for them to move.  It is

not like they are staying there and drowning.  But the

realization of this rise in sea level is a slow rise, it is

sensed that ten years from now or 40 years from now, major storms

cause more flooding into regions which were not flooded before. 

The extreme events associated with such stormy weather are the

crucial things in judging what the impacts of the sea level

rising might be.

<p>

     Secondly, with regard to agriculture, the IPCC says very

clearly that there is no reason to think there needs to be a very

drastic negative change of the total productivity of land on

earth, because of the Climate Change.  As a matter of fact, it

would be possible to maintain present agricultural production or

even increases.  But there may be considerable changes over where

you can grow and where you can't grow, where present patterns

might change, and where some countries might be very badly off,

others might gain, which is in itself a disturbing factor for the

global society to experience.

<p>

     When it comes to forests, forests are at present being

diminished, or have been, due to man's use of forest products. 

It is likely that there will be more warming over continents and

also drier climate in middle latitudes, not high latitudes, which

might well affect forests, because forests grow on land that

would otherwise be grassland, provided there is adequate

precipitation.

<p>

     How much this will change, or particularly where, is

impossible to say.  But there are indications that two degrees

change of temperature and associated precipitation changes might

lead to a situation where about one-third of the land area would

preferably not have the present ecosystem there, but another one. 

Present ecosystem distribution is tuned over the centuries and

millennia to present climate, and if climate changes, the

ecosystems also will change.  But they are unable to change as

quickly as the change of climate is expected to occur, and there

will be thus pressures on these systems, maybe not so that

existing forests die out, but the regeneration of forests may be

difficult in areas where climate is suitable for forests.  But we

cannot tell where, and we cannot tell either how quickly this

will come about, because it still depends upon whether we choose

a lower sensitivity of climate response or a higher sensitivity

of climate response to man's interventions.

<p>

     Health is another issue which is influenced, in the sense

that vector-borne diseases are very much dependent upon

temperature and precipitation or humidity conditions.  It is

likely that tropical diseases would have the possibility to

spread into larger regions.  To the extent that is a real danger

for humanity depends upon how well we are able to protect

ourselves against such diseases.  Malaria, for example, is not

found in all of the regions in which malaria could exist, because

of precautionary actions by man in the health domain.

<p>

     There are a number of things of this kind, for example,

energy provisions.  To emphasize, our use of energy is not at all

very efficient.  There are some 10, 20, 30 percent increases in

efficiency of energy use which will not cost very much, or in

some cases will even be profitable.  The technical potential is a

lot bigger.  There, costs come into the picture.  Again, to

optimize or minimize costs, the rate with which society can

change is indeed very constrained.  To disband existing

infrastructure is very costly.  So investment policy for the

future, if changes are required, must pay very much attention to

the way capital investments for the future are actually coming

about.

<p>

     Finally, I will conclude what Bob Watson pointed out so

clearly in the introduction.  There is a difference between

developed and developing countries in this matter, a very major

difference.  We know that the mitigation actions will primarily

concern carbon dioxide emissions, fossil fuel use.  Almost 80

percent of the world energy supply is fossil fuels right now.  If

developing countries use energy as we have been able to with

fossil fuel we will then certainly double or triple

concentrations in the atmosphere.

<p>

     Therefore, even though efficiency in energy use can be

enhanced considerably and provide us breathing space, we must

take stronger action in the longer perspective.  The need for new

sources of energy is becoming a most urgent issue to develop over

the next decades or half century.

<p>

     The climate change issue is not an issue that we can resolve

over a day or a year or over a decade, as was the case with the

chlorofluorocarbons and the ozone issue, although these are not

completely settled as yet.  It is rather an issue over half a

century.  To have a long term perspective of this is most

essential.  It does not mean that we take drastic, not well-

thought-through, actions now, right away, but we need to learn

about this.  We need to do the things that are cheap and can be

done for other reasons, and that contribute to limit emissions.  

<p>

     In the meantime, we may learn more.  We may be able to

settle more clearly where in the uncertainty range are we

heading, and in that sense, gradually approach the issue of what

do we need to do in the long term perspective.

<p>

     These are the views as expressed in Working Group Three of

the Summary for Policy Makers, the issues that we bring to the

politicians, in order for them to try to see what the climate

impact in the future might imply.

<p>

     For example, there is no value you can put to natural

ecosystems.  It is a question of how we as human beings value our

environment, which means that cost benefit analyses of the future

become very questionable.  The question about intergenerational

expertise is an issue that cannot be easily taken care of by

deciding on a discount rate. Although one may choose very low

discount rates in other to value the future more than the

discount rate usually used in industrial investments actually

implies, implying that, beyond 20 years, nothing we do today is

worth anything.

<p>

     This is the concluding comment I wish to make here.  It is a

long term issue.  We need to approach it gradually on a sound

temperature knowledge basis, and try to iron out the political

controversy.  But I am happy that I need not address that

question specifically.

     I am a very cautious guy.  There is talk about a change

in sea level as a result of global warming and that people

in low-lying countries might be in some danger of seeing

their homes being flooded.  Well, I grew up in The

Netherlands, and I lived about one meter below sea level for

a long time.  But being a very cautious guy, I moved to

Colorado, five and a half thousand feet above sea level.

<p>

     I will be talking about CO<sub>2</sub>.  Now, if you want to

tackle the greenhouse gas problem, CO<sub>2</sub> is the molecular

species that we have to come to grips with.  Not only is it

the most important anthropogenic greenhouse gas, it is also

very long-lived.  I will try to make a case this morning

that every kilogram of CO<sub>2</sub> emitted counts, in the long run.

<p>

     Furthermore, I will say nothing new here.  Everything I

am going to say is known, and has been known for decades by

geochemists.  For instance, people like Dave Keeling and

Wally Broecker in the '70s already put forward the ideas I

will present here.

<p>

     <a href="figures/tansfig1.gif"> Figure 1</a> is a schematic of part of the 
natural carbon

cycle.  The rapidly exchanging reservoirs are, to the left,

plants and soils, the atmosphere in the middle, the oceans

to the right, and on top, the fossil fuel reserves that we

are dumping into the system.

<p>

     The units I have used here are ten to the 15th mol or

petamol, if it were oil or petroleum, it would correspond to

17 cubic kilometers of oil, or four cubic miles. The

atmosphere holds 50 petamols.  The amount of fossil fuels

that we are burning is half a petamol per year, or in other

words, two cubic miles of oil if all the fossil fuel were in

the form of oil.

<p>

     The oceans hold much more than the atmosphere.  The

oceans hold 3100, the atmosphere only 50, so that the latter

is a relatively small reservoir.  Plants and soils hold

about three to four times the amount the atmosphere holds.  

<p>

     There are two big arrows.  This is air-sea exchange

between the oceans and the atmosphere, and photosynthesis

and respiration between plants and soils and the atmosphere. 

There are about seven petamols of carbon exchange between

the oceans and the atmosphere, and four petamols per year

photosynthesized and given back to the atmosphere through

respiration.

<p>

     At this point, I have not yet mentioned the slowly

exchanging reservoirs, so I'll add them.  We then have a

somewhat more complete, albeit still very schematic, picture

of the carbon cycle.  They are the rock reservoirs, the

really large reservoirs of carbon, carbonate rock and

kerogen.  The oceans have 3100 petamols of carbon; carbonate

rock holds five million petamols, more than a thousand times

the oceans.  However, the fluxes from the oceans to the

carbonate rock and from carbonate rock back to the oceans

and to the atmosphere are very small compared to these fast

exchanges like air-sea exchange.

<p>

     Take for instance, continental weathering.  There is

about .02 petamol per year of carbonate rock that is

weathered.  So these reservoirs are large, but they are

almost immobile.  They almost play no role in the fast-

exchanging system of carbon reservoirs.

<p>

     I have calculated the results of adding fossil fuels to

the atmosphere in a simple carbon cycle model.  <a 
href="figures/tansfig2.html"> Figure 2</a>

shows the assumed fossil fuel combustion as a function of

time that I have calculated for this model.  Here on the X

axis is the time scale, starting in 1800, and I go out to

the year 2600.  The assumption is that all the fossil fuel

reserves, 400 petamols of carbon, that is considered

economically recoverable will be burned.  In both of these

scenarios, all of these recovered fossil fuels will be

consumed.

<p>

     The upper curve, the solid curve, is the one in which

the initial rate of increase of fossil fuel combustion is

two percent per year, until we run into limitations.  As it

takes more and more effort to get it out of the ground, it

will taper off again, according to a logistic curve.  That

is just a possible scenario of fossil fuel burning.

<p>

     The dashed line represents the case in which we

increase initially the amount of fossil fuel consumption by

1 percent per year.  However, in both cases, the same total

amount is burned.

<p>

     What happens?  We will only be looking at the

atmosphere-ocean system first.  What happens is a giant

titration reaction <a href="figures/tansfig3.html">(see Figure 3)</a>.

<p>

     Carbon dioxide will combine with water to form carbonic

acid.  The carbonic acid in the oceans will react with

carbonate ions, giving two bicarbonate ions.  It will also

react with borate ions, giving boric acid.  This is the

third reaction.  These reactions are very well known.  The

thermodynamic constants have been worked out or measured to

great precision, so this is something we really know very

well.

<p>

     <a href="figures/tansfig4.html">Figure 4</a> is a titration diagram.  On 
the 
bottom axis is

the partial pressure of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere in

microatmospheres on a logarithmic scale.  <a href="figures/tansfig4.html"> 
Figure 4</a>

represents the well known chemical equilibrium between

atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>, dissolved CO<sub>2</sub>, carbonate and 
bicarbonate

ions, boric acid and borate ions.  

<p>

     The solid vertical line shows you the chemical

equilibrium concentrations when the CO<sub>2</sub> level in the

atmosphere was at the pre-industrial level, say in year

1850.  The dashed line shows you the same for the CO<sub>2</sub> level

in the atmosphere now.  As you can see, the upper curve is

the carbonate ion concentration, the curve underneath that

is the borate ion concentration.  They are both being

depleted by those two reactions that I showed you in the

previous Figure.  The figure shows how the thermodynamic

equilibrium between the surface ocean and the atmosphere

develops as CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere goes up.  This is known.



     Of course, you will be more interested to see how this

plays out in time as expressed in the atmosphere for the two

fossil fuel combustion scenarios I showed in <a href="figures/tansfig2.html"> 
Figure 2</a>.  This

is shown in <a href="figures/tansfig5.html"> Figure 5</a>.  As a reminder, 
the 
two fossil fuel

scenarios, with the initial rise of 2 percent and 1 percent,

are drawn (not to scale) at the bottom.   The upper curve

represents the partial pressure of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere if

we manage to combust all the fossil fuels that are

recoverable according to the first scenario.  The partial

pressure will go up around the year 2200 to 2,000 ppm.  This

is only part of the carbon cycle, I remind you.  This curve

is based only on the response of the atmosphere and the

oceans.

<p>

     Now, if we are more conservative, and we have measures

in place to slow down the rate of increase of fossil fuel

burning, and we increase by only 1 percent a year, the

resulting atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> level is shown on the dashed

curve.  One sees that it doesn't matter in the long run.  In

other words, if we manage to burn it all, every ton counts. 

If you follow the slower scenario, by the time it has all

been burned, the CO<sub>2</sub> level in the atmosphere around the year

2500, 2600, is the same as when you burn it all at once.

<p>

     One more thing I should say.  I calculated this for a

long time into the future.  You can see that, by the time

all the fossil fuels have been burned, the CO<sub>2</sub> in the

atmosphere is still decreasing.  Why is that?  Because the

oceans are still not completely in equilibrium with the

atmosphere.  The total amount of carbon in the atmosphere-

ocean systems of course is constant under these assumptions. 

But the atmosphere is still losing a little bit to the

oceans.  That is because the turnover time of the oceans is

slow.  The exchange time of the deep oceans with the

atmosphere in this model I took to be 1500 years.  This is

loosely based on carbon-14 estimates of ocean turnover.


<p>

     What I just showed you is very simplistic, because

there are more reservoirs involved.  So let's add the

reservoir of plants and soils, and see what happens.  I have

divided the reservoir of plants and soils into two.  One I

call plants, which have an average life of maybe forty

years, to which I have added so-called intermediate soil

carbon, which also may stay in the soil for anywhere between

20 and 100 years.  What I call explicitly soils is very

long-lived.

<p>

     There is a component in soils that accumulates very

slowly, but it is large.  There is more carbon in slowly

accumulating soils than there is in the atmosphere.  So a

typical turnover time for that component in soils,

especially at high latitudes, might be a thousand years.  

Therefore, I split this reservoir up into these two

components, one with an aggregate turnover time of 60 years,

plants and shorter-lived soils, and long-lived soils with a

turnover time of a thousand years.

<p>

     Next, I have made some very rough assumptions.  It was

assumed that the rate of photosynthesis responds positively

to increased CO<sub>2</sub>.  This type of response has been measured

in greenhouse experiments, lab experiments with fairly small

plants in pots.  It appears to be a very general response

that plants will photosynthesize faster at higher CO<sub>2</sub>

levels, however, we are not so sure that this actually works

in the real world, because there are lots of other

limitations.

<p>

     I took an expression for the enzyme kinetic response to

higher CO<sub>2</sub> levels from Allen, in Global Biogeochemical

Cycles, Volume 1, page 1, and I put that into this simple

model.  Respiration, or decay, is assumed to be proportional

to biomass.  <a href="figures/tansfig6.html">Figure 6</a> shows you a 
dramatic difference.  If

you allow the biosphere to absorb carbon, you get the middle

curve.  The lower curve shows the initial 2 percent rise

scenario of fossil fuel burning (not to scale).  The upper

curve is the same as in <a href="figures/tansfig5.html">Figure 5</a>, with 
no 
change in plant

and soil carbon.  It looks as if the carbon taken up by

plants and soils has not been emitted into the atmosphere-

ocean system, so the carbon that is stored in plants and

soils does make a difference.  With our assumptions, the CO<sub>2</sub>

in the atmosphere will be lower.

<p>

     How does this play out over the long run?  I ran it out

to the year 7,000 <a href="figures/tansfig7.html">(Figure 7)</a>, still with 
this 
very simple

model.  The middle curve includes growth of the biosphere,

the upper curve excludes it.  Even in the long run, as long

as CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere stays high, plants will

photosynthesize faster than they do today.  Under the simple

assumptions that I made, they will have a higher amount of

stored carbon in them.  Both curves go down for the first

few thousand years. This is due to deep ocean mixing.  How

likely is this?  Practically all terrestrial ecologists do

not believe that this will happen.  On the contrary, most of

them believe that there will be stresses on ecosystems due

to ourselves -- deforestation is a very simple example of

that -- but also due to climate change, if the climate

changes significantly.  There will be significant pressure

on ecosystems to move to areas where they presently are not.

<p>

     Many ecologists tend to think that plants and soils

will be storing less carbon instead of more into the future. 

But for the simple assumptions that I have made, namely that

the only response to higher CO<sub>2</sub> in a changed climate is more

rapid photosynthesis, <a href="figures/tansfig8.html">Figure 8</a> shows 
how 
it plays out.  The

fast biota, on a time scale of 60, 70 years, will grow in

response to higher atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>, then decrease and

finally level off.  The slowly increasing soils will also

absorb more carbon in the long run.  The fact that the

response levels off at the end is only related to the fact

that CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere also almost levels off in this

model.  

<p>

     You may have noticed that none of the carbon added to

the system has left.  It has only been re-distributed. 

Whether we intend it to or not, atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> will

stabilize if we wait long enough.

<p>

     I still have omitted a very important long term

feature.  That is, the role of the rock reservoirs.  On a

time scale of 7,000 years, they do play a role, because they

impact on what I earlier called the titration reaction of

CO<sub>2</sub> in the oceans.  

<p>

     <a href="figures/tansfig9.gif">Figure 9</a> shows the reactions.  As we 
add more CO<sub>2</sub> to

the oceans, the deep seas become more acidic.  One of the

reactions in the long run will be that some calcium

carbonate on the ocean floor will dissolve.  It will turn

into calcium ions and carbonate ions.  

<p>

     It was these carbonate ions that the CO<sub>2</sub> initially

reacted with.  This reaction is repeated here as the second

reaction, and when you add the first and second reactions,

you get the third.  They show that calcium ions add to the

oceans' capacity to hold CO<sub>2</sub>.

<p>

     Note that this type of calcite weathering takes place

both in the deep oceans and on the land.  CO<sub>2</sub> in the

atmosphere, and especially in soils where its concentration

is very high, will also react with calcium carbonate

(calcite), giving two bicarbonate ions.

<p>

     Finally, there is a geologic reaction that takes place

deep under the earth that I won't go into.

<p>

     Only the first of these processes I will consider in

<a href="figures/tansfig10.html">Figure 10</a>, whereby calcite of the ocean 
floor is dissolved. 

What is the result of that?  The upper curve again is the

very first curve I showed, considering the ocean and the

atmosphere only.  If we add a rock reservoir to that, no

biology here, just inorganic reactions, then the middle

curve shows what calcium carbonate dissolution might do.

<p>

     There are assumptions in here as well.  But first of

all, let me point that for the first thousand years, it

doesn't make any difference whether this carbonate dissolves

on the ocean floor or not.  That is because it takes a long

time for the acidity (CO<SUB>2</SUB>) that we are adding at the surface

of the ocean to reach the deeper parts of the ocean, those

parts of the ocean floor that have calcium carbonate in

them.

<p>

     Next, I made an assumption here which partially

determines the rate of atmospheric CO<SUB>2</SUB> decrease, namely that

it takes a thousand years for the product of the calcium ion

and carbonate ion concentrations to restore itself to a

value where the calcium cycle in the oceans is again in

balance.  So that is an assumption.  And it is probably too

fast.  Articles in the literature suggest that it could also

be 3,000 years, but I was conservative and I said, let's

maximize this effect and see what happens.  So I made it

relatively fast.  In other words, it is quite possible that

the rock cycle or the dissolution of calcite hardly lowers

the atmosphere CO<SUB>2</SUB> curve by the year 7000.

<p>

     To take a look at the really long term effect, I

assumed (erroneously) that the product of the calcium ion

and carbonate ion concentrations will restore itself to a

proper calcium balance, so that the calcium cycle is in

balance, in a hundred years, which is extremely unlikely,

and is certain not to happen.  However, I assumed that just

to see what might happen in the really long run.

<p>

     <a href="figures/tansfig11.html">Figure 11</a> shows that, in the very 
long 
run, the CO<SUB>2</SUB> in

the atmosphere doesn't go down anymore.  The upper curve

still represents the original case, with no changes in the

biosphere and no calcite dissolution.  In the middle curve,

we start out at 280 parts per million in pre-industrial

times, and in the year 7000, even with very rapid calcite

dissolution, we still have 370 parts per million in the

atmosphere after we have burned all 400 petamols of fossil

fuel carbon before the year 2500.  In other words, this is

permanent.  

<p>

     Not entirely permanent, of course.  There is also a

silicate weathering cycle and burial of organic matter. 

This will eventually control atmospheric CO<SUB>2</SUB>, but it may

take 100,000 to a million years.

<p>

     I hope I have pointed out the importance of management

of the carbon cycle, the importance of the biological

reservoirs.  The amount of carbon stored in biological

reservoirs appears to us in this context as if it hasn't

been emitted into the giant oceanic titration system.  

<p>

     The research that we do is focused on that.  We want to

find out right now what the role is of terrestrial systems

in absorbing carbon.  

<p>

     <a href="figures/tansfig12.gif">Figure 12</a> shows our main tool.  This 
is an observing

network, where we have regular air samples from all of these

places and we are looking for the fingerprint of carbon

sources and sinks in the atmosphere.  Not only do we measure

the CO<SUB>2</SUB> itself, we measure a host of other gasses, but

especially in the case of CO<SUB>2</SUB>, we also measure the carbon-13

and carbon-12 isotopic ratios of CO<SUB>2</SUB>.  That is important,

because when plants take up carbon, they discriminate

against the uptake of C-13, thereby enriching the isotopic

ratio of the CO<SUB>2</SUB> that stays behind in the atmosphere.  When

the CO<SUB>2</SUB> is taken up by the oceans, there is no isotopic

effect.

<p>

     In other words, looking carefully at the isotopic

ratios, we can distinguish whether plants are taking up the

CO<SUB>2</SUB>, or the oceans are taking up the CO<SUB>2</SUB>.

<p>

     I will show you something that we published recently. 

<a href="figures/tansfig13.html">Figure 13</a> shows during '92 and '93 
what 
we obtained from

this fingerprint of CO<SUB>2</SUB> and its isotopic ratio all over the

earth in the atmosphere, a picture of sources and sinks of

carbon as a function of latitude.  So latitude is at the

bottom, the South Pole to the left, the North Pole to the

right.  The solid curve portrays the sum of all natural

sources and sinks of CO<SUB>2</SUB>, either due to the oceans or the

terrestrial biosphere.  The dashed line is the contribution

to the total sources and sinks from the oceans.  The dot-

dash is the contribution of plants.  Always, the dashed and

the dot-dash lines will add up to the solid line.

<p>

     What do we see?  At least during '92 and '93, there is

tremendous uptake of CO<SUB>2</SUB> at mid-latitudes in the Northern

Hemisphere by plants.  The uptake is about half as large as

the total combustion of fossil fuels.  So this is fortunate,

this is good news.  People in the oil and coal industry

might love it.  But like I said, we don't know if this is

going to last.  Biologists are generally very skeptical that

this will keep happening for decades.  In fact, we know that

in 1994, terrestrial uptake at the mid-latitudes in the

Northern Hemisphere was much smaller than during '92 and

'93.  So we know that it varies a lot from year to year.  It

just so happened that when we got our isotopic analysis on

line, there were two big years of terrestrial uptake.

<center><h1>                   Detection of Climate Change  </h1>



                         <b>  Thomas Karl  <br>

                  National Climate Data Center  </b></center>

<p>



     Let us start out this by looking at the past climate

records.  A number of issues arise if one looks at the past

records in terms of detecting climate change.

<p>

     Questions come up, how is the climate warm, has it become

wetter, has the circulation changed, how about extreme events,

has the climate become more extreme or variable, and how have

long term climates varied in the past, beyond the instrumental

record that we have?  Questions such as these are very relevant

to the broader issue of detecting climate change when you come

down to the issue of, do the variations that we see in the

climate record really reflect climate change, or are they due to

natural variations.

<p>

     In order to answer these questions, it requires some

additional questions.  Those are related to how well do we know

what we think the causes of those changes would be, what are the

potential forcings, and how well do we know the history of the

changes in those forcings, because it is going to be pretty

critical if we are able to piece together what is going on here,

that we match changes in one part of our paradigm to another,

where we are looking at the forcings.

<p>

     Once we have asked these questions, then we say, how do we

try and match things up?  This involves estimates of the real

natural climate variability, that is a major issue, and the way

in which you go about analyzing the data.  

<p>

     We will start out by taking a look at what we see in the

climate records, to give you an appreciation.  There is no

smoking gun, there is no single study that we will be able to

say, ah-ha, we have detected it, ah-ha, we have proven there is

no greenhouse effect, or there is no effect on aerosols.  It is

the culmination of the studies that one has to look at.

<p>

     I will pose the question, has the climate warmed?  I know

there are still some people who may be skeptical.  At least in

the IPCC report, but I think a large number of scientists believe

that the temperatures have warmed since the late 19th century. 

The estimates haven't changed much in the last couple of years,

still three to six-tenths of a degree, because of our uncertainty

of the past data.  But warming is not globally uniform.  It is

greater over the continents, the mid-latitude continents, than it

is over the oceans.

<p>

     Over the last 40 years, the warming has been about two to

three-tenths of a degree Celsius, and the warming has been

greater at night in those areas where we have data.  It has been

greater at night than it has been during the daytime.

<p>

     Since 1979, when we have had both weather balloons, balloons

that are launched every day for operational weather forecasting,

and we have also had satellites, both of these different

observing systems depict a slight cooling since '79, while the

surface temperature has warmed very slightly.  There has been a

lot of discussion, looking at the satellite records from '79 and

saying, there is no global warming, but the satellites show it,

so do the weather balloons.  You must be very careful looking at

a very short period of record, that you don't walk away with a

long term broad-scale conclusion, because the climate has to be

viewed on the longer time scale. 

<p>

     If you go back to the 1950s, look at the temperature

measurements in the troposphere where the weather balloons are

measuring, you find a warming very similar to what we see at the

surface <a href="figures/karlfig1.gif">(Figure 1)</a>.

<p>

     If you look back and say, what about other records besides

just simply the measurement of temperatures from instruments, one

has a number of proxies that one can look at.  These are bore

hole measurements of ground temperatures, changes in snow cover,

glacier retreat,and sea level rise.  All these other measures are

broadly consistent with the warming signal that we have seen

since the late 19th century.

<p>

     Doctor Bolin has shown you this Figure One.  I include it to

remind you that the warming is not contiguous, it is not a simple

trend over time, in the Northern Hemisphere, the Southern

Hemisphere, and the global average, but there are bumps and

wiggles.  That is important to consider, because we are going to

look at some of these records in terms of this issue of

detection.

<p>

     Now, if we look at the spatial change, some areas are

increasing in temperature,some are decreasing.  Since 1950, we

find some areas of increasing temperature in the northeastern

part of North America, over Eastern Europe, and there is are

small decreases in China and South America.

<p>

     The point here is that there is a spatial pattern of change

that we can use to try and take into account in our detection

efforts not only looking at the global mean temperatures, but

looking at those patterns of change, as Bert has pointed out

earlier this morning.

<p>

     I mentioned earlier that temperatures are warming more at

night from data that we do have available.  <a 
href="figures/karlfig2.gif">Figure Two</a> shows

those changes over time.  You can see here the maximum

temperature, 1950 to '90.  It increased, but not as strong as it

increased at night, and the difference between the two, the

diurnal temperature range, decreasing to some extent, another

possible clue as to why the climate may be varying due to a host

of causes.

<p>

     <a href="figures/karlfig3.gif">Figure Three</a> is a busy diagram, but I 
want to include it

because I think it illustrates some important points we want to

bring up later on.  This is directly out of the current IPCC

report.  The top part of this diagram reflects changes of

temperature in the troposphere as well as at the surface.  The

surface temperatures are given by the dashed lines.  You can see,

they mirror fairly well the more solid lines represented by the

weather balloons.  This is what I talked about earlier, a warming

since the late '50s in the climate record from both weather

balloons as well as at the surface.

<p>

     Now, if we look at the temperatures since 1979, where we

have reliable satellite data or more reliable satellite data, I

should say, they are given by the solid dark line, and you can

see, there is a reasonably good match between the weather

balloons and the satellite data.  If you look at the difference

between the two, the differences over time are not systematic. 

That is, there are individual differences in any given year, but

you don't see any long term trend, one particular observing

system warming relative to another cooling.

<p>

     Now, if we use the same satellite measurements and the upper

air measurements, looking at what is going on in the lower

stratosphere, we find that there is indeed some interesting

characteristics here, some rather dramatic cooling that has taken

place since the mid-1980s.  This is not unrelated to the ozone

depletion in the stratosphere, another major global issue.  In

many senses, ozone depletion is not a completely distinct problem

from global climate change.  

<p>

     In fact, you can see very clearly in this record the Mt.

Pinatubo eruption in the stratosphere, a very strong warming,

reflected both by the weather balloons and the satellite.  You

can see this also reflected in the surface.  The surface

temperature is cooled, as well as the temperatures in the

troposphere.  I might point out that the tropospheric

temperatures above the surface cooled more with the Mt. Pinatubo

eruption than did the surface temperatures.  We find that the

tropospheric temperatures tend to have more variability

associated with them than at the surface.

<p>

     If we were completely mistaken about our ability to measure

global warming, it would be hard to find matches equal to these

in <a href="figures/karlfig4.gif">Figure Four</a>.  On this diagram is 
reflected Northern Hemisphere

snow cover variations.  They begin when satellite records began,

in the early 1970s.  Each year is reflected by the bars.  The

curves represent snow cover and temperature over those same

regions for different seasons of the year, October through

November, winter, December to March, spring, summer, and then

annual <a href="figures/karlfig5.gif">(Figure 5)</a>.  You can see a very nice 
match between the

temperatures and the change in snow cover, which gives us added

confidence that we indeed are measuring a warming signal that is

fairly robust.

<p>

     Another question that has been raised, switching our focus,

has the climate become wetter?  During the 20th century there has

been a small positive increase in worldwide land precipitation on

the order of about 1 percent from the best analyses we can

produce to date.  But perhaps more importantly, the precipitation

increase has not been uniform.  In fact, precipitation has

increased over land in high latitudes, and in the last few

decades decreased significantly in the tropics, especially since

the 1960s.  We believe this is not unrelated to the ENSO effects. 

<p>

     As related to the hydrological cycle, where we have cloud

measurements from surface weather observers, we believe that

indeed, the cloud cover has increased in many areas over land as

well as over the ocean.  Travelling ships who record the weather,

simply because they are interested in getting accurate weather

forecasts, have been doing this for many, many decades.

<p>

     Over land, the evaporation appears to have decreased since

1951 over the U.S. and in the former Soviet Union.  There is a

very nice match between this evaporation decrease and the

increase in cloud cover.  It gives us more confidence about the

decrease in evaporation.  It gives us more confidence about the

cloud cover, and there is a very nice match between those two

changes and the decrease in the diurnal temperature range.  They

all go together:  more clouds, less sunshine, less evaporation

from the surface.

<p>

     Over the ocean, we think that evaporation has increased in

all areas over the tropics.  It is tempting to say as a result,

water vapor has been observed to increase over North America and

the tropics since about 1973, when we have reliable records.  

<p>

     This is very important, because increases in carbon dioxide

initially warm the climate.  As the climate warms, more water

vapor is put into the atmosphere, which gives an enhancement to

the greenhouse effect.

<p>

     One of the problems in looking at atmospheric circulation is

the dearth of good analyses, even where we have good consistent

data.  There are efforts going on now to re-analyze data, put it

into models in a kind of a back-cast mode, so we can better

understand how the atmospheric circulation has changed.  That is

ongoing, and it really needs to continue.

<p>

     <a href="figures/karlfig6.gif">Figure Six</a> is an example of the 
Southern Oscillation index,

as defined by Trenberth and Horne in 1995.  I just point out to

you the unusual characteristics of the ENSO over the last decade,

especially since 1990, the rather persistent behavior.  Right

now, the ENSO is back up to slightly above the line in this

index.  But certainly this is an unusual characteristic in this

climate record.  This all has to be considered in trying to

understand what impacts are causing the changes that we observe. 

It even brings us to a broader question, how is the Southern

Oscillation index expected to change as other forcings may impact

the climate, such as increases in greenhouse gasses?

<p>

     Another very important question has been, has the climate

become more variable or extreme?  I want to begin by saying, this

is one case where we have an inadequate number of analyses and

not very good databases to say anything very global.  We do have

some good databases in some regions of the world.  Where people

have taken a look at that, in some respects we have found some

increases in extreme events, but in other areas we found little

change.

<p>

     In particular, there is a clear trend toward increasing

extreme precipitation rates in the U.S., as well as Northeast

Australia.  It just doesn't rain much in Central Australia, as

you might have guessed.  Other areas -- for example, we have

looked at China back to 1950, and we don't see much evidence for

change in that area.

<p>

     Increases in extreme extra-tropical cyclones in the North

Atlantic since the late 1980s have been pretty robust.  There has

been a lot of discussion about hurricanes, especially in this

country, because of the activity in the North Atlantic.  If you

take a broader perspective over the last 40 years, hurricanes

have actually decreased, but, over the last decade or so, there

has been a tendency for an increase.  We have found that the day-

to day variability of temperatures actually decreases in the

Northern Hemisphere.  That is, the difference in temperature

between today and tomorrow has actually gone down to some extent,

if we look at the mid-latitudes and high latitudes of the

Northern Hemisphere over land.  If we look at the difference in

temperature between one year and the next year, we really don't

find any long century scale trend associated with the

fluctuations of inter-annual temperature variability.

<p>

     Hurricanes have gotten quite a bit of discussion in this

country this year.  <a href="figures/karlfig7.gif">Figure Seven</a> compares 
1995 to some selected

years.  You can see other years rivalling 1995 in terms of the

number of both tropical storms and hurricanes, a fair number of

them. 

<p>

     If we take a look at the number of hurricanes reaching

landfall and look at it by decade <a href="figures/karlfig8.gif">(Figure 8)</a>, 
one can see a dip

during the 1970s and if the rate of hurricane production

continues as we see in the first five years of this decade, the

projection out to the end of the decade will bring us back up to

more typical levels.

<p>

     This is a very uncertain area in terms of how hurricanes

would be expected to change with global warming.  The theoretical

basis would suggest they become more intense, more extreme.  How

frequent they are is also subject to changes in circulation. 

Right now, models aren't capable of giving us good information. 

Nonetheless, storms are very important, but this is not the type

of thing we would use to detect whether or not the climate is

changing, and whether or not it is changing due to an increase in

greenhouse effect.  We simply don't know enough about it.

<p>

     I mentioned the increase in extreme precipitation events. 

<a href="figures/karlfig9.gif">Figure Nine</a> shows a very interesting 
signal in the U.S.  What you

see is a rather remarkable trend, the proportion of precipitation

in the United States that is falling from precipitation events of

two inches or more on any given day.  That percentage has

increased from the order of 8 or 9 percent in the early part of

the century to somewhere in the neighborhood of about 11 percent

at the present time.

<p>

     This is a very interesting signal.  It has been discussed in

IPCC as one of the anticipated changes we might expect with an

enhanced greenhouse effect, that is warmer climate leading to

more extreme precipitation events, a greater precipitation rate.

<p>

     How have climates in the past varied?  We can take a very

broad look at what has gone on in the last thousand years to try

and put what we have seen in the last century in a better

perspective.  We can rely on tree rings, historical records,

corals, and shallow ice cores.  There are a number of proxies

that are used.  

<p>

     They all have their limitations, because they are not

globally distributed, so they are somewhat difficult to interpret

on a global basis.  But nonetheless, with that caveat, based on

the best available evidence we have today, the 20th century

appears to be warmer than any century we see, going back to 1400,

based on a collection of these paleo climatic records <a 
href="figures/karlfig10.gif">(Figure

10)</a>. 

<p>

     It is also important to point out that the warming began 

during one of the coolest periods during the last 600 years.  In

some areas of the globe, from the paleo climatic evidence, we are

now clearly warmer than we have ever been, at least in the last

thousand years or so.

<p>

     Going back much further, 100,000 years, there is other paleo

climatic evidence that doesn't give you the good resolution, but

gives you a broader look at how climate has varied in the past. 

Based on these records, it seems very unlikely that at any time

over the last 100,000 years there has been a change in

temperature of more than a degree Celsius in a century.  As we

mentioned before, it looks like this past century has warmed

already half a degree.  Projections are anywhere between one and

a half and three and a half by the year 2100, clearly larger than

anything we have seen in many years.

<p>

     Let me go on here, in the interests of time, to pose this 

next question.  Do these climate variations reflect real changes?

We do have some notion, but our confidence in just how much of an

effect this would have on the climate system does vary <a 
href="figures/karlfig11.gif">(Figure

11)</a>. The greatest confidence we have is in the direct effect of

the greenhouse gasses.

<p>

     We have other issues to be concerned with, however, if we

want to find out what is causing those changes.  Other forcings

are going on.  Depletion of stratospheric ozone, tropospheric

ozone,sulfates, fossil fuel soot, biomass burning, the indirect

effect of tropospheric aerosols,and solar variability, all are

factors.  As you may be aware, we only have direct measurements

of solar variations since about the late 1970s.  Every time we

keep putting up a new satellite, we don't have a good overlap in

the record and thus, we still have a difficult time in putting

together a good long term time series of solar variability, even

when we have satellites up there.  So many of these time

histories have to be done through proxy measurements of solar

variations.

<p>

     Well, how well do we know the histories?  I have already

given you a clue, at least my assessment.  Well-mixed, long

lifetime anthropogenic greenhouse gasses -- we have fairly good

data since the Industrial Revolution.  Earlier than that we have

to rely on ice cores.  Perhaps a D+ is our ability to discern

whether or not changes in carbon dioxide are occurring before

increases in temperature or after.

<p>

     With other greenhouse gasses such as tropospheric ozone we

are not doing a very good job.  Soot, sulfate aerosols?  We can

make some guesses from looking at the history of changes in

sulfur emissions.  Biogenic aerosols?  Not doing a terribly good

job.  This is our current knowledge, which suggest they are minor

forcings, but nonetheless, they are important to try and

understand if one wants to narrow uncertainties around the

observed climate variations and changes.

<p>

     What are some of these other issues?  We have to estimate

natural variability, in order to assess whether or not the

changes we see are due to any specific forcing.  The question

arises, what measure do we use?  Analyzing the data, what

particular statistical technique are you going to use?  Can we

uniquely assign observed climate changes to specific forcings or

combinations of forcings?  This is the issue that is going to dog

us, because we know we are going to always leave out some of

these factors in any of our analyses of climate.  We cannot

relate them back to changes, because we don't have models that

have information about how the histories have changed. Whether or

not this could be modelled is another question.

<p>

     How can we discern the impacts on climate record?  With the

models, future projections, the more detailed, the less chance we

have of being misled by a false signal.  If we can look at all

the information, it is probably better than looking at the grand

global averages.

<p>

     We do need a measurement of background variability.  A

number of studies have done this.  They have looked at paleo

climate information to give an estimate of background natural

climate variability.  They have looked at GCM model simulations

themselves, without any forcings, and trying to use that as a

measure of natural variability, or they have used the observed

record that we see of the last 100 to 150 years.

<p>

     The exact answer you get depends on which one of these

measures you use, so you could have someone doing the exact same

study, coming out with the probability that the change we see is

95 percent certain, it is real greenhouse and not natural

variability.  If they are using another measure as opposed to

this measure, someone else may do that same study and find there

is only an 85 percent chance, and it is not statistically

significant.  This is important to keep in mind, because it is a

way in which some apparent conflicts arise in the literature.

<p>

     How can we discern their impacts?  Qualitative analyses, I

believe, are still very important, because from a qualitative

analysis, you can assess whether there seems to be a general

agreement between the predictions and observations.  

<p>

     Quantitative analyses are the bread and butter.  These can

take a number of forms.  They can be multivariate and uni-

dimensional, or multi-dimensional, they can look at a number of

aspects of the change in a particular variate, or they can

include a number of variables, and they can look at all the

spatial scales associated with those variables.  This we haven't

approached yet.  We would expect that work would be ongoing in

the next few years. 

<p>

     Recent studies have added a lot of information to the

climate record, because of the role sulfate aerosols have played. 

<p>

     I want to give you one example of why we think this has been

very important.  If you take a look at sulfur dioxide emissions

since 1980 <a href="figures/karlfig12.gif">(Figure 12)</a>, the larger circles 
represent larger

emissions.  You can see the greater emissions in North America

compared to some of the lesser developed parts of the world.  But

the emissions have not been constant.  If we look closer <a 
href="figures/karlfig13.gif">(Figure

13)</a>, we find that in the U.S. since 1966, the emissions have

actually decreased.  Same thing in Europe.  Other areas have seen

significant increases, particularly in China.

<p>

     One can use that information and say, what if we were to

look at the changes in zonal temperatures and see if there is a

spatial pattern across that zone that reflects over this period,

1966 to '80, which would reflect the expected changes.  

<p>

     We would expect sulfate aerosols to have their strongest

impact in the high sun season, summer, where there is a lot of

solar radiation being reflected back to space.  Most of the

warming actually occurs in the wintertime, which is perhaps not

unexpected, in the sense that there isn't a lot of solar

radiation at mid and high latitudes in the wintertime, and there

is often snow cover.  The effect of sulfate aerosols is not

nearly as great in winter as in spring and summer.

<p>

     Let us examine the SO<sub>X</sub> emissions in the United States

<a href="figures/karlfig14.gif">(Figure 14)</a>.  This shows that they seem to 
match quite nicely the

changes in maximum temperature, without much of an effect on the

minimum temperature.

<p>

     If you only look at carbon dioxide, you find significant

warming throughout much of the troposphere, peaking in the high

troposphere.  If you add in the sulfate aerosols, you find some

symmetry, not as much warming in the Northern Hemisphere.  

<p>

     In trying to put together all the forcings and trying to

come up with a clear picture, we did an analysis in the U.S.,

looking at a number of indicators that have been discussed in

1990 and the most recent IPCC report,to determine the types of

changes that you would expect with the greenhouse effect in mid-

latitude locations.

<p>

     One of these indicators is the percent coverage with much

above normal temperatures.  Another is the percent of the country

with much above normal cold season precipitation, the

precipitation that will enhance greenhouse effect which is

expected to increase more during the cold season than at other

times.  A third is the percent increase in extreme severe

droughts during the warm season because this increase in

temperature causes more evaporation.  As I already indicated,

this perhaps has not been the case.  The last two are the percent

of the U.S. with these extreme precipitation events, and the

reduction in the day-to-day temperature variability, another

expectation.

<p>

     If you put all those indicators together in an index, you

can come up with a curve that looks like <a 
href="figures/karlfig15.gif">Figure Fifteen</a>.  You can

see some very high values in recent decades, do statistical

analyses, and come away with the notion that it is very unlikely

this would have happened simply by chance, maybe a one chance in

20, if there was not some real effect going on.

<p>

     <a href="figures/karlfig16.gif">Figures Sixteen</a> and <a 
href="figures/karlfig17.gif">Seventeen</a> are out of the IPCC report. 

It is good to stand back and look at the types of projections

that have been expected to occur, comparing those to what has

been observed.  Stratospheric temperatures are expected to cool,

we have seen that.  The troposphere is expected to warm.  Snow

cover is expected to decrease.  These are all temperature

indicators.

<p>

     Little change or slight decrease of the El Ni&#241;o Southern

Oscillation is expected.  That perhaps one might argue has not

occurred, there is still some work to be done in that area.  Near

surface air temperature increases, greater in the Northern

Hemisphere mid-latitude areas, especially in the wintertime.  We

expect reductions in sea ice.  Land nighttime temperatures are

expected to warm more than daytime.  Ground temperatures are

expected to warm.  There are many changes in the model

projections that are consistent with what we see, consistent in a

qualitative sense.

<p>

     So in conclusion, I want to say that there is no doubt the

climate has warmed over the last century.  It has warmed despite

the Mt. Pinatubo eruption, and 1995 numbers would suggest that we

probably are going to be very close to one of the warmest years

on record.  The emerging evidence does point toward detectable

human influence on global climate, far more than we were able to

show a couple of years ago.

      <center> <h1>               Questions - Session I     </h1>



<b>              Bert Bolin, Pieter Tans, Thomas Karl  </b>  </center>



<p>

     DR. WATSON:  The first question is one for Bert Bolin.  Why

does it matter if there is a discernible human influence on

global climate?

<p>

     DR. BOLIN:  If there is one at this stage that we can

identify with what man is doing, it is very likely that it is

going to increase.  That is after all what we are concerned

about.  Still, as I said, we have not yet assessed and quantified

the sensitivity of the climate system to changes of greenhouse

gasses and aerosols very well.  But there is a positive relation

that is quite clear, as far as I can judge.

<p>

     But maybe you aren't concerned about the warmer climate.  I

did not address impacts very much.  

<p>

     DR. WATSON:  I would add to that.  I think it starts to give

us more confidence in elements of our theoretical models, which

do of course predict significant changes in the absence of

climate policies into the future.

<p>

     I also believe it will fundamentally start to reshape the

political debate internationally, I believe it is going to be

much harder for certain delegates to argue there is no evidence

of a human influence on the climate system.  

<p>

     On a much simpler issue, stratospheric ozone depletion, once

we have established cause and effect between human activities and

stratospheric ozone, it had a major effect on the international

negotiations.

<p>

     I was asked a question.  How do you get politicians with a

short attention span to favor support for long term research and

actions?  I'm not sure the problem in the U.S. at the moment is

that they have a problem with long term research.  The problem

is, for some of them, they don't believe in these environmental

issues.  It isn't so much that you have to study them for the

long term; they have supported rather well research on

stratospheric ozone.  They have supported quite well fundamental

basic research in the National Science Foundation.

<p>

     The problem we face at the moment is that some people who

are rather influential in Congress don't believe global warming

or global change is an environmental issue that we should care

about at all.

<p>

     As far as long term action, I think we have to convince

people that climate change in the absence of policies is going to

be very serious to both the United States and the rest of the

world, and taking some near term actions will be beneficial to

economic growth and the health of the average American citizen,

let alone citizens around the world.  So I don't totally despair

that we can get them to move in the right direction, but it is a

challenge.

<p>

     To Tom Karl, Skeptics make a lot of the satellite data,

indicating recent cooling.  Can you expand on this?  You

obviously talked about it in your talk, but do you want to expand

upon this?

<p>

     DR. KARL:  I think it is very important not to be misled by

short records of 10 to 15 years.  This has been unfortunate that

at first, satellite records were looked upon as being in conflict

with the surface records, because they showed warming.  There was

some notion that the satellite was not looking at the potential

urban effects, so therefore perhaps the warming that we have seen

at the surface was purely due to urbanization. 

<p>

     Indeed, when you compare those satellite measurements with

the weather balloons, they are fairly consistent.  The satellites

themselves are not totally perfect.  In fact, just last year the

record was revised by about a six-hundredths of a degree Celsius

per decade because of some biases.  There is a lot of work that

has gone into those records to try and alleviate biases.  The

satellites don't measure the diurnal cycle completely.  As the

satellites change, some of them measure some parts of the diurnal

cycle, others measure other parts of the diurnal cycle.

<p>

     But I do not believe there is a serious inconsistency

between the satellite measurements, the weather balloons and the

surface measurements.  One has to be extraordinarily carefully

about looking at a short record and making grand conclusions.

<p>

     DR. WATSON:  Thank you.  It is quite clear that over one to

two decades, one can clearly have a natural cooling trend that

would easily offset any projected increase due to anthropogenic

emissions of greenhouse gasses.

<p>

     For Pieter Tans, what effects could the death or loss of

coral reefs have on the CO<sub>2</sub> system?

<p>

     DR. TANS:  It could have a tremendous effect.  I did talk

about it.  I showed you a titration diagram, and I talked about

bicarbonate and borate and CO<sub>2</sub>.  

<p>

     There was a lower diagram I didn't talk about, the pH.  The

pH of the oceans of course will go down as we add this carbon

dioxide.  At a certain point, coral reefs might become

susceptible to solution.

<p>

     If we manage to burn all the fossil fuel reserves, we might

get into that range.  In that case, it would also put a natural

cap on the CO<sub>2</sub> increase in the atmosphere, because the addition

of calcium ions to the ocean and would increase of the ocean's

capacity to hold carbon.  In that sense, it is good, but of

course, it is an ecological disaster of the first order.

<p>

     DR. WATSON:  A nice soft question for Dr. Bolin.  In Madrid,

several strong and particularly informative statements were

edited out of the Working Group One report solely as the result

of objections from non-scientists working in oil ministries in

Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, based on briefs provided by the U.S.

fossil fuel lobbyists.  Are you worried about this new

development?

<p>

     DR. BOLIN:  Yes, indeed.  I think we have tried in the

scientific community to accommodate different views, maybe a

little too much.  We haven't asked adequately for the scientific

justification for some of these objections.  It is a natural

trend in a scientific debate, trying to see what kind of

uncertainty we have.

<p>

     However, it was a very important decision taken.  That is,

we did separate  this very clearly on one occasion.  It will be

in the reports, an explicit statement that Saudi Arabia and

Kuwait did not agree.  I think this is very important, because it

should encourage a much more clear distinction on matters of this

kind.  

<p>

     It is not the purpose, I have said a dozen times, of the

IPCC to just try to compromise into a common view, if there are

different views, they should be reported.  I hope this is done

more in the future than it has in the past.

<p>

     With regard to the lobbyists, I note that from now on, or

soon, all lobbyists will have to declare from where they get

their incomes.  In that way, it will be much more obvious, not

least in the United States, from where these views stem.

<p>

     DR. WATSON:  I think the answer by Dr. Bolin is very

important.  More and more, some of the IPCC plenaries are

becoming negotiating sessions on particular sentences, because

some delegations realize those sentences may be quoted back in

negotiations on policy formulation under the Conference of

Parties.  I believe the approach taken by Bert Bolin and John

Horton in one instance of isolating those two particular

countries and putting them as a footnote needs to be done far

more, and we can't keep going towards the lowest common

denominator in all of our debates.  A country that has a problem,

or two or three countries that have a problem with a particular

sentence should be willing to be noted in the footnotes as having

a problem.  I think that is the approach that will be taken far

more in the future, rather than negotiating for hours to a lowest

common denominator sentence that absolutely everybody can buy

into.

<p>

     DR.WATSON:  A question for Tom Karl.  Given we are seeing a

signal of the greenhouse effect, how much of that signal can be

attributed to anthropogenic activities?  A nice easy one.

<p>

     DR. KARL:  The unfortunately part about that question is the

whole basis of what we are trying to do.  That is, it is

impossible for us to say exactly how much of the signal that we

see is due to any specific forcing.  That is why we spend a lot

of time on trying to look at estimates of natural variability and

trying to detect changes that go above that estimated natural

variability.

<p>

     But what it does speak to is the fact that as climate does

vary and change, and we see evidence for changes that exceed our

estimates of natural variability, we then are confident that what

we are seeing is in agreement with our expectations.

<p>

     Another way to look at this is that climate could be varying

naturally in a way that would enhance our ability to see

particular climate variation or variability, or give us a false

sense.  That is, the globe might be warming naturally, just

because the globe has internal variability in its warming, or it

could be cooling, just because it has some internal natural

variability.

<p>

     So the question goes both ways.  But our best estimates of

natural variability would suggest that the signals that we are

seeing are merging above and beyond that noise.

<p>

     DR. WATSON:  A question for Pieter Tans.  What if we don't

want carbon dioxide to increase to more than one thousand parts

per million?  For example, what if we want to keep CO<sub>2</sub> from

exceeding 450, what is the implication for burning all the fossil

fuels?

<p>

     DR. TANS:  It would be Draconian.  I showed the real long

term effect of it.  If we want to keep CO<sub>2</sub> below 450 ppm

permanently, I guess we would have to stop just about today,

almost.

<p>

     DR. BOLIN:  There is in the summary for Working Group One

very clear statements that if you wish to stabilize at 450, you

mustn't emit during the next 110 years more than 600 gigaton,

which is just about the average emission during the next century

as the present emissions.  But we also need from about 2100

onwards to get very much below this.  So you can peak during the

next few decades, but then you must get down.  Whether that is

possible or not remains for others to answer.

<p>

     DR. WATSON:  Yes, if you were to stabilize at today's global

emissions, you would not stabilize concentrations.  They would

continue to rise up for many centuries, passing 500 parts per

million by the end of the next century, going past 550, 560

within two centuries, and they would continue to go up, meaning

that you would have to eventually reduce the emissions back to

something like three gigatons of carbon per year.  So even

stabilization around 450 to 550 would mean very significant

cutbacks in the total amount of CO<sub>2</sub>.

<p>

     DR. TANS:  Then after that period you would have to emit

even less.  Cutting back to three gigatons is not going to do it. 

You have to go back to zero.

<p>

     DR. WATSON:  A question for Bert Bolin.  What future role do

you foresee for the IPCC in terms of assessments vis-a-vis the

role of SUBTA under the conference of parties, for those of you

who don't what SUBTA is.

<p>

     DR. BOLIN:  IPCC I think has established its credibility in

the scientific community.  That has taken five years, I would

say.  SUBTA today has no credibility within the scientific

community, naturally so.  It is by and large a political

committee.  It is an open-ended committee where anyone can be

represented.  Therefore, it is not likely that it can achieve a

scientific credibility of the kind that IPCC has.

<p>

     That may be, but why change when there is something that

works reasonably well.  That is my question.  The IPCC will

continue.  About every five years is what, not I, but scientists

are others, think is a plausible interval between such major

assessments.  But in between, there is a need to get in much more

of a dialogue with the subsidiary bodies of the convention in

order to transfer information.  But in doing so, as sharply as

possible maintain the scientific integrity of the IPCC.

<p>

     DR. WATSON:  There is a question here for Tom Karl.  Do we

really have a long enough time series of ENSO data to say that it

has been behaving in an unusual manner?  How well defined is the

normal ENSO cycle?  I can comment that in the policy makers'

summary, we say that since 1989, the persistence from '89 through

'94 is unusual in the last 120 years.  Maybe you would like to

amplify.

<p>

     DR. KARL:  When we say unusual, we are saying that word in

terms of both the direct observation we have and some evidence

from coral records that also suggests that the variability that

we have seen recently would still be considered unusual, 

inferentially suggesting that there are some very interesting

things going on with ENSO recently.

<p>

     DR. WATSON:  There is a question here for Bert Bolin.  In

Rome, should calls for striking certain chapters of the Working

Group Three Report on definition of the value of a statistical

life arise, how will they be handled?  For example, will you

refuse to open all the reports or reflect this in the synthesis

report?

<p>

     DR. BOLIN:  The working groups adopt the Summary for Policy

Makers.  When it comes up in the IPCC plenary, we must uphold

that kind of a procedure.  It is very essential.  Otherwise,

things start to just disintegrate.

<p>

     Now, anyone can request that something be added to the

minutes of the meeting in Rome.  That of course will have to be

accepted.  But it is also important to clarify that acceptance

does not mean that you agree with what is written there.  The

thing is, it is acceptance that this is a fair summary of what

the scientific community has done.  If politicians don't agree

with that, that is their business.  That is reasonably well

reflected in the kind of Policy Makers' Summary that Working

Group One was able to agree on, which is implicitly some

criticism of the underlying chapter, in that it has been too

stringently based on rather formalistic assumptions with regard

to how you assess costs and benefits.  

<p>

     Procedures as we have them must be upheld very stringently.

<p>

     DR. WATSON:  A question to no one in particular.  What is

the global warming potential of water vapor?  The answer is, IPCC

has not calculated one.  There is another question that is

somewhat linked.  I'll phrase it.  Are carbon dioxide and water

vapor included in GCMs for calculating global temperature?  The

answer is quite clearly, the way we drive the GCMs or the simple

box Upwellan models of climate is by changing the emissions of

gasses such as carbon dioxide, methane and CFCs and nitrous oxide

into the atmosphere, and looking at the response.  None of the

GCMs assume a change in emissions of water vapor, but water vapor

should respond to changes in the temperature structure of the

earth's atmosphere.  Hence, water vapor, both in the lower and

upper troposphere, is a feedback mechanism to the perturbation or

the change in radiated forcing of greenhouse gasses.  Hence, we

use water vapor as a response to forcing, not as a forcing

mechanism directly in its own right.

<p>

     So clearly, the GCMs do take into account changes in both

carbon dioxide and water vapor, and their influence on the

radiated balance both in the troposphere and the stratosphere,

both are quite important.

<p>

     DR.WATSON:  A question for Tom Karl.  Why do you suppose

there is no evidence of increased incidence of extreme drought in

the warm season within the USA?

<p>

     DR. KARL:  I think there are two reasons that that has not

occurred.  One is, the 1930s drought event in the U.S. was such a

spectacular event, it may indeed be very ill-advised to focus on

looking at changes in drought frequencies in the U.S. as being a

greenhouse signal, simply because it would take a long time for

that type of event to be smeared out in the record.

<p>

     Secondly, we have found an increase in cloud cover over the

U.S.  Part of this could perhaps be due to the El Ni&#241;o southern

oscillation event.  Part of it also may be related to natural

variability.  Another part could be related to indirect effects

of sulfate aerosols.  All these are possibilities.  But

nonetheless, the addition of cloud cover does tend to make the

maximum temperature less than what it might otherwise have been. 

Therefore, we don't see a tremendous rise in the increase of

extreme events associated with drought.

<p>

     If you look at the records, there is a slight indication of

a greater portion of the U.S. having more extreme and severe

droughts, but it is very slight.  We would be splitting hairs to

say it is anything other than no change at all.  But again, the

drought event in the '30s, that really stands out.

<p>

     DR. WATSON:  A question for Bert Bolin. Your correlation

coefficient was 0.3 for modeled and observed delta temperature. 

What is the statistically significance of that number, and is the

correlation convincing to the eye?

<p>

     DR. BOLIN:  Yes, it is convincing to the eye.  You can look

up the picture in Chapter 8 of Working Group One, where this is

clearly brought home. It is much better that you look at that 

than let me explain it to you, because those writing that are

much more knowledgeable than I am.  But it is a clear indication

that the correlation between model and observed patterns has

increased with time over the last 20 or 30 years.

<p>

     It is not an exact agreement in any way, because of the

natural variability, essentially.  But there is an increasing

resemblance between these two patterns in the course of time.

<p>

     DR. WATSON:  In fact, if you look at the diagram shown by

both Bert Bolin and Tom Karl, the model which had CO<sub>2</sub> only, 
and

look at the pattern of the CO<sub>2</sub> only and the observations, you

have a negative correlation that is getting worse with time; it

just goes down.  If you then bring in the fact that there has

also been a change of sulfate aerosols and other aerosols and a

depletion of stratospheric ozone, you find a positive correlation

between the observations and the theoretical models increasing

with time.

<p>

     So I think it is rather convincing.  We saw some of this

information in Madrid.  It is obviously in the assessment

documents.  It is rather convincing, even to the eye.  So I think

the point Tom Karl made is the most important.  Any one piece of

information could be challenged.  It is the ensemble of all of

the information, the agreement of the global mean annual

temperature over the last hundred years with the theoretical

models, that take into account both greenhouse gasses and

aerosols.  It is the latitudinal and longitudinal distribution

and the vertical distribution, when you take all of that ensemble

into account, then it starts to become quite convincing that you

can make this cause and effect statement, as we have in Working

Group One.

     Climate change, whether anthropogenic in origin or not,

results in major changes in the structure of terrestrial

ecosystems.  These changes involve not only shifts in the

composition of plant and animal communities, but also the

distribution of nutrients with these systems.  These structural and

composition shifts impact both the biological as well as service

functions played by terrestrial systems.  Hamburg reviews the kinds

of system changes that can be expected over the next 100 years, and

the implications of those changes on the preservation of natural

communities and the production of extractable commodities.

  <center><h1>  Potential Impact of Climate Change on

                   Agriculture and Food Supply  </h1>



                     <b>    David W. Wolfe    <br>

                       Cornell University    </b> </center>

<p>



     Will climate change help or hinder our efforts to maintain

an adequate food supply for the increasing world population of

the next century?  Which regions are likely to benefit and which

are likely to suffer food shortages and socioeconomic crises? 

Could the beneficial effects of increasing atmospheric carbon

dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) on plants (the so-called "CO<sub>2</sub> 
fertilization

effect") counteract some of the negative effects of climate

change?  What types of adaptations and policies will be necessary

to take advantage of the opportunities and minimize the negative

impacts of climate change on agriculture?  What will the cost of

these adaptations and policies be?

<p>

     To address these questions scientists from various

disciplines have linked together climate, crop growth, and

economic-food trade computer models.  These multi-layered models

are extremely complex and contain numerous assumptions about the

physical, biological, and socioeconomic systems they attempt to

simulate.  Nevertheless, they represent the most comprehensive

analyses we have at present.  They can be useful to policymakers,

particularly if there is an educated appreciation for the level

of uncertainty inherent in their projections.  Before presenting

model outcomes, we will first review some fundamental aspects of

what we know and don't know about how crop plants respond to

temperature and increases in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>.


<p>


<b>Temperature Effects on Plants</b>

<p>

      Most plant processes related to growth and yield are highly

temperature dependent.   We can identify an optimum temperature

range for maximum yield for any one crop.  Crop species are often

classified as warm- or cool-season types.  The optimum growth

temperature frequently corresponds to the optimum temperature for

photosynthesis, the process by which plants absorb CO<sub>2</sub> from the

atmosphere and convert it to sugars used for energy and growth. 

Temperature also affects the rate of plant development.  Higher

temperatures speed annual crops through their developmental

phases.  This shortens the life cycle of determinate species like

grain crops, which only set seed once and then stop producing. 

<a href="figures/wolfefig1.gif">Figure 1</a> illustrates the temperature 
effects on photosynthesis

and crop growth duration.  It shows that for a variety currently

being grown in a climate near its optimum, a temperature increase

of several degrees could reduce photosynthesis and shorten the

growing period.  Both of these effects will tend to reduce

yields.

<p>

     The particular crop varieties currently being grown in major

production areas are usually those best-adapted to the current

climate.  A significant increase in growing season temperatures

will require shifts to new varieties that are more heat tolerant,

do not mature too quickly, and have a higher temperature optimum

for photosynthesis.  Developing such varieties should be possible

for many crop species, but there are limits to what can be

accomplished through plant breeding and modern genetic

engineering approaches.  In many cases traditional crops will

have to be abandoned for new crops better suited to the new

environment.  For farmers in very cool regions, where the current

climate limits their crop options, global warming will be mostly

a benefit, giving them the opportunity to grow a wider range of

crops and long-growing-season, high-yielding varieties. 

<p>

     Some plant species require a cold period before they will

produce flowers and a harvestable product.  The process, called

vernalization, tends to have very narrow temperature and duration

boundaries.  Vernalization of winter wheat, for example,

requires temperature to be between 0 and 11 &#176;C (32 and 52 &#176;F),

with an optimum near 3 &#176;C (37 &#176;F)  for a period of 6 to 8 weeks. 

Production of the seed of many biennial vegetable crops has

similar requirements.  Even a minor climate shift of 1-2 &#176;C could

have a substantial impact on the geographic range of these crops.


<p>


<b> Temperature Effects on Livestock </b>

<p>

     Climate change will affect livestock production indirectly

by its impact on the availability and price of animal feed.  Farm

animals are also directly affected by temperature.  <a 
href="figures/wolfefig2.gif">Figure 2</a>

illustrates that animal species differ in their temperature

optimum range.  Young animals have a very narrow and specific

temperature optimum.  A rise in temperatures in regions currently

near the threshold of the optimum range could be detrimental to

production.  Construction and maintenance of controlled

environment facilities to house farm animals is costly and will

not be a viable option for many.


<p>


<b> Carbon Dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) Effects on Plants </b>

<p>



     The debate over whether CO<sub>2</sub> and other greenhouse gases are

warming the planet continues, but few question the fact that

atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> is increasing exponentially and will likely

double (to 700 parts per million (ppm)) within the next century. 

This has a potential beneficial effect on the Earth's plant life

because plants take up CO<sub>2</sub> via photosynthesis and use it to

produce sugars and grow.  If this "CO<sub>2</sub> fertilization effect" is

large, it could significantly increase the capacity of plant

ecosystems to absorb and temporarily store excess carbon.  It

could also lead to significant increases in crop productivity.


<p>


 <b>    CO<sub>2</sub> and photosynthesis </b>

<p>

     The biochemistry of photosynthesis differs among plant

species, and this greatly affects their relative response to CO<sub>2</sub>. 

Most economically important crop and weed species can be

classified as either a C3 or C4 type, the names referring to

whether the early products of photosynthesis are compounds with

three or four carbon atoms.  It has been well known for many

years that the C3 photosynthetic pathway is less efficient than

the C4 pathway.  Because of this, C3 plants benefit much more

from increases in CO<sub>2</sub> than C4 plants <a 
href="figures/wolfefig3.gif">(Fig. 3)</a>.  Over 90 percent

of the world's plant species are the C3 type, including wheat,

rice, potato, bean, most vegetable and fruit crops, and many weed

species.  However, the C4 group includes the important food

crops, maize, millet, sugarcane, and sorghum, as well as many

pasture grasses and weed species.  These C4 crops will benefit

little from a CO<sub>2</sub> doubling.

<p>

     The CO<sub>2</sub> response curves shown in <a 
href="figures/wolfefig3.gif">Figure 3</a> are typical of

results from experiments where plants are grown under optimal

conditions and current ambient CO<sub>2</sub> concentration (350 ppm). 
The

magnitude of the CO<sub>2</sub> response often changes when plants are

acclimated to a high CO<sub>2</sub> environment (e.g., 700 ppm).  Usually

the beneficial effects decline with long-term exposure to high

CO<sub>2</sub>, but in some instances they increase.  Identifying the

mechanisms of both upward and downward photosynthetic acclimation

to CO<sub>2</sub> is an important area of current research.  The greatest

benefits from CO<sub>2</sub> tend to occur when plants are able to expand

their "sink capacity" for the products of photosynthesis by, for

example, producing more flowers and fruit when grown at high 
CO<sub>2</sub>. 

When genetic or environmental factors limit growth and sink

capacity, sugars build up in the leaves, a negative feedback on

photosynthesis occurs  and the benefits from elevated CO<sub>2</sub> 
become

minimal.  This explains why maximum CO<sub>2</sub> benefits usually 
require

an optimum environment and increased inputs of water and

fertilizers.  A research priority in the future will be breeding 

for genotypes that take full advantage of increases in CO<sub>2</sub>.

<p>

<b>     CO<sub>2</sub> and crop water use  </b>

<p>

     Another important direct effect of high CO<sub>2</sub> on plants (both

C3 and C4 species) is a partial closure of the small pores, or

stomates, of the leaves.  This restricts the escape of water

vapor from the leaves (transpiration) more than it restricts

photosynthesis.  Some have suggested that this will moderate the

increase in crop water requirements anticipated to occur in a

global warming scenario. However, significant water savings have

seldom been observed in experiments designed to test the

hypothesis.  Although plants grown at high CO<sub>2</sub> transpire less

water per unit leaf area, their leaves are frequently larger and

there are more of them so that whole plant water use is similar

to or greater than plants grown at normal CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations.

<p>

     The stomatal response to CO<sub>2</sub> does appear to have some

beneficial impact under water-limited conditions.  Several

studies have found that the relative beneficial effect of a CO<sub>2</sub>

doubling on growth is greater under mild water stress conditions

than when water supply is optimum. The absolute benefit from 
CO<sub>2</sub>

is nevertheless maximum when water is not limiting growth.

<p>

 <b>    CO<sub>2</sub> and crop yield  </b>
 
<p>

     Most of our information regarding the yield response to CO<sub>2</sub>

is based on controlled environment experiments, where plants were

well supplied with water and nutrients, temperatures were near

optimum, and pressure from weeds, disease and insect pests were

nonexistent.  Under such optimum conditions a doubling of

CO<sub>2</sub> (e.g., from 350 to 700 ppm) typically increases the yield of

C3 crops by 20 - 35%. While this describes the average, there are

reports in the literature of lower yield responses in some slow-

growing winter vegetables such as cabbage, and reports of higher

yield responses in some fast-growing indeterminate species such

as cotton and citrus.  Maize and other C4 crops typically have

yield increases of less than lO% with a CO<sub>2</sub> doubling, as might 
be

expected from their photosynthetic response <a 
href="figures/wolfefig3.gif">(Fig. 3)</a>.

<p>

     Several recent reviews have emphasized that when plants grow

in a field situation, the optimum conditions required for full

realization of the benefits from CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment are seldom, if

ever, maintained.  This is particularly true for natural

ecosystems and for agricultural systems in developing nations

where irrigation, fertilizer, herbicides, and pesticides are not

available or prohibitively expensive.  Even in developed

countries, the increase in inputs sometimes necessary for maximum

CO<sub>2</sub> benefit may not be cost-effective or may be limited by

concerns regarding resource conservation or environmental

quality.

<p>

     The specific temperature range for realization of a positive

CO<sub>2</sub> effect varies, but for most crops the beneficial effects

become minimal at temperatures below about 15 &#176;C (59 &#176;F). This

has important implications for temperate regions of the world

where, despite global warming, average temperatures during early

and late portions of the growing season will be too cool to

expect much benefit from a CO<sub>2</sub> doubling.  Where excessively 
high

temperatures (e.g. above 38 &#176;C or 100 &#176;F) occur, flowering and

pollination of many crop species will be impaired.  Yields will

be very low regardless of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels.

<p>

<b>     CO<sub>2</sub> and weed, disease, and insect pests   </b>

<p>

     An increase in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> is just as likely to increase

the growth rate of weed species as cash crops.  To date, most of

our information regarding crop response to CO<sub>2</sub> is based on

experiments in which competition from weeds was not a factor. 

Important C4 crops, such as maize and sugarcane, may experience

yield reductions because of increased competition from C3 weeds. 

However, broad generalizations regarding CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment 
effects

on crop-weed competition provide little insight into the specific

weed control challenges that farmers will have to face in the

coming century. The site-specific mix of weed and crop species,

and the relative response of each of these species to

environmental conditions in the future CO<sub>2</sub>-rich world, will

determine the economic outcome for both farmers and consumers.

<p>

     Recent research examining the effect of elevated CO<sub>2</sub> on

insect damage has found that leaf-feeding insects often must

consume more foliage to survive on high CO<sub>2</sub>-grown plants,

presumably because the leaves tend to have a lower protein

concentration.  Natural selection would tend to favor the

evolution of insect genotypes that consume more plant material

more rapidly.  To combat this, farmers may be required to use

more pesticides.

<p>

     The climate changes that result from increased atmospheric

CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations will undoubtedly influence the geographic

range of insect and disease pests.  Warmer temperatures in high

latitude areas may allow more insects to overwinter in these

areas.  Also, crop damage from plant diseases is likely to

increase in temperate regions because many fungal and bacterial

diseases have a greater potential to reach severe levels when

temperatures are warmer or when precipitation increases.

<p>



<b> Model Projections of Climate Change Impact on Food Supply  </b>

<p>

    <b> Global assessment  </b>
<p>
     Several groups have attempted to model the impact of climate

change on crop yields and food supply.  A particularly

comprehensive approach, involving the collaboration of many

scientists worldwide, is that described by Rosenzweig and Parry

(1993, 1994).  They linked global climate model outputs with crop

growth models, and then used the yield projections as inputs into

a world food trade model. The analysis considered climate

uncertainties by comparing results from three different general

circulation models (GCMs), those from the NASA Goddard Institute

for Space Studies (GISS), the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics

Laboratory (GDFL) and the UK Meteorological Office (UKMO).  Two

levels of farmer adaptation to climate change, and the potential

direct effects of CO<sub>2</sub> were also considered.

<p>

     <a href="figures/wolfetable1.gif">Table 1</a> shows estimated yield 
changes for several important

cereal crops.  It is clear that regardless of GCM used, climate

change had a substantial negative effect on yield unless a

beneficial effect from elevated CO<sub>2</sub> is assumed.  With a 
CO<sub>2</sub>

fertilization effect, the impact of climate change on wheat and

soybeans shifts from negative to positive for the GISS and GDFL

climate scenarios, and rice yields also significantly improve. 

Maize yields remain substantially negative because this C4 crop

is assumed to benefit little from an equivalent CO<sub>2</sub> doubling.    

<p>

     The CO<sub>2</sub> effect was incorporated into the crop models as a

simple multiplier, increasing predicted yields of soybeans,

wheat, rice, and maize by 34, 22, 19, and 7%, respectively.  To

obtain these values, the modelers had to rely on the published

literature, which, as discussed above, is dominated by

experiments conducted under optimum conditions.  The CO<sub>2</sub> 
effect

multiplier was applied without taking into account the likely

profound effect of regional, seasonal, and daily temperature

variations on the magnitude of CO<sub>2</sub> response. The predicted 
yields

with CO<sub>2</sub> effects in <a href="figures/wolfetable1.gif">Table 
1</a>, therefore, probably overestimate the

yield response to CO<sub>2</sub> in many cases. On this point the authors

themselves warn "... there is always uncertainty regarding

whether experimental results will be observed in the open field

conditions likely to be operative when farmers are managing

crops." (Rosenzweig and Parry, 1993. p. 92).

<p>

     There was considerable regional variation in yield response

to climate change as indicated in <a href="figures/wolfetable2.gif">Table 
2</a> which shows predicted

wheat yields for several countries.  Yield increases in the

highest latitude locations, for example in parts of Canada and

the former USSR, were due to an extension of the frost-free

growing season and improved temperatures for productivity.  The

optimistic assumptions regarding effects of CO<sub>2</sub> also caused

substantial yield benefits in all areas.  Decreased yields were

associated with faster plant development rates that shortened the

growing period, decreases in water availability, and poor

vernalization of winter wheat.

<p>

     Many developing nations are in tropical or subtropical areas

where a global warming will be of little benefit, and often a

detriment, to crop yields.  Also, these areas frequently have

less capacity for irrigation, which becomes a more serious

drawback in some climate scenarios where rainfall does not meet

the increasing crop water requirements.  These factors, combined

with a relatively high population growth rate, will tend to

increase the probability of food shortages in many developing

nations.  <a href="figures/wolfefig4.gif">Figure 4</a> illustrates the large 
discrepancy in predicted

cereal production for developed vs. developing nations.  This

particular analysis assumed direct positive CO<sub>2</sub> effects, and

"Level 1" adaptation to climate change by farmers, which included

shifts in planting date, additional irrigation in areas with

existing irrigation capacity, and changing to better adapted crop

varieties from the existing pool of varieties available.  <a 
href="figures/wolfefig5.gif">Figure

5</a> shows the predicted increase in risk of world hunger with

climate change and various levels of farmer adaptation.

Adaptation Level 2 included development of new irrigations

systems, increase in fertilizer application, and development of

new varieties.  This analysis shows that only if we assume Level

2 farmer adaptation capacity and an optimistic beneficial effect

of elevated CO<sub>2</sub> on yields are the risks of hunger likely to not

increase beyond what we would expect without climate change.

<p>

      <b> U.S. agriculture </b>

<p>
     Most analyses have concluded that although there will be

both winners and losers within the U.S. agricultural sector,

overall productivity is not likely to decline to the point of

threatening national food security unless climate change is

severe. The magnitude and direction of the predicted impact on

U.S. agriculture varies depending on assumptions about climate

and plant response to CO<sub>2</sub>.  For example, the comprehensive 
study

by Adams et al. (1990) predicted a 9% increase in production of

field crops (included wheat, soybean, sorghum, cotton, oats,

maize, hay and silage) using the GISS climate scenario, or a 20%

yield decrease with the GFDL climate model. The GFDL model

predicts slightly warmer, drier conditions for some regions of

the U.S. than the GISS model. This assessment assumed an

optimistic 20 - 35% yield boost due to the CO<sub>2</sub> fertilization

effect.  The economic component of their analysis predicted that

for the more severe GFDL climate scenario, U.S. consumers would

face moderately higher food prices, but the major impact would be

on exports.  Both climate scenarios predicted significant

reductions in cropped acreage in the Southeast, Southern Plains,

and Northeast, and increases in the Northern Plains, Great Lakes,

and Rocky Mountain regions.


<p>


<b> Can Farmers Adapt to Climate Change?  </b>

<p>

     Farmers in developing nations will be least able to adapt to

climate change because of a relatively weak agricultural research

base, poor availability of inputs such as water and seed of new

varieties, and inadequate capital for making adjustments at both

the farm and national level.

<p>

     In contrast, the U.S. and many other developed nations have

a strong agricultural research base, abundant natural resources

for flexibility in cropping patterns, and capital available to

pay for adaptations and buffer negative economic effects during

transition.  For this reason many are optimistic that farmers in

developed nations will be able to take advantage of opportunities

and minimize negative effects associated with climate change.

<p>

     Adapting to climate change will be costly, however.  Costs

at the farm level will include such things as increased use of

water, fertilizer and pesticides to maximize beneficial effects

of higher CO<sub>2</sub>, and investment in new farm equipment and 
storage

facilities as shifts are made to new crop varieties and new

crops.  Costs at the national level will include substantial

diversion of agricultural research dollars to climate change

issues, and major infrastructure investments, such as

construction of new dams and reservoirs to meet increased crop

water requirements.  Environmental costs associated with

agricultural expansion into some regions could include increased

soil erosion, increased risk of ground and surface water

pollution,  depletion of water resources, and loss of wildlife

habitat.

<p>

     Developed as well as developing nations must be prepared to

deal with the citizens in those regions negatively impacted by

climate change.  Regardless of capital availability, agricultural

economies in some areas will collapse due to factors such as

excessively high temperatures, severe pest pressure, lack of

locally adapted varieties or poor markets for adapted crops.  As

climatic zones shift, there will be some cases where those zones

with the best climate for crops will not have good soils or

available water.  It would be wise to begin examining national

policies for their ability to handle these climate change issues. 

The CAST report on preparing the U.S. for climate change (CAST,

1992) emphasized the need for climate change-related agricultural

research and suggested modifying existing policies to encourage

more flexible land use, more prudent use of water resources, and

freer trade.


<p>


<b> Summary</b>

<p>

     The three major uncertainties regarding impacts of climate

change on agriculture are:  (1) the magnitude of regional changes

in temperature and precipitation; (2) the magnitude of the

beneficial effects of higher CO<sub>2</sub> on crop yields; and (3) the

ability of farmers to adapt to climate change.  Current

assessments suggest that, in all three categories, developed

nations will frequently be at an advantage compared to most

developing nations.

<p>

     With regard to climate, many developed nations are in mid-

to high-latitude locations, where warmer temperatures may improve

crop yields by extending the growing season.  In contrast, many

developing nations are in subtropical and tropical areas, where

global warming may lead to excessively high temperatures and

reduce yields.

<p>

     Many crop models account for the CO<sub>2</sub> effect by globally

increasing yields of C3 crops by 20 - 35%, which assumes a near

optimum growth environment.  Field conditions are seldom optimum,

but farmers with access to adequate water, fertilizer, and other

inputs will likely gain more from a CO<sub>2</sub> doubling than farmers 
who

do not have these resources. Temperatures may become too hot, or

be too low despite global warming, for beneficial effects of CO<sub>2</sub>

in some areas.  It should also be noted that those farmers

producing C4 crops, such as maize, sorghum, millet  and

sugarcane, will see very little benefit from higher CO<sub>2</sub>, and at

the same time their crops will face increased competition from C3

weeds.

<p>

     Farmers in developed nations will have an obvious advantage

in adapting to climate change because of a strong agricultural

research base and capital available for farm inputs and

infrastructure investments.  Food security in these countries may

not be directly threatened, and overall productivity may even

increase, if global warming is moderate and the frequency of

severe weather events does not increase However, adapting to

climate change will be costly.  Even within countries that

benefit at the national level, climate change is likely to have

negative economic and environmental impacts in some areas as

production zones shift.

<p>

     Studies integrating climate, crop, and food trade models

suggest that a moderate climate change may have only a small

impact on world food production because reduced yields in some

parts of the globe are offset by increased yields in others. 

Despite this, severe food shortages are likely to occur in some

developing nations because of trade and local climate and

resource constraints.  This will have political consequences at

the global level.  Climate change will likely lead to an increase

in world hunger unless population growth rates in developing

nations are much smaller than currently projected, and farmers

obtain adequate assistance.  Adapting to climate change with

minimal economic, social, and political upheaval will require a

coordinated international effort to deal with the many serious

consequences of climate change on agriculture.

       Implications for Sustainable Health and Development </h1>



              <b>       Jonathan Patz, MD, MPH   <br>

<p>



<b> Introduction  </b>

<p>

     According to the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on

Climate Change (IPCC), anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions are

significantly altering the earth's climate. By the year 2100,

average global temperatures are projected to rise by 2.O&#176;C, and sea

level is anticipated to rise by nearly 50 cm. (1)  This represents

a five-fold faster rate of warming and a three-fold higher rate of

sea level rise than that observed over the past century. While

uncertainties accompany predictive climate modeling, the increasing

agreement between climate projections arising from varying

methodologies in multiple climate centers is cause for concern

among the medical community. The World Health Organization already

considers global warming as a serious threat to sustainable public

health. (2,3)

<p>

     Paralleling the concept of sustainability in the context of

development, sustainable health is the promotion of health for

people today without compromising resources needed by future

generations to achieve the same level of health. The long-term

nature of the health impacts from climate change, therefore, will

necessitate increased attention by economic strategists as they

plot a course for sustainable development.  After all, sustainable

economic development will be undermined if the health of the

population is threatened.


<p>


<b> Expected Health Effects </b>

<p>

     Under the conditions of global warming, direct hazards to

human health (e.g., urban heat-island effect and harmful air

pollution) may become significant public health problems given

current trends in urbanization. Warmer temperatures combined with

increased ambient UV radiation could worsen photochemical smog,

especially over urban areas. Elevated night-time temperature

readings are the most significant meteorological variable

contributing to heat-related mortality; the greenhouse effect is

predicted to especially affect these minimum temperatures and

studies estimate a 3-4-fold increase in heat-mortality in large

temperate US cites under a doubled atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> scenario. 
(4)

<p>

     Infectious agents which cycle through cold-blooded insect

vectors to complete their development are quite susceptible to

subtle climate variations. (5) In temperate regions, climate change

would affect vector-borne diseases by altering the vector's range,

reproductive and biting rates, as well as pathogen development rate

within the vector host. (6)

<p>

     Malaria and dengue fever serve as prime examples of climate

sensitive diseases. The geographic range of malaria is generally

limited to the tropics and subtropics because the Plasmodium

parasite requires an average temperature above 16&#176; C to develop.

(7) Malaria has been observed in non endemic high elevations in

Africa during unseasonably warm conditions. (8)

<p>

     Freezing temperatures kill overwintering eggs of Aedes

aegypti, the mosquito carrier of dengue and yellow fever.  Warming

trends, therefore, can shift vector and disease distribution to

higher latitudes or altitudes, (9) as was observed in Mexico when

dengue reached an altitude of 1,700 meters during an unseasonably

warm summer in 1988. (10) In an earlier study in Mexico, the most

important predictor of dengue prevalence in communities was found

to be the median temperature during the rainy season. (11)

<p>

     Temperature also drives epidemic dynamics of dengue

transmission. Warmer water temperatures in breeding vessels reduces

the size of emerging adults that subsequently must feed more

frequently' to develop an egg batch. (12) Viral development time

inside the mosquito also shortens with higher temperatures,

increasing the proportion of mosquitoes that become infectious at

a given time. (13) Thus, mosquitoes bite more frequently and are

potentially more infectious at warmer temperatures.

<p>

     Climate-related increases in sea surface temperature can lead

to higher incidence of water-borne cholera and shellfish poisoning. 

Marine phytoplankton blooms include red tides that cause diarrheal

and paralytic diseases. Vibrio cholera has been found to be

associated with zooplankton, and blooms from warmer sea surface

temperatures could expand this important reservoir from which

cholera epidemics may arise. (14,15)

<p>

     Human migration and damage to health infrastructures from the

projected increase in climate variability and severity of storms

could threaten human shelters and public health infrastructures and

indirectly contribute to disease transmission. Human susceptibility

to disease might be further compounded by malnutrition due to

climate impacts on agriculture. (16,17) 


<p>


<b> Sustainable Health and Development  </b>

<p>

     The World Commission on Environment and Development clearly

illustrated that national governments can no longer separate

economic development from environmental issues. (18) Now it is also

clear that both development and environment can not be separated

from human health.  In the short-term, development generally

improves human health which is usually related to per capita

income.  The health implications from climate change, however,

present a unique "exposure pathway" never before addressed by the

health community.  Adverse outcomes that arise from disturbance of

global environmental systems, such as the climate system will

require more integrated preventive measures which take into account

both long-term environmental and economic forces.

<p>

     Development is central to policy directed towards climate

change.  Development accounts for the creation of anthropogenic

greenhouse gases (causing the root exposure hazard), and defines

the extent to which nations remain vulnerable to the consequences

of climate change. (19)  With heightened awareness of the linkages

between global climate/ecological systems and sustainable public

health, we can no longer make health assessments based solely on

local environmental conditions.  Local and regional development

must be internationally coordinated with consideration of these

long-term population health consequences.

<p>

     Developing countries will suffer disproportionately more from

the consequences of climate change, though industrialized nations

are presently more responsible for GHGs in the atmosphere.  In the

future, poorer countries will influence the course of global

warming significantly more, (20) both through the technologies they

choose to adopt as their development accelerates, and by land use

practices.  Much of the responsibility for insuring prudent policy

shifts lies with those nations already having established health

infrastructures; their development occurred prior to the

realization of the adverse impacts of short-sighted economic goals

on global systems that serve as foundations for sustaining human

health.

<p>

     The insidious nature of the "exposure" of climate change also

requires shifting attention to the health of future generations. 

No less priority should be given to current health crises, however,

the scope of public health needs a broader focus to begin to

anticipate intergenerational health challenges already requiring

preventive measures.  In planning adaptive measures (e.g., air

conditioning and vector control strategies) long-term impacts must

therefore be considered.  For example  increased energy demand for

air conditioning will exacerbate greenhouse gas emissions and

widespread pesticide applications can promote insect resistance, as

well as impact human health directly through toxic exposures.

<P>

     Precautionary measures aimed at reducing greenhouse warming

will also have inherently beneficial side-effects, or "ancillary

benefits" for public health.  Reducing air pollution and population

growth, for example, have obvious short-term positive impacts on

health.  In a sense these short-term gains weigh favorably in the

policy debate which must consider potentially irrevocable and

widespread health consequences together with vast uncertainties.

<p>

     Finally, we must be cautious in our interpretation of the

concept of sustainable development.  One interpretation dangerous

to sustainable health is that of an "economically stable but

ecologically impoverished world." (21) The ecologically-based

nature of the health effects of climate change necessitate full-

cost-accounting of both environmental and health concerns stemming

from economic development.


<p>


<b> Conclusion  </b>

<p>

     New understanding of the linkages between public health and

"global life-support systems" is emerging in the literature. (22) 

Prime examples are those of stratospheric ozone depletion, climate

change and threatened fisheries which have enormous implications

for public health, but may not be immediately perceptible.  Through

new collaborative efforts we can begin to confront these challenges

and advance that much further in the practice of "sustainable"

preventive medicine.

<p>

     What is uniquely challenging about global environmental change

is that the issues transcend local communities.  The causes are

collective and multifactorial, and the impacts will be global and

unconfined by national borders.  The public health community is now

confronted by indirect and delayed effects on life-sustaining

systems on a global scale. (23) The attributable risks of such

population-wide exposures can lead to tremendous disease burdens,

and therefore, demands increased attention by the public health and

economic development communities.

<p>

     In the history of public health, our reductionist approach to

research and prevention has to this point been quite successful in

identifying single etiologic agents, including microorganisms,

direct chemical toxins, and specific harmful human behaviors.  The

health effects expected from global climate change, however, will

involve exposure factors (or processes) that will likely be

ecologically-based and difficult to quantify over extended time

scales. (24) This relationship between ecosystem stability and

long-term human health underscores the importance of far-sighted

sustainable development and reinforces the need for integration of

sustainable health and development policies.

     The preponderance of the earth's population lives on or near

the seacoast.  This large population threatens the health and

survival of coastal and estuarine systems when the seas rise.

<p>

     Low lying lands close to the oceans would be flooded as the

waters rise, creating new estuarine areas, but human interference

will largely mitigate this and the salt marshes will tend to

disappear.

<p>

     Sea level will rise due to the thermal expansion of the

water and partly from melted glaciers.  This threatens many areas

of the world, especially Bangladesh, Egypt, the Netherlands, and

some island countries.  Salt marshes, which contribute greatly to

biological productivity, will be depleted.

<p>

     Warming of ocean and coastal waters will affect many natural

systems.  As waters warm, many species will be able to adapt or

migrate to cooler areas but sessile organisms may succumb where

rapid warming occurs.  Already some coral reef organisms are

showing mortality from El Ni&#241;o effects and some bivalves in local

areas are becoming extinct.  However, human intervention (over-

fishing, pollution, etc.) may be more important in species

extinction than climate change alone.  We must conclude that

changing temperatures will influence patterns of distribution and

abundance of marine life.  This will affect fisheries.

<p>

     Increased rainfall will dilute the saline environment in

some coastal areas with deleterious affects on biological

systems.  Lower levels of local rainfall may also result in salt

intrusion into water bodies which are presently widely used for

municipal water supplies.  Also, increased frequency and severity

of storms would seriously affect coaster cities and low-lying

islands.

<p>

     It is difficult to predict the direction and scale of

climate changes in regional and global areas.  Some predictions

are fairly certain but lack of data and the complexity of natural

systems reduce prediction to "informed speculation."  It seems

prudent to scale back greenhouse gasses, to practice sustainable

ecological and economic resource use, and to develop the data

needed to mitigate challenges to the coastal zone.

 <center><h1>              Mitigation Options -- Energy Supply  </h1>



<b> A. Denny Ellerman  <br>

Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research

<p>



 

     It is important to pay attention to mitigation options that 

concern energy supply.  Before proceeding with a brief survey of 

the alternatives for reducing greenhouse gas emissions on the

supply side, I want to distinguish between what might be

considered demand side and supply side options.   


<p>


<b> The Nature of Supply Side Options </b>

<p>

     Demand side options are based upon the observation that

energy is supplied to meet certain basic human needs, such as

heat, mobility, or lighting.  Demand side actions seek either to

change the demand for the basic service or to meet that demand

without the use of energy.  Such changes of demand are one way to

affect energy supply, and thus to mitigate greenhouse gas

emissions; but they are not what I mean by a supply side option. 

Instead let us define a supply side action as one which takes

some level of energy supply as given.  It may be that the level

of supply and demand is too great or too little, but that is

another matter.  In effect,  supply side options may be regarded

as those actions which can be taken to mitigate greenhouse gas

emissions given some irreducible level of energy supply. 

Accordingly, supply side options can be defined as methods of

obtaining energy without carbon, or with less carbon.

<p>

     In considering supply side options, a long term perspective 

must be maintained; in fact, a near term focus will be not only

frustrating, but it can be counter-productive in obscuring what

can be accomplished over long time horizons.  Most of the near

term supply actions to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions take on

the characteristics of a tax; and we know the reception these

proposals receive in the political system.  Fortunately, global

change is a longer term problem.

<p>

     A longer term perspective is appropriate, not so much for

reasons of political expediency, but because of the nature of the

demand for energy and the relation of energy to carbon.  The

demand for the services provided by energy is very strong, so

strong that it can be regarded almost as universal across

cultures and time.  The demand for these basic services can be

influenced, but it is very fundamental and not easily changed. 

Carbon is not so fundamental; it is only one attribute of the

particular forms of energy that we use today.  In particular, the

greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide, is a residual or by-product of

our current forms of energy supply.  It is not essential to

meeting the demand for those basic human services.  Therein, lies

the promise of a longer term approach to supply side mitigation

and the opportunity for lower carbon trajectories.  Thus, when a

longer term perspective is adopted, it becomes possible to change

carbon trajectories in ways that do not imply a tax or equivalent

restriction on the basic needs that create the demand for energy.

<p>

     Broadly speaking, there are three supply side options: 

removal and sequestration, altering the conventional energy mix, 

and new carbon-free technology.  Lets look at removal and

sequestration first.


<p>


<b> Removal and Sequestration </b>

<p>

     The United States and some other countries have effected

significant reductions of other pollutants that are associated

with energy supply, such as sulfur dioxide and particulates, by

end-of-pipe technology and process changes.  Given this

successful precedent, it is natural to ask why the same cannot be

done with carbon dioxide.  Technically, carbon dioxide can be

removed from waste gas streams by methods analogous to what is

done for sulfur dioxide, particulates and other criteria

pollutants.  The first problem is cost:  because the volume to be

removed is so large, the cost of CO2 scrubbing is much greater

than for other pollutants.  Important as this problem is, the

real obstacle is disposal, or the more apt term for carbon

dioxide, sequestration.  Unlike other pollutants, simply

disposing of the captured pollutant in a less offending media is

not adequate, it must be isolated or sequestered. 

<p>

     The residue from particulate or sulfur dioxide removal is

easily handled and lends itself to a variety of uses.  Typically,

the residue can be stored in the ground in a manner much less

offending than if left in the air; but we have also discovered a 

variety of ways to recycle these residues in gypsum walls,

concrete and roadway fill.  The residue from carbon dioxide

removal is a gas that if not contained will escape back into the

atmosphere.  It can be liquefied, but only under pressure and at

very low temperatures.  There are some uses for CO2, but many

(such as dry ice) lead to the gas escaping back into the

atmosphere.  The gas can be transformed into a hydrate and

injected into the deep ocean or reinjected into oil wells or

other impervious strata of the earth, but none of these

alternatives is very satisfactory or cheap.  

<p>

     Nevertheless, capture and sequestration is a supply side

option.  Research is being conducted to reduce the cost and to

find more practicable means of sequestration.  We can always be

hopeful, but the reason you do not hear much about this supply

side option is because it is not that promising.  


<p>


<b> Changing the Conventional Energy Mix </b>

<p>

     The second supply side option is changing the current energy

mix.  The carbon content of current energy forms is not equal:

there are carbon-free conventional energy forms, nuclear and

hydro power, and natural gas has notably less carbon content than

coal or petroleum products.  These conventional forms of energy

constitute an important share of energy supply in many countries. 

In the United States, for instance, nuclear and hydro power meet

about 12 percent of total demand, and natural gas accounts for

about a quarter of all energy used.  

<p>

     It is hard to imagine that serious action to restrain

greenhouse gas emissions would not entail a fundamental

reconsideration of nuclear and hydro power.  Currently, we may

think of further nuclear and hydro development as being

undesirable for a number of reasons, but this position is based

upon the ready availability of hydrocarbon substitutes.  If we

decide that carbon is a problem, it is unrealistic to think that

the balance now being struck with respect to nuclear and hydro

power would not be changed.  Not to do so leads to policies that

appear to deny the basic needs that energy supply can meet and

that are so strong.  For instance, opposition to the damming of

the Yangtze Gorges in China and to the development of a power

sector based on China's abundant coal resources, not to mention

opposition to the development of nuclear power in China, comes

perilously close to opposing development in any practicable form.

<p>

     Although not as low in carbon content as nuclear or hydro

power, natural gas is one of the alternatives for lowering carbon

trajectories by altering the conventional energy mix.  This

option is also more feasible now that we no longer think of

natural gas as a super-scarce, noble fuel whose use must be

restricted by legislation.  In fact, current trends would suggest

that natural gas will gain a larger share of the energy mix quite

apart from any concerns about greenhouse gas emissions.

<p>

     The most notable feature about natural gas during the past

decade has been the much lower than expected price prevailing in 

North America.  Far from being a premium fuel that would sell at 

an oil equivalent price or better, natural gas prices have

settled in a range that is well below oil prices.  The same

phenomenon is being observed more recently in the United Kingdom

based on North Sea supplies.  In both instances, it appears that

earlier regulation of natural gas production led to a systematic

under-estimation of the resource base, or that recent

technological developments have made it possible to produce

natural gas far more cheaply than before.  

<p>

     In addition, the development of higher efficiency, combined 

cycle technology has given natural gas a distinct advantage over 

coal as the choice for new powerplants where natural gas is

available and reasonably priced.  When coupled with the abundant 

(although often inconveniently located) natural gas reserves in

the rest of the world, the potential for shifting the

conventional energy mix to a less carbon intensive form is

considerable.

<p>

     Lower prices, an expanded resource base and new technology

will lead to growing use of natural gas, but the rate at which

the energy mix changes is going to be restrained by problems of

infrastructure in developing countries, where the greatest growth

of carbon emissions is anticipated, and by the problems facing

new plant construction in already industrialized countries.  In

developing countries, even assuming the availability of natural

gas reserves, the greatest problem is getting the gas to market. 

Its delivery requires a large initial investment in pipelines or

LNG tankers.  Not only is scarce capital required, but the

infrastructure so created is single purpose.  Coal and petroleum 

products can use existing infrastructure and waterways, and any

special infrastructure built to deliver coal or oil lends itself 

to other uses.  In the industrialized countries, where the gas

infrastructure has been put in place, the prospects for expanded 

use of natural gas are brighter, particularly where there is

still oil to be backed out of household or industrial use.  In

the electric utility sector, lower prices and the development of

combined cycles have made natural gas the fuel of choice for new 

plant construction; but there are few new plants.  Part of the

reason for the relative paucity of new plants is the bias against

new plants expressed both in the new source performance standards

and the problems of siting any plant whether coal or gas fired.

<p>

     Despite the problems with nuclear and hydro power or with

natural gas, there is promise of a lower carbon trajectory

because of changes in the conventional energy mix.  Many

countries already depend upon carbon-free nuclear and hydro

power; and, although further dependence on these carbon-free

sources does not seem likely in North America or Europe, Asian

countries are continuing to develop these energy sources. 

Natural gas is no longer the scarce, premium fuel that is too

valuable to be burned in a boiler.  As its resource availability

continues to expand, we can expect its price to become

increasingly attractive relative to coal and petroleum and its

share to expand.  


<p>


<b> New Carbon-Free Technology  </b>

<p>

     The third supply side option for mitigating greenhouse gas

emissions is new technology.  This is always a favorite solution,

particularly when the problem is insoluble.  The question is

whether reliance on new technology is more than just a cop-out.  

I believe that there is something more to this option, but we

must be careful about what we mean.

<p>

     Consider first that it is very unlikely that the sources of 

energy that would be used a hundred years from now would be the

same as we now have.  Technology has never been constant, much

less over the long time horizons that are relevant to global

change.  It would be truly extraordinary if our present carbon

intensive means of meeting the underlying human needs for heat,

mobility and lighting were to remain frozen throughout the next

century.  It would not be surprising that the seeds of whatever

is the energy technology that will dominate the twenty-first

century are lying about now, just as a hundred years ago the

precursors of the internal combustion engine and of refining were

present.  These were the innovations that made horses obsolescent

and expanded petroleum applications beyond its initial use for

lighting as a replacement for whale oil.

<p>

     Furthermore, the signal innovations which led to the great

expansion in the use of coal, petroleum or natural gas were all

developed outside of these industries.  The steam engine made

coal the energy form of the 19th century, just as the internal

combustion engine made petroleum the fuel of the 20th century. 

Natural gas could not be marketed far from the well-head until

welding techniques permitted seamless pipelines.  The important

technological developments were not in finding or producing the

energy source, although these were also important, but in the

enabling innovations that expanded the applicability of what were

known and existing sources of energy.  

<p>

     As we look for the enabling innovation that will transform

energy use in the 21st century, the most likely candidate is the 

ongoing information revolution.  The dramatic reductions in the

cost of information, and in the cost of control and coordination,

over the past two decades are bound to have significant

implications for energy use and perhaps move us on to lower

carbon trajectories.  Energy conservation, for instance, has

already been greatly enhanced by these developments.

<p>

     As we seek the innovations that would bring on new carbon-

free technology, we must be always mindful that the new

technology must compete with existing sources at today's price. 

The notion that it is sufficient simply to demonstrate technical

feasibility because depletion of existing energy sources or

environmental taxes will eventually make the new technology

economic is not only wrong, but also detrimental to the

development of competitive alternatives.  If history is any

guide, resources do not deplete; they are displaced by new

technology that typically leaves much of the old resource in the

ground.  

<p>

     The problem with developing new carbon-free technology is

how to make it happen.  It is not clear that government support

through funding research and development is the answer.  In

theory, there is unlikely to be sufficient R&D absent some

government support; but we also have the spectacle of having

spent large sums of public monies on energy R&D over the past

twenty years with very little to show for the effort.  There are

no really new energy technologies, and what have been

demonstrated as a part of this effort are almost without

exception uneconomic.  The one example of seemingly successful

government support for a new technology was nuclear power.  There

has been nothing to succeed nuclear power, and many have come to

question the wisdom of developing nuclear power, despite its

carbon-free properties.


<p>

     There is real potential in this third supply side option for

lower carbon trajectories.  The particular forms of energy we use

today are carbon-based; it has not always been thus.  For most of

man's existence, energy came primarily from other sources.  There

are other ways to meet man's basic needs for energy; we only need

ingenuity to develop another enabling innovation.

<p>

     In conclusion, I would like to leave you with three thoughts

about supply side mitigation options.  First, we must recognize

that the services and human needs being met by our current forms 

of energy are very basic and not likely to be significantly

changed by demand-side actions.  Second, if global warming is the

problem, energy is a problem only to the extent that it is

coupled with carbon.  Third, the supply side task is to decouple

carbon from energy, much as we have successfully decoupled energy

and economic growth over the past twenty years.  I hope that I

have been able to give you some perspective on the broad means by

which such a decoupling might be accomplished.

<center><h1>Climate Change Mitigation Options:  Demand-Side 
Management in

Formerly-Planned Economies  </h1>



<b>Meredydd Evans  <br>

Pacific Northwest National Laboratory<br>

(Operated by Battelle for the Department of Energy)  </b></center>


<p>


      I am going to talk about some of the demand side options for

mitigating climate change.  My focus will be on options in

Central and Eastern Europe, for a couple of reasons. Central and

Eastern Europe have a great potential for mitigation, and many of

the lessons countries in transition are learning about the

effects of energy subsidies and other policies apply throughout

the world.

<p>

      I will begin by discussing emissions and energy in Central

and Eastern Europe; I will then address the cost of emission

reductions and problems with estimating costs in the formerly

planned economies; and finally, I will cover energy scenarios and

some specifics about mitigation options and barriers to

mitigation.


<p>


<b>Emissions and Energy Use in Central and Eastern Europe </b>

<p>



      This chart describes global carbon emissions.  Non-OECD

Europe represents Central and Eastern Europe, which is

responsible for about 20 percent of world carbon emissions.

Central and Eastern Europe are also responsible for 21 percent of

global energy consumption. While the per capita emissions and

energy use of Central and Eastern European countries are similar

to those in Western Europe, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and

per capita income in the countries of this region are not very

high in comparison with Western countries.  The reason for this

discrepancy in energy use and emissions in comparison with

economic well-being is that Central and Eastern European

countries use a lot of energy inefficiently.  It is a very energy

intensive region, so it does not get the economic benefits of its

energy use.

<P>

      The primary energy mix in this region varies from country to

country.  The former Soviet Union is heavily dependent on natural

gas, and to a lesser extent on coal and nuclear energy.

Renewables play a small role, with hydropower the leading form of

renewable energy.  In Poland and the Czech Republic, coal and to

a lesser extent natural gas are the main sources of primary

energy. Thus, overall, the region is heavily dependent on fossil

fuels for its energy.


<p>


<b>Cost of Emission Reductions </b>


<p>



      Costs are key to demand side options for mitigation.  The

costs of mitigation in Central and Eastern Europe are quite

economical in comparison to the West.  In some cases, the costs

are even negative, which bodes well for mitigation. Nevertheless,

there are market distortions and barriers in countries in

transition, which inhibit the implementation of energy efficiency

measures.

<p>

      Modelers have developed very different assessments of how

much it will cost to reduce carbon emissions.  Their cost

estimates vary from 6 percent of GDP to negative, which is a wide

range (see table "Cost of Carbon Dioxide Emission Reductions"). 

These estimates are important because actual costs are going to

determine the feasibility of the options.  If is too expensive to

install controls or installation, for example, individuals and

businesses will not implement these energy efficiency measures.

William Chandler, a senior scientist at PNNL, surveyed models of

Central and Eastern European carbon emissions.  He found that the

bottom-up models estimate much lower costs for carbon emission

reductions than top-down models.  This holds true throughout the

region:  in the former Soviet Union, Hungary, Poland, the Czech

Republic.  He also found that there is a much higher correlation

between cost and model type than between cost and any other

factor, including percent of emission reductions.

<p>

      There are some important differences between top-down and

bottom-up models.  Top-down models often over-estimate the cost

of mitigation because they assume that formerly-planned economies

are in equilibrium, which they are not.  However, bottom-up

models have another problem, in that they do not have a feedback

mechanism to adjust the price of energy based on other inputs.

<p>

      There have been a few attempts to create models which

incorporate both top-down and bottom-up methodologies.  FEWE, the

Polish Foundation for Energy Efficiency has developed one such

model, and Jae Edmonds of PNNL has developed another.  The

advantage of such models is that they can aggregate the effects

of demand-side mitigation measures, like bottom-up models, but

they also provide a top-down feedback mechanism between energy

prices and inputs such as demand.


<p>


<b>Estimating Costs in Formerly Planned Economies </b>

<p>

      Countries in transition are in economic dis-equilibrium.  Of

the Central and Eastern European countries, the Czech Republic is

probably the closest to equilibrium.  Most of the other countries

in this region, particularly in the former Soviet Union, are

quite far from equilibrium.

<p>

      Energy prices, in particular, demonstrate why this

disequilibrium is important to consider when modeling. Energy

prices have been very heavily subsidized, and in many countries

are still subsidized.  Demand patterns and price elasticity of

the past are not representative of what will happen in the future

because past demand was not market-driven.  Central and Eastern

European countries are energy-intensive because energy prices

were subsidized and the governments of the region promoted the

growth of energy-intensive heavy industry.  As energy prices

rise, and their economies have time to restructure, we see that

energy intensity decreases.  It is difficult to estimate the

future price elasticity because there is no record of market-

based demand on which to base such an estimate. Top-down models

often overestimate the cost of mitigation because they use past

prices and demand as a surrogate for price elasticity, and they

therefore predict that energy use will increase with economic

growth in the same way that it did under Communism. 


<p>


<b>Energy Scenarios </b>

<p>



      Formerly-planned economies are very energy-intensive.  To a

large extent this is because they have a large heavy-industry

base:  metallurgy, defense production, machine production.  They

have small service sectors, and relatively little light industry. 

Services and light industry were never a major focus of the

Communist regimes.

<p>

      There are many different scenarios predicting future energy

supply and demand in post-planned economies, including:

<ul>
      <li> Business as Usual

      <li> Structural Change

      <li>Structural Change plus Efficiency

      <li> Natural Gas

      <li> Nuclear Variations

</ul>

      Business as usual means that the structure of energy supply

and demand will continue to look like it did in the past.  The

business as usual scenario is useful for comparison.  There are

also a few countries in the former Soviet Union, particularly in

Central Asia, which may in fact continue to use and produce

energy as they did in the past.  Most formerly-planned economies,

however, are undergoing structural change.  This change will

certainly have an impact on energy demand, although, as noted

earlier, modelers differ on the extent to which energy efficiency

will decrease demand in economies undergoing structural change.

<p>

      The changes taking place in Central and Eastern Europe will

have an impact not only on the levels of energy supply and

demand, but also on the energy mix.  Whether these countries use

coal, natural gas, or nuclear energy will have a profound effect

on their greenhouse gas emissions.  For environmental and

economic reasons, Central European countries may begin relying

more on natural gas, which will decrease emissions.  On the other

hand, some former Soviet republics, primarily Ukraine, may shift

away from imported natural gas to domestic coal, since coal is

seen as a more secure source of energy.  Given the dwindling

supply of domestic Ukrainian coal, it is not clear that coal

solves the problem, and most Ukrainians realize that there are

severe environmental problems associated with the use of coal.  


<p>

      Some countries are building new nuclear power plants, or are

keeping old ones open despite safety problems.  The Czech

Republic is building the Temelin nuclear power plant.  In

Ukraine, Chernobyl continues to operate despite the accident

because of problems with Ukraines supply of natural gas. 

Armenia recently reopened a nuclear power station that was

damaged in a major earthquake, although many Western experts

think the threat of an accident is great if another earthquake

occurs.  While the overall environmental impact of such reactors

may not be desirable, nuclear energy will decrease greenhouse gas

emissions, so the reactors need to be considered in scenarios for

future emissions.



<p>

<b>Mitigation Options and Barriers</b>


<p>



      Energy efficiency is an appealing mitigation option in

Central and Eastern Europe because it is very cost-effective. 

Since the economies of these countries are so energy-intensive,

the potential for energy savings is truly enormous. However, many

cost-effective projects are not being implemented because of

financial, legal and institutional barriers. For example, most

countries in this region have subsidized residential energy,

which discourages energy efficiency.  The municipalities and the

residents both pay a portion of the energy costs.  In this

situation, neither party has a strong financial incentive to pay

for efficiency, so both continue to waste energy.

<p>

      The Polish Foundation for Energy Efficiency, FEWE, did a

comprehensive study of the costs of demand-side and supply-side

efficiency options in Poland.  Some of the measures are extremely

cost-effective.  Steam traps, for example, have an internal rate

of return (IRR) of 335 percent.  Other cost-effective options

include residential gas boilers (instead of district heating),

efficient street lighting and high-efficiency electric motors.

<p>

      FEWE then extrapolated how much energy could be saved

throughout the Polish economy.  FEWE staff first looked at the

technical potential for energy savings, which they estimated at

approximately 900 PJ/year.  Then they looked at how much of this

potential was cost effective, and about half of it remained. 

Finally, they estimated how much of the potential had an IRR of

over 18 percent, and found that 400 PJ of potential energy

savings met this criterion.

<p>

      This is an important cutoff point, because most Western

investors, either banks or companies, realize that there is

greater risk in these countries, and they will not get involved

in a project unless it has a very high rate of return.  Eighteen

percent is about the minimum that any Western investor is willing

to accept.


<p>
      While there are barriers to demand-side mitigation options,

overall carbon emissions have decreased significantly since 1990. 

The main cause of this decrease is the drop in production

associated with the general economic decline and structural

change. Some of the emission reductions are also because of

efficiency, particularly in Central Europe--Poland, Hungary and

the Czech Republic--where most industrial companies have been

privatized.  These companies are trying to modernize and increase

efficiency in order to stay competitive.


<p>


<b>Examples of Mitigation</b>

<p>



      While the problems associated with climate change mitigation

may be daunting, there are many examples of successful energy

efficiency projects in Central and Eastern Europe.  No single

project will solve the problem of global warming, but they are

all steps in the right direction. 


<p>
      One example is the Russian Enterprise Housing Divestiture

Project. It is one of the first large World Bank projects

focusing on energy efficiency.  The goal of this project is to

increase residential efficiency in order to help enterprises

divest themselves of worker housing.  When enterprises are

privatized, they want to get rid of worker housing to consolidate

their holdings and avoid the high costs of residential utility

bills.  However, because this housing is expensive to maintain,

the municipalities do not want it, and the residents are wary

that if they privatize their apartments, their energy bills and

taxes will go up.  As a result, the enterprises cannot even give

this housing away.  To make housing divestiture more feasible by

reducing the burden of high energy bills, the World Bank would

loan municipalities $300 million to pay for energy efficiency

measures, such as insulation and weather stripping.  The World

Bank is currently assessing this loan.

<p>

      Another potential project targets four industrial

enterprises in Ukraine for energy efficiency upgrades.  The total

cost would be about $100 million and the European Bank for

Reconstruction and Development has expressed an interest in

financing it.  This would pay for controls, steam traps, steam

pipe insulation, efficient motors, and some modernization costs. 

This project began as an effort to find alternatives to the power

generated at Chernobyl, which would allow the Ukrainians to close

Chernobyl. The Ukrainian Government argues that it cannot shut

down Chernobyl until alternative sources of power are

established.  Industry in the Ukraine is the major energy

consumer, so this project would tackle both the problem of

industrial inefficiency, and that of excess electrical demand in

Ukraine.



<p>

      An example of a private project is the work of ESCOs in the

Czech Republic. One U.S. ESCO signed $30 million worth of

contracts with Czech organizations during the first meetings with

these organizations.  The contracts are with hospitals and

industrial enterprises.  The Czech organizations saw the need for

efficiency, and decided to invest their own money in it.  This

indicates that there are cost-effective mitigation options in the

Czech Republic despite the barriers. 


<p>


<b>Barriers to Demand-Side Mitigation </b>

<p>

      Subsidized energy is a very important barrier to demand-side

mitigation, because as long as energy prices are very cheap,

people will continue to waste energy.  Lack of hard budget

constraints is also a barrier in many cases.  If an enterprise

knows that the government guarantees to purchase its goods and to

bail it out if it goes into debt, the enterprise does not have to

worry about running up the energy bill.  In this situation, the

enterprises have little incentive to save energy. In fact, under

the planned economy, enterprises were actually given incentives

to consume energy because their payments from the government--

profit as they called it--were based on production costs.  The

more they spent, the more they earned.

<p>

      The tax and business laws create institutional barriers. 

For example, if a Hungarian firm wants to start producing energy

efficiency equipment, the firm must overcome enormous problems

associated with high taxes and the risky business climate. 

Customers may not pay, and contract laws are not well defined, so

investors may not have recourse options.  These uncertainties and

risks significantly increase the transaction costs.

<p>

      There are also technological barriers.  Most of the

equipment at industrial plants is outdated and inefficient.  If

you look at a typical steel plant in Eastern Europe, the

technology in place is what we used 30 years ago.  For example,

continuous casting is rare in most steel plants.  Another

technological problem is the lack of energy efficiency equipment,

like controls and insulation.

<p>

      The financial barriers are also inhibitive.  There is very

little capital available for energy efficiency measures.  The

large international development banks prefer large projects

because they are easier to assess and manage than a multitude of

small ones.  Energy efficiency projects tend to be small because

they do not involve creating new infrastructure, like building a

new coal plant.  As a result, institutions such as the World Bank

and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development rarely

get involved in energy efficiency projects.


<p>
      In the West, commercial banks are an important source of

financing.  Unfortunately, commercial banks in Central and

Eastern Europe are not well-developed, and generally have only

limited amounts of capital to lend.  Western commercial banks shy

away from lending money for project financing in this region

because the risk is too high.  

<p>

      Most of the Western assistance to this region has focused on

energy supply:  upgrading fossil and nuclear power plants,

repowering hydropower plants, and building new district heating

plants or gas distribution systems.



<P>

<b>Recommendations </b>

<p>

      As I mentioned in the beginning, Central and Eastern Europe

are important to climate change mitigation not only because of

the mitigation potential there, but also because of the lessons

they can teach.  This region is coming to grips with the reality

that energy prices must reflect the full cost of energy if the

region is to thrive economically and environmentally. 

Rationalizing energy prices is important the world over because

until energy prices reflect the true costs, people will continue

to waste energy.


<p>
      Adjusting taxation policy is also important to promote

mitigation.  Taxes can help internalize the environmental costs

of economic activity.  Many Central European countries have

carbon and other environmental taxes on the books, but they are

not well enforced. Russia and Ukraine have both proposed energy

taxes in recent years, but for political reasons, have not been

able to adopt them nationally.

<p>

      More financing is also needed for energy efficiency, both at

national and international levels.  Ironically, Central and

Eastern European countries are increasing budget allocations for

energy efficiency, despite their economic hardships, at the same

time that the more prosperous United States is cutting back on

energy efficiency funding.  In the international arena,

development organizations have a tendency to spend more money on

energy supply than on energy efficiency or environmental

protection.  The World Bank, for example, argues that structural

reform should create incentives for efficiency, so there is

usually no reason to provide additional financing for energy

efficiency.  One could also argue that if the prices are right,

energy suppliers will recover all their costs and so there is no

need to provide financing for supply.  The World Bank, however,

spends most of its energy budget on loans for energy supply.

<p>

      The World Bank is right about the need for restructuring in

Central and Eastern Europe.  Countries in transition generally

have fundamental imbalances in their economies.  These imbalances

often lead to higher energy use and higher carbon emissions. 

Thus restructuring the economy as a whole--privatizing

enterprises, reforming the prices, etc.--can also help to reduce

carbon emissions.  

<p>

      This is a crucial moment in the development of Central and

Eastern Europe.  The changes which are now taking place will

determine the future of the region, and the future of their

emissions.  These changes also create many opportunities for

climate change mitigation.

<p>





     DR. MARKHAM:  Thank you, Steve.  We do indeed have time for

one or two questions.  Yes, there is one over here.

<p>


     PARTICIPANT:  (Comments off mike.)

<p>


     DR. HAMBURG:  The question was, I defined resilience as

returning to a previous state.  In the case of the spruce forest,

the spruce forest didn't return, but a hardwood forest did.  

<p>


     I agree, and I probably slipped by something I meant to say

with that.  In defining resilience in this case, I want to define

it in terms of the services that we would be getting from that

forest, or the conditions in the case of biodiversity,

maintaining certain species that we would want from that forest

or that terrestrial ecosystem.  
<p>



     So in that case, I would argue that that forest did prove to

be resilient.  But that was a very small change in that forest,

compared to what is projected.  I would strongly question, based

on my knowledge of that forest and the paleo record of that

forest, whether or not, if you had the rate of change that is

projected in the JCMs occurring in that forest, whether you

wouldn't see a collapse and total loss in this case of

extractable wood, or a very large loss of extractable wood from

that forest.

<p>


     DR. MARKHAM:  A question down here.

<p>


     PARTICIPANT:  You showed this Swiss forest.  That was a

model study, right?

<p>


     DR. HAMBURG:  Right.

<p>


     PARTICIPANT:  It showed an initial loss of carbon that

stresses the forest.  I am just wondering, are there data that

show that this is what will happen?

<p>


     DR. HAMBURG:  The question is, I showed an example of a

model output for a Swiss forest and the carbon losses that follow

climate change scenarios being imposed upon that forest, and

whether there are any actual empirical data to demonstrate that

type of losses.

<p>


     As far as I know, good data, no.  I would argue that part of

the reason that we have had trouble with that is that in most

cases, we have land use history superimposed on it, and in the

temperate zone, almost the entire forest has been cut over.  So

we are having a little bit of a tough time pulling out the

climate signal from the underlying land use signal.  That is

where this study that I talked about with the spruce -- we got

around that by being able to get good empirical data that we

could separate the land use component from the climate component.

<p>


     That is why I say it is a question.  Theoretically, and

based on general empirical data, most terrestrial ecologists

believe there will be a disorganizational phase in an adjustment

of ecosystems to climate change.  How much carbon might be lost

is very much up in question.  I don't think it would be fair to

say we have a good handle on that, but there is very strong

consensus that that process will take place.  Now what we need to

do is figure out good ways to qualify it.  

<p>


     Also, what becomes key is the timing, obviously.  If the

timing is synchronous, then we have got a big problem.  If it is

asynchronous, then there is a possibility that the impacts on

global climate change will be relatively small.

<p>


     DR. MARKHAM:  Time for one more question if there is one. 

The gentleman just down here.

<p>


     PARTICIPANT:  (Comments off mike.)

<p>


     DR. HAMBURG:  Right.  The question was whether or not the

plants that I talked about would adapt to the changing

temperature regimes.  Certainly, some would, and I had some more

slides to deal with that, but for brevity's sake didn't include

that.

<p>


     We know that plants have an optimal temperature range in

which they can survive, and some plants are going to stay within

that range.  But in terms of evolution, I don't think there is

any evidence in the time scales that we are talking about, which

are less than a generation for most of these organisms, that we

could expect the plasticity within their genome to be able to

allow them to endure past the existing range that they are in.  I

think you will see them collapsing at the edges of their ranges

in most of the areas which for the temperate zone would be

approximately one-third of the area.

<p>


     I just don't think there is lots of evidence to suggest that

you're going to see spruce living in a five degrees or three

degrees Celsius warmer environment than they do today, except in

the northern portions of their area.  I think there is good paleo

evidence to suggest that won't occur.

<p>


     DR. MARKHAM:  A question for Denny Ellerman:  Where are

renewables in the picture, for instance, solar and wind.  Also,

what is the energy mix that we might be looking at over the next

ten to 20 years to get us toward stabilization in the atmosphere.

<p>


     DR. ELLERMAN:  Let me answer the second first, because it is

easier to deal with.  I don't see realistically what that energy

mix is.  It is not clear what that would be, whether

stabilization would happen.  I can see that much more easily in

developed countries, industrialized countries.  That seems quite

feasible.  When you talk about the rest of the world, it is very

hard to see how that is going to come about.  I don't see the

means to control economic growth, even assuming that were

desirable, to change the energy mixes and so on.

<p>


     Let's go to solar energy, because I think that is a good

illustration of what I find intriguing about the interactions

between information and energy use.  In the past, solar taps into

a highly diffuse form of energy.  Its great disadvantage in the

past was that it was diffuse, and the costs of collection were

very large, and can't compete with the concentration of energy

that you find in a ton of coal or a gallon of gasoline, or what

have you to meet the sort of needs that people wanted.

<p>


     What is interesting about the information changes and what I

find intriguing about it, is that it may convert this reduction

of the cost of information and of control and coordination, may

make it possible to integrate dispersed sources, or to tap into

dispersed sources that may overcome what heretofore have been the

prohibitive costs of collection or of concentration; how do you

concentrate this energy which is in diffuse form.

<p>


     So the way that one should think about this is, you can have

photovoltaic reflectors on your roof or something, which would

take in energy whenever it is available, and it gets integrated

into the system.  This is being done in places now.  So the

energy when it is there is taken in, it meets the supply, and

either goes out into the grid or reduces demand at the end point. 

<p>


     You could say, could we have done that before?  Well, yes,

you could, but it was very costly to coordinate the electric

supply systems that were on networks with all this sort of

dealing with the interruptability of these sources.  It may be

that one of the implications of the information revolution is

going to be that we can't tap into those sources, and there is a

much greater potential for dispersed generation than there has

been in the past, in that it permits us to take advantage of its

very dispersion and its intermittency in a way that would have

significant effects upon energy demand.  What we think of as the

central system now becomes a residual system.  The services are

all the same, so people don't really care about that. 

<p>


     That hasn't happened.  The issue would be how to -- if you

get the reduction of cost and the ability to bring that energy

into the system in a usable form.  But solar is like any other of

these technologies; there are isolated niche markets where they

are economic.  If the view is that we ought to tax everything

else very heavily and make them economic, the question is, is

that going to happen.  I think it is arguable.

<p>


     DR. MARKHAM:  One more question at the back.

<p>


     PARTICIPANT:  (Comments off mike.)

<p>


     DR. MARKHAM:  I think the question was, how feasible are the

low-emission strategies developed by IPCC  working group two,

particularly biomass.

<p>


     DR. ELLERMAN:  The low emission strategies developed by IPCC

working group two.

<p>


     DR. MARKHAM:  Particularly with regard to biomass.

<p>


     DR. ELLERMAN:  I'm not familiar specifically with what

working group two has developed.  It strikes me that what one can

say about solar can very much be said about biomass.  It is an

alternative, it has niches.  Generally speaking, these are not

economic with today's energy supplies.  Many people think of

them, they will be needed in the future because current energy

will be much more expensive because we will be running out of it. 

One should put a big question mark at that point.  Or we are

going to be taxing those forms because of global warming at a

level that would make them viable.

<p>


     If the costs can be reduced and they can be collected and

brought to market, the question is what is keeping them today. 

You do see some applications of these.  We do have photovoltaic

cells that are being used in applications.  I am not that

familiar with biomass to know, but I wouldn't be surprised that

there are -- we do know in terms of wood chips and this that you

have had applications that stand on their own feet, on their

economics, without subsidy.

<p>


     DR. MARKHAM:  Do we have, before we get into the general

discussion, a question?

<p>


     PARTICIPANT:  (Comments off mike.)

<p>


     DR. MARKHAM:  Can you repeat the question before you answer

it?

<p>


     DR. EVANS:  The question is looking at district heat.  One

of the slides I had mentioned residential gas boilers.  The

question is, isn't district heating a positive thing.  I would

say that yes, in many cases, district heating is, but not in all

cases.  One of the problems with district heating is that while

the efficiency of the production of energy may be more efficient

than localized boilers, by the time that you have transmitted it,

sent it through the steam pipes or the hot water pipes, -- and

also, in district heating systems, you would have to basically

account for the person who is going to be the coldest.  You can't

easily adjust the system.  

<p>


     PARTICIPANT:  (Comments off mike.)

<p>

     DR. EVANS:  But the problem is that in many of these 

countries, they don't have any controls whatsoever.  So when you

try to compare the cost of installing radiators everywhere, I

think that is one of the fundamental problems, is the lack of

controls.

<p>


     DR. MARKHAM:  Jonathan, and then we will go into the

discussion session.

<p>
  PARTICIPANT:  (Comments off mike.)



<p>



     DR. MARKHAM:  The question is on energy pricing, 

particularly with reference to China and the very large reliance

of China on coal, which is very much subsidized coal.


<p>

     DR. EVANS:  Actually, China has recently freed their coal

prices.  I don't know the latest -- I think it is just in the

past year or so that they have done that, so I don't know the

latest of what impact that has had on their energy use.  But

you're right, in China, coal is by far their energy of choice. 

That is creating a lot of problems in terms of their carbon

emissions. 

<p>


     I agree with you.  I don't quite know how to respond, other

than that.

<p>


     DR. MARKHAM:  Thank you, Meredydd.  We have half an hour

left for a general discussion session.  What I would first like

to do is get the three previous speakers, Steve, David and

Jonathan, to come back up here and take a chair, because

otherwise they won't be able to be heard on microphone.

<p>


     I have a few questions here on cards.  If people want to ask

more questions, please jot them down on a card and if you wave

your hand around, someone will come and collect the card from you

and bring it up to me.

<p>


     The first question that we have, which I am not sure if

anyone actually knows the answer to, is, where and when can we

get copies of the IPCC documents, particularly all the good pages

as well as the summaries for policy makers.

<p>


     As far as I know, the IPCC documents won't become public

until after March next year, when they will be published.  I

think that is the date at the moment.  

<p>


     DR. HAMBURG:  The summary has been released.  The summary

for policy maker was -- I know Working Group Two was released

right after the plenary, and I believe Working Group One

similarly.  I am assuming that, since that just took place.  But

certainly the summaries are available through the technical

support units at least, if not on the Internet; I don't know.

<p>


     DR. MARKHAM:  I know that the Climate Action Network, which

is a nonprofit network here in the U.S., is distributing a

summary of 15 pages of what they regard as the good pages. 

Everyone has their own ideas about what those would be.  The full

chapter reports I don't think will be available for all working

groups until early next year.

<p>


     PARTICIPANT:  (Comments off mike.)

<p>


     DR. MARKHAM:  So they are on their way.

<p>


     MR. WAGNER:  Dr. Bolin left me a copy of Working Group One's

executive summary.  I am going to copy that tonight.  It will be

available for distribution here tomorrow.

<p>


     DR. MARKHAM:  So now I will come to the next question. 

Could one of the panelists comment on the impacts on animal

protein sources, i.e., cattle or fish and other marine protein

sources, of climate change.  Maybe we should take -- who wants to

comment on that?  David, would you like to talk about that?

<p>


     DR. WOLFE:  About the only comment I would have eon that is

that many pasture grasses tend to be C4 plants, so they are not

going to be in that group that benefits a lot from the higher

CO<sub>2</sub>.  That is about all I know on that topic.

<p>


     DR. MARKHAM:  We have been involved recently in a Southern

Africa impact study, where we looked at potential implications of

increased drought in some of the Southern African countries.  It

does appear that there will be a move toward small stock like

sheep and goats and away from cattle, because cattle tend to be

less resistant to drought, and also some move towards wildlife

farming as an alternative to cattle farming, multiple use systems

rather than single-stock systems.  So that is just from one

region.

<p>


     DR. HAMBURG:  The chapter on rain plants in the Working

Group Two IPCC report concluded that unmanaged pastoral systems

would be very sensitive to  climate change impacts, in part

because of protein ratios within the grasses themselves and the

effects of drought, lower nutritional quality impacting the

ability to effectively manage those systems.  Highly managed

protein sources in domesticated animals was felt to be less

sensitive, because you could use agricultural feed stocks to make

sure they got sufficient quality nutrition.

<p>


     DR. MARKHAM:  Do you have anything to say on fish?


<p>

     DR. HAMBURG:  No, I don't have anything to say on fish.

<p>


     DR. PATZ:  If he doesn't have any information on fish, I

would just like to say we need more information on fish, because

a large proportion of coastal populations depend on fish for

their protein.  To the extent that climate change may impact

fisheries, that would be important.  Right now, the impact of

over fishing would be much more than that of climate change.

<p>


     DR. MARKHAM:  Another one on agriculture.  David, you talked

about adaptation in terms of inputs and change in crop varieties. 

What about changes in farming practices, for example, tillage, as

illustrated in the posters.  Disclaimer, I don't know the author

of the poster.  Could this be an example of analogs to energy

efficiency, something we should be doing anyway.  In other words,

a win-win situation.

<p>


     DR. WOLFE:  With regards to the poster out there on tillage,

I think it is talking about the actual contribution that

agriculture can make in terms of the greenhouse gasses that are

given off in agricultural production, and tillage practices can

affect the CO<sub>2</sub> released.  Agricultural practices also have an

impact on methane, rice production and other animal production,

in some cases.

<p>


     So I think that is what that poster is about.  The author is

probably here and can comment on that in the audience somewhere.

<p>


     DR. MARKHAM:  Anyone want to make a comment on that?

<p>


     PARTICIPANT:  (Comments off mike.)

<p>


     DR. MARKHAM:  Thank you very much.  The next one is on

ecosystems.  This one is for Steve.  What is the potential for

human management to help ecosystems change into new self-

sustaining ecosystems without collapsing?

 <p>


     DR. HAMBURG:  I guess I am concerned that the potential is

not that great for the unmanaged portion of the ecosystems of the

world.  Obviously, for ones that we are already managing, if the

rate of change is sufficiently slow, then we have a high

probability of being able to manage that in that changing

environment.  

<p>


     For unmanaged systems, we have a pretty poor track record of

being able to manage them in a way that retains the integrity of

the characteristics of that unmanaged system.  So I would say

that spreading seeds in anticipation of future climate conditions

to make sure the proper yields are present in a place where they

might not naturally occur, though sounding simple, is probably

not going to be a very effective means of insuring the future

viability of the system.  Remember, these systems will

disaggregate before they reaggregate.  Systems don't move in

their entirety, so I am not optimistic that we have the knowledge

nor the resources probably to be able to do that for the

unmanaged portions of the terrestrial biosphere.



<p>


     DR. MARKHAM:  Thanks.  On that point, some of the things

that Steve talked about was the rate of change being very

important.  Also very important is the fact that most of our

ecosystems have been highly fragmented.  It is becoming clear

that highly stressed ecosystems or fragmented ecosystems will be

less able or less likely to be able to adapt to climate change.  

<p>


     So what we have been looking at at World Wildlife Fund is

some of the issues surrounding, for instance, protected areas

management and climate change.  While you may not be able to

manage well to help species or ecosystems adapt, there may be

ways of buffering them against some of the impacts.  

<p>


     So if you take a protected areas system as a whole in a

country like the U.S., then you might be looking at increasing

the resilience of that system, perhaps by increasing the size of

areas, keeping more redundancy amongst that system of protected

areas, and perhaps having corridors between areas to allow

species to migrate.  But again, as Steve says, we don't have very

much information about how that actually works in practice. 

There is a great deal of doubt as to whether even migratory

corridors would be very helpful.  So we need to look much more

into that in practical field experience rather than just in the

theory of conservation biology.

<p>


     The next two questions I have are for Dr. Ellerman, on

energy.  The first one was one that I expected.  Do you believe

nuclear energy is a viable alternative to carbon-based systems? 

I thought you answered that to a certain extent in your talk, but

if you would like to add anything to it.

<p>


     DR. ELLERMAN:  My point is, the need for reconsideration

of -- to my mind, the biggest issue in nuclear power is the cost

of operating -- one of the major problems with its economic

viability is the cost of operating the systems as it ages.  There

is evidence that it requires major maintenance expenditure, that

would destroy the major economics compared to other fuels, or the

competition.

<p>


     I can't claim to be an expert.  My sense is -- and you

certainly have societies that believe that the problems with

nuclear power can be handled in terms of the disposal, the

technical sort of issues which suggest that it would be viable.

<p>


     I guess my sense is that if we are considering a major

change away from carbon-based fuels, the notion is that all the

non-carbon-based fuels are also unacceptable, you are probably

describing an impossible situation.  I think that is the

implication of trying to engineer at least in a quick move away

from carbon-based systems -- you do have to reconsider the limits

that we may have placed on carbon-free systems currently in

existence, whether it is hydro development or nuclear.

<p>


     DR. MARKHAM:  Thanks.  The follow-on to that is, granted

that the challenge for energy supply is to decouple energy from

carbon, how do we get there.  The questioner goes on to say, you

were doubtful about whether government backing of certain

developments was perhaps the way to go, in other words,

subsidies, more research and development, in which case, what

should be the way to go?  How do we get away from that, and what

should we be backing?

<p>


     DR. ELLERMAN:  The issue here is one of how you induce

certain forms of technological change.  I think it is the sort of

deep issue of technological development in this area.

<p>


     I don't know how you make that happen.  I think we do have a

fair number of cases in history where we can think that we have

been able to include certain forms of technological change in

certain directions.  The issue here is, we want technological

change which would be less carbon intensive.  So how do you

direct development in that direction?

<p>


     The evidence with respect to government support is simply

not encouraging.  I think the answers lie in political economy

and the tendency to exploit the political system for private

interests and private agendas that don't lead anywhere.  That is

the basic problem.  But I think we need to think about how does a

society organize and set up, to where you do promote these sort

of developments.  It may be consciousness raising, industrial

ecology, educational practices that you are now seeing.  But I

think that is a major issue, to my mind.

<p>


     DR. MARKHAM:  Thanks.  The last question that I have is on

an energy theme to Denny Ellerman or to Meredydd Evans, whichever

of you wants to answer first.  In light of proposed utility

deregulation here in the U.S., how do you see the U.S. meeting

its target or goal of reduced greenhouse gas emissions by the

year 2000, getting back to 1990 levels?  A tough question to

finish on.  Who wants to go for that?  Meredydd?

<p>


     DR. EVANS:  I think in my view, one of the biggest problems

with this is the anticipated decrease in integrated resource

planning programs and demand side management programs.  It is

going to be a lot more difficult in the future to insure that

energy efficiency plays an important role in utilities' programs.

<p>


     In terms of trying to come up with efficient sources of

supply, I know that certain states, for example, California and

Connecticut, are trying to build into their new regulations

conditions that renewables have to make up a certain percent or a

certain portion of the total supply.  It can be met in a number

of ways by a number of companies.


<p>

     That I think has a lot of potential, because it is fairly

flexible and can let utilities -- I think that will be a trading

aspect to it, is what some of the states are looking at, if I'm

not mistaken.  So utilities could meet their renewables needs in

may ways, including purchasing it from other utilities.


<p>

     DR. ELLERMAN:  I think the whole effort to restructure

fundamentally undercuts the global action plan of the

Administration.  The unspoken assumption has been cost recovery

through the utility franchise, which means that customers do not

have a choice about where they obtain their energy, and pay

whatever price is made available to them, which they can take,

whatever the quantities.  The attitude of electric utilities to

engage in voluntary agreements which do incur costs has been

greatly reduced with the prospect that the regulatory structures

which would guarantee recovery of those costs, may be rapidly

removed.  So I don't think there is much question.  It doesn't

look likely that we will meet the targets, but if we do, it won't

be because of the assumptions that were built into the global

action plan.


<p>

     DR. MARKHAM:  One late-coming question.  What are the

barriers to the use of hydrogen-based energy?  Does anyone want

to have an answer to that one?  No?

<p>


     DR. ELLERMAN:  High cost.

<p>


     DR. MARKHAM:  High cost.  That is all the questions I have. 

Does anyone here on the panel wish to make any last comments or

statements, or ask any other panelist a question?  If not, then I

think I would like to thank you all very much for excellent

overviews, and close the session.  Thank you, and see you

tomorrow.

Climate Change Impacts </h1>

<b> Samuel Fankhauser <Br>

<p> 
 
<b>1.  Introduction </b><p>

 While many unknowns remain, a better picture is gradually starting to 
emerge about the impacts of climate change.  There is wide agreement now 
that the impacts will be diverse, with winners as well as losers.  Some effects 
may be positive, others may at least be easy to adapt to.  For the majority of 
people, however, the consequences of climate change will probably be 
negative.  For some regions, they could be disastrous. <p>

      Working Group II of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has 
extensively reviewed the potential impacts of climate change (IPCC, 1990b, 
1996a).  The best studied regions remain the developed countries, in 
particular the United States.  Studies usually deal with only a subset of 
damages, and are often restricted to a description of impacts in physical terms.  
By far the best studied areas are agricultural impacts (e.g. Reilly et al, 1994; 
Rosenzweig and Parry, 1994; Adams et al, 1995) and the costs of sea level rise 
(e.g. Yohe et al, 1996; Fankhauser, 1995b).  Attempts at a comprehensive 
monetary quantification of all impacts are relatively rare, and usually 
restricted to the United States (Nordhaus, 1991; Cline, 1992a; Titus, 1992).  
Among the most comprehensive studies with respect to regional coverage 
and the number of included impacts are Fankhauser (1995a) and Tol (1995). 
<p>

      This paper reviews the available economic assessments of climate change 
impacts drawing on the work of IPCC Working Group III (see IPCC, 1996b).  It 
is structured as follows.  Section 2 starts with a brief summary of expected 
impacts in qualitative terms.  The next two sections then summarize the 
main quantitative findings of IPCC Working Group III.  Section 3 is 
concerned with the results of equilibrium analysis, while Section 4 deals with 
dynamic aspects.  Section 5 discusses the main shortcomings of the current 
models and analyses how economic assessments might change in the light of 
recent findings.  Section 6 concludes with an outline of how climate change 
may affect the prospect for sustainable development. <p>
 
<b>2.  Climate Change Impacts </b><p>

      Global warming will have a variety of effects on both human and natural 
systems.  IPCC (1996a) foresees a shift in the current agricultural production 
pattern away from current production areas to more northern latitudes.  
Together with changes in soil water availability, the increased occurrence of 
climatic extremes and crop diseases this may lead to an overall reduction in 
agricultural yields, and could result in serious regional or year-to-year food 
shortages.  The forestry sector may have to adjust to altered growing 
conditions and a change of species mix.  Fisheries will face a similar 
challenge.  The IPCC also predicts that the increased stress on unmanaged 
ecosystems may lead to the extinction of species unable or too slow to adapt. 
<p>

      The rise in sea levels connected with a warmer climate will threaten low 
lying coastal areas.  Sea level rise will particularly affect densely populated 
coastlines and small island states.  Health experts expect a rise in climate 
related diseases such as heat strokes and an increased incidence of vector 
borne diseases like malaria.  Adverse effects like these may trigger a stream of 
climate refugees away from the worst affected regions and coasts. <p>

      Others have warned about the consequences of increased water shortages.  
Climate dependent economic activities like construction, transport and 
tourism will be affected, with improved conditions for some activities, and 
deterioration for others.  The need to adapt could affect energy consumption, 
with higher demand for air cooling in summer, and lower heating needs in 
winter. <p>

      A large unknown is the effect of climate change on extreme weather 
events such as droughts, floods and storms.  Many experts predict an 
increased incidence of such events, that would entail greater vulnerability for 
areas such as coastal zones.  An increase in extreme events would also have 
repercussions on the insurance industry. <p>

      The following sections assess the impact of these changes on human 
welfare in quantitative terms. <p>
 
<b>3.  Damage Assessment I: Equilibrium Analysis </b><p>

      The scientific research on global warming impacts has focused 
predominantly on an (arbitrarily chosen) scenario called 
2xCO<SUB>2</SUB>-the impacts of an atmospheric CO<SUB>2</SUB> 
concentration of twice the preindustrial level.  Most of the figures reported 
below are based on the 2xCO<SUB>2</SUB> scenario. <p>

      Climate change impacts can be classified as either market related (effects 
which will be reflected in the national accounts) or non-market related 
(impacts affecting "intangibles" such as ecosystems or human amenity).  <a 
href="figures/fanktable1.gif">Table 
1</a> categorizes the expected impacts from global warming.  It also assesses 
how 
carefully they have been estimated in the literature so far. <p>

  Climate change impacts can be expressed either quantitatively, or in a 
common unit of measurement such as money.  Monetary estimates of both 
market and non-market damages are ideally expressed in the form of 
willingness to pay (WTP), or willingness to accept compensation (WTA), as 
described in <a href="figures/fankbox1.html">Box 1</a>.  Unfortunately, 
WTP/WTA estimates are not always 
available for the assessment of global warming impacts, and approximations 
were often used.  In addition, several damages that could not so far be 
estimated have been ignored altogether in the aggregated damage estimates 
(IPCC, 1996b). <p>

      Available estimates on the costs of climate change are therefore neither 
accurate nor complete, and a considerable range of error can be expected.  
Figures on developing countries in particular are clearly less reliable than 
those for developed regions. <p>

      Based on an extensive survey of the literature, IPCC Working Group III 
expects the following aggregate damages for 2xCO<SUB>2</SUB>:  <table 
border>

<tr><th align=left>World impact: </th><td>1.5 percent to 2.0 percent of 
world GNP</td>  
<tr><th align=left>Developed country impact:</th><td>  1 percent to 1.5 
percent of  national GNP</td>
  <tr><th align=left>Developing country impact: </th><td> 2 percent to 9 
percent of  national GNP</td></table><p>
 
     A wide range of sectoral and ecosystem impacts contribute to these total 
damages.   <a href="figures/fanktable2.gif">Table 2</a> shows the relative 
importance of different damage 
categories, using figures for the United States.  Impacts on coastal zones, 
human health, water supply and agricultural production are likely to be 
among the most serious effects.  Note that estimates include both adaptation 
costs and residual damages.  Examples of the former include the costs of 
coastal protection, the costs of migration, and the change in energy demand 
due to alterations in space heating and cooling requirements.  Examples of 
residual damages include agricultural impacts, and the loss of dry - and 
wetlands.  The underlying adaptation assumptions, however, are not 
explicitly stated for most impact categories. <p>

      A caveat is necessary.  The above figures are best guess estimates they do 
not reflect the uncertainties they neglect the possibility of impact surprises, 
and of low probability/high impact events (see Section 5).  To avoid long-
term predictions, figures have been derived by imposing 
2xCO<SUB>2</SUB> onto a society with today's structure. <p>

      Considerable regional differences are likely, with potentially higher 
impacts for some countries such as small island states.  <a 
href="figures/fanktable3.gif">Table 3</a> shows some of 
the estimates underlying the above conclusions in more detail highlighting 
the substantial differences between regions.  The Table shows that some 
developing countries could face extremely high damages.  Although the 
South will face less warming than northern latitudes developing countries 
tend to be more vulnerable to climate change, Their economies are more 
dependent on climate-sensitive sectors, in particular agriculture.  They have 
less technical, institutional and financial capacity for adapting to changing 
conditions.  In addition, they tend to be more exposed to extreme whether 
events such as tropical cyclones.  The combination of these effects could result 
in particularly severe damages. <p>
 
<b>4.  Damage Assessment II: Dynamic Analysis </b><p>

      The analysis so far was confined to comparative statics.  All figures in 
Tables 2 and 3 are estimates of the impact of one specific change of the climate 
(2xCO<SUB>2</SUB>) on the current economy.  This is clearly insufficient.  
Not only will we, for the larger part of the future, be confronted with climate 
change substantially different from 2xCO<SUB>2</SUB>, but socio-economic 
vulnerability to climate change will also shift as a consequence of economic 
development. <p>

      What would be relevant to know from a policy point of view are marginal 
figures, ie, estimates of the extra damage done by one extra tonne of carbon 
emitted.  Unfortunately, the requirements for marginal damage calculations 
go far beyond the information available from 2xCO<SUB>2</SUB> studies.  
Greenhouse gases are stock pollutants.  That is, a tonne of gas emitted will 
affect climate over several decades, as fractions of the gas remain long in the 
atmosphere.  Calculating marginal costs therefore requires the comparison of 
two present value terms:  The discounted sum of future damages associated 
with a certain emission scenario is compared to the sum of damages in an 
alternative scenario with marginally different emissions in the base period.  
(In estimates based on optimal control models the marginal costs are 
calculated as the shadow price of carbon, ie, the carbon tax necessary to keep 
emissions on the socially optimal trajectory, see, e.g. Nordhaus, 1994; and 
Peck and Teisberg, 1993.) <p>

      The current generation of models deals with this challenge in a rather ad 
hoc manner, using very simplistic representations of the complex dynamic 
processes involved.  In older studies damage costs were typically specified as a 
polynomial (usually linear to cubic) function of global mean temperature, 
calibrated around the 2xCO<SUB>2</SUB> estimates.  Damage is usually 
fully reversible and assumed to grow with GNP.  Only recently, studies have 
started to emerge which explicitly incorporate regionally diversified 
temperatures and sea levels, model individual damage categories (e.g. 
agriculture) separately, or at least distinguish between damages related to 
absolute temperature level and those related to the rate of change (e.g. Hope 
et al, 1993; Dowlatabadi and Granger, 1993; Tol, 1996).  <a 
href="figures/fanktable4.gif">Table 4</a> provides 
estimates of marginal damages obtained from polynomial damage models.  
Figures range from about $5 to $125 per tonne of carbon, with most estimates 
at the lower end of this range.  The wide range reflects variations in model 
assumptions, as well as the high sensitivity of figures to the choice of the 
discount rate. <p>

      The pioneering paper on the social costs of CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions 
is Nordhaus (1991).  Using a simplified version of a dynamic optimization 
model, he calculates social costs of 7.3 $/tC.  The model had a number of 
shortcomings, however, in particular the assumption of a resource steady 
state and of a linear damage function (see Cline, 1992a).  These objections are 
also relevant to the study by Ayres and Walter (1991), whose calculations are 
based on the Nordhaus model.  The paper has additional shortcomings.  
Particularly questionable is the use of uniform commodity values, e.g. for 
land, in all world regions. <p>

      The shortcomings of the earlier model were recognized and corrected in 
Nordhaus' subsequent approach, the DICE (Dynamic Integrated Climate 
Economy) model (Nordhaus, 1994).  The shadow values of carbon derived 
from DICE are in the same order as the previous results, starting at 5.3 $/tC in 
1995 and gradually rising to about 10 $/tC in 2025.  Note that figures for future 
periods are current value estimates, i.e. they denote the social costs valued at 
the time of emission.  Values of a similar order of magnitude were found by 
Peck and Teisberg (1993), using a similar model.  Tol's (1994) alternative 
specification of DICE yields shadow prices of $13 for 1995, rising to $89 for 
2095.  These model runs all assume that parameter values are known with 
certainty.  In the case of DICE, shadow prices more than double, once 
uncertainty is added to the model.  All three authors assume a pure rate of 
time preference (or utility discount rate) of 3%.  (For discussions on 
discounting see IPCC, 1996b; and Nordhaus, 1994.) In contrast, Cline (1992b) 
finds significantly higher shadow prices by using a zero utility discount rate.  
His reproduction of the DICE model generates a path of shadow prices 
beginning at about $45 per ton, reaching $243 by 2100.  Other parameter 
specifications provide even higher values. <p>

      Fankhauser (1994) identifies a lower and flatter trajectory for the shadow 
price of carbon, rising from $20 per tonne by 1991-2000 to $28 per tonne by 
2021-2030.  He uses a probabilistic approach to the range of discount rates, in 
which low and high discount rates are given different weights.  His 
sensitivity analysis with the discount rate suggest that moving from high 
(3%) to low (O%) discounting could increase marginal costs by about a factor 9, 
from $5.5 to $49 per tonne of carbon emitted now. <p>
 
<b>5.  Shortcomings And Extensions </b><p>

      Comprehensive damage assessments have been fiercely criticized by many 
authors (e.g. Grubb, 1993; Ekins, 1994).  While not all criticism is based on 
sound analysis, the damage estimates of Tables 2 to 4 do have a number of 
shortcomings.  The most important points of contention are as follows.  <p>

<b>Valuation </b><p>

     Probably the main objection concerns valuation, in particular the validity 
of economic valuation techniques, and their applicability to such damage 
aspects as increased mortality.  Grubb (1993) for example criticized 
2xCO<SUB>2</SUB> damage estimates as being based on a "largely 
subjective valuation of non-market impacts" (p.153).  However, while many 
of the existing figures are indeed based on approximations <a 
href="figures/fanktable1.gif">(see Table 1)</a>, it 
would be wrong to take this as an indication of the ineptitude of economic 
valuation techniques in general. <p>

      Economic valuation of non-market goods is controversial <a 
href="figures/fankbox1.html">(see Box 1)</a>.  
Nevertheless, the problem of greenhouse damage estimates is currently 
perhaps not so much the accuracy of valuation methods as such, but the fact 
that they have not yet been applied to the problem to a sufficient degree.  This 
is not to say that a full and complete valuation of all greenhouse impacts will 
ever be possible.  Given the size of the problem and the uncertainties 
involved, it will probably not be, at least not within reasonable time.  
However, existing estimates are clearly far from perfect and the policy debate 
would gain from their improvement.  Further, and more detailed valuation 
studies are thus warranted.  What is particularly needed is a broadening of the 
scope from the emphasis on agriculture and sea level rise to the inclusion of 
other damage aspects such as ecosystems loss, climate amenity, health and 
morbidity.  Better estimates are also needed with respect to the damage costs 
to developing countries, where only little is known e.g. about the willingness 
to pay for non-market goods like wetlands, or the value of a lower mortality 
risk. <p>

<b>Aggregation </b><p>

     The calculation of global estimates such as those in <a 
href="figures/fanktable3.gif">Table 3</a> requires the 
aggregation of regional figures.  Usually, regional estimates are simply added 
up.  This process has sometimes been criticized for not giving enough 
prominence to damages in developing countries.  It is one of the 
consequences of the WTP/WTA approach that regionally diversified unit 
values are used to assess impacts in different regions.  People's willingness to 
pay is a function of their income, among other factors.  The value of an acre 
of wetland, for instance, or of a lower mortality risk therefore varies between 
regions that have different income levels. <p>

      As a consequence, impacts in regions with low incomes may not be given 
enough importance, especially if the observed income distribution is not just 
(as is currently the case).  Damage aggregates that simply sum up regional 
impacts reflect this unfair distribution.  One may therefore prefer an 
aggregation procedure which corrects for equity considerations. <p>

      An alternative that has sometimes been suggested is to use uniform, 
usually average, unit values across countries.  This would also assure that 
impacts in different regions are given equal weight.  While the use of global 
averages would not be problematic for the calculation of global damages, it 
would not significantly change the global damage assessment.  Damage 
calculations were made in such a way that using average values would 
produce aggregate estimates that are very similar to those reported in <a 
href="figures/fanktable3.gif">Table 3</a>.  
Using global averages to assess damages in only one region, on the other 
hand, could cause significant problems and may lead to logical 
inconsistencies.  The value of a coastal wetland, for example, would differ 
depending on whether it is threatened by local development or by sea level 
rise.  A regional value would be applicable in the first case, while the global 
average value would be used in the second.  Although providing exactly the 
same service in both cases, the asset would have two completely different 
values.  To avoid such inconsistencies, the assessment of regional damages 
needs to be based on regional averages. 
<p>
<b>Catastrophic Events </b><p>

     The estimates of Tables 2 to 3 concentrate on the most probable damage 
scenario, i.e. they merely provide a best guess assessment of what damages are 
most likely to be.  Given the complexity of the climatic system and the 
unprecedented stress imposed on it, this focus maybe too narrow, though.  
Other, more disastrous scenarios cannot be excluded with certainty.  Rather 
than with only one point, we are confronted with an entire damage 
probability distribution.  Unfortunately, only little is known about the shape 
of this distribution, and in particular about the probability of an extremely 
adverse outcome.  Several catastrophe scenarios have been portrayed in the 
literature so far (IPCC, 1996b): <p>
<ul>
<li>The melting of the polar ice caps.  A possible disintegration of the west-
antarctic ice sheet would rise sea levels by up to 6 meters.  This process is 
however slow and would take place over a time span of 300-500 years. <p>

<li>A shut-down of the ocean conveyer belt may lead to changes in ocean 
circulation patterns.  A redirection of the gulf stream would somewhat 
ironically cause significant cooling in Western Europe, with temperatures 
comparable to those currently observed in Canada (abstracting from the 
amount of warming which will already have occurred at that date). <p>

<li>The runaway greenhouse effect:  Initial warming levels may be amplified 
through massive feedback effects, e.g. through the liberation of methane from 
previously frozen sediments into the atmosphere. <p>

<li>Abrupt, non-linear changes in climate patterns.  There is paleo-climatic 
evidence from ice-cores pointing at the prospect of a highly unstable climate 
with temperature changes of several degrees Celsius within only a few years. 
<p>

      In addition to such worst case impacts, there may also be surprises, events 
which are impossible to predict before hand and for which no probability of 
occurrence therefore exists. </ul><p>

      Evidently, by their very nature nothing can be said about the direction or 
magnitude of such events.  However, in neither considering the entire 
damage distribution, nor the possibility of surprises, existing estimates are 
clearly incomplete.  This has to be remembered in the decision about the 
optimal greenhouse policy response. <p>

 <b>New Findings </b><p>

     The scientific understanding of climate change and climate change impacts 
is increasing rapidly.  Socio-economic analysis, which uses these scientific 
findings as input, will inevitably lag behind.  Most of the studies surveyed in 
the previous Section work with the climate and impact scenarios of the 1990 
and 1992 IPCC reports (IPCC, 1990a, b; 1992).  New findings and 
methodological advancements that have taken place since then only now 
start to trickle down into socio-economic analysis.  Important recent 
developments include an increased emphasis on adaptation to climate 
change and on climate variability and extreme events.  The importance of 
non-climate change related stress factors and of integrated climate change 
assessment is also increasingly stressed (see Fankhauser and Tol, 1996).  As a 
consequence of these and other scientific developments, Fankhauser and Tol 
(1996) identify three broad tendencies in damage assessment: <p>
<ol>
<li>Increasing Regional and Sectoral Differences:  Recent findings stress the 
regional diversity of impacts.  The notion that a warmer world will know 
winners as well as losers now features far more prominently than in the first 
generation of assessments.  Agricultural studies like Rosenzweig and Parry 
(1994) or Reilly et al (1994), for example, identify many developed and other 
northern latitude countries as possible winners, provided farmers take 
adequate adaptation measures.  Food insecurity in the South, on the other 
hand, is likely to further aggravate.  Differences are also increasingly 
emphasized between different regions within a country, and between 
different agents, sectors and commodities. <p>

<li>Lower Market Impacts in DeveLoped Countries:  Re-assessments of 
market-related impacts in developed countries have in many cases lead to a 
reduction in expected impacts compared to earlier estimates.  Yohe et al 
(1996), for example, observe a continuous decrease in estimated damage costs 
from sea level rise.  Calculations for the US by Rosenthal et al (1994) suggest 
that earlier estimates of energy sector costs may have been too high, and that 
climate change may in fact be beneficial for many US regions.  More recent 
agricultural estimates also tend to be lower than earlier assessments (eg, 
Adams et al, 1995).  Adjustments in estimates have occurred for a variety of 
reasons.  One of the most important factors is the better incorporation of 
adaptation into impact models.  Whether this trend to decreasing market 
impacts can be extended from industrialized countries to other regions is 
therefore not clear.  As mentioned above, developing countries often lack the 
financial, institutional and technical capacity to efficiently adapt to a warmer 
world in the same way as industrialized countries will. <p>

<li>Increasing Importance of Non-Market Impacts:  While estimates of 
market impacts are often corrected downwards, new results on non-market 
impacts suggest that these effects may initially have been underestimated.  
Improvements in this area have not so much occurred with respect to the 
accuracy of figures it remains low than with respect to their 
comprehensiveness.  Some non-market impacts that were neglected in earlier 
analysis for lack of data can now be quantified.  This is most notably the case 
for health impacts, where numerical estimates are now available for the 
expected spread of malaria in a warmer world (see Matsuoka et al, 1994; 
Martens et al 1994).  Recent work about a link between climate change and the 
spread of diseases such as cholera and dengue fever also suggests that the 
health impacts of climate change may have been underestimated so far (see 
e.g. Stone, 1995). </ol><p>
 
<b>6.  Policy Implications And Conclusions </b><p>

 <b>Frameworks for Decision Making</b> <p>

     What are the policy implications of the above global warming damage 
results? There is hardly an aspect of greenhouse economics which is more 
fiercely disputed than the question of the optimal policy response.  Several 
approaches to the problem can be distinguished on a methodological level, 
and not all of them require a knowledge of greenhouse impacts in monetary 
terms. <p>

      The most prominent approach, at least among economists, is probably the 
cost-benefit approach.  In the cost-benefit approach the optimal policy is 
determined through a trade off between the costs of policy action and the 
benefits from greenhouse damage avoided.  This need not necessarily imply a 
strict cost-benefit analysis in the traditional sense, with costs and benefits 
expressed in monetary units, though.  The cost-benefit philosophy is more 
broadly centered around the general notion of weighing up "goods" against 
"bads". <p>

      Alternatively emission targets could emerge from ethical, political or 
precautionary considerations, more or less independently of the resulting 
costs and benefits.  This is for example the stance taken by Howarth and 
Monahan (1992), who propose a rule for greenhouse action based on the 
sustainability principle.  Today's generation has a moral obligation to defend 
the safety and well being of future generations, "if doing so would not 
noticeably diminish ...[today's] quality of life" (p. 6-85).  Even if climate 
impacts were not catastrophic overall, obligations could still occur towards a 
minority of severely affected people, e.g. the inhabitants of small island states.  
Carbon targets based on the precautionary principLe have for example been 
proposed by Krause et al (1989) and Swart and Vellinga (1994). <p>

      It is not the purpose of this paper to decide on the respective merits of each 
of these approaches.  Our interest rests with the economic assessment of 
greenhouse impacts, and consistent with this scope, the following analysis 
will concentrate on those approaches which require some knowledge about 
the economic costs of global warming. <p>

 <b>Cost-Benefit Results </b><p>

     The first application of the cost-benefit method to global warming is the 
influential paper by Nordhaus (1991).  On the basis of a marginal 
CO<SUB>2</SUB> damage of 7.3 $/tC in the best guess case <a 
href="figures/fanktable4.gif">(see Table 4)</a>, the 
paper concludes that only a limited amount of greenhouse abatement would 
be warranted.  An alternative to the controversial Nordhaus model has been 
provided by Cline (1992a).  Owing to the inclusion of features like no regrets 
options and risk aversion, and by using a different discount rate Cline found 
favorable benefit-cost ratios for an aggressive abatement plan of freezing 
CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions at 4 GtC per annum, about two thirds of their 
1990 level. <p>

      More sophisticated optimal control models that were developed since 
provide a similarly differentiated picture, see for example the results from the 
models MERGE (e.g. Manne and Richels 1995) CETA (Peck and Teisberg, 1992, 
1993) and DICE (Nordhaus, 1994).  While most models tend to be similar to 
Nordhaus' earlier results - DICE for example calculates an optimal 
CO<SUB>2</SUB> reduction of only about 15% off baseline projections by 
2100 - the results are extremely sensitive to the underlying assumptions. <p>

      This has been noted by Cline (1992b) who replicated the DICE model and 
observed that the Nordhaus result of only modest abatement "does not stem 
inherently from the optimization model and approach used, but hinges on 
the particular assumptions applied" (p.31), the most important one being the 
choice of the discount rate.  In some of Cline's alternative calculations 
CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions are virtually phased out by the end of the 21st 
century.  Other critical features include the availability of a carbon free 
backstop technology and the treatment of non-market damages.  By 
interpreting non-market damages as a direct   element in the utility function, 
rather than a production cost, Tol (1994b) found significantly higher 
abatement levels than Nordhaus. <p>

      A similar, although less extreme picture also arises from the sensitivity 
analyses done by Peck and Teisberg (1992, 1993).  Over the first forty or fifty 
years the various optimal emission trajectories calculated in the model barely 
differ from each other and all closely follow the baseline.  The subsequent 
trajectory, however, strongly depends on the chosen damage parameters, 
particularly on the slope of the damage function. Significant emission 
reductions only occur for a steep damage- temperature relationship (Peck and 
Teisberg, 1993). <p>

 <b>Hedging Against Catastrophes</b> <p>

     It is one of the main weaknesses of many greenhouse cost- benefit models 
that they tackle the problem as if all parameters were known with certainty.  
Clearly, this is not the case, and an optimal greenhouse policy has to take 
uncertainty into account.  Many advocates of immediate action interpret 
greenhouse gas abatement as an insurance, and argue that for the same 
reasons as individuals are willing to secure themselves against hazards of all 
sorts, society should be willing to spend some money to protect itself against 
adverse climatic effects, particularly since these may be irreversible and 
potentially disastrous.  This view is implicit in much of the literature on the 
precautionary principle.  An explicit analysis of the insurance argument is 
Manne and Richels (1992, 1995). <p>

      Much of the persuasiveness of the insurance argument hinges on the fear 
of a possible climate catastrophe.  The question of how to handle such high 
impact/low probability events is however far from settled.  Two archetypal 
methods of decision theory have been applied so far.  The first is the expected 
utility approach, as used by e.g. Peck and Teisberg (1994).  The second is a 
maximin approach, as proposed by e.g. Krause et al (1989).  To minimize the 
risk of a climate catastrophe the approach requires that an emission target be 
set at the maximum level of emissions under which a climate catastrophe can 
reasonably be excluded. <p>

      In the Peck and Teisberg (1994) model the atmosphere is interpreted as an 
exhaustible resource of unknown stock.  Exhausting the resource (passing a 
climate threshold) would trigger a climate catastrophe.  People take 
precautions against this event by reducing emissions, and the optimal rate of 
emissions is determined in a trade off between abatement costs and the risk of 
catastrophe.  The amount of abatement undertaken crucially depends on the 
degree of people's risk aversion, as well as on their perception of the 
likelihood of a catastrophe.  Surprisingly, the Peck and Teisberg results hardly 
differ from those achieved with a conventional damage function (e.g. Peck 
and Teisberg, 1992).  In the main scenario CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions 
continue to rise throughout the next century and reach almost 40 GtC/year by 
the Year 2100, about six times 1990 levels.  In a more pessimistic scenario 
emissions still rise to about 20 GtC/year in 2100, and are only gradually 
reduced below 1990 levels thereafter. <p>

      With a maximin approach the picture is completely different.  Under a 
maximin strategy society is only concerned with the worst possible outcome 
(i.e. an early catastrophe) and implements the policy which would maximize 
the payoff under this scenario.  As a consequence the resulting abatement 
targets are rather high.  In the analysis of Krause et al. (1989) it leads to the 
imposition of a maximum warming target of 0.1 C/decade, and 1.5 C in total.  
Working backwards they found that this would translate into a reduction in 
emissions of 20% below 1985 levels by 2015 and 75% by 2050. <p>

 <b>Policy Implications </b><p>

     The variability of methodologies and the high sensitivity of results makes 
it difficult to derive policy conclusions.  Existing optimal control models on 
the one hand have a tendency to favor relatively moderate abatement levels.  
A risk minimization strategy on the other hand would require significant 
emission cuts within the next two decades or so.  Outside the cost-benefit 
paradigm a case for more stringent abatement could also be made for reasons 
of intergenerational equity, or on the grounds that the fate of the worst 
affected nations, e.g. small island states, should merit particular attention. 
<p>

      Fortunately, the problem is less severe once it is recognized that decisions 
can be taken sequentially (Manne and Richels, 1991).  While model 
predictions heavily differ over the medium and long term, there is far less 
divergence with respect to the immediate future the time period with which 
current abatement decisions are concerned.  Cline (1993, p.18) even observes 
"a surprising convergence of the various analyses" for the first decade, with a 
10-15% emission cut emerging as a possible consensus policy for the next ten 
years or so. <p>

      For subsequent periods, there are signs that the inclusion of secondary 
environmental and economic benefits (e.g. lower air pollution damage 
because of carbon abatement, see IPCC, 1995b) into cost-benefit analyses could 
tilt the balance in favor of a more stringent abatement policy in the medium 
run.  This would be consistent with the precautionary and equity views held 
by many authors, and would hopefully leave enough time to learn more 
about the emission policy required in the long term.  Insuring the world 
against global warming may not be too expensive, after all. <p>

EDITOR'S NOTE:  Montgomery states in his talk that it could be

very expensive to try to meet near-term targets and timetables

for emissions reductions, based on analyses of the economic

impacts.  He sites alternatives that can achieve the same climate

goals at much lower costs, including:  accumulating more

scientific information about climate change; investing in

research and development on energy efficient carbon-free energy

supply technologies; avoiding placement of resources into very

expensive near-term emission reductions, but instead putting them

as a hedge into finding the kind of technologies that will make

it possible to reduce emissions much more cheaply in the future;

and planning for only very modest and very low-cost emission

reductions in the near term, until these new energy sources

become available.  His contention is that such alternatives

represent the best direction indicated by the analysis of the

economic costs of emission reductions.

<center><h1>Integrated Assessment - What Can It Tell Us?  </h1>



<b>James Edmonds <br>

Battelle Pacific Northwest Laboratories   </b> </center>

<p>



     My charge is to look at integrated assessment and what can

it tell us.  Integrated assessment isn't a new area, though there

has been a great deal of interest in it lately.

<p>

     There are a variety of definitions of integrated assessment

(IA) that have been put forward.  The one that I find most

appealing is:  "Integrated assessment examines knowledge derived

from diverse disciplinary research endeavors for the purpose of

understanding the implication of their interactions and to gain

insights not otherwise available."  That is, IA creates

interdisciplinary knowledge from multidisciplinary sources of

information.  The classic example is energy-economic models

coupled to carbon cycle or atmospheric chemistry models.  The

field has of late gone much further and preceding speakers have

pointed out that IA models have looked at sea level rise, climate

change, economic and non-economic damages from climate change,

and have ultimately been put together into a cost-benefit

framework.

<p>

     When IA modelers are successful, they engage in

interdisciplinary research.  That is, there is enough knowledge

transferred from the relevant disciplinary areas to affect more

than the simple butting together of models that were created for

other purposes.

<p>

     Very importantly, IA models contain feedbacks and

interactions of sub-systems.  If it were not for that fact, the

problem would be a simple linear one.  That is, it would be

possible to take results from one disciplinary area and simply

add them linearly to the results of another disciplinary area. 

But IA produces insights from the interaction of disciplinary

areas that were not obvious to researchers working separately in

the individual disciplinary areas.

<p>

     As I indicated, IA is an field which has received a great

deal of attention of late.  In 1977, when Bill Nordhaus put

together the first of the integrated assessment models, there was

just one model.  Last April, there were 14 models participating

in the Energy Modeling Forum, inter-model comparison.  There are

a large number of models operating at the present.

<p>

     Because there are a great number of computer models

operating, there has been a sense that integrated assessment is

nothing but modeling.  This is not correct. Integrated assessment

occurs any time knowledge is combined to gain some insight

otherwise unavailable.  IA therefore need not be embedded in a

computer code.  The Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change

(IPCC) is an integrated assessment process without a computer

code.

<p>

     In looking back over the last few years of work in the field

of IA I have chosen a set of four results derived from IA

research efforts that have had a major impact:
<ol>

     <li>  Sulfur emissions matter,

     <li>  Timing matters,

     <li>  Hedging helps us cope with an uncertain world, and

     <li>  Climate change is a global not regional problem.

</ol>

     The first result is that sulfur emissions matter. This is

one of the most intriguing results that has come out of IA

research.  It stems from the fact that the use of fossil energy

not only generates emissions of carbon compounds (all of which

are greenhouse related gasses), but also sulfur emissions, which

also affect the Earth's radiative balance.

<p>

     Unlike emissions of carbon and nitrogen compounds, whose

presence in the atmosphere tends to warm the climate, sulfur has

a very powerful cooling effect.  It also adds complexity to the

formulation of policy that was not there before.  This is

important and needs to be recognized.

<p>

     The second conclusion that previous speakers have mentioned

is that timing matters.  To implement the Framework Convention on

Climate Change (FCCC), which has as its objective the

stabilization of concentrations of greenhouse gasses in the

atmosphere in a cost effective manner requires the distribution

of emissions over time.

<p>

     The third result grows out of the research on uncertainty

and value of information.  That is, it pays to hedge against

unlikely but high-consequence events.  If decision makers are

risk averse, the existence of a high-consequence event, even if

highly unlikely, tends to skew the response toward more action

sooner than compared with a policy formulated on the basis of the

most likely outcome.

<p>

     Finally, climate change emissions are a global, not a

regional or national, problem.  It matters a great deal whether

or not emissions controls are formulated as a cooperative or a

non-cooperative endeavor.  There is a lot of money at stake in

this decision.

<p>

     I will elaborate on each of these points.  I will begin with

sulfur.  The first time that I encountered the sulfur result was

a couple of years ago in doing some work for IPCC Working Group

II, in which we were examining advanced energy technologies,

which were presumed to be available at costs which were highly

competitive.  We didn't grapple with whether or not those costs

were available today or not; we simply assumed for the sake of

the calculation that we could achieve these goals of getting very

low cost technologies which do not emit carbon freely to the

atmosphere.

<p>

     We gradually introduced them into a scenario whose reference

case was similar to the IPCC's case, IS92a, a scenario which is

right down the middle of the range of research results from a

vast literature.  We also examined their implications when the

reference case was similar to IPCC IS92c, which is toward the low

end of emissions under business-as-usual, and IPCC case IS92e, a

case toward the high end of the range of business-as-usual

scenarios found in the literature.  The introduced of advanced

energy technologies reduces fossil fuel carbon emissions

dramatically.  In fact they reduce emissions to the point where

the concentration of atmospheric CO2 stabilizes below 500 parts

per million without further policy intervention.

<p>

     But surprisingly, at very low emissions the global mean

temperature was higher for the first 50 years than in the

reference case.  This was highly surprising.  When we went back

and unraveled this unexpected result, we found that as the

emissions of carbon were being reduced, so too were the emissions

of sulfur.  We were cleaning up an acid rain problem at the same

time as we were taking care of the greenhouse problem, but we had

made the near-term greenhouse problem worse.

<p>

     That result was very surprising.  IPCC Working Group I found

the sulfur effect was so powerful that it explains why climate

models without sulfur in them show about twice as much warming as

observed in the historical record.  Sulfur emissions explain the

apparent inconsistency in the history of climate modeling.  But

in an IA model sulfur implies that very aggressive emissions

reductions in the near term lead to higher temperatures rather

than lower temperatures.  Note however, that past the year 2050

the effects of sulfur are dominated by the direct effects of

carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses, and that reductions

in emissions lead to lower temperatures than in the reference

case.

<p>

     The second noteworthy IA modeling result concerns the timing

of emissions reductions.  Timing matters in implementing the

FCCC, which has as its goal the stabilization of greenhouse gas

emissions at concentrations that would prevent dangerous

anthropogenic interference with the climate. 

<p>

     Having said that, the FCCC was put together by teams of

international negotiators who crafted language that everybody

could live with.  When the goal was established, it was a goal

with which everyone could agree, but the FCCC never said what

constitutes dangerous anthropogenic interference with the

climate.

<p>

     I will focus today on two concentration ceilings:  450 ppmv

and 550 ppmv.  They are interesting because they require policy

intervention immediately to achieve.  But they are not so low as

to require negative emissions.  And they are not so high as to

require no near-term policy intervention at all.

<p>

     The identification of an emissions trajectory which

simultaneously minimizes economic cost and leaves an atmospheric

concentration ceiling is a familiar problem to economists. 

Researchers in the area of climate change have examined variants

of the problem for many years.  Nordhaus (1979) was the first to

examine the problem which has more recently been considered by

Richels and Edmonds (1994), Kosobud et al. (1994), Manne and

Richels (1995), and Wigley, et al. (1995).  Several reasons argue

for a particular pattern of emissions if the economic burden to

society is to be minimized.  The generic path for an emissions

trajectory which stabilizes emissions has three phases:  

<ol>

     <li>  Increasing emissions,

     <li>  Emissions Peak, and 

     <li>  Declining emissions.  

</ol>

The extent of each of these phases depends on height of the

ceiling, the cost of emissions reductions and the nature of the

cost function, and on the carbon cycle.

<p>

     The rationale for the three phase optimal trajectory can be

seen by considering a ceiling of 500 ppmv.  Begin by noting that

present fossil fuel emissions rates of 6 PgC/yr imply a CO<sub>2</sub>

concentration in year 2100 of 500 ppmv.  Since constant emissions

imply concentrations in the years beyond 2100 in excess of 500

ppmv, then observance of a ceiling implies that year 2100 fossil

fuel emissions must fall below 6 PgC/yr.  If this is the case,

then emissions in some year prior to 2100 must be in excess of 6

PgC/yr.  The economic and carbon cycle considerations listed

below argue that any extra emissions be taken near the present:

<ol type=A>

<li>   The Carbon Cycle Dividend:  For any concentration ceiling,

     cumulative emissions tend to be greater the earlier in the

     period of analysis emissions are released.  Thus comparing

     two emissions trajectories, both of which satisfy the

     concentration ceiling, the profile with larger near-term

     emissions will also have larger cumulative emissions.  We

     refer to this phenomenon as the "carbon cycle dividend." 

     The carbon cycle dividend can be substantial.  For the 550

     ppmv computation the difference between cumulative emissions

     for the stable emissions and atmospheric stabilization cases

     between 1990 and 2100 is 290 PgC (48 years of fossil fuel

     carbon emissions at 1990 rates).  The "carbon cycle

     dividend" is so large that annual emissions need not return

     to 1990 levels until the year 2040 to achieve the 450 ppmv

     ceiling and the year 2100 to satisfy the 550 ppmv ceiling. 

     This is despite the fact that steady-state 1990 emissions

     exceed a concentration of 550 ppmv early in the twenty-

     second century.  The carbon cycle dividend operates because

     the sooner emissions enter the atmosphere, the longer

     natural removal mechanisms have to operate and the more that

     can be removed by a fixed date.

<p>

<li>   Discounting:  Any economic activity such as emissions

     reductions requires the allocation of scarce resources.  A

     positive marginal product of capital means that resources

     set aside today can accommodate a larger burden, if they are

     not needed until some future date.  Put another way, the

     further in the future a given economic burden lies, the

     smaller the resources that must be set aside today to

     facilitate the activity.  There is great leverage to be

     gained by postponing the burden of emissions reductions. 

     This is not the same as procrastinating.  There is still a

     present day resource equivalent burden, but the overall

     resource requirements are lessened.  Furthermore, it does

     not mean doing nothing.  Emissions must eventually peak and

     decline and therefore the nature of new investments must

     change immediately, because each piece of new capital

     installation must spend an increasingly long period

     operating in a reduced emissions environment.

<p>

<li>   Technology Development:  Emissions reduction technologies

     are not static.  As the IPCC Working Group II notes,

     multiple technologies exist in various stages of development

     and deployment which have the capacity to reduce emissions

     in the future at costs lower than those required today. 

     Since cumulative emissions reductions are largely fixed

     (subject to the qualifications of the carbon cycle mentioned

     above) then costs are lowered by undertaking emissions

     reductions most strenuously when they are cheapest -- in the

     future -- since a tonne of emissions reduction counts as

     much or more if it is undertaken in the future as it does if

     taken now.

<p>

<li>   Capital Utilization:  Both physical and human capital are

     created with a set of expectations about the environment in

     which they will be used.  These expectations shape the

     character of these investments.  Historical investments have

     been made with the expectation of little or no carbon

     emission penalty.  There is a cost to utilizing capital in

     an environment for which it was not configured.  As a

     general rule, the greater the departure from the anticipated

     operating environment, the larger the penalty sustained. 

     For atmospheric stabilization ceilings which do not require

     immediate emissions reductions, there is a benefit to

     announcing future emissions controls, but implementing them

     over time.  See point 2 above for further discussion.

</ol>

     Richels and Edmonds (1994) have shown that the cost of

efficiently stabilizing the atmosphere at 500 ppmv may be only

half the cost of efficiently stabilizing emissions.

<p>

     The third observation that comes out of integrated

assessment is that in the face of an unlikely but highly

undesirable event an appropriate risk averting policy response is

to hedge.  In terms of the FCCC, hedging tells us to set a lower

greenhouse gas concentration ceiling than we would otherwise.  So

these results are a different cut through the climate problem

than the timing result.

<p>

     The hedging result says that if you don't love risk, i.e.

you are risk averse, that even if disaster is unlikely, but still

possible, recognizing the potential for that disaster would lead

you to take more action sooner than you would if you just took a

statistical approach to the problem.

<p>

     The literature that has looked at this is relatively small

so far.  But what it tends to indicate is that given the current

probabilities of extreme consequences, that the appropriate

financial surcharge is approximately $5 per tonne of carbon

emissions.

<p>

     The fourth result emerging out of the integrated assessment

literature is one that joint implementation of emissions

reductions are cheaper than uncoordinated policies which achieve

the same emissions reductions.  Climate change emissions are a

global, not a regional or national problem.

<p>

     Minimizing the cost of any emissions reduction goal requires

joint implementation.  That is we seek mechanisms that will

induce all parties to reduce emissions up to the point where the

cost of the last tonne of emissions reduction is the same for

every one.  If the marginal cost of emissions reductions are

unequal, there are gains to be had by trading.  If it costs me a

hundred dollars to get rid of a tonne and it costs you one dollar

to get rid of a tonne, there is a wide range of potential benefit

to both of us for me to pay you to take out a tonne rather than

me.  I can pay you up to 99 dollars and be ahead.  You can take

anything above a dollar and be ahead.  So there is tremendous

room for benefit to trade, and we saw this result discussed in

the cost-benefit analysis paper.  Any time there is a difference

in the marginal cost of emissions reductions, there is potential

for everybody to be better off and nobody to be worse off by

emissions trading.

<p>

     The magnitude of these gains can be seen in the example of

the AOSIS proposal.  If OECD nations execute emissions reductions

responsibilities individually, the total global cost is about a

little bit more than two and a half trillion 1990 US dollars,

discounted at five percent per year from 2050 to the present.  If

these emissions reductions were taken globally on a least cost

basis, costs would be cut by two-thirds.

<p>

     I am open to questions.

<center><h1>                   Questions - Session III   </h1>



                     <b> David Montgomery   </b>   </center>

<p>





     PARTICIPANT:  Doesn't the needed level of carbon tax

depend in part on what to do with the carbon tax, for

example, re-invest it in pollution control?

<p>

     DR. MONTGOMERY:  There has been a lot of work on this

issue. It always makes sense to separate how you raise

revenue to pay for something from what it is that it makes

sense to do.  That I think is mostly how we have approached

the analysis of carbon tax.  

<p>

     The primary effect of a carbon tax is to give an

incentive for reducing emissions.  We have assumed that the

revenues are recycled through general tax reform, because we

wanted to separate an analysis of what are the costs of

reducing emissions from an analysis of, are there

opportunities to come up with a better tax system than the

United States has now.  Lots of economists have thought for

a long time that we have needed a better tax system in the

United States, and have not gone very far in achieving it. 

We have been trying to focus on the cost of emission

reductions.

<p>

     The use of revenues from a carbon tax to subsidize

specific kinds of improvements in energy efficiency or

adoption of alternative energy technology does not change

the costs of those investments.  The real economic cost

stays exactly the same, no matter whether it is paid by a

taxpayer or by a government.  So the estimates of the costs

of reducing climate emissions would not be different if we

assume that the revenues went to pay for subsidizing

particular kinds of changes in reductions in carbon

emissions.  In fact, if those subsidies were directed at

relatively inefficient ways of reducing emissions, they

would actually increase the costs.  The incentive that is

provided by the higher cost of energy will, by itself,

direct attention toward those emission reductions.  

<p>

     So I think we need to keep separate each of those

effects.  The primary effect of a carbon tax is incentives. 

That produces a reduction in emissions.  How the revenues

are utilized, the question of who pays for something,

doesn't change the real economic cost.  

<p>

     PARTICIPANT:  What makes these changes happen within

the time frame you're talking about?  You are essentially

saying let's delay ten or 20 years.  What are the incentives

that prevent us from getting to the point 20 years from now

where we are again saying let's delay 20 years?

<p>

     DR. MONTGOMERY:  It is not a policy of doing nothing,

and I didn't say anything like that.  The challenge for

policy is to move climate science forward enough that there

can be a consensus of whether or not it is worth doing.  The

second challenge for policy is to design ways of stimulating

R&D investment as a hedge against the possibility that it

will be needed in the future.  That is not a trivial

challenge, but it is one that is not even addressed by calls

for targets and timetables for immediate emission reduction.

<p>

     Anything we do over the next five or ten years is going

to be transitory, because it is going to be changing

peoples' behavior.  That is the only way to drive down

emissions rapidly.  It is not building the base for the kind

of long term changes in energy technology that would be

necessary if ultimately it was decided that significant

reductions in greenhouse gasses are needed.

<p>

     That is what the policy should be focusing on, and it

is an illusion to think we even accomplish anything for the

environment by adopting targets and timetables for the next

five to ten years.

<center><h1>              An Environmentalist's Perspective on

             the Current State of the Climate Debate   </h1>



                        <b> Jeremy Leggett  <br>
 
                    Greenpeace International  </b></center>

<p>





<b>1.  Introduction </b> 

<p>

     During 1995 the scientific evidence backing a grim threat-

assessment for global warming has been tightening.  This paper

begins with a synopsis of the recent scientific evidence, which is

soon to become codified in the Second Assessment of the

Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, due for release in

December.

<p>

     Despite such robust evidence of clear-and-present danger, as

1995 draws to a close it is clear that the world is failing to face

up to the enhanced-greenhouse  threat.  At the climate

negotiations, most developed countries now accept that they will

not even meet their target of stabilizing greenhouse-gas emissions

by 2000.   Meanwhile, the energy industry has become entrenched in

a defence of perceived short-term vested interests.          


<p>

     In contrast, the financial sector has shown the first signs of

awakening to the greenhouse threat not only as a major problem, but

also as a potentially significant future market driver.  This paper

very briefly reviews that process, which is summarized further in

a forthcoming edited volume to be published in December by the

German insurer Gerling Group.(1)

<p>

     At the same time that the financial sector has been taking an

increasing interest in the issue, a second important new dynamic

has been taking shape.  Publics have shown recently that they are

now capable of exerting crushing consumer pressure,

internationally, once their concern is awakened on environmental

issues.  The importance of this with regard to the enhanced-

greenhouse problem is that although publics are not yet placing

global warming high on their list of environmental concerns, it

seems inevitable - as a corollary of what climate scientists are

now warning about climate change - that it will soon move up the

ladder of concern.

<p>

     I focus in this paper on these two emerging dynamics: the

respective awakening processes of the financial sector and publics

to the greenhouse threat.  I assess the potential interplay in the

years ahead between these dynamics and the  governmental domain,

and examine the implications for markets.

<p>

     I argue that creating huge new markets in solar-power will be

the single most important factor in beating the enhanced-greenhouse

threat, and fashioning sustainable economies.  A key theme

developed towards the end of the paper is that lurking in the

greenhouse threat are not just economic dangers, but opportunities. 

A potentially historic opportunity is in the process of opening up

for a greenhouse-driven marriage between investment capital and

consumer market-pull, on a scale capable of explosively inflating

the use of solar energy globally.  Such an achievement would be the

single biggest possible contribution to abating the greenhouse

threat, and would trigger instant progress towards solving many

other economically-threatening human societal and environmental

problems into the bargain.


<p>


<b> 2.  The state of the climate negotiations, and the interplay

between government and industry to date  </b>

<p>

     The world in general began waking up to the threat of an

enhanced greenhouse effect in the late 1980s.  The

Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was convened, and in 

1990 duly delivered an authoritative and extremely gloomy

prognosis.(2)  Governments reacted, and had by June 1992 negotiated

the Framework Convention on Climate Change, a treaty without teeth

(which is to say greenhouse-gas emissions-reductions commitments)

but with a tough objective inevitably requiring such teeth sooner

or later (i.e. stabilization of atmospheric greenhouse-gas

concentrations at levels which pose no threat of dangerous

interference with climate, a goal requiring deep cuts in

emissions).

<p>

     Throughout that process, and in the continuing negotiations,

the oil industry combined with coal and other fossil-fuel-related

industries to try and stall governments' efforts to begin an

international global-warming policy response commensurate with the

threat.  But this "carbon club" lobby, as it has become known

(including organizations like the Global Climate Coalition  the

Global Climate Council, and the International Petroleum  Industries

Environmental Conservation Association), failed to derail the

negotiations.  The Convention on Climate Change has now come into

force - it is, in other words, an instrument of international law -

 and at the Berlin Climate Summit in April, governments negotiated

a mandate to agree a protocol on emissions reductions by 1997.

<p>

     However, the prospects for achieving the stated goal look bad. 

OECD governments have proved either unwilling or unable in the five

years of the climate negotiations to put in place policies capable

of limiting national emissions.  All major efforts to do so, such

as the proposed carbon-energy tax in the EU, and BTU energy tax in

the USA, have run into the sand.  Electric utilities in 1995 are

rewarded for generating rather than saving kilowatts to the same

bewildering extent they were in 1990.  Oil companies have come

under no pressure to seriously begin planning for a future where

efforts are being made to cut back on oil demand.

<p>

     In parallel, depressing evidence that global warming is a

major threat continues to build up in  the technical journals.


<p>


<b>3.  Recent evidence that a warming "signal" is becoming clear,  and

related evidence of growing concern about the greenhouse (April -

September 1995)  </b>

<p>



     The contents of the premier scientific journals in the months

immediately following the Berlin Climate Summit in April revealed

a pronounced decrease in the level of uncertainty top climate-

change researchers were prepared to ascribe to the view that the

warming in recent decades might be due to reasons other than

greenhouse warming.  On 7th April, a researcher from AT&T's Bell

Labs published a statistical treatment of the twentieth-century

warming record showing correspondence between warming and a

decreasing amplitude of the annual temperature cycle - the

temperature difference between winter and summer.  Had changes in

incoming solar radiation been solely or largely responsible for 

observed warming, as greenhouse skeptics tend to argue, the reverse

should have been the case.  Solar variability, AT&T researcher

David Thomson concluded, "is at most a minor factor." (3)  Thomson

told New Scientist that "you almost have to invoke magic if it is

not carbon dioxide.  It's the only logical explanation."(4)

<p>

     On 21 April, scientists at the US National Climatic Data

Center reported that they had found a pattern suggesting that the

US climate has turned towards a greenhouse regime in the last 15

years.  They compiled data on climatic extremes expected to arise

under greenhouse warming, including higher-than-normal daily

minimum temperatures, extreme or severe droughts in warm months,

and much-above-normal precipitation in cool months.  Using this

data, they calculated a Greenhouse Climate Response Index in order

to express any persistent trends.  The index has been consistently

high since the late 1970s, in marked contrast to the pattern in

earlier decades.  Thomas Karl, the lead researcher, concluded that

the probability that this can be natural fluctuation in a stable

climate is only about 5%.(5)

<p>

     In June came two other high-powered studies similarly

dismissive of natural climatic variability as an explanation for

the hot years of the 1980s and 1990s, this time in the global

record.  A team from Germany's leading climate lab, the Max Planck

Institute for Meteorology, concluded that there is only one chance

in forty that natural variability can explain the warming seen over

the last 30 years.  "At the moment there is no other convincing

explanation than carbon dioxide for such a big change in

temperature," a member of the German team, Gabriele Hegerl,

reported.  A second team at the USA's Lawrence Livermore Laboratory

factored the cooling influence of sulphate aerosols (largely

derived from coal burning) into the temperature record, leaving a

clear greenhouse fingerprint since about 1950, when the growth of

carbon dioxide emissions took off.  Commenting on this in Science

magazine, Thomas Karl said "you're seeing a shift in the overall

scientific view".(6)

       <p>                                       

     Then, on 1Oth August the results of the most sophisticated

climate-model experiments yet performed were reported in Nature

magazine.  Researchers at the UK's Meteorological Office

effectively simulated past climate variations using a coupled model

(one linking both the atmospheric and oceanic components of the

climate system) which also factored in the sulphate aerosol

effect.(7)  This breakthrough significantly boosted confidence in

the accuracy of the models used for forecasting climate change in

the future.  Leading IPCC climatologist Tom Wigley wrote in a

commentary that "'these results mark a turning point both in our

ability to understand past changes and predict the future".(8)

<p>

     The impression of a significant stiffening of scientific

opinion on the question of "the signal" was reinforced at a

conference of leading climatologists in Colorado, reported in

Nature on 24th August.  Rapporteur Michael MacCracken, summarizing

many presentations, concluded that the evidence for an

anthropogenic signal was becoming "quite compelling.  Although

greenhouse gases and aerosols are not yet convicted beyond all

reasonable doubt (in the warming of recent decades), the case is

becoming steadily stronger".(9)

<p>

     And at the same time, the drip of worrying evidence that the

feedbacks may be preparing to kick in, stoking up an amplifying

effect for future warming, did not abate.  In Science magazine on

25th August, a team of researchers at the US National Oceanographic

and Atmospheric Administration reported that they had found

isotopic evidence for a large sink for carbon dioxide on land in

the northern hemisphere during 1992 and 1993.  "Because carbon

storage on land is likely to be more transient and vulnerable to

anthropogenic and climatic perturbations than storage in the

oceans," they concluded, "the current partitioning of CO<sub>2</sub> uptake

between the oceans and the land biosphere may well have significant

implications for future increases in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>".(10)  
Within

a week, as though to abate hopes that even the oceanic sink would

hold up, came evidence in Nature magazine that the oceans may be

losing fixed nitrogen.  Fixed nitrogen, as the nutrient nitrate, is

a major control on the abundance of phytoplankton.  Denitrification

- the degradation of nitrate by bacteria in areas of oxygen-

deficient surface waters in the oceans - converts fixed nitrogen to

free nitrogen or nitrous oxide,  of no use to most plants. 

Studying nitrogen balances,  Canadian and American oceanographers

found evidence that warmer  oceans will lose nitrate, so depleting

phytoplankton, so boosting atmospheric carbon dioxide.(11)

<p>

     On 10th September, the stiffening of scientific opinion

reached the front page of the New York Times.  The headline

referred to a leaked draft copy of the IPCC's Second Assessment

report, due to be published in December.  It read: "Experts confirm

human role on global warming."

<p>

     Against the march of this kind of evidence and events, soon to

be codified in the IPCC Second Assessment, the arguments of the

small but vocal community of scientific skeptics are beginning to

look increasingly flimsy.                            

<p>

<b> 4.  The emerging reaction of the financial sector to the greenhouse

threat     </b>

<p>

     One of the few moving objects on the radar screen of the

global greenhouse debate comprises the private financial

institutions (insurance companies, banks, and pension funds), which

are in some quarters starting to realize that their future

profitability depends on abating the greenhouse threat, and hence -

 among other corollaries - the early take-off of clean-energy

markets.  The insurance industry fears that climate change can in

principle inflict severe damage on global property-catastrophe

reserves, and that concern is spreading to the banks and pension

funds, who are just beginning to appreciate that they face

potentially severe direct and indirect threats to investments.

<p>

     Two quick examples illustrate the problem.  A recent New York

Times article on the impacts of climate change, reporting a second

leak from the IPCC report, comments about the prospect of sea-level

rise in a warming world as follows.  "At the most likely rate of

rise, some experts say, most of the beaches on the East Coast of

the United States would be gone in 25 years.  They are already

disappearing at an average of two to three feet a year."(12) 

Consider the direct threat to the insurance industries interests

inherent in this statement.  There are over two trillion dollars of

insured assets in US coastal communities.(13)  A direct threat to

banks' interests lies in the  danger posed to debt investments, a

threat which becomes a disaster if - as so many insurance chiefs

now say is possible in an enhanced-greenhouse world - unlucky rolls

of the dice cause a global insurance crash.

<p>

     Talk has already started in the sector of a greenhouse-driven

strategic adjustment of investment behavior.  The Chartered

Insurance Institute Society of Fellows set up a Study Group on

climate change and insurance which concluded in a 1994 report that

"the industry has a limited breathing space in which to gather its

wits, and plan in a truly long-term timeframe."  It recommended

many options, one of which was that "all investment managers should

modify their investment policies to take account of the potential

direct and indirect effects of global warming."(14)  Such options

are discussed by industry actors further in the forthcoming Gerling

book.  In addition to the written word, I have participated in

high-level discussions in insurance companies where options for

greenhouse-gas risk abatement at source have been discussed.  Such

discussions show that, where progressive talk is currently aired,

boardrooms are currently split, and so nothing has yet happened to

change the status quo.  I do not expect that situation to last.  As

I write this paper, my Financial Times carries a full-page advert

by reinsurance giant Swiss Re.  It shows the corporate logo bent

over by winds, and reads "giant storms are triggered by global

warming; this is caused by the greenhouse effect; which is, in

turn, accelerated by man ...Swiss Re, together with its clients

(the insurance companies of the world), is implementing a dedicated

environmental strategy."(15)

<p>

     In this process of awakening to the greenhouse threat / market

driver, financial institutions are in the encouraging company of a

progressive enclave in the gas industry.  Bob Kelly, Executive Vice

President of Enron, told the 1995 US Solar Energy Industries

Association annual trade fair in San Antonio, Texas, that he

believes that global warming will inevitably drive huge solar

markets in the future.  He wants to place his company - one of the

largest gas companies in the world - firmly in the front lines of

the solar revolution.  "We think the multi-megawatt solar industry

is ready to take off," Kelly said.  "Sometime, our children will

have to pay a carbon pollution cost.  That could be a great big

number.  It could be bigger than the budget deficit.  We think

there is a great big market out there, and we are going for it." 

His company can now build 100 MW solar photovoltaic (PV) power

plants, generating electricity at 5.5 cents per kilowatt hour: a

price competitive with fossil-fuel power.   Kelly subsequently

addressed insurers and bankers on this theme at a Greenpeace - US

Solar Energy Industry Association seminar in Washington DC (July

1995), and contributed a chapter to the Gerling volume.


<p>


<b>5.  Public opinion on the environment: growing concern, but not yet

on the greenhouse issue   </b>

<p>



     The chief lesson of the Brent Spar and French-nuclear-testing

episodes in 1995 seems to be the volatile nature of publics in the

mid 1990s when it comes to wilful environmental infringements. 

Market research in a number of countries suggests that core values

on the environment, while routinely subordinate to unemployment as

a concern, have reached a new and  unprecedented level

recently.(16)  Both Shell and President Chirac catastrophically

underestimated the impact on publics of their respective

intentions.  Organs such as the Financial Times, the Economist and

the New York Times have all suggested that the Brent Spar affair

marked a watershed in environmental politics.

<p>

     The corollary of what climate scientists are saying about the

enhanced-greenhouse threat today embodies a clear corollary that a

critical mass of public concern about global warming may be not far

off.  When Mt. Pinatubo erupted in June 1991, NASA's Jim Hansen

predicted that world average temperatures would be cooled by 0.5C

over the next few years.  He was bang on.  He predicted that as

soon as the aerosols from the huge eruption  disappeared from the

stratosphere, the sequence of hot years in the 1980s would begin

again.  Right again.  1995 seems set to be the hottest, on the

global average, since records began 140 years ago.  The eight

hottest have all been since 1980.  In parallel, a suspicious

sequence of worst-of-the-century droughts, drought-related

wildfires, floods and storms has hit most continents since the late

1990s.(17)

<p>

     If publics were to wake up in numbers to the global-warming

threat, generating political currency for politicians, and looking

for opportunities to give shape to their concern, where would the

best avenue for consumer action lie? In the next section, I argue

that the answer to this question lies in the area of solar power.



<p>

<b>6.  The central importance of solar power in fashioning sustainable

economies   </b>

<p>

     Solar energy production emits no greenhouse gases, and

although energy efficiency and other renewables are vital

components of a sustainable energy future (in no way do I intend to

infer that their importance should be down graded) solar

photovoltaic (PV) and solar-thermal energy are the core of the

energy mix in many energy scenarios for the future, including for

example both Greenpeace's and Shell's.(18)  In addition, human

enhancement of the greenhouse effect - awesome a problem though it

is - sits at the head of a long list of other daunting

environmental and societal problems which require that the

developed and developing worlds proliferate solar energy as quickly

as possible.(19)

<p>

     Because China and India have huge coal reserves, which they 

will utilize unless better alternatives are made available,

solarizing the developing world is probably the biggest of all

environmental imperatives.  But it is clear that that will not

happen quickly or pervasively enough to arrest environmental ruin

unless the developed world goes solar, or heads in that direction

fast.(20)  This sounds like visionary, but is in principle

achievable with ease, even using today's solar technologies.  As

Shell's Head of Renewable Energy Supply and Marketing, Roger Booth,

put it in February 1995, "all the world's energy could be achieved

by solar many thousands of times over."(21)

<p>

     The rooftop and building-integrated PV market in the developed

world is potentially vast, and offers the best consumer-led key to

solarizing the world.  For example, BP Solar professes that putting

solar panels of existing efficiency on the rooftops of the UK -

0.4% of the land area in that not optimally sunny land - would

provide all that country's primary energy requirement.(22)  Once a

solar revolution was underway, led by explosive growth of the

rooftop building-integrated and/or the other main solar markets

(developing world off grid, and the solar PV power-plant market)

there could be little doubt that its impact would spread -

critically - into the transport sector, and  ultimately lead to

mass-production of zero-emission and very-low-emission cars: solar

cars, hydrogen cars, battery cars, and hybrids of various kinds.

<b>7.  Adjunct reasons why progressive capital withdrawal from 

carbon-fuels may be inevitable, and advisable.  </b>

<p>

     Delphi International's well-known 1994 report is the first

financial-sector report analyzing threats to carbon-fuel

investments arising from climate change.(23)  The main message of

that ground-breaking study is that the coal and oil industries'

collective denial of the enhanced-greenhouse problem poses

potentially severe threats to investments in those industries.  For

example, most greenhouse spokespersons in the oil industry contend

that because the enhanced greenhouse is not the problem that the

IPCC professes it to be, sea level will not rise appreciably in the

next thirty years.  The New York Times report based on the IPCC

Second Assessment draft, as quoted above,  showcases an interesting

example of the problems involved in  the reality-insulated oil-

industry view.  If there is indeed little threat from

anthropogenically driven sea-level rise, presumably the oil

industry will not enhance risk-management measures for existing

coastal-infrastructure such as  refineries.  Indeed, the industry

will presumably seek support in the capital markets for expansion

of such infrastructure.  It will be interesting to see how many

banks, having read the IPCC second assessment, will prove willing

to capitalize an oil company wanting to build a refinery with a 30

year lifetime on a coast.

<P>

     On top of direct greenhouse-related threats such as this comes

the prospect, in the post-Brent-Spar world, of politically-enforced

major liability payouts, public-relations disasters, and huge

infrastructure-upgrade costs arising from routine operations: for

example in the oil industry's case as a result of the aging tanker

fleet and the parlous state of the pipelines for delivering oil

from frontier provinces.  The main theme, in effect, is that fault

lines have begun to appear in the idea that the oil industry can

add a second century to the oil era.  The intersection of the

greenhouse problem with other escalating environmental problems

suggests that the oil industry will experience severe

capitalization problems in the decade to come.(24)


<p>


<b>8.  The enhanced-greenhouse threat not just as compound  business

threat, but generic business opportunity.  </b>

<p>

     Putting the three key themes of this paper together - the

ongoing greenhouse-awakening of the financial sector, the 

seemingly inevitable upwelling of public concern, and the technical

readiness of solar technology - allows some encouraging crystal-

ball gazing.  If the financial sector did begin a greenhouse-driven

strategic adjustment of investment behavior, the effect could be

seismic, the more so if it intersected with a consumer-focused

upwelling of public concern, and the translation of that concern

into political currency and therefore increased governmental

willingness to act.  The private financial institutions own over

half the equity in corporate America, for example.  Even a switch

of capital from carbon fuels at the margin could have a dramatic

snowballing effect if a way could be found to divert it into solar

markets.  As Time magazine put it in March 1994, "the crucial role

played by the $ 1.41  trillion insurance industry in the world

economy could change the dynamic of the debate about global

warming."

<p>

     There are a number of modus operandi open to financial- sector

actors wishing to act proactively on the question of greenhouse

risk-abatement and loss-reduction.  As I have argued elsewhere,

options include participation in the policy debate at the climate

negotiations themselves, sending unilateral signals in routine

corporate practice favoring clean energy, and investment in the

full gamut of clean-energy markets, not just the embryonic solar

markets.(25)

<p>

     The case for the financial sector to help create new markets

as a route to greenhouse risk-abatement, loss reduction, and

sustainable profit is now compelling.  And it seems that it is

showing the first signs of registering at the top of the banking

industry, as well as the insurance industry.  In September, the

British Bankers Association submitted a paper to the annual meeting

of the chief executives of the world's bankers'  associations.  It

concluded as follows.  "A lot of bank lending today is for long

terms up to 40 or 50 years and often for 20 to 30 years.  Within

the lifetime of loans granted today climate change is forecast to

have a dramatic impact upon industrial operations within 20 to 40

years." The paper discussed the need to monitor the climate

negotiations closely, assessing that "at best it will enable banks

to be full partners, thus protecting as far as possible existing

business and safeguarding opportunities for future business;

clearly there are enormous opportunities to finance new

environmental developments and the development of alternative

energies, amongst others."(26)


<p>


<b> 9.  Conclusions  </b>

<p>



     Contributions to the forthcoming Gerling book on climate

change and financial institutions by financial-sector contributors

capture the themes I have tried to define.   As Dr. Sven Hansen,

Vice President and Head of Environmental Management Services at the

Union Bank of Switzerland, puts it, global warming is "the single

most important environmental problem for the world today ...site

contamination and lender liability are only the tip of a banker's

'environmental iceberg'.  Climate change is from my perspective,

the mass lying underneath the water line and we can't neglect this

part ...(it) will probably surface soon."  Carlos Joly, Senior Vice

President, Environment Policy and Investments at UNI Storebrand,

adds, "prevention must occur through global cooperation before

catastrophe develops.   ...What we invest in long term, how we

manage the assets we are entrusted with, should take into

consideration avoiding causing harm to our clients through

environmental deterioration.  What good does it do us to cash in on

investments 20 years from now if the world goes to hell partly as

a result of what we invest in?" Bob Kelly, Co-Chairman of Amoco-

Enron Solar - an oilman, no less -  seizes on the business

implications of this, in terms of opportunities.  "Solar technology

can play a major role in the global effort to limit CO<sub>2</sub> 
emissions,"

he says.  "Rooftop systems are already feasible."  Hilary Thompson,

Head of Environmental Affairs at the National Westminster Bank,

offers a similar view from the banking sector.  "Climate change

holds implications in terms of funding new sectors, new growth

markets, and solar energy is one - even if we do not understand it

as an industry terribly well - where there are investment

opportunities.  "

<p>

     The solar revolution is coming, it seems, and with it many

benefits.

<p>

     But it will be a race against time.

     number of green consumers.  23% of the British general public

     claim to avoid using the services of a company which they

     consider has a poor environmental record.  Worcester points

     out that this suggests "more than 9 million consumers are

     using their purchasing power to affect the behavior of

     manufacturers in this country to produce green.  When you

     think that this includes one in three ABs, who are nearly one

     in five of the population and more than that in purchasing

     power, this is a powerful force."

     Special Publication, 1994; P.  Kassler "Energy for

     Development" Shell Selected Paper, November 1994.  The

     differences are as follows.  In Shell's Sustained (energy)

     Growth Scenario, solar does not dominate the mix until after

     2050, and it does so in a world where even more coal, oil and

     gas are being burned than today, and all recoverable oil is

     ultimately burned.  In the Greenpeace Fossil Free Energy

     Scenario, solar energy is dominating the global energy mix

     soon after 2030, at which time the use of fossil-fuels has

     fallen to around half today's level and is still falling, so

     that some recoverable oil ultimately remains in the ground

     unused.

<p>

19.  As well as global warming, solar proliferation meaningfully

     addresses the acid rain, air quality, water-quality and

     availability, deforestation, urban migration, and population

     problems.  Solar cells emit no acidifying gases and offer air

     quality both by replacing the need for power plants, and when

     used to charge batteries or make hydrogen fuel, displacing

     gasoline.  It can power water-purification apparatus and can

     make water by driving desalination.  It can obviate the need

     to fell trees by powering solar cookers, and provide power for

     local economic activity, arresting the flow of millions to

     megacities.  Finally, by providing light for reading, and

     power for refrigeration, it can improve literacy and health:

     two of the key drivers of high birth rates.

<p>

20.  Many energy-policy discussions with developing-world diplomats

     at the climate negotiations have shown me that without clear

     evidence that solar technology - or for that matter wider

     clean-energy technologies - are the technology of choice for

     all, the search for development will inevitably be powered

     primarily by fossil-fuel-fired power stations.  As well as

     showing the way to a new development paradigm, however, a

     massive solarization programme in the developed countries can

     accelerate the growth of solar markets in the developing world

     by lowering unit costs of the technology.  The more the volume

     of production globally, the cheaper the price will go, and the

     more the 2 billion people currently without any electricity at

     all might be able to afford it.

 <center><h1>                     Business Perspectives  </h1>



                      <b>    Paul Walitsky  <br>

                    Philips Lighting Company  </b></center>


      <p>  


     We want to talk about the ways in which lighting can be used

to balance the dichotomy between environmental protection and

sustainable development.

<p>

     We are a subscriber to the ICC charter on sustainable

development, and we believe that our products and policies can

truly make things better.  I would like to explain some of the

basics of the electric lighting industry and our perspective. 

Also to say that we have been working with the World Bank in

Poland on an energy-efficient lighting project, in Jamaica, and

also in Mexico, a project in Mexico City and Guadalajara.

<p>

     Because we all use lamps every day -- this room has got over

a hundred, actually -- and electricity is so accessible, it is

easy to overlook how much energy is used in lighting and the

environmental consequences of that usage.  We have to keep in

mind that electricity is a secondary form of energy, and that

primary energy used to generate electric is greater by a factor

of three.  Even so, in the United States electricity amounts to a

growing fraction of energy demand.

<p>

     Lighting is a significant user of electric energy.  In a

standard commercial building about 40 percent is used for

lighting.  That is before the Green Lights update.  If you factor

in the consumer usage, the residential, you get about 20 to 25

percent of the energy in the United States is used for lighting. 

That is a significant number.  Therefore, the potential for

savings is large.


<p>
     The other savings you get besides the direct usage for

lighting is, you reduce the heat load in the building, because

lights generate heat, and then you need more air conditioning to

carry away that heat.  Therefore, the lighting has a direct

impact on the environment.

<P>

     We know that if we look at things like compact fluorescents,

an 18-watt, can replace a 75-watt incandescent.  In that case,

you save 570,000 watt hours of electricity, or a million and a

half watt hours of primary energy.  This reduces the CO<sub>2</sub> by a

significant amount, and also the sulfur, nitrogen dioxide, and

other things that might come out of coal, because coal is still

more than half the power in the United States.

<p>

     The lighting industry has been trying to get more and more

energy-efficient lighting in place.  The compact fluorescents,

which were developed in the early 1980s are now starting to slow

the growth of incandescent lighting.

<p>

     One of our power suppliers in Wisconsin tells us that he is

putting in compact fluorescents wherever he can by subsidizing

the use of those by his consumers.  This trend has slowed down in

the last year or two.  In New York City, Con Ed for a while was

subsidizing that but is no longer.  It seems to have dropped by

the wayside.

<p>

     Now, other energy improvements that we have looked at -- and

it is a long history.  The fluorescent lamp, the standard linear

lamp, was developed in 1938, and it had a 25 lumens per watt

output at that time.  Current fluorescents are now at a hundred

lumens to watt.  The metal halide lamp which is used in street

lighting and parking lots and stadiums started out at 65 lumens

per watt, and it is now at a hundred.  High-pressure sodium,

which was developed in the 1960s at 90 lumens per watt, is now

near 130 lumens per watt.  These kinds of savings mean less

lighting fixtures, they mean less energy generated from the power

plants.  So these are the kinds of things, the trend, of the

lighting industry.

<P>

     The important problem with all of these fluorescents is

metal halides and mercury.  People raise the issue of mercury

content in the lamps.  What we have seen if we look at a life

cycle analysis is that the mercury in the energy-efficient lamps

is a good investment, because it reduces coal burning, and coal

contains mercury, which goes into the atmosphere.  About a factor

of two to four times as much mercury is saved in the standard

fluorescent lamp, when you put that in the ceiling and replace

incandescent lighting.

<p>

     Even with this positive balance to the mercury cycle, the

industry is still moving to reduce mercury content.  This data

has been published in the Federal Register; it is industry-wide

data of the three major fluorescent lamp manufacturers in the

United States combined.

<p>

     In 1985, we had the four-foot inch and a half lamp that had

48 mgs of mercury.  In 1990, it was down to 41, and the end of

last December, the industry average was 22.8.  So in just about

ten years, we have cut the mercury content of the standard four-

foot lamp in half, more than half, actually.  

<p>

     Now in June of this year, Philips announced a new

development in the trend to lower mercury.  We announced a lamp

that we call Alto, which is now less than one-third of the

industry average from last December.  The Alto series of lamps in

this case will have significantly less than ten mgs of mercury. 

The announcement was made in June.  We started production the

week before Thanksgiving, so that we are now getting these lamps

out to the warehouses, and we will start delivering low mercury

lamps within the next week or two.

<p>

     This is a major breakthrough.  This lamp now is in the

single digits of mercury and reduces the mercury load, but it

also changes the equation of how much mercury is saved by putting

fluorescent lamps into the ceiling.  

<p>

     It will come out in the 34-watt lamp, which is a six-watt

reduction from the standard 40-watt; it is the econo-watt

version.  We will gradually introduce this low-mercury feature

throughout the line, so that at the end of 1996, just about all

of Philips' production will be at low mercury.  Since we are the

largest lighting manufacturer in the world, this makes a

significant reduction in the mercury load and lighting.

<p>

     Now, we have pushed the mercury reduction and the wattage

reduction by being active participants in Green Lights.  We are a

partner and an ally with EPA.  We have made the Green Lights

program a cornerstone of our marketing effort, and have been

trying to find new customers for EPA to sign up.  So the Green

Lights effort, which is an effort to change the lighting in the

United States, energy-efficient lighting, finds an ally in

Somerset.  We have in fact done our own factories and our own

warehouses.  We will finish up the last one early in 1996.

<p>

     One of our facilities indicated in the first month of doing

this, a reduction in the bill of $8,000.  That is why energy

efficiency pays, because it reduces the dollars that people pay

out in electrical bills.  Therefore, that money is now available

to do other things.  On the global scale or on the national

scale, if you have energy-efficient lighting, that money now

becomes available to build roads and hospitals and other things

that are not needed to build power plants.

<p>

     The Green Lights and Energy Star are voluntary programs. 

But the Energy Policy Act, which was passed in 1990 in the United

States, is not a voluntary program.  It eliminated the 40-watt

standard cool watt lamp as of this past October.  October 31 of

this year was the last production date for any lamps manufactured

in the United States at a 40-watt size.  So the 34-watt that we

talked about and the low mercury becomes the standard lamp.  That

is why we put the low mercury in it, because it will be the

standard lamp.  The eight-foot lamps were eliminated last April,

and they now are also an econo-watt type version.

<p>

     The real energy saving is to go to 32 watts instead of 34

watts, and go to a T-8 lamp, which is one inch in diameter

instead of an inch and a half.  What this also runs on is an

electronic ballast, and there is an additional wattage savings in

the electronic ballast.  So you can get a 40 percent change in

electrical efficiency by going to the T-8 with electronic

ballast.  This is why Green Lights pays.  When you go from

standard T-12s with magnetic ballast to a T-8 with electronic

ballast, you can reduce your energy cost by 40 percent.

<P>

     In states where the electrical bill is over five cents per 

kilowatt hour, Green Lights is a very good investment, just from

the purely economic standpoint, not being concerned about CO<sub>2</sub>

emissions or the other things you save, just on pure economy.  In

those states where electrical rates are three and four cents an

hour, then the payback is not what industry looks for.  But you

can appeal to the environmental side of it, and still push Green

Lights.  We did our own factory in Salina, Kansas, where electric

rates are three and a half cents.  It was not a particularly good

investment from an economic standpoint, but we did it because we

are a Green Lights partner, and we wanted to get it done.

<p>

       As part of this, I will mention about new technology that

Dr. Edmonds mentioned this morning before lunch.  One of the new

technologies which is just coming out is the T-5.  It won't fit

in existing fixtures.  It is a metric size, with less glass, less

metal, less packaging, more lamps in the truck, so that we get

lamps to the warehouse and to the customers with less tailpipe

emissions, and it is actually more efficient at the end of a

thousand hours than the T-8, which is just starting to grow.  We

are designing fixtures for the T-5 which are going to be lighter

and smaller than the fixtures for the T-8s, so the ceiling

structures don't have to be as heavy or as strong.  The T-5 is a

new technology.  Five years from now, you will see more and more

fixtures in the T-5 range.  That is where technology will take

us.

<p>

     The other concern is the tradeoff between life and

efficiency.  This lamp, an induction lamp, has no electrode and

no filament and is called the QO lamp.  It has a radio frequency

field which excites the mercury, which excites the phosphor. 

This lamp is rated at 60,000 hours.  Nobody knows how long that

lamp is going to last, because nobody has tested it that long

yet.  Our theory is that the electronics will burn out before the

lamp, but it is a perfect application for tops of buildings, for

atriums, for things where nobody ever wants to change a light

bulb again.  It would be beyond our lifetime.  They do sell for a

couple of hundred dollars, but the maintenance savings and the

replacement savings are there.  Right now, it is in two wattages,

85 watt and 55 watt.

<p>

     The other part of the system of lighting are the ballasts. 

I mentioned these electronic ballasts.  There are also hybrid

magnetic and electromechanical ballasts which are more efficient

than before.  Lighting is a system, and you have to look at that

at both the ballast and the lamp.  In that regard, lighting moves

on to new technologies, new things being developed.  

<p>

     We are not the only one that will have the low-mercury lamp. 

Eventually, our friends at GE and Sylvania will have the same

thing.

<p>

     As a worldwide corporation, and the largest lighting company

in the world and one of the largest electronics companies, we

have an environmental policy.  I want to review that policy. 

This has been endorsed by the chairman of the board and the

presidents of all the constituent companies.  Our principles are;

sustainable development in the right place, prevention is better

than the cure, and the total effect on the environment is what we

care about in our products.  And, of course, open contact with

the authorities.

<p>

     The policy comes down to eight statements.  We are committed

to environmental care in all of our operations.  We recognize the

importance of an ongoing involvement with management and all its

employees.  We do believe in life cycle assessment, the total

assessment of the product, maybe because we are European-based,

and are farther along in Europe than it is here.  We are a

supporter of the business charter for sustainable development,

and that is why we are one of the sponsors of this conference.   

We are committed to complying with all the environmental laws,

but we think we need a harmonization throughout the world.  We

see even in the United States, some states want one thing, some

states want another.  If a state is more lax than another, then

it becomes a dumping ground for those things that the more

stringent state doesn't want dumped in its state.

<p>

       The last two from our perspective are that we encourage

recycling of our products throughout the world.  There is a

growing recycling industry in the United States for light bulbs,

and we support that industry.  We have a recycling center in

Europe that recycles TVs and takes apart electronic gear, those

types of things.  We do produce environmental type brochures that

list all the ingredients in the lamps and in the products that we

make.

<p>

     That is our perspective on where technology can take us in

the lighting field.  Because lighting is a major part of the

electrical load, we think it is one that needs attention.  We

think it is one that every company ought to pay attention to, and

change its own light bulbs, an idea that even the UN is now

looking at.

<p>

     These are practical aspects.  These are things which can

lower your organization's electric bill.  When you go back to

your own places, look at your ceiling and see what you've got,

and see how you can make your own contribution to the climate

change problem.

<p>

     DR. FOX-PRZEWORSKI:  Thanks.  Just to give you a footnote on

that, the governments have requested that UNEP institute within

the UN environmental good housekeeping.  Indeed, the UNEP office

in New York, which has not been renovated in 20 years, is using

the occasion to do a green retrofit in a building that is not

ours, by the way.  So it has particular constraints that are

interesting.  There will be a resolution within the General

Assembly requesting that this effort be multiplied and replicated

throughout the UN system.  So we do look forward to carrying

through some of the work that others from your own organizations

have done in green planning and also in green lighting as well. 

Thank you.

     I wanted to compliment Paul Walitsky of Phillips Lighting

Company on his presentation, and I wanted to point out that

virtually all of U.S. industry has been involved for many years

in a wide range of environmental programs.

<p>

     Estimates have been developed by some of our companies that

about 25 percent of U.S. electricity is used for lighting.  If

you could replace all the lighting with modern lamps, you would

probably reduce electricity use by about 12 1/2 percent.  There

is a major effort going on in that area, and I think there are

over a thousand members or participants in the Green Lights

Program which the U.S. EPA is sponsoring.  Our members, basically

U.S. companies, invest over $100 billion a year in the

environment, and our companies are very active internationally as

well.  For instance, the chemical industry has developed an

effective responsible care program, and the petroleum industry

has been very aggressive.  The utility industry is one of the

leaders of the voluntary programs in the United States.

<p>

     I would like to raise a caution regarding some other

comments today.  I don't think we can paint this issue in terms

of good folks and bad folks, right folks and wrong folks.  This

is a very complicated international issue.  How we deal with the

climate issue has serious implications for the future of the

United States economy and economies around the world.  We must

evaluate the impacts of any decisions we make related to the

Climate Change issue based on how it is going to affect our

livelihood, and our ability to drive our economy.

<p>

     I am going to talk about the U.S. and linkages of our

economy to other economies throughout the world.

<p>

     The GCC, which I represent, is a leading business voice on

climate change, and is a broad-based organization of over 55

business and trade associations and companies representing

virtually all sectors of U.S. industry, including utilities,

coal, paper, automobile, cement, railroad, oil, steel, aluminum,

chemical and others.  We represent virtually all of U.S.

manufacturing, and our members comprise almost 40 percent of the

U.S. economy.  We were established in 1989.  We have been active

on this issue in the INC negotiations.  We were a lead voice in

Rio.  Because it is an important issue, there is a lot of

activity and debate, and I think we have to increase the

understanding of the implications of proposals related to this

issue as we try to make decisions.

<p>

     We have worked very aggressively with the U.S. government in

terms of promoting U.S. technology and know-how overseas and in

the development of the Climate Change Action Plan.  We have

worked with the Departments of Energy, Commerce, the White House

and other federal agencies to promote the development of U.S.

exports of energy and environmental technologies.  Many of our

industries invest in alternative energy sources.  It takes a

great deal of capital investment, and they are trying to develop

those.  But you must have a receptive market, and you must have

an infrastructure not only for alternative energy sources, but

for other energy sources that are available to you at a

reasonable cost.

<p>

     The issue has obviously taken on a new characteristic.  With

the cessation of the Cold War, countries are placing much more

emphasis on the economic and social issues in relation to

developing world-wide and regional strategies.  The UN has

increased its clout, and is attempting to increase its role,

which has expanded dramatically, especially on social and

economic issues.  They are aggressively involved in the climate

issue through the Framework Convention on Climate Change

Secretariat, and most of their affiliated agencies.  Therefore

they have a lot of influence on this issue, and we need to pay a

lot of attention to the UN and their process.

<p>

     Developing countries with their growing populations and

economies are increasingly pressing for access to technology and

resources, and are looking to developed countries for this kind

of support.  This is not for Climate Change, but for dealing with

growing populations, for dealing with poverty, for dealing with

environmental issues, for dealing with a range of issues that are

major challenges to those countries.  That is going to take major

resources.  The climate issue is an important focal point of

international debate, but it is not for the climate issue the

they are looking for resources, though perhaps a win-win process

could develop where the resolution of development issues can also

impact environmental issues.  International environmental issues

will be closely linked to a nation's economic energy and social

goals.

<p>

     I'm just going to touch on the science, because we have

several experts here. But we should be aware of what transpired

in Madrid.  The IPCC summary stated the balance of evidence

suggests there is a discernible human influence on climate

change.  But understand that this report came out of a report of

six pages, which came from a report of 40 Pages, which came from

a report of 1500 pages.  They also qualified that language in

preceding language, which said that our ability to quantify human

influence on global climate is currently limited because the

expected signal is still emerging, and because there are

uncertainties in key factors.

<p>

     One must watch this process carefully especially if major

economic decisions will be made as a result of discussions taking

place within the IPCC and other science bodies.  The key fact

remains we are not confronting catastrophic climate change today. 

According to recent studies by OTA and others, we have time to

take sensible approaches.  Earlier studies on the economics of

this issue say the same thing.

<p>

     This is a global issue.  For the U.S., the impacts of

additional commitments by Annex One parties, developed countries

plus Central Europe, and post 2000 actions must be analyzed and

assessed for their impacts on economic growth, jobs,

international trade and competitiveness.  I don't think any

sensible nation should make any decision without understanding

fully the economic impacts of this issue.

<p>

     Secondly, we think the U.S. should continue to reject

targets and timetables as a strategy to implement the Framework

Convention on Climate Change.  Rigid targets and timetables, we

believe, will lead to limits on U.S. economic growth, and

subsequently - and this is very important, because we are a

worldly economic driver - world economic growth, which will in

turn reduce global standards of living, and limit the

opportunities for transfer of technology to developing countries,

which are the largest potential sources of greenhouse gas

emissions.

<p>

     We are in a serious negotiation, and it will be over in

about 15 months.  Being in a serious negotiation, and talking

about post-2000 measures, we have to take this issue very

seriously.  We also have to take into consideration national

circumstances, especially in the United States.

<p>

     For example, relative to developing countries, the U.S. has

higher population growth rates, lower population density, a more

intensive transportation infrastructure and a larger existing

housing stock.  So in discussing the climate negotiations, we are

talking about direct economic impacts, and we are talking about

lifestyle issues.

<p>

     Joint implementation actions with developing countries

beyond the existing U.S. pilot program should be a priority.  And

technology cooperation activities should be strengthened and

expanded.

<p>

     As I noted earlier, we have stressed to our government the

need for comprehensive analysis and assessment before we make

decisions on Climate Change policies.  We believe that sensible

Climate Change policy making must involve careful consideration

of the cost of mitigation and adaptation options, together with

what those options may buy, in terms of reducing potential

Climate Change.

<p>

     As we look at the ad hoc Berlin mandate process, we have

already been through two of six negotiations.  The GCC believes

the U.S. should undertake a serious and comprehensive economic

analysis of proposed Climate Change policies, and report the

results to Congress and the public before it adopts any position

on the global climate international process that differs from the

U.S. commitment in the Rio treaty.

<p>

     Further, we feel that such an analysis must include the

impact on the U.S. of any proposed policies which exclude

developing countries whose lack of climate obligations should be

an important part of U.S. economic decision making.

<p>

     There are over a hundred developing nations who were party

to the treaty who do not have any obligations under the Berlin

mandate in the post-2000 period.  There is some movement towards

some of them reporting analyses of emissions, but they have no

specific obligations.  So the negotiations taking place are only

for OECD and developed countries, not for other countries.  Yet,

the non-OECD countries' emissions are going to grow tremendously. 

The U.S. also illustrated this in a presentation on the floor of

the last AGBM meeting last month.

<p>

     As part of the Berlin mandate process to negotiate

additional emission reductions for Annex One parties only, a

draft protocol submitted by the Alliance of Small Island States

calls for a 20 percent reduction of green house gas emissions

below 1990 levels by 2005, and will be included  for

consideration in the process.  We think this needs to be

thoroughly studied.  Does the U.S. know what the impact on U.S.

manufacturing, competitiveness and jobs would be if we reduce

emissions by 20 percent below 1990 levels by the year 2005?  A

recent DRI study shows that a $100 per ton tax reduces GDP by

2.3%, decreases business investment by 4.6%, and reduces consumer

spending by two percent.  Several other studies have shown the

same kinds of dramatic effects.

<p>

     Jae Edmonds presented a paper which pointed out that the

most important approach to emission reduction would focus on

technology and development starting in the next 25 years or so.

He also indicated in his paper that the stabilization of C02

concentration requires a long term global effort.  I emphasize

global.  The OECD cannot go it alone.

<p>

     We have asked the U.S. to look at a number of factors in

relationship to trade, impact on developing countries, trade

flows, business investment, and Gross Domestic Product, not only

in the context of the AOSIS protocol, but also in the context of

several other measures that are being recommended in this

process.

<p>

     We have supported voluntary programs.  We will continue to

do so.  We think they are important.  However, one has to

understand that progress will not be linear.  Many of the     

investments and voluntary efforts that are made today won't have

benefits for four or five or ten years.  But these programs are

there, and industries continue to work very hard on volunteer

efforts in the United States.  The GCC, I might add, was also a

leader in promoting the President's voluntary approach, and our

members have gone to other businesses and industries in other

countries to promote that process as well.

<p>

     We support joint implementation, but one has to understand

that we are going to have to deal with countries who have many

barriers to extensive technology.  We're going to have to work

very hard as a country and as industries to work with those

barriers, to develop infrastructure, to develop capacity

building, and to get to know those countries better.  We need to

work with multinational banks, who have some knowledge of how

those countries work.

<p>

     I think one has to understand that a healthy U.S. economy is

going to drive this issue, if you are really interested in

preventing climate change, both in terms of investment in the

United States, as well as investment elsewhere.  We have lagged

behind Japan and Germany in relationship to investment in new

plant and equipment in the last 15 years.  They have had more

capital to work with.  But the fact remains that we are going to

have to invest both in research and in refining the technologies

we have.

<p>

     Also, as we look at new approaches we have to understand

that countries differ in styles of government, legalistic

systems, and energy and economic structures.  Let's be sure we

understand all competitive and economic impacts - the differences

in countries, how they operate, why fossil fuel is important, the

competitive advantages and disadvantages.


<P>

     In closing, I would like to say that we are going to

continue to be involved in this issue, we're going to continue to

propose rational policies that make sense for the United states,

not U.S. industry, but U.S. jobs, U.S. economic growth and

economic as well as lifestyle well-being.  We think this approach

will drive successful climate policy and develop a worldwide

approach.

                   <b>      Abby Young   <br>

              Cities for Climate Protection-U.S.

  International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives </b></center>

<p>





     I don't think that my personal background is nearly as

exciting as what I am going to talk about, so I won't get

into detail about that.

<p>

     I am going to discuss very briefly the background of my

organization.  I will then talk about the relationship

between local governments and climate change, and the role

of local governments in the international forum on this

issue.  I will try to do this very quickly.

<p>

     I have a couple of slides, which I think we can start

now.  The International Council for Local Environmental

Initiatives, which I will for the rest of the speech

affectionately refer to as ICLEI, is an international

association of local governments.  The most important thing

is on the bottom of this slide:  the purpose of ICLEI is to

advocate for local governments before national and

international governments, agencies and organizations.  We

try to provide a collective voice for municipalities on

local environmental issues.

<p>

     ICLEI was founded in 1990 at the United Nations.  A

major environmental initiative that ICLEI sponsors is the

Cities for Climate Protection campaign.  This campaign was

launched in 1993 in New York at a local government leaders

summit on climate change.  The cities in the campaign set

their own emissions reduction targets, and then developed

local action plans to meet those targets.  The purpose of

the campaign is to assist cities in that process.  I am the

U.S. coordinator for that campaign.

<p>

     Now, to talk about global warming and how it relates to

cities, you have to talk about the impact of global warming

on cities,  and also the impact of cities on global warming. 

First of all, this slide clearly shows the impact of global

warming on cities.  The negative effects of climate change

will be hardest felt by cities. 

<p>

     As we have all heard and as we all know, scientists

have indicated that the first effects of climate change

which we are now feeling are extreme weather patterns.  And

cities, because they are the population centers of the

country, will feel these impacts economically and socially

as well as ecologically.  Many cities have already felt

these impacts firsthand.

<p>

     Climate models predict up to 12 percent increases in

precipitation, resulting in increased flooding.  Two years

ago, the Midwest floods ended up causing about $12 billion

worth of damages and property losses.  Now, while FEMA, the

Federal Emergency Assistance Program, provided some

immediate financial relief, much of the damage is long term. 

The region is still suffering from the loss of many

structures and businesses.  There is no way that state and

federal assistance can totally cover the levels of loss that

are going to be experienced by cities, and city governments

know this.

<p>

     Coastal areas will be particularly hard hit by an

increase in tropical storms and a rise in sea level.  One of

our member cities did an interesting thing.  They projected

on a map of their coastal areas what it would look like 50

years from now if global warming were to continue unchecked,

and huge amounts of coastal property, prime residential

areas as well as revenue rich commercial properties were

submerged.  Sea level rise will deal an economic blow to

cities.

<p>

     As you heard, one of the speakers yesterday touched on

a variety of new health problems that are going to threaten

cities.  Urban areas suffer from elevated temperatures due

to the darkness of paved streets and roofs. Already elevated

temperatures due to global warming will be felt higher in

city centers, and there will also be aggregations of

respiratory ailments.  These health problems will tax

already overburdened municipal health care systems.

<p>

     The impact of global warming on cities is clearly going

to be significant.

<p>

     Now, the impact of cities on global warming.  Local

governments have a special role and an undeniable

responsibility to take initiatives to protect the climate. 

By the year 2000, it is estimated that one-half of the

world's population will live in urban centers.  Cities,

because they are population centers, are major emitters of

greenhouse gasses.  Together, the emissions from the ten

largest U.S. cities account for about 10 percent of the

U.S.' total greenhouse gas emissions.  This slide is not a

list of the ten largest cities; these are cities that are in

our program.  But it gives you an idea of what their

emission levels are.

<p>

     Local governments influence and control many of the

activities that produce these emissions.  Because they

exercise key powers over land use, transportation, building

construction, waste management and in many cases, energy

supply and management, local governments have the ability to

greatly influence the energy intensity of their communities. 

For example, they set the building codes which determine the

energy efficiency of structures and facilities.  They also

issue building and development permits, which determine land

use patterns, which then influence whether their community

among other things has a high or a low auto dependency. 

They may also operate the public transit system, which can

influence the amount of time people spend in their cars. 

Because local governments are the public bodies closest to

individual consumers, they exercise the greatest direct

influence over energy consumption patterns.

<p>

     I wanted to show you what a couple of our cities are

doing to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in their communities.  We

don't just work with cities; we also work with counties. 

Dade County is focusing on, among other things, building

retrofits to increase energy efficiency and reduce

electricity use as a way to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.  In

contrast, the city of Portland's electricity is principally

generated through hydropower.  So rather than looking at

reducing electricity use through building retrofits, they

are focusing on transportation management as a way to reduce

their CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.

<p>

     Preventing climate change is by and large not the chief

reason that we have been able to involve U.S. cities in our

climate protection campaign.  Instead, they are drawn to the

issue because of local economic and environmental needs. 

When we talk about policy in the face of uncertainty, the

one thing that is very certain to local governments is that

cities benefit from energy efficiency.

<p>

     At a time when local governments especially now, are

facing tighter budgets, the appeal of saving money through

lower energy bills is often the starting point for municipal

energy management initiatives.  Additionally, investments in

energy efficiency and new energy systems are among the most

effective ways to create new employment and strengthen local

economies.  

<p>

     The issue of timing came up earlier today and generated

a lot of discussion.  I think it is important to note that

many cities are instituting low-cost and no-cost energy

efficiency measures right now.  So there are a lot of things

that can be instituted to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> immediately.

<p>

     For example, Newark, New Jersey recently did an energy

efficiency street light retrofit project.  It is saving the

city $1.3 million annually in avoided energy costs.  These

are the kinds of projects that cities are 

looking for, and why they buy into this kind of a program.

<p>

     I just like this slide.  The city of Seattle, to reduce

their vehicle fleet, is putting some of its law enforcement

officers on bicycles.  It is a great idea.

<p>

     When energy management reduces energy bills, the

savings are re-spent, usually within the community. 

Investments in energy efficiency boost the local economy by

creating economic opportunities for local vendors,

manufacturers and installers of energy efficiency

technology.  In many cases, by contrast, money spent on

energy bills goes to outside corporations and utilities, and

is not reinvested in the community.

<p>

     The city of Wooster, Ohio did a very interesting study,

and found that 90 percent of the money it was spending on

energy was leaving the city.  The study equated that to

losing a local payroll of 3,000 jobs.  Again, when things

can be put into these terms, you can see very clearly how

this affects cities.

<P>

     In addition to economic benefits, actions taken to

protect the climate change and reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions also

improve local air quality.

<p>

     Now I'm going to talk a bit about local government

representation at the global forum. "Although it was

national governments that signed the climate change

convention at the Rio Earth Summit, they did not set targets

to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.  Now, it is the cities of the world

that are setting specific targets.  The real global

leadership for the reducing of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and energy

conservation is coming from municipal leaders."

<p>

     Do you recognize that quote?  That was Dr. Noel Brown. 

He was then the director of the North American region at the

UN Environment Program.  I think it is important to note

that, we heard mention of the AOSIS goal earlier today by a

couple of the speakers.  AOSIS is the Association of Small

Island States.  The reduction goal that they are urging is a

20 percent reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions below 1990 levels by

the year 2005.

<P>

     I want to mention that the very first entity to commit

itself to a greenhouse gas reduction goal was a city - the

city of Toronto, Canada.  Its original target was a 20

percent reduction below 1988 levels by the year 2005.  That

was originally called the Toronto target.

<p>

     One of ICLEI's purposes is to represent local

governments at gatherings like this to communicate the need

for and importance of municipal action on this issue. 

Because local governments have such a strong influence on

their communities' day-to-day energy use, there is a

critical need for national and international agencies and

governments to acknowledge the necessary role and

contribution of local governments in curbing global warming.

<p>

     Local governments recognize the stake they have and

important role they play in this arena.  They came together

at the ICLEI-sponsored Municipal Leaders Summit on Climate

Change that was held in New York in 1993.  The municipal

leaders at this summit initiated the Cities for Climate

Protection Campaign.  The Campaign is designed to be a

catalyst for bringing local governments to the international

forum on climate change.  

<p>

     At the beginning of this year, 90 cities representing

50 million people and 550 megatons of CO<sub>2</sub> were members of

the Cities for Climate Protection Campaign.  Today, there

are over 130 cities worldwide in the campaign, representing

a full five percent of global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.  Many of these

cities have already adopted the Toronto Target as their

emission reduction goal.

<p>

     ICLEI held a second summit in conjunction with the

first Conference of the Parties meeting in Berlin last

spring.  The 350 participating local government leaders

drafted a communique to the COP, urging developed nations to 

adopt the Toronto Target.  Additionally, it calls for formal

recognition of the municipal sector by the COP.  This

communique was also placed in the U.S. Congressional Record.

<p>

     A third Municipal Leaders Summit on Climate Change was

just held this past October in Saitama, Japan.  At that

summit, over 200 cities representing 55 nations worldwide

reiterated this call for local action to protect the global

climate.

<p>

     ICLEI, which sponsors many different local

environmental initiatives has focused much of its work on

climate change for three big reasons.  First of all, this

focus on climate change is very much constituent-driven. 

Cities have wanted to play a stronger role, and local

authorities are the level of government which has taken the

lead on this issue, by committing to reduction goals before

their national governments have.  Originally, this lead was

taken through the action of Toronto, and now cities are

continuing to lead by participating in the Cities for

Climate Protection Campaign.

<p>

     The second big reason we focused on climate protection

is that cities have for a long time appreciated the benefits

that they reap from reducing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.  Thirdly, ICLEI

as an organization recognizes the role of local communities

in solving this particular global problem.

<p>

     In closing, I would like to say that we can't solve the

problem of global climate change unless we utilize the full

participation and action of cities.

<p>

     Thank you.

                       <b>Patrick Michaels  <br>

                Environmental Sciences Department

                     University of Virginia   </b></center>


<p>


     Thank you for asking me to present this paper.  I think it

is an important juncture, especially given the recent Nobel

Prize.  Buchanan won the Nobel Prize for the concept called

public choice, which predicts among other things that

organizations that are largely in the public venue will have some

sort of resistance to types of change that might change their

role.  It is very hard, when one tries to produce a scientific

consensus with an organization like the United Nations for this

concept not to intrude.

<P>

     I would like to spend a few minutes showing you how

difficult consensus is to form, and how consensus changes.  In

1990, the United Nations produced its first scientific assessment

of climate change.  I was asked by my friend, Tom Karl, to review

it.  I was asked anonymously to review it, because at that point

the issue had already been so politicized that some people who

were thought to give critical reviews were not invited to the

process.

<p>

     In 1990, I wrote that the models that were being used

 were probably producing too much warming, and it was likely that

there was something that was mitigating the warming.  The review

hypothesized, because of the increases that were being observed

in cloudiness, that it would possibly be some type of aerosol or

something like that.  The review was profoundly ignored, which is

not surprising.

<p>

     In fact, the UN wrote in 1990 in the summary document, when

the latest models are run with impressive concentrations of

greenhouse gasses,that their simulation of the present climate is

generally realistic on large scale.  

<p>

     Anyway, the problem was well known, because the temperature

increase was not nearly what was projected, even by the models of

that time.  It was reasonable to assume that sulfate aerosols or

something like that might be the problem, because the Southern

Hemisphere temperature increase was greater than the Northern

Hemisphere's increase.  It is a very interesting history, by the

way, in that the Northern Hemisphere should warm up first and

fastest.  But much of the warming of the Northern Hemisphere took

place prior to World War II, which was really when the greenhouse

effect took off.

<p>



     At any rate, by the time we got to 1992, we could change the

climate models a little bit, so that in the report that was

prepared specifically for the Rio climate treaty, we now had

climate models that changed the carbon dioxide concentration

gradually, as opposed to changing it at once.

<p>

     These models then formed testable hypotheses, because you

could run the models backwards and see what climate was being

projected to occur as the carbon dioxide concentration increased.

<p>

     The most commonly cited of these models in the 1992 report,

and remember, the 1992 report was specifically designed to back

up the Rio treaty, was the model that came out of Princeton

University, known as the GFDL model.  To give you an idea of some

of the resistance on this, the GFDL model run backwards on it's

own internal carbon dioxide concentration for the Northern

Hemispheres shows a very large and growing disparity that began

to develop about three decades ago.  This is what is fueling some

of the debate on this issue.

<p>

     I should point out parenthetically, in 1992 I requested the

output from this model from GFDL and was told, no, I couldn't

have it.  I thought that was very strange, so I asked my graduate

student, who nobody knew was my graduate student, to request it,

and they gave it to him, and then we ran this model.

<p>

     Well, anyway, you can see the problem.  It gets worse when

one looks at the satellite data.  The satellite data is thought

to be highly accurate.  The Southern Hemisphere satellite

temperature history from when the satellite goes up in 1979 to

now shows a significant difference which has always been there.

<p>

     In the Northern Hemisphere, it gets much worse. There is

cooling from Mount Pinatubo on the satellite data.  There is no

trend in the satellite data itself.

<p>

     Well, at any rate, what strikes me as rather interesting in

all this is, if we go back to 1992 and we read what the UN said

on that report, it said the observed warming is broadly

consistent with model projections.  Does anybody believe that?  

Then it was stated that the satellite data really don't reflect

the ground-based temperature because of stratospheric ozone

depletion, which would affect the top level of satellite data.

<p>

     When we compare the satellite temperature and the ground-

based temperature you can see something quite interesting.The

only place where they agree is where the temperature record is

the best, in other words, in the north temperate zone, where we

have the good temperature records from the United States, the

former Soviet Union, and Europe.  That is where the two records

are very much in agreement.  So we have pretty good reason to

trust the satellite data.

<p>

     The satellite data also matches up very well with

temperatures from 5,000 to 30,000 feet, as measured by weather

balloons.  Therefore, if the satellite does not see warming, it

is probably not there.

<p>

     In fact, what happened by the time we got out to 1995, the

consensus process changes much slower than some of the more

outspoken scientists on this issue.  In 1995, the UN report says

now, when increases in greenhouse gasses only are taken into

account, most models produce a greater warming than has been

observed.

<p>

     That is an admission that the people who were marginalized

to the process in 1992 and 1990, who said it is producing too

much warming, that was supposed to be the squalling of a small

group of skeptics, well, it turns out that that now is the

consensus.

<p>

     Having said that, let's take a look at the satellite

temperature history.  It is rather instructive, it is certainly

is not a global pattern.  What it is, is a warming of the mid-

latitudes, primarily in the Northern Hemisphere.

<p>

     Now, if one is going to hypothesize that sulfate aerosol,

which we have heard so much about, is the reason for the lack of

warming, I caution you that the sulfate regions of the planet are

the regions that are warming, not cooling.

<p>

     In fact, if we take a look at the model that best tracks the

past climate, according to the new UN report, that model was

published by Mitchell et al. on August 10 in "Nature" magazine. 

I would like to spend a couple of minutes talking to you about

what that model really said, because I don't think a lot of

people know.

<p>

     It says, number one, if you run the greenhouse effect only,

you get a warming of 2.5 degrees for doubling CO<sub>2</sub>.  Then 
Mitchell

states in the paper that that model is too warm.  He says it does

not track the climate over the last quarter century, it is too

warm.

<p>

     The change is 33 percent, if you put the sulfates in the

model.  You do get a model that tracks the past climate, he says,

of the last 40 to 50 years.  The surface temperature record,

which is in some debate, shows a warming of about four-tenths of

a degree in the last 40 to 50 years, and the overall warming in

the model for doubling CO<sub>2</sub> plus sulfates is 1.7 degrees.  That

leaves you 1.7 minus .4 degrees, 1.3 degrees.  That is the

remaining warming for a doubling in the model that best tracks

the climate of the past.

<p>

     That is a dramatic change from previous forecasts.  When one

cites a number of two degrees, that is not the number that is

driven by the model that best tracks the past.

<p>

     There is a problem with this, though. In the model with the

greenhouse gasses only, temperature change by the middle of the

next century by Mitchell, et al., with the sulfates, SUL plus

greenhouse gasses only, in the high latitudes of the Northern

Hemisphere these two models are very similar.

<p>

     All scientists know that the greenhouse- only models have

produced way too much warming to date in the high latitudes of

the Northern Hemisphere.  The one that supports the Rio climate

treaty more than any of the others, the Princeton model, has a

warming of 2.5 degrees poleward of 60 degrees latitude between

1950 and now.  The net warming observed between 60 degrees north

and the pole is zero in the last 45 years.  There isn't any.  It

looks like this model makes the same error. 

<p>

     So when I was asked to review the United Nations report, the

new upcoming second assessment, I requested what we call the

transient output from this region , because it does look like it

is making that error.  I was denied five times, five separate

requests for that data.

<p>

     Now, if anybody thinks that this is an effective peer review

process, I challenge them to respond to a denial of data to a

reviewer.  The problem is that when we do that, we are behaving

institutionally much like Buchanan predicts.  There will be a

resistance on the part of the organization to change what may

affect the organization.  That I think is seminal to this issue,

because the review process is very important in any scientific

debate.

<p>

     I have about seven minutes left, six at best.  I am going to

finish up with a totally boring discussion of why it is not

sulfates, anyway.  Academic scientists are paid to explore,

wherever your mind takes you, you must go. 

<p>

     One of the things that we need to do is to ask the question,

is it really sulfates?  One does not say sulfates killed the

warming, or are responsible for it merely by making another

climate model that reduces the radiation input to the Northern

Hemisphere.  That is guaranteed to fit the data better.  It has

to, because it is too warm.  You saw how well the model worked

when we didn't have sulfates in it, not very well at all.  If you

reduce the radiation coming downward in the Northern Hemisphere,

it will fit better, but that won't say the sulfates caused the

problem.  No, you have to do what a doctor would do.  You have to

use a diagnostic approach and ask, does the model that fails fail

because of sulfates? That is a totally reasonable thing to do.  

<p>

     This is a mathematical formulation that explicitly tests

that.  I don't want to bore you with it.  It was in the "Journal

of Technology" about a year ago.  What you can do is, you can

test the observed patterns of climate change versus what was

modelled.


<p>


     I want to tell you the good news about the most important

pattern of climate change in the summer.  I wish people who

disagree would have read this paper, because it says that the

climate models have correctly captured in the Northern Hemisphere

the most important pattern of temperature change in the summer. 

They have done it.  This is quite an important achievement. 

Unfortunately, it is the model without sulfates.  As it changed

the slopes are correct.  This behavior however is not typical. 

This is the behavior of a winter pattern over time in a climate

model.  This is reality.  There are different signs.  This

happens all the time.

<p>

     We can compare patterns and see how well we have done.  The

patterns do the following.  The climate might not change and the

model might not change.  That is good.  That means that the

climate was not predicted to change by the model, and it didn't

change.  There can be the type one or the type two errors, where

the observed climate change didn't occur or the modelled climate

change didn't occur.  There is pattern number four, where the

observed model changes are correct, and pattern number five, the

horrible mistake, where opposite to what you predicted happens.

<P>

     I am going to take you on a tour through an increasingly

sulfate-laden atmosphere.  Southern Hemisphere winter has no

sulfates in it whatsoever, for all intents and purposes.  The

first category is where neither the model nor the climate

changes.  That is what is called being half right.  If you were

in Atlantic City, you would get your money back on that bet.

<p>

     With the type one and type two errors, everywhere that the

model says the climate will change, it didn't, and everywhere

that the climate changed, the model said it didn't.  So there is

no correct forecast of any of the observed climate changes

between pattern number four and a sulfate-free atmosphere.

<p>

     Go to the North Polar region in the summer.  This is

remarkable, how much the climate has changed in this region. 

Only ten percent of the observed climate or the predicted climate

has not changed since 1933 in a statistically significant

fashion.  Climate moves around a lot.  But all the change that

was predicted didn't occur, and none of the change that occurred

was predicted.  That was all type one and type two error.  No

sulfates up there.

<p>

     Northern Hemisphere has the sulfates. The sulfate effect is

supposed to be greatest in the summer.  Here we see the best

performance on a hemispheric basis in the model, in the

hemisphere where the sulfates are when the sulfate effect is

supposed to be greatest.  

<p>

     When we look explicitly in the sulfate regions in the

summer, the model performs extremely well.  This is the type of

climate change that is correctly modeled, and this is the type of

non-climate change that is correctly modeled.  There is very

little error in the sulfate region.  Only one problem:  this is

the model that was predicting the dramatic warming that didn't

occur.  This is the model that bases the 1992 convention, in

large part.  This is the model without the sulfates.

<p>

     So now you see the problem, don't you?  Sulfates are not the

disease.  But you can get it to act like they are the problem

with the forecast.  It is much like if you went to a doctor with

an infection, and the doctor gave you steroids, which will reduce

the inflammation.  The climate model had an inflammation.  It was

too warm.  So we put something in it that drives down the

inflammation.  Then we find out later that we did not affect the

cause of the inflammation.

<p>

     It is not sulfates.  I think it is the fact that the upper

atmosphere cooled above 30,000 feet when the models predicted

that would start at 50,000 feet.  That is why the clouds

increased.  That is why the warming is muted.  That is why it is

primarily in the night, and that is why it is primarily in the

winter.  The 1.3 degree upward that you get from the Mitchell

model happens to be the exact same number that you get if you

assume that the warming of the 20th century had something to do

with the greenhouse effect after all.  If you went out to

doubling CO<sub>2</sub> at equilibrium, you would get a warming of 1.35

degrees.

<p>

     Three more things.  There are three separate sets of data

that say the same thing.  You can get this from the surface

temperature record, from the satellite temperature record, from

the weather balloon record, and you can get it from a critical

analysis of the surface temperature.  They all give you the same

number.  Nature is trying to tell us something here.  Nature is

running the model for you, and nature says that it is not

sulfates, it is the greenhouse effect itself, not as large as was

once feared, which is a nice thing to know.

Adaptation of Costa Rica's and Panama's Hydropower Generation

to Climate Change* </h1>

(*reprinted with permission)

<br>

     Preliminary results from the vulnerability and adaptation

study to climate change in Central America are present in this

paper.  A methodology was conceptualized in order to tailor in-

country needs and lack of data.  Additionally, the developed

methodology takes into account El Ni&#241;o-Southern Oscillation

(ENSO) as a climatic scenario for Panama and Costa Rica.

<p>

     The main objective of this research is to describe possible

adaptation measurements to potential impacts of climate change,

using Costa Rica and Panama's water resources as a case study. 

Results obtained for countries such as Costa Rica and Panama,

where 98% and 73% of all electricity comes from hydropower, are

critical for a sustainable management of water resources under

climate change conditions.

<P>

     Adaptation measurements are directed to sectors dealing with

availability, use, distribution and operation of water resources

for hydropower generation in tropical countries, as they serve

for discussion of a regional strategy of water resources

adaptation to climate change.  Measures such as building of new

reservoirs, adaptation of old ones, and programs on energy

efficiency addressed to the residential sector are proposed as

alternatives to confront potential impacts due to climate change.

<p>

     In addition, variables such as implementation of costs and

environmental impacts are also addressed and discussed.

<p>

     Latest scientific estimations indicate that changes in the

global temperature may have an effect on the intensity and

frequency of tropical cyclones affecting Central America (Brenes

& Saborio, 1994).  Additionally, changes in the intertropical

convergence zone, and the speed and seasonality of the trade

winds area are also expected.  According to the scientific

assessment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change

(IPCC), it is also expected that climate change may affect

important economic activities such as:  forestry, biodiversity,

water resources, agriculture, human health, and coastal and

marine ecosystems (Houghton, et al., 1990).

<p>



     Because of Central America's water resources richness, most

countries have high dependency on hydropower generation.  Changes

in circulation patterns that might affect seasonality and the

amount of rainfall would represent a major impact on energy

generation.  Recent experiences with El Ni&#241;o-Southern Oscillation

(ENSO), provide important evidence of these important changes. 

ENSO manifestation in Costa Rica and Panama is mainly related

with a decrease in the amount of precipitation, especially along

the Pacific coast.  In Costa Rica ENSO affects directly important

hydropower sites such as the Arenal and Ventanas-Garita dams

where a significant reduction on runoff is observed (Costa Rica,

1989).

<p>

     In this paper we study the importance of water resources for

electricity generation in both countries, as well as the benefits

for income that this sector generates for Costa Rica's and

Panama's gross domestic product.  Trends in energy production are

studied, and the growing dependence of their economic activities

on hydroelectricity is evaluated.

<p>

     It is hypothesized that vulnerability and future responses

of the energy generation sector to climate change are correlated

with their response to ENSO; there might be differences between

climate scenarios from Global Circulation Models (GCMs) and ENSO

scenarios.

<p>

     This paper is based on preliminary results from the Central

America Project on Climate Change (CAPCC), whose main objective

is to estimate the vulnerability of water, agricultural and

coastal resources to potential climate change.  Climate scenarios

developed for CAPCC are at this stage under review, but they will

constitute a source of improvement for this study.  Seven

countries are involved in the project.  Each country has

organized their own national team and developed their own

studies.  The activities are executed under the guidance,

coordination and cooperation of the Central America Technical

Team on Climate Change formed by a group of experts on each field

with the assistance of the United States Country Study Management

Team (USCSMT).

<p>

     Climatic change scenarios developed by the CAPCC are based

on considerations from Global Circulation Models (GCMs), and

represent regional scale climatic conditions.  This presents a

problem of scale for regional watershed planning (Sanchez, 1993). 

Therefore, for the purpose and objectives of this study, in which

the basins have been used as the main studying scale, a climatic

approach, related to climate variability (ENSO) is considered.

<p>

     Utilization of climate variability as a climate change

scenario, is considered because of the observed relationship

between changes in patterns of electric generation (thermic and

hydraulic).

<p>

     ENSO phenomenon is an important source of interannual

variability in weather and climate around the world.  The

Southern Oscillation (SO) is a global pattern principally

consisting of a seesaw in atmospheric mass involving exchanges in

air between eastern and western hemispheres centered in tropical

and subtropical latitudes.  El Ni&#241;o is an anomalous warming of

the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean but, in major "warm events,"

it extends over much of the tropical Pacific and, it is in these

cases, where it is clearly linked to changes in the atmosphere,

manifested as the SO.  ENSO results from an interaction between

changes in the tropical Pacific Ocean and the global atmosphere. 

Surface atmospheric winds drive tropical ocean currents and

change the sea surface temperatures, which in turn, alter the

location and strength of atmospheric convection and precipitation

in the tropics, and so change the atmospheric heating patterns,

atmospheric waves and the winds in the tropics (Trenberth, 1989).


<p>


<b>Costa Rica's and Panama's Case Study </b>

<p>

     Vulnerability studies for the water resources in Costa Rica

and Panama indicate that there is a high dependence between

vulnerability of water resources and economic and population

growth.

<p>

     Costa Rica has a high capacity for hydropower generation. 

Total power generation for the 34 main drainage basins is being

estimated on 223,000 GWh/yr and total theoretical energy power is

estimated to be 25,450 MW (Costa Rica, 1990a).  There are also

several small drainage basins each with a generation capacity

around 20 MW for a combined production of 1000 MW.

<p>

     Energy demand in Costa Rica is strongly correlated with

population growth (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.87), gross domestic product 
(r<sup>2</sup> = 0.85), number of people with electricity 

(r<sup>2</sup> = 0.90) and the

urban growth (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.93).  The rate of growth of energy

consumption has oscillated since 1966 with a strong relationship

to population growth, but also reflects impacts of climatic

variability and different economic crisis experienced in the

country <a href="figures/sanchezfig1.gif">(Figure 1)</a>.

<p>

     <a href="figures/sanchezfig2.gif">Figure 2</a> presents Costa Rica's 
evolution of installed

capacity for the 1965-89 period.  It can be observed that most of

the demand is supplied by construction of new hydropower

complexes.  During 1982-87 Costa Rica's installed capacity

covered 80% of the demand and for 1989 it covered 84%.  Current

installed capacity covers 98% of all energy demand.

<p>

     Despite Costa Rica's high availability for hydropower

generation; population growth, high rates in energy consumption

and ENSO have produced a greater gap between offer and demand. 

As a result, Costa Rica imported 77.8 GWh electricity for the

first time on 1986.  Energy imports have grown steadily since

then, 159.5 GWh in 1987, 190.6 GWh in 1988 and 152.0 GWh in 1989

(Costa Rica, 1990b; Costa Rica, 1992).

<p>

     Current Costa Rica's policies to confront energy demand

consider building of new hydropower complexes, geothermic

generation, and lately, wind generation as the main resources. 

Less than 2% of all the global demand is covered by thermic

generation, but it is expected to grow as a result of current

cuts from the government expansion plans of critical hydropower

complexes.

<p>

     For Panama, by the middle of 1960 and early 1970, most of

the electricity was generated by burning fossil fuels.  Despite

the fact that during the late 1930s hydroelectricity was already

generated at the "Macho Monte Station," it was until the middle

of the 1970s when the "Bayano" started its operation that

hydroelectricity balanced the thermic generation <a 
href="figures/sanchezfig3.gif">(Figure 3)</a>. 

Thermic generation has been almost constant since the 1970s,

however, hydroelectricity production received a large impulse in

1984 when "La Fortuna" station was built.

<p>

     The energy demand in Panama, as in Costa Rica, is strongly

related with the growth in the gross domestic product and

population growth.  The direct contribution of the electricity

sector to Panama's economic growth, even though it is small when

compared with other sectors (3.4% for 1994), represents a large

benefit when it is associated with sectors such as industry (9.3%

for 1994) and commerce (11.6% for 1994).

<p>

     Panama's thermic and hydroelectric generation is driven

mainly by demand, but also is affected by changes in climate. 

This, as mentioned before, can be exemplified by the relationship

between ENSO and the changes in generation patterns.


<p>


<b> Analysis of Results </b>

<p>

     From <a href="figures/sanchezfig4.gif">Figure 4</a>, you can see Costa 
Rica's heavy dependence on

hydropower generation.  Long term vision of previous governments

as well as highly efficient management of demand since 1966 has

produced a set of hydropower complexes at critical points of

demand.  These policies have produced high storage capability

that tends to buffer effects related to climatic variability.  It

can be observed that only during the 1977-78 El Ni&#241;o, was there

an increase on thermic generation; extraordinary for the whole

time series <a href="figures/sanchezfig4.gif">(Figure 4)</a>.  As a result of 
construction of new

hydropower plants, the 1982-83 and 1986-87 El Ni&#241;o anomalies were

not even detected in terms of hydropower generation.  In Panama,

it can be observed from <a href="figures/sanchezfig5.gif">Figure 5</a>, that 
during the years that

follow El Ni&#241;o occurrence, there was a clear decrease in

hydropower generation, having to generate more thermic energy in

order to satisfy the demand (Panama, 1994).  This phenomenon

increased the dependence on fossil fuels and increased greenhouse

gas emissions.

<p>

     It can be inferred that, if a phenomenon such as El Ni&#241;o has

a strong impact on hydroelectricity, a decrease of 15-20% in the

total amount of precipitation for the region, and changes in

distribution as a result of climate change may cause a severe

impact not only on the electricity sector but also on the

associated activities that depend on this service.

<p>

     

<b> Adaptation Measures  </b>

<p>

     Adaptation policies of Costa Rica's and Panama's water

resources depend on measurements related to long range planning,

demand management, and supply development and management. 

Implementation of these measurements is complicated by the

difficulty to distinguish between natural variability and long-

term climate change.

<p>

     Long-term planning should look at energy system robustness

and the expansion capability of current hydropower plants.  This

means that current planning goals should consider a "wide soft

component" that can be reviewed over time to evaluate the

system's response to climate change as our knowledge increases

over time.  Long term plans should also be related to economic

sustainability, ecosystem integrity, social desirability,

implementability and equitability (Klem&#224;s, 1993).

<p>

     Aspects such as demand management and supply development and

management are even more difficult to implement.  The general

paradigm related to price control, legislation, current

consumption practices and allocation of resources from

governments, more concerned with satisfying current demand and

short term problems, complicates long term climate change

visions.  Despite the existing knowledge of the potential

problems from climate change, it is difficult to implement

measurements in developing countries which are more concerned

with what is going to happen in the next 5 years than in the year

2075.  As a result, it is almost impossible to implement climate

change adaptation measurements for long term scenarios.  We

hypothesized that reactions given in the past and related to

climatic variability, can be a good example or analogy of a

potential response to climatic change in the long term.

<p>

     As has been shown before, Costa Rica and Panama are

countries with high dependency on hydropower energy, a 98%

dependency for Costa Rica and 73% for Panama.  In both cases a

sound and broad set of measures is required to confront possible

climate change.  These measures are based on current Costa Rican

and Panamanian institutional policies regarding energy planning.

<p>

     The goal is to provide an adaptive response and discussion

framework for policy makers on areas related to availability,

use, distribution, and operation of water resources for

hydropower generation.  The proposed strategy is developed around

the question addressed by Stakhiv (1993):  should we adapt

incrementally to the explicit signals of climate change, or

should society develop an anticipatory strategy to ameliorate the

expected adverse impacts?

<p>

     A strategy regarding adaptive measurements should consider

the environment, the human society, and their social and economic

development as a whole, as part of a national strategy for

sustainable development.

<p>

     As a first measure, Costa Rica is implementing a national

strategy to improve energy efficiency.  A nationwide strategy to

reduce energy consumption and to encourage use of more efficient

appliances is currently implemented by Costa Rica's Electricity

Institute (ICE).  This strategy focuses on a newspaper, radio and

television campaign which gives emphasis to current environmental

and climatic stress over key reservoir sites, and their impact on

hydropower generation.  In addition, incentives are also planned

for people who reduce their energy consumption.  This first step

is probably the most important taken by the government towards

energy savings.  The previous measures were addressed to adapt

incrementally to explicit signals of climate change, and deal

more at a conscience level.  Under the new policy people learn

the value of energy savings and take responsibility towards

society.

<p>

     In Panama's case study, measures are related to the

improvement of bill collection and price control.  At the same

time a huge effort is undertaken to decrease energy losses from

energy generation, transmission and distribution which reaches

72% GWh for 1994 or 21.4% of all energy generated by the country

(Panama, 1994).

<p>

     Anticipatory measurements are more complex to implement.  In

the first place, they have to deal with short and long term

energy plans, as well as consider the uncertainties related with

estimates of impacts produced by climate change.

<p>

     As a result of potential impacts of climate change in Costa

Rica and Panama water resources we can foresee an increase in

construction of new hydropower plants as a priority as well as an

increase in thermic generation.  Two consequences are expected:

direct impact on the economy and an increase on greenhouse gasses

from fossil fuel burning.

<p>

     Measures to confront potential climate change impacts in

Costa Rica and Panama, related to the increase on number of

hydropower plants and the improvement of old ones will produce

the greatest ancillary benefits.

<p>

     Hydropower energy is a "clean energy" and in some cases the

more expensive in short term.  Hydropower construction policies

are expected to have direct impacts on the environment,

especially on un-explored areas where hardly anything is known

regarding issues such as biodiversity.

<p>

     Even though this form of "clean energy" has the highest

priority for the countries, it will have direct impacts on the

national economy.  In general, these hydropower plants are

constructed using international loans from organizations such as

the Inter-American Development Bank, the International Monetary

Fund or the World Bank.  If the construction of such projects are

not carefully planned, impacts on the local economies and the

social system must be expected as a result of an increase of the

external debt.

<p>

     The second measure to consider:  increase in fossil fuel use

by thermic plants, presents the highest risk for the global

environment, not helping with the general agreement stated by the

United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.  In the

short and middle term, we expect an increase in the "petroleum

bill," which will be passed directly to the people as the

"thermic factor."

<p>

     Despite the uncertainties on the issue of climate change,

the first of the options (clean energy) is more realistic for

middle and long term planning.  It is also important to consider

that most of the current climate change scenarios are considering

impacts around the year 2050.  Under this timeframe, most of the

current projects will be out of operation, and even the ones

being considered for construction around the year 2010, will be

close to their life expectancy.  In this regard, it will be

necessary to plan new mitigation and adaptation measurements that

will consider a sustainable management of the drainage basins in

terms of land use as well as a constant evaluation of the soft

component element of future hydropower plants.  As part of this

evaluation, use of state-of-the-art tools such as remote sensing,

digital elevation models and geographic information systems will

give new insights in terms of natural resources management in the

tropics (Sanchez & Harriss, 1994).  At the same time it will be

necessary to increase people's awareness of climate change's

potential impacts through education.

<p>

     It is also important to address that Costa Rica's and

Panama's response to climate change must be considered not only

as a nationwide plan, but as a part of a regional initiative. 

For example, Costa Rica's annual electricity deficits are

supplied from Honduras.  As a result, construction of new

hydropower plants to confront the impact on runoff reduction must

consider current interdependencies between countries.

             The U.S. Administration's Perspectives

          on Science, Global Warming and the Convention    </h1>



           <b>              Mark G. Hambley <br>

                     U.S. Department Of State </b></center>


<p>


<b>Sustainable Development:  A Concept in Search of Definition </b>

<p>

     One hears many different definitions of sustainable

development -- so many, in fact, that one could conclude that the

only thing sustainable about the term "sustainable

development" is the number of interpretations being applied to it. 

The term means many things to many people depending on

circumstances or situations.

<p>

     This said, "sustainable development" is featured

prominently in the climate convention.  Indeed, in Article 2 of the

convention, the concept is mentioned when discussing the

convention's ultimate objective which is to achieve

"...stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the

atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous

anthropogenic interference with the climate system.  Such a level

should be achieved within a time-frame sufficient to allow

ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change, to

ensure that food production is not threatened, and to enable

economic development to proceed in a sustainable manner."

<p>

     Managing the challenge which is posed by global warming is one

key aspect of this responsibility.  In this context, I thought it

might be appropriate to focus on two aspects of the U.S.

government's perspectives on climate change:

<p>

First, I will briefly give you some of the background for

international action which led to the climate convention in the

first instance, and,

<p>

Second, I will then try to describe for you some U.S.

perceptions about the first Conference of the Parties of the

convention held in Berlin last spring and the later follow-up

meetings in Geneva, the most recent one which ended last month.

<p>



<b> (I) Background for International Action  </b>

<p>

     Concern about climate change resulting from the buildup of the

so-called "greenhouse gases" has existed for some time. Over the

past several years, the preponderance of scientific evidence has

continued to strongly suggest that our initial precaution in

reducing greenhouse gas emissions was both prudent and justified. 

New evidence is emerging that global climate change remains a

serious challenge to the international community and must be

addressed with urgency and priority.

<p>

     It was really the year 1988 that was the turning point in

terms of our adopting a course of action to deal with the

problem of climate change.  That was the year of the famous "hot

summer", and for whatever reason, the drought of 1988 etched an

eerie image in the minds of the American public about what global

warming might mean.  It was perhaps no coincidence, therefore, that

1988 was also the year that the UN Environment Program and the

World Meteorological Society organized the

Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change or the IPCC.

<p>

     As all of you know, the IPCC was established to assess the

science, impacts, and response options for dealing with climate

change.   It produced its first assessment report -- totalling

several hundred pages -- in August 1990.  Its second assessment

report -- an even longer compilation -- has just been completed and

is expected to be adopted at the IPCC plenary in Rome in December.

<p>

     The first IPCC report was reviewed at the Second World Climate

Conference in November 1990.  Its conclusions regarding the

importance of addressing the problem of climate change were such

that a declaration was issued from that conference calling for the

negotiation of a climate change convention.

<P>

     Following an intensive series of negotiations, the

Framework Convention on Climate Change was opened for signature at

the Earth Summit in Rio de Janiero in June 1992.  Over 150

countries -- including the United States -- signed the

agreement on this momentous occasion,  Shortly thereafter  the U.S.

became the fourth country to ratify the convention and the first

industrialized country to do so on October 15  1992.   The

convention entered into force on March 21, 1994 after being

ratified by 50 countries.  Some 138 countries have now done so, so

the convention is truly one of international significance.


<p>


<b>(II)  The Berlin "COP" and the Follow-on Geneva Talks </b>
<p>



     The UN General Assembly decided that negotiations should

continue following the adoption of the convention in order to

prepare for its entry into force and to prepare for the first

meeting of the Conference of the Parties, the so-called "COP." This

meeting was held in Berlin between 28 March and 7 April of this

year.

<p>

     At this massive and often tumultuous conference, the

United States had three specific key objectives:

<p>
<ol>
     <li> to negotiate a mandate to begin considering next steps   

  under the climate change convention;



     <li> to ensure that all Parties will be part of that

     process; and



     <li> to establish a pilot phase for joint implementation.
</ol>
<p>

     We were able, in our view, to achieve all three of these

objectives, and it is on this basis that we think the Berlin

Conference was a success.  We believe the agreement reached at

Berlin moves the world another step toward protecting the

global environment, through a process that allows careful

consideration of options and cost-effective strategies.

<p>

     The convention required that the Conference of the Parties

make several decisions at its first session.  Most importantly, the

COP had to review the adequacy of certain convention

provisions that apply to industrialized countries.  In

particular, the review related to the provision that

industrialized countries "aim" to return their emissions of

greenhouse gases their 1990 levels by the year 2000.

<p>

     In Berlin, the COP agreed that these provisions were not

adequate.  The United States fully shared that view, believing that

current convention commitments are only a first step -- but are

silent on how nations should proceed after the year 2000.

<p>

     The COP agreed to launch a process (informally referred to as

the "Berlin Mandate") to define actions in the post-2000 period and

to advance the commitments of all nations.  This process is taking

place through the work of an ad hoc body known as the "AGBM" (for

"ad hoc working group/Berlin Mandate")

which is supposed to finish its work as early as possible in 1997. 

As I will describe in a moment, this group just finished its second

meeting in Geneva last month and will hold its third session early

next year.

<p>

     The process includes in its early stages an analysis and

assessment to identify policies and measures to deal with

climate change and should lead to agreement on actions for the

period after the year 2000.  The goal is to make further

progress toward the convention's ultimate objective -- to

stabilize atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases at a level

that will prevent dangerous human interference with the climate

system.

<p>

     This process contemplates that industrialized country Parties

will adopt new commitments in the post-2000 period without

specifying what these may be.  By 1997 -- only two years from now -

- the AGBM is to have completed its work on a proposal which will

enable us to take appropriate action for the period beyond 2000,

including strengthening the commitments of developed countries and

reaffirming and continuing to advance the implementation of

commitments by all countries, developed and developing.

<p>

     While the Berlin agreement specifies that there will be no new

commitments for developing country Parties, it does require

elaboration of the existing commitments for developing

countries.  In this way, the final consensus reflects our

belief that this is a global problem requiring global

solutions.  We firmly believe that all countries must work together

to do more to guard against harmful climate changes.

<p>

     The time-frame established by the Berlin Mandate for

development and adoption of a protocol or other legal

instrument is short and must be used efficiently.  At the same

time, the way forward is not obvious.  Many questions will need to

be addressed, and finding answers will not be an easy task. It is

our view that through analysis and assessment, we will be able to

come up with a proposal which will be credible and sustainable both

economically and politically.


<p>


<b>Other Berlin Decisions </b>

<p>

     The COP made decisions in a host of other areas, as well. We

were pleased that the COP decided to launch a pilot program for

joint implementation (JI).  Under the pilot program,

greenhouse gas emissions that are saved will not count toward

meeting a country's commitments before the year 2000.  But

countries may be able to count such savings thereafter from

projects begun during the pilot phase.

<p>

     In addition, the Parties formally endorsed two subsidiary

bodies established by the Convention to assist the COP -- the

Subsidiary Body on Scientific and Technological Advice, and the

Subsidiary Body on Implementation.  These bodies, working in

concert with the newly established AGBM, will work to continue the

implementation of the convention, and to assure its

appropriate advancement into the next century as it addresses the

climate change problem.


<p>


<b>The First Geneva Meetings </b>

<p>

     It was in this context that the first meetings of the AGBM and

its two subsidiary bodies were held at Geneva between

August 25 and September I of this year.  The U.S. was generally

pleased with the results of these meetings, although there were

some disappointments, as well.

<p>

     We were pleased that the AGBM accepted, in principle, our

proposal regarding starting with analysis/assessment initially,

followed by serious negotiations later on.  On the downside, the

AGBM did not endorse our call for the creation of a panel of

experts to address global emissions trends at the AGBM's second

meeting on October 30.  Moreover, the group failed to agree on the

composition of a Bureau to monitor and coordinate the work of the

AGBM.

<p>

     The meetings of the two subsidiary bodies likewise

produced some uneven results.  The Subsidiary Body on

Implementation sped through its agenda in an orderly fashion. The

Subsidiary Body on Scientific and Technological Advice (or SBSTA)

was less fortunate.  On the plus side, it approved a list of

taskings to be discussed with the IPCC for possible investigation

and future reporting.  Moreover, it endorsed the concept of an NGO

workshop to be held in connection with its next meeting in February

to discuss non-governmental inputs into the process.

<p>

     On the negative side, SBSTA was unable to find a

satisfactory compromise on the question of creating two

technical advisory panels which will focus on methodological and

technology issues.  Resolution of this issue will now be delayed

until SBSTA's next meeting which is scheduled for February,

although this problem was discussed on the margins of the AGBM

meeting last month.


<p>


<b>The Second Geneva Meeting  </b>

<P>
 


     The second meeting of the AGBM started on October 30 with

two "surprise" presentations.  The first was our slide show

presented on emissions trends.  This was viewed critically by many

nations and the environmental NGOs who accused the U.S. of over-

emphasizing the role of developing countries in future steps and by

some who questioned its "relevance."

<p>

     The second surprise was the EU presentation of an outline on

the features of a future protocol.  This was unexpected primarily

because it came at the point in the discussion when we were

beginning to discuss policies and measures (and not during the

appropriate agenda item on this topic).

<p>

     In general, we were pleased with the results of AGBM2. Our

call for new and different thinking on options for new objectives

fared well.  Many countries commented favorably on the value of

considering new approaches, although the majority of the ideas

still centered on the current world view, with a fixed annual

target, a 1990 baseline year, and on the dates of 2005, 2010, and

2015.

<p>

     Our proposals detailing our view that analytic work on this

issue would be valuable were viewed by many as an effort to delay

agreement.  We countered these suggestions by cataloguing our

requests for analysis/assessment and noting that, in terms of both

hours of effort and cost, these were moderate and quite doable. 

Several of our ideas and suggestions were later adopted by the

plenary, and we now feel confident that analysis and assessment is

finally underway.

<p>

     We were also pleased by the general reaction of the G-77

countries to our shared responsibility to advance

implementation of the Convention in accordance with Article 4.1. 

Some countries argued strongly that any steps taken by the non-

Annex I Parties (e.g., the developing economies) can be easily

accommodated in the decision of the COP and ought not to be in any

protocol or other legal instrument.  Another large developing

country continued its familiar refrain that

"differentiation" means that, without significant action by Annex

I parties, developing countries need not do anything.  At the same

time, there were several indications that the G-77 (or, at least,

some of its key members) do want to move forward on national

communications issues.  A workshop on this topic will be held prior

to next year's AGBM3 in order to explore ways of facilitating these

communications.

<p>

     There were some downsides to this meeting, as well, and some

divisive issues remain:  namely, the organization of a Bureau and

the outstanding matter of the technical panels for SBSTA. 

Unfortunately, the effort by SBSTA Chairman Farago to

find "a compromise" solution was not successful.


<p>


<b>Conclusion </b>

<p>

     In summary, let me underscore that the Clinton

Administration remains committed to the international climate

change process.  The science remains convincing:  it is evident

that the prospect of global warming is real and that we must

continue to take steps to address this problem consistent with our

political realities.

<p>

     The climate problem will not go away if we turn our backs and

ignore it.  The climate convention represents the global effort to

reverse this damaging trend and to preserve our planet in a way

which it will continue to be habitable, stable, and economically

sustainable for future generations.  The

United States will continue to work in support of this

agreement.  We need to seek ways to reduce our emissions of

greenhouse gases, just as we need to make sure that all

countries in the world seek to reduce theirs.

<p>

     Thank you very much.

                      <b>   Patrick Ramage   <br>

    Global Legislators For a Balanced Environment (Globe USA)  
</b></center>


<p>


     I'm afraid I bring neither the eloquence nor the particular

experience of my GLOBE members, the members of the U.S. Congress

who are active in our Global Legislators for a Balanced

Environment organization to this question.  What I do share with

them in common is that I am not an expert in climate policy or

climate science.

<p>

     What I do have is a unique vantage point on the policy

process that may prove of interest to you, and some observations

and questions that may be helpful as you depart from this

mountaintop experience and go back to your daily lives, armed

with new information and contacts that you have gathered here.   

I will apologize in advance for a dose of Washington cynicism

that I find increasingly I bring to fora of this type.  

<p>

     Just a little bit about my organization.  GLOBE is an  

international membership for legislators and parliamentarians

that have an interest in international environmental issues.  We

have about 150 members worldwide, and are made up of four member

organizations:  GLOBE USA, of which I am the director, with 30

members of the U.S. Congress, both Republican and Democrat

involved, GLOBE Russia, GLOBE European Union and GLOBE Japan.

<p>

     We meet twice a year in what are called GLOBE international

assemblies, where these legislative leaders come together and

solve the world's environmental problems on paper, and then

return armed with that consensus to their respective parliaments,

with an eye toward implementing some of the consensus that they

have achieved.  Quite frankly, sometimes it works, often it

doesn't.  It is inevitably a profound educational experience for

the legislators that are involved.

<p>

     Climate change in particular and sustainable development

generally have been high on our agenda since the organization's

founding in late 1989.  Ironically enough, we were founded by a

Republican Senator from Pennsylvania, the late Senator John

Heinz.  We are currently led in the U.S. by Senator John Kerry of

Massachusetts as our Democratic chair, and Congressman John

Edward Porter of Illinois as our Republican chair.

<p>

     Let me start with just a few observation on sustainable

development and the climate issue.  I think the concept of

sustainable development exists in a state of levitation, floating

like a beautiful balloon, hovering above and beyond the day-to-

day concerns of most people, who have very little time to deal

with these issues.  I find often that these issues and our

approach to them have very little grounding in reality.

<p>

     In looking over the list of speakers and seeing some friends

in this room, I think a lot of us in the United States who are

concerned with this issue on a day-to-day basis, a lot of us, if

not the majority, are here.  That points up the challenge that we

face.

<p>

     I think it is useful to remember that whatever our

fascination may be with this amorphous and remote concept of

sustainable development, and whatever measure of success we or

Ambassador Hambley may enjoy in advancing particular language in

some obscure international forum, this has little meaning unless

we can ultimately motivate the vast majority of people around the

world who have never heard of the Rio earth summit, who have

never heard of sustainable development, or if they have heard of

it, couldn't define it adequately. 

<p>

     In thinking about it, if you confronted American people on

the street and ask them to define IPCC, I would bet you money

that the majority would say it was some kind of new-fangled

computer.  I will venture a guess that joint implementation would

be described as a medical procedure.

<p>

     We are dealing with a level of scientific literacy that is

at about the ninth grade level, and a level of literacy with

international fora and institutions that have been contrived to

deal with these pressing issues that is even far below that.  I

don't mean to start off on a negative note, but I think it is

useful for us to bear those realities in mind.

<p>

     In light of those facts, we as people concerned with the

issue need to confront a couple of key questions.  In no

particular order, I will list them here.  First, how do we

establish a common set of national and global environmental

priorities against a backdrop of polarization?  Those of you

Washington residents are confronting this question on a daily

basis at least since November of 1994, and arguably well before

that.

<p>

     Second, how do we communicate environmental information

responsibly and accurately to this public that has a terrifically

short attention span and such a deficit in terms of their own

scientific background?

<p>

     Third, how do we translate global problems and challenges to

local populations in ways that are meaningful?  We are fond of

repeating the mantra," think globally, act locally."  I think we

heard a little bit from Arturo Sanchez in terms of the challenges

that Costa Rica is confronting.  In the end, it is not about

billions of pounds of CO<sub>2</sub> sometime in the next century; it is

about coffee and banana plantations today, and reservoirs and

human habitations, et cetera.  But we who are trying to push this

issue forward need to tie strings to the balloon, if you will,

and be making these issues that we care about more relevant to a

population that doesn't confront them on a day-to-day basis.

<p>

     Fourth, how do we encourage leaders from politics, from the

environmental movement, from business and other sectors to

overcome the fantastic dis-incentives and distractions that keep

them from addressing environmental and sustainable development

issues at all, let alone generating the political will to make

the hard choices that the climate issue puts before them?

<p>

     In summary, how do we forge the societal consensus that will

allow us to move forward together in addressing these pressing

issues?

<p>

     These questions are being wrestled with across our country

and around the world.  The answers aren't likely to come from the

government in Washington, with all respect to Ambassador Hambley,

or remote UN agencies in New York or elsewhere.  It is far more

likely that they will come out of fora and seminars such as this

one, if we use them effectively.

<p>

     Well, I have brought the answers to all those questions with

me today, and I will quickly go over them, being sensitive to the

fact that we're running a little bit late.  All kidding aside, I

have some answers from the perspective of an environmentalist who

is working daily with environmental activists that are concerned

about and trying to push this issue.

<p>

     My advice falls in three or four key areas.  First, I think

we need to focus more -- and this is true, whatever side of this

issue you're on.  We have got members of Congress in GLOBE who

are dealing with a whole range of issues and are being asked to

develop positions on everything from acid rain to zero population

growth, literally, the A to Z of issues.  We have organizations

driving the policy process in the NGO community that have

specialists on all those issues, too.   We have said since Rio

that diversity is our strength.  But let me suggest that it can

also be an obstacle, and we ourselves need , as

environmentalists, as science people,to focus more of our efforts

in particular areas, focus on the climate issue in general, and

focus our strategies for pushing that issue forward amongst

ourselves in particular.

<p>

     Second, we need to package our message better.  I admit some

U.S. bias on this, but our experience over the past several

years, I would say, would be that the wind has somehow left the

sails of the U.S. environmental movement and is beginning to

shift.  At least on Capitol Hill there is a sense that somehow

there has been a deflation since Earth Day, 1990, since the Rio

Earth Summit.I think part of that has to do with the fact that we

haven't been effectively packaging our message.  If you remember

your Communications 101 class, they tell you in college that

communication begins with the listener.  It is the goal of the

communicator to package the message in a way that resonates with

something already inside the listener.

<p>

     In the United States, we have what we call a Wise Use

Movement, the so-called anti-environmentalists, who have been

doing that very effectively.  They are not talking about parts

per billion water pollution or pounds of CO<sub>2</sub> and distant threats

to small island states.  They are talking about your job.  They

are talking about private property rights, Constitutional issues,

fundamental concerns, whereas we in the environmental community

are somewhat hamstrung with a jargon and set of acronyms.  

<p>

     The message that we are selling right now, be it in terms of

climate change or the endangered species act, where we begin to

talk misty-eyed about the marbled merlet or threats to the

spotted owl, does not resonate in the same way.  We need to

catapult up to those larger themes, like human health, like

agriculture - begin to tie strings to the balloons a little bit

and fill in the break between day-to-day reality and the

levitated condition of the issue that we care about.

<p>

     Tim Worth does that very effectively on immigration issues,

he touches a nerve in the debate over immigration. He can lay out

a very eloquent explanation of how threats to small island states

including Haiti ultimately mean more Haitians emigrating from

that change, and the links between environmental and national

security.  You can't do it in a sound bite, but it is an

effective case that needs to be made to policy makers on Capitol

Hill.  Just going up and saying "the sky is falling, the sky is

falling," doesn't resonate very well with this Congress in

particular.

<p>

     Third, we need to plug into the mainstream more.  We need to

engage the business community more effectively in this cause, and

start using more judo than we do karate.  I think we need more

outreach.  We have had efforts like BCSD.  There are tremendous

efforts that Jeremy Leggett from Greenpeace has undertaken that I

assume he mentioned earlier in his remarks, reaching out to the

insurance industry.

<p>

     If you are familiar with another issue that emanated out of

Rio, and that is the Convention on Biological Diversity, you are

aware of the tremendous difficulty that the U.S. NGO community

and the Clinton Administration had motivating Congressional

decision makers in a Democratic Congress to pass that piece of

legislation, despite some assistance from leaders in the U.S.

business community.  I guarantee you, if we don't get business

voices on our side in this debate, it will not go any better in

terms of climate change.

<p>

     Related to that, I believe deep down in the importance of

some kind of post-2000 understanding.  But I question my friends

in the environmental community who are throwing all their time

and energy to that when we are in the midst of abrogating the

1990 standards that we had all hoped, at least in this country,

would be reached.

<p>

     Eileen Claussen from the National Security Council staff is

fond of saying that we activists are needed more in Grosse Point

than we are in Geneva, and I think her point is well taken.

<p>

     These are some thought-provoking questions.  But I really

feel that unless we do what we are doing smarter, that we are in

danger of our common future, as the Berlin Commission called it

in 1989, being the story of our common failure.

<P>

     I was struck when Ambassador Hambley was noting the comment

of James Irwin, looking back from space at earth and saying, what

a beautiful, warm, living object it is.  It is warm, it is

getting warmer, and the time to do something about that is now,

and I hope we all leave this meeting with strategies for how we

can each be more effective toward that end.

                 <b>      Mack McFarland  <br>

            United Nations Environment Programme  </b> </center>


<P>


     About three months ago, I was at Buffalo Springs

National Reserve in Kenya where I live.  In the evening I

went down to the dining area, walked to the edge that

overlooks a watering hole about 30 meters away, looked down,

and saw a large crocodile only about six or seven feet away. 

The crocodile was laying next to a warning sign: "BEWARE OF

CROCODILES!  DO NOT GO BEYOND THIS POINT!"  The sign was

obviously misplaced.

<p>

     It occurred to me that proper placement of a warning

sign is something like what we are trying to do to meet the

ultimate objective of the United Nations Framework

Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC):  The ultimate

objective of this Convention is to achieve stabilization of

greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level

that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with

the climate system.  I hope we do a better job of

establishing the positioning of that sign than those who put

up the warning about crocodiles.

<p>

     Now we are trying to establish the position of a

climate warning sign.  You have heard a number of opinions

on positioning that sign.  Arguments that if you put it too

close, there could be significant economic impacts, impacts

on standards of living.  If you put the sign too far away,

we could be surrounded by crocodiles before realizing it. 

We're not sure what is out there, what kind of crocodiles or

other hazards may be waiting.  Climate change is clearly a

very important issue with high stakes.  So where do you go

to get good information on the issue?


<p>

     A quote from a book by E. Bright Wilson, Jr. ("An

Introduction to Scientific Research," McGraw Hill, 1952)  in

a section titled "Bias and the Experimenter" is relevant: 

"No human being is even approximately free from such

subjective influences;  the honest and enlightened

investigator devises the experiment so that his own

prejudices cannot influence the results.  Only the naive or

dishonest claim that their own objectivity is a sufficient

safeguard."

<p>

     The mechanism used to provide information as a basis

for decisions on how to meet the ultimate objective is, in

effect, an experiment.  Design of that experiment, that

mechanism or process, is critical.  You have learned from

Professor Bolin that there are some 10,000 references in the

current Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)

report that is due to be published soon.  There is no one

that can cover all of this material, that can be an expert

in all of the fields covered by these references. 

Individual biases might stem from a lack of understanding of

the full range of subjects that must be covered.  Others may

come from different value systems.  So how do you design a

process to get good information as a basis for decisions?

<p>

     I believe that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate

Change process is a sound way to provide good information. 

There are principles within that process that are aimed at

providing the best available information, and providing that

information in a manner that is useful to policy makers.

<p>

     Quoting from the IPCC Procedures, "The role of the IPCC

is to assess on a comprehensive, objective, open and

transparent basis the scientific, technical and socio-

economic information relevant to understanding the risk of

human-induced climate change, its potential impacts and

options for adaptation and mitigation."

<p>

     The IPCC reports were prepared following those

procedures.  Sources of information for the reports are

primarily the peer reviewed literature.  If a manuscript is

referenced that hasn't been through peer review and isn't

readily available, it must be made available to all of those

that are preparing and reviewing the report.

<p>

     In an earlier presentation, the IPCC report was

referred to as a U.N. document.  Although sponsored by U.N.

agencies, the reports are prepared and reviewed by leading

independent experts from around the world, from academia,

government laboratories, and private laboratories.

<p>

     Working Group I, the physical science part of the

document, was prepared by 390 experts from at least 50

countries.  For Working Group II, the one that deals with

adaptation and mitigation, 509 experts from 57 countries

were involved in the preparation, and 92 experts from 36

countries were involved in Working Group III report

preparation.

<P>

     The Working Group I report was sent to some 800 experts

from around the world for review.  In addition this report

(as well as all others) was distributed to some 200

governments and organizations during the review process. 

The Working Group II report was reviewed by 700 experts from

58 countries.  For Working Group III, 129 experts from 30

countries, actually sent in written reviews on the report. 

It was distributed to many more who had the opportunity to

comment on it, should they choose.

<p>

     To assure policy relevance, IPCC Procedures state: 

"IPCC assessments should be neutral with respect to policy,

although they may need to deal objectively with scientific,

technical and socio-economic factors relevant to the

application of particular policies."  To insure this

criteria is met, all of the issues that are important for

policy decisions are covered; not only the physical sciences

and the impact sciences, but also the technical options and

the socioeconomic aspects.

<p>

     Governments are involved in outlining the subject to be

covered to insure their policy questions are  addressed, and

governments and organizations participate in the preparation

and the review of the documents.  Coverage, preparation of

outline and participation assure provision of information

that is relevant to those that have to make decisions.

<p>

     As a result of the process, I believe that these

documents have significant value.  They are as objective as

I think you can make these types of documents.

<p>

     Consensus within the community is built through

preparation of the documents.  I don't mean that science

should be a consensus process, but these are documents for

policy.  When you begin preparation of such a report, you

will find that there are scientists who have an

understanding of one, or even several aspects of the issue,

but don't have an understanding of the entire range of

subjects that are needed as a basis for decisions.  Through

the discussions in the preparation and review of these

documents, there is a sharing of information which builds

consensus within the scientific and technical communities

around many key pieces of information.

<p>

     As a result, you have a consistent message going out to

decision makers around the world.  In the absence of this

process, you might have one expert with a lot of knowledge

in one area, giving his government or decision maker one

perspective, while another expert with an equal depth of

knowledge in another area telling his decision maker in his

government or organization a not inconsistent but different

message.

<p>

     With consensus and a consistent message there is a

common basis as a point of departure for policy debate.

<p>

     I am sure you have all heard criticism of the process. 

My observation is that it is not a fault of the process. 

There have been some problems with participation, and I

think the criticisms that you have heard stem from the way

some participants have behaved in IPCC meetings.

<p>

     I believe there should be principles that the

participants should follow. 


<ol>
     <li> Attempt to remain objective. 
<p>
     <li> Synthesize information and views.  Information 

     and interpretations of information from different

     disciplines must be synthesized to provide a meaningful

     assessment report.
 
<p>

     <li> Avoid policy debates.  There is a place for policy

     debates but the IPCC is not the place.  If policy

     debates occur here, you distort the basis for the

     decisions.  To the maximum extent possible, the

     participants should avoid value judgments.  Where it is

     essential that some sort of value judgments be made,

     socioeconomic analysis for example, the value judgments

     should be clearly spelled out in the report.</ol>

    <center><h1>               Questions - Session IV  </h1>



   <b>     Jeremy Leggett, Paul Walitsky, John Shlaes, 

              Abby Young, Patrick Michaels

          Arturo Sanchez, Mark Hambley, and Patrick Ramage  </b> </center>

<p>



     DR. FOX-PRZEWORSKI:  For Jeremy Leggett, there seem to

be some inaccuracies regarding the role of developing

countries in the economic convention in the Berlin mandate. 

Would you perhaps help us clarify this issue?  

<p>

     MR. LEGGETT:  This question refers to the statement

that was made that developing countries have no obligations,

and they are the problem.  There are strong inferences that

developing countries are where we have to be concerned.

<p>

     First of all, of course, they do have obligations under

the climate convention.  They may not have obligations to

have targets and timetables for emissions limitations, but

they are very much embroiled in the process.  They have to

report data. They are clearly engaged to a much greater

degree with the convention than they would be if we didn't

have it.

<p>

     Passing the buck in this way, I should say, is one of

the core strategies of the carbon club.  The aim here is to

obfuscate and switch the blame to the extent that we can,

and hide the basic facts, which are that 80 percent of the

greenhouse gasses up there right now have come from the 25

or 30 percent of us who live in the OECD.  So we do have

manifestly an ethical responsibility to take the lead.

<p>

     Then there is also the technology transfer issue.  One

is quite right when he says the emissions from the

developing countries are coming like a rocket behind us. 

But does anyone think for a minute that the Indians and the

Chinese are going to switch to solar and biomass and wind

and energy efficiency if we don't take a lead, if we don't

show the first signs of addressing the challenge of

reshaping our own energy infrastructure in the years ahead?

<p>

     Anybody who has been to the Climate Convention's

meetings and talked to diplomats from the developing world

will be quite clear on this.  They all say we are not going

to go unless you go first, unless you show the way.  I think

that makes obvious sense.  So we have another ethical

imperative to get going, slowly and in an orderly fashion,

building down our fossil fuel dependence and our energy

profligacy, and, in an economically sustainable way,

switching as fast as we can to the new technologies of the

next century, and of course, maximal energy efficiency.

<p>

     MR. SHLAES:  May I comment?  If I am a member of the

carbon club, 80 percent of U.S. manufacturing is dependent

on fossil fuels.  That is a competitive advantage we have. 

We also have reduced energy intensity by 50 percent while

the economy has doubled in the last 20 years.  This is in

the U.S.  Those are real figures, and we can give them to

you if you want.  

<p>

     But the fact remains that what has built these

economies has been our ability to have reasonably low cost

energy.  The Chinese are going to build 30 power plants per

year for the next ten years.  It is all going to be driven

by Chinese coal, or most of it. We are much more efficient

in both the building and operating of power plants than the

Chinese, mainly because we have made the investment in

technology, we made the investment in processes, and we have

the cooperation of our customers.

<p>

     So the fact remains that we are living in a global

world, but we should not rush to judgment and cap the U.S.

economy -- and you heard enough this morning about what the

impact of that is. Developing countries are required to

report emissions if they get resources from developed

countries. They have no obligations in relationship to the

post-2000 negotiations and they keep reminding us of that.

<p>

     I don't have the exact language here, but it is almost

that specific.  Therefore, they are participating in this

negotiation, where developed countries will take on

additional negotiations, and they will participate in what

those obligations might be.  

<p>

     All we're saying is, if we're going to look at this

issue, let's look at it pragmatically, let's look at it

economically, and let's look at it in a way where there is

mutual benefit.  I'm not going to go into what joint

implementation is all about, but that is something that the

convention says we're going to try to advance.  That is an

important issue, but it is also a technology issue, which

means we've got to deal with barriers.  They are there. 

They are there in all evolving economies.  That is also the

essence of debate when we talk about trade.  

<p>

     So it is a very complicated issue.  It is not as

simplistic as one would make it.  

<p>

     DR. FOX-PRZEWORSKI:  The next question is to Mr.

Shlaes.  Does the Global Climate Coalition support the

Montreal Protocol?

<p>

     MR. SHLAES:  Several of our members are involved in the

Montreal protocol.  That is a very different treaty.  If you

will recall,it reflects a few gasses developed by a few

industries.  Several of our members are not involved in the

Montreal protocol, because those industries are not involved

in CFCs.  Every treaty should be considered in all of these

international negotiations, separate and unique.  We have

made our case in that context.

<p>

     I think the bottom line in relationship to the Climate

Convention is that it affects lifestyle issues.  That is the

essence of this debate in the United States, in Europe,and

in developing countries everywhere.  We are in a very new

context of debate internationally.  But in any regard,

several of our companies are involved in the Montreal,

several are not, because it involves CFCs, not the climate

issue, not CO<sub>2</sub>.

<p>

     DR. FOX-PRZEWORSKI:  For Abby Young, please, is 

there research on the effects on the urban ecosystems due to

Climate Change?  Specifically, would you also address what

cities or counties that you work with are doing in

maintaining the green spaces, the tree systems, parks, et

cetera, for CO<sub>2</sub> update?  There are two parts to that

question, please.

<p>

     MS. YOUNG:  The first part was on reduction of CO<sub>2</sub>

effects on the urban ecosystem, is that correct?

<p>

     DR. FOX-PRZEWORSKI:  The effects on the urban

ecosystem, specific research in these areas.

<p>

     MS. YOUNG:  First of all, I probably can't answer that

question.  Being a program coordinator for the U.S.

cities, -- I don't know who asked that question, but if it

is an issue of wanting to get research, yes, I am in a

position where I can find the research for you and get it to

you.  But I am afraid that I can't cite any specific studies

that directly discuss CO<sub>2</sub> reduction on the urban ecosystem, 

But maybe if that person can talk to me afterwards, we can

have an exchange of cards.  That is something I can get to

you later.

<p>

     The other question was, cities and counties that are

part of our program, what they have done to preserve open

spaces, parks and open spaces.  This has been a component in

some of the cities.  I am thinking specifically of Portland. 

I can't think of which cities and counties particularly.  I

know Minneapolis has done a lot as well. 

<p>

     The aim is first for the biggest reductions in CO<sub>2</sub>, so

they are looking at the transportation systems as well as

looking at energy efficiency, because that is where they get

the biggest initial change.  But many of them are

integrating their approaches with other city policies that

may or may not have been very aggressively enforced or

aggressively instituted.  Many of those aspects contain open

space and promote accrual and reversion of commercially used

spaces to open space.

     <p>

     DR. FOX-PRZEWORSKI:  A question for Dr. Michaels

regarding whether you have done a statistical test of

significance on your multivariate analysis, and if you have

done the significance test, has this been released along

with any other information on the particular results?

<p>

     DR. MICHAELS:  Yes, that was done.  It is in the

Journal of Technology, 1994.  The standard that is used was

a slope test, so it is very straightforward.

<p>

     DR. FOX-PRZEWORSKI:  Another to Jeremy Leggett.  Could

you please clarify further the role of aerosols?  There

seems to be much discrepancy on this issue.

<p>

     MR. LEGGETT:  That is a very difficult question to

answer quickly.  But let me just make one quick point. I

definitely got the impression that in the 1992 air report

completed in Guanjao, China, there was no treatment of

aerosols at all. 

<p>

     That is plain wrong.  Anyone who reads that report will

see that the aerosol cooling factor is discussed extensively

and was one of the reasons why the warming was revised down,

the other one being the unexpectedly fast depletion of CFCs.

<p>

     At the risk of being combative, I do want to make the

point that there is something here that is a little bit

surreal.  We see an individual scientist representing a very

small group of peers, complaining about not being given

access to data and so forth.  He could have gone to any one

of those IPCC plenaries.  There are no barriers.  Even

people like me from Greenpeace can go, for heaven's sake. 

1990 he wasn't there, 1992 he wasn't there, 1995 he wasn't

there, either.  He could have gone.

<p>

     To me, as a scientist, I should say quite honestly as

an ex-scientist, I was a university academic for 11 years,

on the faculty of Imperial Science and Technology, there is

something surreal about pretending that this is just an

academic debate, where reputations and whether or not data

is exchanged is the substance.  What we are dealing with

here is a threat assessment which, if we get it wrong and

the roll of the dice is unkind to us, poses a real threat,

not just to our economies and ecosystems, but to the future

of civilization.  That is something that really distresses

me.  I don't have any recipe for how to deal with it.  But I

find it really distressing, and somewhat surreal.

<p>

     DR. MICHAELS:  In IPCC 1992 there is not one spatial

representation of the projected temperatures as modified by

sulfate aerosol.  
<p>


     With regard to the review process for these documents,

there are not a lot of reviewers, I suspect, that would have

picked up the high latitude problem in the new model.  It

seems to me that what really should happen here is, there

should be an exceedingly free exchange of the so-called

transient model results, because the validity of any

scientific endeavor is determined by the sanctity of peer

review.

<p>

     So whether or not one attended meetings in 1990 and

1992 has nothing to do with the free exchange of

information.  I don't understand the logic that connected

those two comments.

<p>

     DR. FOX-PRZEWORSKI:  Has Costa Rica studied the direct impact

of forest resource development on employment and economic

development in Costa Rica, and watershed protection to insure

sustainable delivery of hydropower?

<p>

     DR. SANCHEZ:  Regarding the one on sustainable development and

employment in the development of Costa Rica, most of the

forestation that has been documented is for expansion and basically

to export to the U.S. market.  It is well known, in Central

America, where we turn old forests into grasslands for exports to

the United States, especially during the '70s and '80s.  

<p>

     There is a direct and striking pattern of employment.  In the

areas that have been deforested, we don't develop any kind of

industries, actually we are encouraging people to move out of the

towns and move into the compound where they have a better quality

of life.

<p>

     On the other hand, we are moving backwards.  We have right now

some projects in joint implementation with different institutions

that we hope can help to develop some kind of economic sources for

the communities still in the developed areas.  But we need to see

about that in the next five years.  It is too soon to say that the

forest resources management in joint implementation is producing a

positive outcome.  We are just starting this project.

<p>

     Regarding the question of watershed protection to insure

sustainable development of hydropower, the most critical issue in

hydropower generation is transport into the reservoirs.  You have

drainage basins without a sound land use and soil conservation

project, you are going to have your reservoir silted twice a year. 

We have specific cases in Costa Rica and Central America where we

have to actually drain reservoirs to clean them from sediment that

comes out of the upper parts of the watershed.  

<p>

     So from an economic point of view, the key for a sound

delivery of hydropower is to help us with sustainable management of

the land use in these basins.

<p>

     DR. FOX-PRZEWORSKI:  For Mark Hambley we have a number of

questions.  One relates to the Administration's request for the

State Department's Office for Global Change, if you might tell us

something about the current appropriation numbers and if they are

lower than the ones coming out of the House and Senate.  If they

are lower than the Administration's request, how would these

reductions affect the United States' ability to carry out its

negotiations in other work related to the FCCC and the IPCC?

<p>

     MR. HAMBLEY:  Our appropriations bill is one of the ones which

is being held up.  It has not been finalized.  There are two

different versions, one from the Senate, one from the House, both

of which would have very negative impacts on our overall foreign

policy programs.

<p>

     I can't give you a specific figure regarding the Office of

Global Change. The way these cuts are managed, central management

will tell us we will lose 10 to 15 percent of your outlays from the

previous year.  I will say that it has impacted on our ability to

staff conferences, and prepare for conferences.  I think that is

something which we are going to have to live with in the future and

somehow try to direct what resources we have to these international

obligations in a manner which we think is appropriate.

<p>

     I will say that a more serious budgetary impact concern is the

Congressional attitude towards funding the actual conventions

themselves.  For the Climate Change Convention, the IPCC and other

instances, the House and the Senate have decided to cut the

appropriations significantly.  We thus far think we are going to be

able to meet our obligations, but not much more than that.  That is

something which will impact very seriously on our ability to carry

forth this process.

<p>

     DR. FOX-PRZEWORSKI:  Who and perhaps also what will we need to

engage to get the science findings into the public conscience and

onto the public agenda?  How do we go about doing that in a better

way?

<p>

     MR. RAMAGE:  I attended a pretty conference recently at the

Hay Adams Hotel, where Working Group Two was releasing some of

their recent findings.  It is a tremendous challenge.  I just sat

there, as did some others, shaking their heads, because you have

advocates on this issue who are hoping to hear silver bullet kind

of language, and then you have scientists who are inherently

careful, and using, in the best sense, weasel words to hedge bets

and discus probability.  It doesn't get itself onto the radar

screen quite like we would hope.

<p>

     Indeed, the Post after that press conference, I thought they

attended a different event than I had been at.  But I think a lot

of it is not taking the issue as a whole and getting into a karate

style debate, the planet is warming up, the planet is not warming

up, whatever, but taking specific impacts on issues like food, like

human health, like migration, like threats to coastlines, et

cetera, and going after that little piece with the folks that are

concerned with that issue.

<p>

     Just to use an example, one of our GLOBE members who might be

approachable on this issue,is a fairly conservative moderate

Republican, Porter Goss from South Florida, who has real issues he

is going to be dealing with, both in terms of immigration and his

own coastline in his district, and packing it that way.  It is a

real challenge.

<p>

     We had Dr. Bolin come at the outset of this Congress, when

they were all full of vinegar and I don't know what else with the

Contract with America.  We got about five Congressional staffers in

addition to a healthy contingent from CRS, and for somebody of that

stature who brings that perspective to bear, to get that kind of

low turnout, we are doing something wrong in getting the issue to

resonate properly.

<p>

     It is a real challenge, but I think trying to segment it and

tie it to particular issues that people already care about may be

a step in the right direction.

<p>

     MR. HAMBLEY:  Could I just add something to that?  I was very

impressed with what Patrick Michaels said earlier about the

importance of somehow galvanizing the public reaction and approach

to this whole issue of Climate Change and Global Warming.  We are

very acutely aware of our dismal failure in this Administration in

focusing public attention on what is a growing problem.

<p>

     In 1988, it was an issue that was very much on peoples' lips. 

There was a very distinguished British colleague in Chicago over

the summer, where several hundred people were dying from heat

prostration.  That may or may not be related at all to this

particular topic, but in Europe, this was directly blamed on Global

Warming, not in Chicago.  It is something that I think we have to

find ways to address.

USGCRP Report 95-01<br>
May 1995

<h1>Foreword</h1>

<p>It was first recognized in the last century that human activities 
could have an important effect on the Earth's climate. Not until the 
early 1960s, however, was there convincing evidence that human 
activities were indeed changing the chemical composition of the 
global atmosphere. In 1964, the President's Science Advisory Council 
first brought the issue to the attention of the U.S. Government. In the 
late 1960s and throughout the 1970s, an initial set of computer 
model simulations were generated to predict changes in temperature 
and precipitation that could occur, given the continuing trend in 
increasing levels of human emissions of greenhouse gases to the 
atmosphere. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the National 
Academy of Sciences convened several panels and committees which 
reported that a doubling of the atmosphere's carbon dioxide 
concentration could potentially raise the global average temperature 
by 1.5 to 4.5&#176 C (about 2.5 to 8&#176 F) and shift rainbelts 
poleward. In 
1988, after significant national and international research efforts 
were initiated to further the scientific understanding of the issue, the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, composed of hundreds 
of scientists from more than 50 countries, assumed responsibility for 
conducting international assessments on climate change and its 
consequences. To date, the IPCC has produced a series of reports 
(1990, 1992, 1994, and a 1995 report is in progress).

<p>In parallel with these efforts to synthesize scientific information, 
national and international research programs have been established 
to improve predictive understanding of the Earth system and to 
provide the broader information base needed by decisionmakers to 
consider whether and how to respond. Building upon the knowledge 
base developed by the nation's basic research program in Earth 
sciences, an increasing array of research activities was begun in the 
late 1970s and 1980s. To further enhance the effort, President Bush 
established the interagency U.S. Global Change Research Program in 
1989, to coordinate and strengthen these activities. Congress enacted 
a statutory mandate for the USGCRP in 1990. The USGCRP currently 
conducts a comprehensive research effort involving observation and 
data management, field studies to improve understanding of climate 
processes, integrated modeling and prediction, and investigation and 
assessment of the potential environmental and socio-economic 
consequences of global environmental change.

<p>In the fall of 1994, the interagency Subcommittee on Global 
Change Research arranged for the special Forum on Global Change 
Modeling to provide an indication of the state of current progress in 
improving understanding of global change and to provide direction 
for future research.  This Forum served as a means of bringing 
together a representative set of scientists to develop a consensus 
statement on the credibility of global model estimates of future 
climatic change.

<p>This report is the agreed-upon statement from the participants at 
the meeting, including revisions and responses based on a wider 
review by the scientific community. We would like to express our 
gratitude to the participants for their commitment to this effort. We 
hope to update the following statement from the Forum periodically 
as new scientific progress is made through national and international 
research efforts.

<title>Overview - Model Forum Report</title>

<a href=cover.html>
<img align=bot alt=Back to Cover Page src=gifs/wheelsm.gif></a><h1>Forum 
on Global Change Modeling</h1>
<img src=gifs/bluegrad3.gif><p>
<h1>Overview</h1>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>On October 12-13, 1994, a Forum on Global Change Modeling was 
held at the invitation of the Subcommittee on Global Change Research 
(SGCR) to help address requests from the White House Office of 
Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and from Congressman Dingell 
to the General Accounting Office (GAO).  The Forum labored to 
produce a consensus document and to provide the GAO 
representatives a sense of the debate on issues related to the use of 
climate models to inform policy.  The charge to the panel and the 
report are attached [see <a href="caveat.html">caveat</a>].

<p>The invited participants included Eric Barron (chair), Joyce 
Penner, Chuck Hakkarinen, Dan Lashof, Jerry Mahlman, Pat Michaels, 
Roy Jenne, Richard Lindzen, Tamara Ledley, and Tom Wigley; a 
number of additional scientists were invited, but were only able to 
submit written comments.  In addition, Mike MacCracken, Ken 
Bergman, Jay Fein, Mike Riches, Lowell Smith, Richard Poore, Robert 
Schiffer, Dave Goodrich, Courtney Riordan, Ghassem Asrar, Robert 
Watson, Tony Janetos, Rick Piltz, and Scott Sandgathe participated as 
agency, congressional, and OSTP representatives.

<p>The report has been positively reviewed by a wider segment of 
the climate community.  Still, the forum participants believe that this 
report is just a beginning.  It includes the judgment of participating 
experts and reviewers-as opposed to detailed arguments-on the 
credibility of climate model projections.  As an additional step, the 
community needs to take the next step of elucidating fully the 
reasons models make the predictions that they do.  This effort should 
be a significant part of a rational approach to determine whether 
models are behaving reliably.  One aspect of this extended process is 
the thorough international assessment that is being conducted by the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which is due to 
be published in late 1995.


Forum Charge

<p>The charge to those attending the Forum and to those who 
submitted written comments was to develop a brief statement on the 
credibility of projections of climate change provided by General 
Circulation Models (GCMs) as background for potential interpretation 
of model results in the context of developing and considering 
national policy options.  The focus of this effort was specifically on 
the climate aspects of the entire global change issue <a 
href=fig1.html>(figure 1)</a> - thus not on the emission 
scenarios, the consequences of change to ecosystems and natural 
resource systems, or the socio-economic implications and potential 
for responses.

<h2>Working Objective Formulated by Forum Participants</h2>

<p>The attendees at the Forum decided to develop an ordered list of 
statements from "virtually certain" to "uncertain" that summarizes 
the major findings and implications stemming from climate system 
model experiments (most commonly with GCMs) and the issues being 
debated in the scientific literature, and to express these statements 
in terms that indicate their potential policy relevance.  The 
participants agreed to include with each ranked statement the basis 
for the consensus view.  In addition, the participants at the Forum 
agreed to provide indications of where opportunities exist for early 
progress in reducing uncertainties and improving confidence in 
model projections.  The report that follows consists of three parts.  
First, a number of conclusions are identified as "virtually certain," 
based on observations, experiments, and models.  These conclusions 
provide a significant starting point for discussion, yet they do not 
directly stem from climate system model experiments.  These 
statements are provided in <a href=part1forum.html>Part 1</a> as an 
introduction.  Second, <a href=part2forum.html>Part 2</a> 
provides the ranked statements that refer to model experiments and 
predictions.  Finally, a list of opportunities for early progress in 
reducing uncertainties is given in <a href=part3forum.html>Part 
3</a>.<p>

<title>Part 1. - Model Forum Report</title>

<a href=cover.html>
<img align=bot alt=Back to Cover Page src=gifs/wheelsm.gif></a><h1>Forum 
on Global Change Modeling</h1>
<img src=gifs/bluegrad3.gif><p>

<h1>Part 1.</h1>  <h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>A number of the scientific elements that are the basis of 
conclusions concerning future climate change do not stem directly 
from climate system models.  In many cases, these elements are 
subject to little or no debate because of their high level of certainty.  
As statements they may even appear to some as almost trivial 
because of the frequency with which they are stated.  Yet, in concert 
with the response to the Forum's specific charge, these statements 
provide both context and conclusions on the credibility of climate 
models for developing and considering national policy options.  Seven 
statements that provide this context follow:<p>

<strong>(1) Greenhouse gases absorb and re-emit infrared radiation, 
which includes the wavelengths of radiation emitted by atmospheric 
gases and clouds and by the Earth's land and oceans.</strong>

<p><strong>Basis-</strong>Laboratory experiments with greenhouse 
gases and spectrally resolved studies of radiation absorption and 
transmission in the atmosphere indicate that a number of gases that 
are present in the atmosphere are capable of absorbing and emitting 
infrared radiation.  The most important of these so-called greenhouse 
gases is water vapor. Other important natural greenhouse gases 
include carbon dioxide, ozone, methane, and nitrous oxide.

<p><strong>(2) Atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, 
methane, nitrous oxide, and halocarbons (most importantly 
chlorofluorocarbons), collectively labeled the greenhouse gases, are 
significantly increased above preindustrial levels, and the increase is 
due to anthropogenic activities.</strong>

<p><strong>Basis:  Carbon Dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)-</strong>The 
observed atmospheric concentration is 30% above preindustrial 
levels as determined from air trapped in ice cores and direct 
measurements since 1957 <a href=fig2a.html>(figure 2a</a> and 
<a 
href=fig2b.html>figure 2b)</a>.  The concentration is continuing 
to 
increase.  The measured (and estimated) anthropogenic sources 
(from fossil fuel consumption, deforestation, and agriculturally 
induced oxidation of humus) are significantly larger than the 
anthropogenic sinks (reforestation).  Changes in carbon isotopic 
composition of atmospheric carbon dioxide indicate that fossil carbon 
and biomass reduction have contributed significantly to the increase 
in the atmospheric concentration.  There is no serious debate about 
the fact that fossil fuel consumption and land-use change are the 
contributors to the increased concentration of atmospheric carbon 
dioxide.

<p><strong>Basis:  Methane (CH<sub>4</sub>)-</strong>The observed 
atmospheric concentration is more than 100% above preindustrial 
levels as determined from air trapped in ice cores, and direct 
measurements over the past 2 decades <a 
href=fig3a.html>(figure 3a</a> and <a href=fig3b.html>figure 
3b)</a>. The concentration has been increasing over recent decades.  
Estimated changes in anthropogenic sources (e.g., agriculture, energy 
resource production and use) are broadly consistent with measured 
increases in atmospheric concentrations, and are large compared to 
anthropogenic sinks or anthropogenically-induced reductions in 
emissions (e.g., reduced wetlands).

<p><strong>Basis:  Nitrous Oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O)-</strong>The 
observed atmospheric concentration is about 10% above 
preindustrial levels as determined from air trapped in ice cores and 
direct measurements over the past 2 decades.  Estimates of 
anthropogenic sources (e.g., nylon production, agriculture) are 
broadly consistent with measured increases in atmospheric 
concentrations; no anthropogenic sinks are recognized. 

<p><strong>Basis:  Halocarbons-</strong>Preindustrial concentrations 
of most of these compounds were virtually zero, because there are no 
natural sources.  Thus, the observed increases in atmospheric 
concentrations are due solely to human activities.  Anthropogenic 
sources (e.g., refrigeration, industrial) have been large; no 
anthropogenic sinks are recognized and natural removal processes 
for most chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) have a time constant of order a 
century.  The rise in atmospheric concentrations of regulated gases 
has slowed and nearly stopped due to recent reductions in emissions.

<p><strong>Basis:  Chemically Active Gases-</strong>The 
concentrations of CO, nitrogen oxides, and non-methane 
hydrocarbons are higher than pre-industrial values over large 
regions.  These gases can, through a series of chemical interactions, 
induce changes in the lifetimes-thus the concentrations-of 
radiatively active gases, including ozone and methane.  As an 
example, the concentration of tropospheric ozone in some regions is 
significantly above its level in the 19th century. 

There is evidence that the concentrations of carbon dioxide, ozone, 
methane, and nitrous oxide have also changed over geological time.  
In many cases these changes have been a driving factor in the 
different climates that are associated with time periods of altered 
concentrations.  Based on straightforward physics and 
thermodynamics, the global concentrations of water vapor must also 
have changed over geologic time, acting primarily in response to the 
values and distribution of temperature, continental geography, and 
orography.

<p><strong>(3) Because of their infrared absorption, increased 
concentrations of greenhouse gases exert a global warming influence.  
As discussed in Part 2, the magnitude and timing of the resulting 
warming is less certain.</strong>

<p><strong>Basis-</strong>Observations and measurements of the 
radiative effects of greenhouse gases in the present atmosphere and 
the association of changes in greenhouse gas concentrations with 
climate changes in the geological past indicate that the resulting 
changes in the radiation balance from increasing greenhouse gas 
concentrations will, in the absence of other factors changing the 
climate, induce global warming.  The extent of the warming will be 
affected particularly by the strength of water vapor and cloud 
feedback processes, which are major factors in controlling the natural 
greenhouse effect and which would be expected to respond to the 
radiative changes induced by the changes in concentrations of carbon 
dioxide and other greenhouse gases being affected by human 
activities.  Feedbacks change the magnitude of the response, as 
amplifying or moderating influences, but do not change the sign of 
the response.

<p><strong>(4) The drawdown of the augmented CO<sub>2</sub> 
concentration, which is now about 30% above its preindustrial level, 
to near its preindustrial level would take centuries, even if emissions 
were to be very substantially reduced in the near future.  Further, 
because a substantial reduction in global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions 
below current levels is unlikely to occur within the next few decades, 
the atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration is expected to continue 
to increase.  The drawdown of CFCs and nitrous oxide to their 
preindustrial levels would also take more than a century, even with 
a halt in human emissions; however, because of chemical 
decomposition in the atmosphere, the drawdown of the excess 
methane concentration to near its preindustrial level would take only 
several decades if emissions were to be significantly 
reduced.</strong>

<p><strong>Basis-</strong>Many of the sinks of CO<sub>2</sub> 
operate on long time scales. For example, while the mixed layer of 
the ocean (upper 75-200 m) comes into near equilibrium with the 
changes in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> relatively quickly, it takes 
hundreds of years to mix carbon throughout the deep ocean.  A 
further basis for this statement comes from the evaluation of the 
plausible sinks of emitted carbon dioxide and other gases in 
comparison to the projected growth of world population, the 
dependence of the world on the use of fossil fuels for energy, present 
trends in agriculture and deforestation, and the expected 
transportation, commercial, residential, and industrial use and 
emission of these gases.  In addition to the importance of the 
sources, many of the sinks of CO<sub>2</sub> operate on longer time 
scales.

<p><strong>(5) Anthropogenic aerosol concentrations are significantly 
increased in source regions (near and downwind of aerosol and 
aerosol precursor emissions).</strong>

<p><strong>Basis-</strong>The global trend in tropospheric aerosol 
concentrations is uncertain and not well-documented by global 
monitoring programs, but the human-influenced emission of aerosol 
precursors has generally increased in several major regions over the 
last decades to a century, and regional aerosol concentrations are 
believed to increase with increasing emissions.  Natural sources of 
tropospheric aerosols include windblown dust, hydrocarbons from 
vegetation and forests, and soot and other products of forest and 
grassland fires.  Increased concentrations of tropospheric aerosols 
are measured in and downwind of regions of anthropogenic sources, 
including sulfate aerosols from fossil fuel combustion and complex 
chemical aerosols from biomass burning.  Stratospheric aerosols are 
largely of natural origin.  Large variations in the concentrations of 
stratospheric aerosols are determined by volcanic eruptions and, in 
polar regions, by the temperature (i.e., at cold enough temperatures, 
atmospheric gases can condense to form aerosols).

<p><strong>(6) Sulfate aerosols, both from volcanic injections and 
from fossil fuel combustion, exert a cooling influence on the climate. 
While the sign of the effect is well-established, estimates of the 
magnitude, trends, and extent of the induced cooling effects are 
uncertain due to limitations in the observations of aerosol amount 
and composition, limitations in the models used to simulate the 
aerosol system, and potential indirect effects of anthropogenic sulfate 
aerosols through changes in cloud extent and character.  Reduction of 
anthropogenic emissions of aerosols and aerosol precursors (e.g., 
sulfur dioxide) would lead, over periods of weeks to months, to 
reductions in atmospheric concentrations of tropospheric aerosols 
due to relatively effective natural removal processes.  However, the 
rates of emissions by anthropogenic sources in some regions are not 
well-documented, particularly for biomass burning sources.</strong>

<p><strong>Basis-</strong>Laboratory and atmospheric measurements 
show that aerosols scatter solar radiation, with much of the radiation 
scattered in the backward direction (i.e., back out into space).  
Observations and model simulations indicate that large volcanic 
eruptions temporarily cool the climate.  Observations also indicate 
that settling and transport move stratospheric aerosols (mostly 
volcanic) into the troposphere over a few years, and that 
tropospheric aerosols are removed by precipitation scavenging and 
contact with the surface within weeks to months.

<p><strong>(7) Global average surface air temperatures are about 0.5 
&#176 C (1 &#176 F) higher than average temperatures in the 19th 
century.</strong>

<p><strong>Basis-</strong>Observational records drawn from ship and 
land measurements since about 1850, while somewhat uncertain due 
to changes in instrumentation, measurement and observation 
techniques, and station location, indicate that the world is warmer 
now than in the 19th century <a href=fig4.html>(figure 4)</a>.  
Limited borehole (ground surface) and glacier meltback records also 
suggest generally warmer conditions during this century.  This 
change cannot yet be unambiguously ascribed to increased 
concentrations of greenhouse gases.  Over the past century, the 
cooling influence of changing amounts of anthropogenic aerosols 
appears to have the potential, in terms of both the timing and the 
reduced magnitude, to explain some of the differences between 
observations and model predictions of the warming due to the 
increased greenhouse gas concentrations alone (model predictions 
suggest that a warming significantly greater than 0.5 &#176 C should 
have occurred).  The natural variability of climate, on time scales of 
months to centuries and variously distributed over the globe, 
contributes to the uncertainty over the interpretation of the record.

<h1>Part 2.</h1>  
<h2>Statements Concerning Results of Climate Models</h2>

<p>There are significant uncertainties in predicting future climates as 
a consequence of (a) natural climate variability; (b) the potential for 
uncertain or unrecognized climatic forcing factors (e.g., explosive 
volcanism, new or unknown anthropogenic influences, etc.); and (c) 
inadequate understanding of the climate system (e.g., a recent 
discovery that clouds absorb significant short-wave radiation which 
is not included in models, or potential errors in fluxes at the top of 
the atmosphere associated with changes in relative humidity).  These 
uncertainties may (or may not) lead to re-assessment of model 
capability.  We must expect that new observations or results from 
process studies may yield information that causes us to re-evaluate 
and improve the capability of climate models.  Our estimates of the 
credibility of climate system models can, of necessity, be consistent 
only with known facts and based only on the "best" current 
knowledge.

<p>The list given below is not a "forecast" but rather a scientific 
judgment based on the assumption that the concentrations of 
anthropogenic greenhouse gases will increase.  Many of the model 
experiments on which these points are based have an even more 
specific assumption, a scenario of a 1% per year increase in 
CO<sub>2</sub> to mimic the radiative forcing of the projected 
increase in the concentrations of all greenhouse gases.


<h2>Virtually Certain</h2>

<p><strong>(1) Large stratospheric cooling will result from the 
increase in CO<sub>2</sub> concentration and ozone depletion; the 
start of such cooling has been predicted by models and observed in 
the upper stratosphere.</strong>

<p><strong>Basis-</strong>Increased emission of infrared radiation is 
an automatic consequence of the increased infrared optical depth in 
the stratosphere due to the increased concentration of 
CO<sub>2</sub>.  This will lead to cooling in the upper stratosphere, 
and satellite observations and other records show this is occurring <a 
href=fig5.html>(figure 5)</a>.  In the lower stratosphere, 
temperature changes due to increased CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations 
are complicated by the changes in ozone concentration due to 
volcanic aerosols, chlorofluorocarbons, nitrogen oxides from aircraft, 
and changes in tropospheric chemistry (further affected by other 
surface emissions), which can variously lead to cooling and warming 
in the lower stratosphere.  Volcanic aerosols have a direct radiative 
effect on the lower stratosphere, producing a warming.


<h2>Very Probable</h2>

<strong>(2) Global mean surface temperature warming will increase 
by the mid-21st century.  The best available estimate is that global 
mean surface temperatures will increase by about 0.5 to 2&#176 C 
(or about 1 to 3.5&#176 F) over the period from 1990 to 2050 due to 
increases in the concentrations of greenhouse gases alone (note that 
point 15 indicates it is inappropriate to convert these estimates to a 
per-decade basis), assuming no significant actions to reduce the 
projected increase in the rate of emissions of these gases.  The best 
available estimate for a climate change that is in equilibrium with 
two times the pre-industrial carbon dioxide concentration (or 
equivalent in terms of other greenhouse gases) is a warming of 1.5 to 
4.5&#176 C, with 2.5&#176 C being the most probable estimate <a 
href=fig6.html>(figure 6)</a>.</strong>

<p><strong>Basis-</strong>This estimate of global warming is based on 
projections of emissions and on a combination of results from simple 
model studies, general circulation models, the observed record, and 
estimates of the response of the climate to various forcings in the 
geological past, based on reconstructions carried out in paleoclimate 
studies.  The estimated warming would be reduced if sulfur 
emissions are not controlled, and the actual temperature change may 
be outside this range if natural climate variations (e.g., significant 
changes in the frequency of explosive volcanic eruptions) are large.

<strong>(3) Global mean precipitation will increase.  The distribution 
of this change is less certain (see <a 
href=ftnote1.html>below</a>).</strong>

<p><strong>Basis-</strong>A warming of the surface temperature over 
the globe will lead to an increase in global-mean precipitation 
because of the relationship between evaporation rate and surface 
temperature.  The underlying physics on this is well-established, and 
all models confirm this relationship. <a href=ftnote1.html>[1]</a>

<p><strong>(4) Northern hemisphere sea ice will be reduced (the 
magnitude of the change will depend on the amount of the warming, 
and the reduced extent will initially be most evident in the transition 
seasons).  Projected changes and their timing in the Southern 
Hemisphere sea-ice extent are less certain.</strong>

<p><strong>Basis-</strong>Studies of past climates provide evidence 
for polar amplification of warming and reduced sea-ice extent.  
Modeling studies also suggest that this will occur, although some 
have suggested local sea-ice expansions.

<p><strong>(5) Arctic land areas will experience wintertime 
warming.</strong>

<p>Basis-Paleoclimate and model studies provide evidence for polar 
amplification of warming and reduction in land-surface snow cover.  
The magnitude of the surface warming will be dependent on 
potential changes in the poleward heat flux, which are uncertain, and 
the magnitude of the global warming.  Current models may 
significantly underestimate the magnitude of polar amplification 
while exaggerating tropical changes if poleward heat flux by the 
ocean-atmosphere system is not properly simulated by models.

<p><strong>(6) Global sea level will rise at an increasing rate, although 
with some probability that the rate of rise may not be significantly 
greater than at present.  The most reasonable estimates for the rate 
of sea-level rise are for a rise of 5-40 cm by 2050, as compared to a 
rise of 5-12 cm if rates of rise over the past century continue <a 
href=fig7.html>(figure 7)</a>.</strong>

<p><strong>Basis-</strong>The most tractable part of making the 
estimate for the next several decades is projecting the component 
due to seawater expansion, whose rate of change is closely 
dependent on the atmospheric warming.  Reasonable estimates of the 
retreat of mountain glaciers are also available.  The mass balances of 
the polar ice sheets are highly uncertain, and are likely to be 
important only on longer time scales.  It is important to recognize 
that these estimates ignore long-term issues relating to both the slow 
response of the major ice caps (Greenland and Antarctica), 
potentially different responses on Antarctica and Greenland, and the 
continuing (centuries-long response) rise in sea level as the deep 
ocean only slowly experiences the warming at the surface.  These 
estimates also do not consider the sea-level rise that would result 
from a potential catastrophic collapse of the west Antarctic ice sheet, 
which has been proposed but remains a subject of considerable 
debate.

<p><strong>(7) Solar variability over the next 50 years will not induce 
a prolonged forcing that is significant in comparison with the effects 
of the increasing concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub> and other 
greenhouse gases.</strong>

<p><strong>Basis-</strong>The magnitude of the forcing from known 
levels of solar variability (variations of roughly 0.2 W/m2 have been 
occurring as a result of the solar cycle) is small compared to 
projected changes in greenhouse gas forcing (forcing of roughly 2 to 
3.5 W/m2 is projected to occur as a result of likely emission 
scenarios, according to the IPCC).  Changes on centennial to millennial 
time scales may be as large as 0.5 W/m2, but are still small 
compared to projected greenhouse forcing.


<h2>Probable</h2>

<strong>(8) Summer Northern Hemisphere mid-latitude continental 
dryness will increase.</strong>

<p><strong>Basis-</strong>Evaporation increases strongly with 
temperature increases.  Current models indicate some general 
agreement that summer mid-latitude dryness occurs because the 
evaporation increase is larger than the precipitation increase. <a 
href=ftnote2.html>[2]</a>  However, uncertainties include the 
following:  (a) increased atmospheric moisture may be transported 
into continental interiors, resulting in transients of increased 
precipitation; (b) the vegetation response to increased 
CO<sub>2</sub> is not known outside of highly controlled conditions; 
and (c) land surface-atmosphere interactions, including the storage of 
wintertime moisture, are still poorly represented in models.

<p><strong>(9) High-latitude precipitation will increase, with potential 
feedback effects related to the influence of additional freshwater on 
the thermohaline circulation and of increased snowfall or rain on the 
mass balance of polar ice caps.</strong>

<p><strong>Basis-</strong>With global warming, there will be an 
increase in the atmospheric mixing ratio of water vapor, producing 
larger moisture fluxes and more precipitation than at present in high 
latitudes.

<p><strong>(10) Antarctic and North Atlantic ocean regions will 
experience warming that is slower than the global average.</strong>

<p><strong>Basis-</strong>Oceanic regions where surface waters mix 
downward and where deeper waters upwell to the surface will have 
a smaller than average surface temperature response to global 
warming.  The suppression or enhancement of the warming will also 
depend on the nature of changes in the precipitation and freshwater 
input at the sites of downward mixing.

<p><strong>(11) Transient explosive volcanic eruptions will result in 
short term relative cooling.</strong>

<p><strong>Basis-</strong>Historical volcanism records indicate 
cooling of a few tenths of a degree lasting up to a few years following 
major eruptions <a href=fig8.html>(figure 8)</a>.  The historical 
frequency of explosive volcanic events large enough to produce 
substantial increases in stratospheric aerosols suggests that a few to 
several such events could occur over the next several decades.

<h2>Uncertain</h2>

<strong>(12) Changes in climate variability will occur.  As yet there is 
no clear evidence that suggests how the character of interannual 
variability may change due to greenhouse warming, but there is the 
potential for multifaceted and complicated, even counter-intuitive, 
changes in variability.</strong>

<p><strong>Basis-</strong>Many potential changes in variability can 
be identified, suggesting that some will occur.  These possibilities 
include the following:  (a) In all models, standing and transient eddy 
activity in the mid-latitudes decreases with the reduced meridional 
temperature gradient associated with global warming, which may 
lead to reduced wintertime variability for warmer climates; (b) 
El Ni&#241 o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) frequency may be related to 
average temperature, as suggested in historical and some modeling 
studies (models have suggested both more and less persistence 
during warm climates); (c) variability associated with smaller scale 
convective activity may increase (e.g., thunderstorms) as a result of 
greater moisture content in the atmosphere; and (d) greenhouse 
warming and land-ocean temperature differences may increase the 
frequency of atmospheric "blocking" events, and may influence low 
frequency precipitation variability.

<p><strong>(13) Regional scale (100-2000 km) climate changes will be 
different from the global average changes.  However, at present 
there is only very limited capability to estimate how various regions 
will respond to global climate change.</strong>

<p><strong>Basis-</strong>There is a significant mismatch of spatial 
scales between present climate system models and regional climate 
variations.  This is especially important because of the dependence of 
regional-scale responses to the details of regional land-surface 
characteristics, especially orography, hydrological conditions, and 
land-surface features.  The best estimates of regional change are 
currently based on the large-scale characteristics of model 
simulations, and differences between global and regional changes are 
uncertain but are expected to be present.

<p><strong>(14) Tropical storm intensity may change.</strong>

<p><strong>Basis-</strong>An increase in tropical storm intensity is 
plausible (e.g., model studies suggest increases in intensity associated 
with higher sea-surface temperatures), but are uncertain because of 
potential changes in poleward heat flux, uncertainties in tropical sea-
surface temperature response, and the strength of the Hadley 
circulation in a greenhouse warming condition.  Whether the 
frequency of tropical storms will increase is uncertain, in part 
because GCMs are currently not run at the appropriate spatial 
resolution to simulate hurricane formation and other factors that 
might lead to changes in hurricane generation.

<p><strong>(15) Details of the climate change over the next 25 years 
are uncertain.</strong>

<p><strong>Basis-</strong>Uncertainties in the factors controlling the 
natural variability of the climate, in the model simulations (as 
described above), and in the perturbations to atmospheric 
composition make it extremely difficult to predict or even suggest 
the details of changes in the global or regional climate on the time 
scale of only a few decades.  In any given decade, the changes in 
temperature and related variables could be substantially less than or 
more than the model-predicted trend.  Warming estimates in terms 
of degrees per decade and their use to analyze a single decade are, 
therefore, unwarranted.  Focus on a decadal analysis of observations 
can be equally misleading.

<p><strong>(16) Biosphere-climate feedbacks are expected, but how 
much these feedbacks will amplify or moderate climate change is 
uncertain.</strong>

<p><strong>Basis-</strong>Processes governing changes in the 
distribution and character of vegetation are not incorporated in 
climate models.  Limited assessments suggest plausible changes in 
climate may occur as a result of vegetation modifications that result 
from the greenhouse-gas-induced climate changes, including (but not 
limited to) (a) replacement of high-latitude tundra by multi-story 
vegetation, resulting in added warming; (b) regional impacts in 
response to vegetation changes from forest to grassland, etc.; (c) 
impacts on the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration of changes in carbon 
storage in vegetation and soils; (d) regional and possibly global 
impacts of extensive tropical deforestation; and (e) impacts on the 
N<sub>2</sub>O, NO, CH<sub>4</sub>, NMHCs, and O<sub>3</sub> 
cycles.  These effects could amplify or moderate expected climatic 
changes.<p>

<h1>Part 3.</h1>
<h2>Opportunities for Reducing Uncertainties</h2>

Meeting participants identified a number of areas where sustained or 
intensified research efforts would bring important gains in 
understanding and predictive capabilities.

<p><strong>(1) While progress is clear as a result of ongoing research 
efforts and important steps can be taken over the coming decade 
that will bring new insights, significant reductions of the 
uncertainties in projecting changes and trends in the climate will 
require sustained efforts that are very likely to require a decade or 
more.</strong>

<p><strong>Basis-</strong>Progress will require significant effort 
because the problems are complex, because improvements in model 
parameterizations will require a sustained and long-term program of 
research and observations, and because the records of past changes 
and influences require careful reconstructions to make them more 
complete and more useful.  Although progress may be modest, there 
are a number of processes and feedbacks on which research must be 
sustained because of the large leverage to be gained from improved 
understanding.  These processes and feedbacks include (a) cloud-
radiation-water vapor interactions, including treatment of solar and 
infrared radiation in clear and cloudy skies (also including resolution 
of uncertainties concerning anomalous solar absorption); (b) ocean 
circulation and overturning; (c) aerosol forcing, requiring information 
on aerosol character and extent; (d) decadal to centennial variability; 
(e) land-surface processes, including the climate-induced changes in 
the structure and functioning of ecological systems with resultant 
changes in global chemical cycles; (f) short-term variability affecting 
the frequency and intensity of extreme and high impact events (e.g., 
monsoons, hurricanes, mesoscale storm systems, etc.); (g) non-linear 
and threshold effects that create the potential for surprises; and (h) 
interactions between chemistry and climate change and improved 
representation of atmospheric chemical interactions within climate 
models, thereby leading to improved understanding of the causes of 
trends in CH<sub>4</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O, O<sub>3</sub>, CFCs, and 
aerosols.

<p><strong>(2) Improved spatial resolution in atmospheric and 
oceanic models will improve the representation of the present 
climate and potential global-scale changes.</strong>

<p><strong>Basis-</strong>In the atmospheric component of climate 
models (as in weather forecast models), major storm systems and 
circulation patterns are significantly better represented in models 
having resolutions finer than about 2.5 degrees in latitude and 
longitude (as opposed to the 5- to 7-degree resolution often used in 
past modeling studies), in part because of improved representation 
of major orographic features and in part because of improved ability 
to represent weather systems, the Intertropical Convergence Zone, 
the Hadley circulation, and other circulation features <a 
href=fig9.html>(figure 9)</a>.  In the oceanic component of 
climate models, ocean current patterns are significantly better 
represented in models having resolutions finer than about 0.5 to 1 
degree (as opposed to the 3- to 5-degree resolution in past modeling 
studies), in large part because important ocean current systems (e.g., 
the Gulf Stream and Kuriosho), ocean variability (including ENSO 
events), and the thermohaline circulation and other vertical mixing 
processes can be better represented.  Improved resolution in both 
atmosphere and ocean components of global climate models has also 
proven to reduce flux imbalance problems arising in the coupling of 
these components.  With the increasing parallelism of 
supercomputers and the availability of massively parallel computers, 
the only impediment to the gain in model accuracy by improving 
model resolution is the commitment of computational resources.  
However, a concomitant increase in efforts for process studies and 
diagnosis and analysis of model results is required.

<p><strong>(3) Climate changes at the surface and as a function of 
altitude can be better represented by inclusion of significantly more 
representative parameterizations of the atmospheric boundary layer 
and of vertical convection processes. Substantially improved 
observations and improved representations of water vapor in climate 
models will reduce a major source of uncertainty in model 
predictions.</strong>

<p><strong>Basis-</strong>By including more complete 
representations of the atmospheric boundary layer, weather forecast 
models have achieved important gains in their representation and 
prediction of surface conditions, and of water vapor transport to the 
free troposphere.  A 1% change in relative humidity leads to about a 
1 W/m2 change in top-of-the-atmosphere fluxes.  Observational 
uncertainty in relative humidity is more than 10% in some regions, 
which can translate to more than twice the flux change expected 
from a CO<sub>2</sub> doubling. It is difficult to separate possible 
model error from observational error, especially in relatively dry 
regions.  Important debate continues as to the nature of the positive 
water vapor feedback associated with global warming.  Improved 
representations of precipitation and of convective transport of water 
vapor into the upper troposphere will significantly reduce 
uncertainties about the amplifying feedback due to water vapor and 
the extent of changes in storm tracks.  Such improved 
representations are being developed and tested, and will be able to 
be implemented, provided computational time is allocated for testing, 
and diagnostic and analysis efforts are strengthened.  An increased 
emphasis on observations of water vapor and evaluation and testing 
of models is crucial to the global warming hypothesis.

<p><strong>(4) Improving the linkages coupling the atmosphere, 
oceans, and land surface will reduce uncertainties in estimates of the 
overall climate response by improving the accuracy of the climate 
simulations, by eliminating the need for ad hoc adjustments to fluxes 
between components that are used in some models, and by allowing 
fuller exploration of natural climate variability over all time 
scales.</strong>

<p><strong>Basis-</strong>The climate is a result of the complex 
interactions of the atmosphere, the oceans, and the land surface.  The 
dynamics, thermodynamics, and hydrodynamics (and to an 
increasing extent the chemical and vegetation dynamics) must all be 
treated in order to provide a realistic simulation of climate.  The 
focus has initially been on the atmosphere, then increasingly on the 
ocean; coupling of the atmosphere and oceans has not been 
completely successful due to limitations in understanding of ocean 
mixing and air-sea exchange mechanisms, in addition to limitations 
in model resolution and the full range of processes internal to each 
domain.  Increased attention to improved representation of the 
coupling is starting to lead to improved representations of 
temperature and other climatic variables.  Corresponding 
improvements are needed in representations of the land surface and 
land-atmosphere interactions and fluxes.  Because vegetation and 
chemical composition can affect radiative forcing and water vapor 
concentrations, these must also be treated in coupled simulations.  
The emerging results from the World Ocean Circulation Experiment 
(WOCE), the Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX), and 
other field and analysis programs are providing the opportunity for 
improving the performance of coupled models.

<p><strong>(5) More explicit representation of land-surface processes 
<a href=fig10.html>(figure 10)</a>, including vegetation, soil 
characteristics, and CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> effects on 
stomatal resistance, will reduce uncertainties in estimates of soil 
moisture, summertime continental drying, and changes of regional 
climate.</strong>

<p><strong>Basis-</strong>Explicit treatment of vegetation provides 
representation of the seasonally varying albedo, the diurnally and 
seasonally varying pattern of evapotranspiration, and other factors, 
permitting better representation of the diurnal temperature and 
humidity.  Explicit treatment of soil characteristics permits treatment 
of runoff and soil moisture, significantly improving representation of 
the hydrologic cycle.  Parameterizations that are significantly better 
than those that have been used in past studies will be available for 
use, but still require extensive testing and evaluation before 
implementation and application in GCMs.

<p><strong>(6) Sub-continental and regional scale features of global 
climate change can be better represented by an intensified focus on 
tailoring global predictions to specific regions using both finer scale 
models and empirical techniques.</strong>

<p><strong>Basis-</strong>Weather forecasts are successfully tailored 
to specific regions using both finer scale models and empirical 
techniques that derive local and regional features from large-scale 
atmospheric conditions.  These techniques, including both regional 
models and statistical methods, have been demonstrated in studies 
that predict local conditions given large-scale conditions.  Application 
is starting to be done and awaits only commitment of resources and 
analytic effort.  Results of this type will permit significant testing and 
improvement of the capabilities for estimating regional 
vulnerabilities of ecosystems and socio-economic systems to climate 
change.

<p><strong>(7) Model comparisons against observations and with 
other models can accelerate the rate of model improvement.</strong>

<p><strong>Basis-</strong>Important new data sets are being 
developed that document the climatic changes and fluctuations of the 
20th century, including improved estimates of changes in factors 
(e.g., greenhouse gas concentrations, volcanic aerosols, sulfate 
aerosols, ozone concentrations, ozone precursors, solar variability, 
ENSO events, etc.) that are likely the primary causes of these 
variations.  Comparison of results of models making these 
simulations with each other and with the observational record can 
identify systematic errors and the strengths and weaknesses of 
alternative model formulations.  Extension of these validation and 
intercomparison efforts to include atmospheric, oceanic, land surface, 
atmospheric chemistry, and coupled models is underway; more 
intensive efforts would likely accelerate progress.

<p><strong>(8) Improved reconstruction, simulation, and analysis of 
preindustrial and paleoclimatic periods can help assess model 
projections of climate sensitivity and variability, and lead to 
enhanced model credibility.</strong>

<p><strong>Basis-</strong>Successfully demonstrating the capability 
of models to simulate known paleoclimatic states will increase the 
confidence in a model's ability to predict future climatic scenarios.  
Although no past climatic periods are precisely similar to the 
present, reconstruction and diagnosis of climate changes and states 
prior to the industrial period provide the natural context to which 
projected anthropogenic climatic changes can be compared <a 
href=fig11.html>(figure 11)</a>.  The past 1,000 years provides 
an opportunity to understand natural climate variability; the 
transition from the Last Glacial Maximum (18,000 years ago) to the 
current interglacial provides a period of relatively rapid warming; 
the last glacial exhibits periods of apparently rapid climatic shifts 
and changes in ocean circulation <a href=fig12.html>(figure 
12)</a>; periods during the Pliocene to the Cretaceous provide 
examples of warmer conditions, often with different orography 
and/or geography.  Comparison of changes in climatic forcing with 
changes in climate across these periods allows estimation of 
processes and conditions ranging from natural variability to global 
climate sensitivity and its latitudinal variation. Model simulations of 
these periods can indicate the influence of factors that cause climatic 
change and can identify features that current models and 
understanding are unable to explain, such as changes that may not 
previously have been seen in the recent climatic record (e.g., 
relatively rapid and sharp climatic shifts).  Several projects are 
underway to reconstruct the climates of past warm and cold periods 
and to compare model simulations to these reconstructions, looking 
at changes in the mean, in rates of change, and in initiation of 
climatic shifts.

<p><strong>(9) Improving the representation of atmospheric 
chemistry and of vegetation and soils is needed to improve 
prediction of radiative feedbacks and to allow calculation of the 
effects of other types of global environmental change.</strong>

<p><strong>Basis-</strong>To treat the effects of climate forcing by 
aerosols (both direct radiative effects and possible indirect effects on 
cloud radiative properties and atmospheric chemistry) and because 
of the indirect effects of climate change and non-greenhouse gases on 
the concentrations of greenhouse gases, especially ozone, it is 
becoming increasingly important to account for these effects in 
climate simulations.  While this can be done to some extent 
parametrically, there is an increasing need to explicitly treat these 
processes in climate simulations.  Similarly, changes in the structure 
and functioning of major ecological systems can affect global 
biogeochemical cycles, the evapotranspiration and runoff of water, 
and surface reflectivity and roughness in ways that must also be 
accounted for in climate simulations if uncertainties are to be 
reduced.  Such changes can be induced by a changing climate or by 
changes in land use or land-use management.  With the development 
of global chemistry models, land-use models, and vegetation models 
(and related models of the effects of ocean biogeochemistry on the 
climate), opportunities are growing for doing so as supercomputer 
resources and speed increase.<p>

<h2><p align=center>AGCI General Information</h2>

The Aspen Global Change Institute (AGCI) is a Colorado non-profit
organization dedicated to enhancing understanding of global scale
environmental change and the role of human beings in that change.  AGCI
also helps to educate decisionmakers, students, and the public about the
science of global change and its ramifications.  To these ends, AGCI
convenes interdisciplinary meetings of the world's leading scientists,
enabling them to work together at the cutting edge of a variety of topics
of critical importance in the global change arena.  The goal of these
meetings is not only to further scientific understanding across
disciplines, but also to serve as a catalyst for researchers to collaborate
on new work.<p>

AGCI is also committed to linking global change science at its most
advanced levels with education at the kindergarten through twelfth grade
(K-12) level.  AGCI's Ground Truth Studies (GTS) curriculum is now used in
over 750 schools in the United States and Canada.  GTS is an activity-based
science education program that integrates local environmental issues with
global change topics and introduces the exciting tool of remote sensing to
students in elementary and secondary schools.  By studying aerial and
satellite images of their own region, students gain new skills and insights
into both local and global scale change.  Students also engage in hands-on
field measurements to "ground truth" or validate remotely sensed data.  GTS
students experience the interplay of chemistry, physics, ecology, geology,
sociology, economics, and many other disciplines, as they learn essential
skills such as collecting, graphing and interpreting data relevant to their
lives.<p>

Other educational efforts of AGCI include EarthPulse NEWS, an electronic
global change update for educators and EarthPulse Notes, a resource of
current article summaries on a wide variety of global change topics.<p>

<title>AGCI EarthPulse Notes</title>
</head>
<body>
<p align=center><img src=gifs/epnotes4.gif>
<h2>EarthPulse Notes - Searchable Summaries of Current Global Change Research
</h2>
EarthPulse Notes is an accessible database of article summaries on global
change topics. Unlike typical abstracts, these summaries are written in
language that can usually be understood by educated laypeople.  While we
make an attempt to simplify complex topics, occasionally the summaries may
be semi-technical, as the subject matter dictates.  Aspen Global Change
Institute (AGCI) staff review Science, Nature, Scientific American, New
Scientist, Eos, and occasionally other publications, looking for articles
relevant to global change.<p>

When an article is selected for entry into the EarthPulse Notes database,
we identify the: Title, Author, Periodical, Date, and Page #.  
We assign keywords and write summaries which attempt to communicate the
essence of the articles, as well as put them in context, when necessary.
These notes are based on the information contained in the particular
article, not on our opinions or the state of the science.  
We seek input on how to
improve EarthPulse Notes and make it more useful.  Send your 
comments, corrections, etc. to AGCI Research Associate Susan Joy Hassol at
<a href="mailto:shassol@agci.org">shassol@agci.org</a>.<hr>

<h3>1.  INTRODUCTION</h3></a>

The U.S. GLOBAL CHANGE RESEARCH PROGRAM (USGCRP) supports activities that 
provide information and policy-relevant understanding about the coupling of 
human activities and the environment across a broad range of issues,
perspectives, and interactions.<p>

<img align=bot alt=Stratospheric Aerosols src=/OCP/gifs/p11pinasm.gif>
<a href=ocpCh2.html>

<h3>2.  ADDRESSING CRITICAL GLOBAL CHANGE 
ISSUES THROUGH A RESEARCH FRAMEWORK</h3></a>

Global change research focuses on providing scientific insight into critical 
global change issues and policy choices facing the nation and the world
community.  Global change research to address these issues is organized into a
flexible multidisciplinary framework for coordinating science activities.<p>

<img align=bot alt=Hurricane src=/OCP/gifs/pg32hurrsm.gif>
<a href=ocpCh3.html>

<h3>3.  THE FY 1995 U.S. GLOBAL CHANGE RESEARCH PROGRAM</h3></a> 

Each global change issue is addressed through a process which strives to
document, understand, predict, and assess the science in a way that yields 
results that are relevant to the needs of decision makers.<p> 

<img align=bot alt=Internet Traffic src=/OCP/gifs/toc4.gif>
<a href=ocpCh4.html>

<h3>4.  LINKING TO THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY</h3></a> 

The USGCRP is founded on the premise that international cooperation and 
coordination is fundamental to addressing global environmental issues.  
USGCRP programs significantly contribute to worldwide global change research 
efforts.<p>


<img align=bot alt=VP Gore src=/OCP/gifs/tocvpsm.gif><a href=ocpCh5.html>

<h3>5.  GLOBAL CHANGE EDUCATION AND PUBLIC AWARENESS</h3></a> 

"The ultimate source of the strength of science will not be found in its 
impressive 
products or in its powerful instruments.  It will be found in the minds of 
scientists, and in the discourse which scientists have developed in order to 
describe what they know..."

<p align=center>July 2, 1991<p>

Dear Dr. Peck:<p>

Enclosed please find a copy of the final version of the "Data 
Management for Global Change Research Policy Statements."  This, 
along with its descriptive Annex, has been reviewed in depth and 
agreed to by each of the Federal Coordinating Council for Science, 
Engineering and Technology agencies through the Office of 
Management and Budget Legislative Referral process.  Suggested 
changes and comments that were submitted were considered and 
incorporated as appropriate.<p>

These may now be considered as U.S. policy statements and can be 
distributed accordingly. I would like to thank both you and your 
committee for active role you played in the initial development and 
review of these policy statements.<p>


Sincerely , <p>
Dr. Allan Bromley<br>
Director <p>

The overall purpose of these policy statements is to facilitate full and 
open access to quality data for

<h3><p align=center>DATA MANAGEMENT FOR GLOBAL CHANGE 
RESEARCH POLICY STATEMENTS </h3><p>

<p align=center><strong>July 1991</strong><p> 

<strong>The global Change Research Program requires an early and 
continuing commitment to the establishment, maintenance, 
validation, description, accessibility, and distribution of high-quality, 
long-term data sets.</strong><p>

Agencies involved in global change research noted that inadequate 
attention has often been given in the past to the creation and 
maintenance of quality long-term data sets.  Often this neglect was 
attributed to relatively lower priority given to long-term data 
management compared with initial data 
collection and analysis, with a concomitant lack of resources for the 
longer term effort.  The Interagency Working Group on Data 
Management for Global Change (IWGDMGC), which assisted in 
development of these policy statements, pointed out that the long-
term cost of maintaining large volumes of data can be significant and 
suggested that the required resources for this purpose must be 
committed at the start of data collection projects.<p> 

Furthermore, the proper preparation, validation, description, and 
care of data sets is critical to their use by the widest possible 
scientific community.  Those not involved in the initial data collection 
and processing must be able to easily determine how data have been 
collected, calibrated, validated, and otherwise transformed.  This may 
include the development of community-consensus algorithms and 
instructional efforts to ensure that potential users are aware of data 
availability.<p>

In some cases the responsibility for establishing and maintaining 
global change research data sets may be shared by agencies other 
than the originators of the data collection efforts.  Plans must be 
developed as part of the overall project to ensure that the 
investment in data collection is enhanced and expanded by adequate 
long-term data management practices.<p>

<strong>Full and open sharing of the full suite of global data sets for 
all global change researchers is a fundamental objective. </strong><p>

Federal agencies have different data distribution practices affecting 
global change research data.  The IWGDMGC proposes establishing a 
fundamental objective of full and open sharing of the full suite of 
global data sets for all global change researchers.  Data sets should be 
made available in a timely manner, but the definition of timeliness is 
left as a responsibility of the funding agencies involved.  As data are 
made available, global change researchers should have full and open 
access to them without restriction on research use.<p>

Global change researchers include those in academic, industry, 
government, and non-government sectors conducting both basic and 
applied research.<p>

The global change research data sets contain data of potential 
usefulness to a competitive U.S. economy for industrial applications 
and improved environmental management.  As required by 
appropriate public law, global change research agencies will develop 
plans for commercial access to the global change databases.<p> 

To accomplish this objective, data must be submitted to archives, and 
information about data sets must be created and made available as 
well.  The access policies for these archives should encourage the 
widest possible use of global change research data in meeting the 
objectives of the Global Change Research Program.<p>

<strong>Preservation of all data needed for long-term global change 
research is required.  For each and every global change data 
parameter, there should be at least one explicitly designated archive.  
Procedures and criteria for setting priorities for data acquisition, 
retention, and purging should be developed by participating 
agencies, both nationally and internationally.  A clearinghouse 
process should be established to prevent the purging and loss of 
important data sets.</strong><p>

The agency representatives noted that data sets representing some 
of the measurement parameters important to global change research 
do not presently have an archive "home".  Many of the biological 
parameter were cited as an example.<p>

This policy statement is meant to emphasize the responsibility of 
data collecting and producing agencies to identify suitably supported, 
long-term archives for all data sets important to global change 
research, make arrangements for those archives to acquire the data 
sets and related information, and make them available for open 
research use.  This principle is not meant to exclude distributed or 
multiple archives where appropriate for particular data sets, but to 
establish, at a minimum, one explicitly designated archive for each 
global change research parameter.<p>

In light of the high cost of long-term data maintenance, the 
IWGDMGC recommends the establishment of specific criteria and 
procedures for setting priorities for data acquisition, retention, and 
purging.  Some data may not be worth retaining on a long-term basis 
due to poor quality or other considerations such as cloud cover.  
However, a mechanism should be developed to ensure that the 
research community is consulted prior to decisions that result in data 
loss.  This includes the opportunity for a new organization to assume 
responsibility for maintaining data sets no longer given a high 
priority by the original archival agency.<p>

This consultative and clearinghouse process should include 
international as well as national organizations.  This might provide a 
reciprocal opportunity for US agencies to participate in decision 
making by non-US agencies that hold data of interest to the US.<p>

<strong>Data archives must include easily accessible information 
about the data holdings, including quality assessments, supporting 
ancillary information, and guidance and aids for locating and 
obtaining the data.</strong><p>

Archive data should include supporting information sufficient to 
permit its effective use by researchers not familiar with the original 
data collection project or the particular instrument making the 
measurements.  One limitation on using existing data sets by 
scientists involved in global change research is the difficulty 
encountered in identifying what data exist, how to access them, and 
what the real meaning is of the information contained in such data 
sets.   In the absence of  supporting documentation on instrument 
calibration, validation campaigns, and other ancillary information, 
full evaluation and application of existing data can be limited.  The 
repositories for global change research data sets must recognize their 
obligation to obtain or develop full accompanying information for all 
global change research data holdings and make the data and the 
supporting information easily available.  This requires a well-
conceived directory, catalog, and inquiry system.<p>

Peer review is one important mechanism for establishing and 
documenting data quality.  The IWGDMGC, however, notes that peer 
review may not always be necessary before data release.  What is 
essential is that data be well enough documented to ensure that 
users can understand what they are getting.<p> 

Work under way through the IWGDMGC to establish an interagency 
Global Change Master Directory (GCMD), and eventually a more 
comprehensive Global Change Data and Information System (GCDIS), 
should contribute to accomplishing this objective.  Through linking 
individual agency directories, users will be able to obtain information 
about existing data holdings anywhere in the interagency complex 
without having to separately contact each individual agency.  Once 
data of interest are located, the user can then proceed to obtain the 
data of interest from the archive where the data reside.<p>

<strong>National and international standards should be used to the 
greatest extent possible for media and for processing and 
communication of global data sets.</strong><p>

Use of standard media, and processing and communications protocols 
and procedures, aims at  making data accessible in a "vendor-
independent" environment.  The diverse user community has 
investigated in many different types of data analysis systems.  To 
the extent possible, through standards and protocols, users should be 
able to obtain, read, and process data without needing to design or 
purchase data-specific hardware, software, and systems.<p> 

Much progress has been made through national and international 
standards organizations, some of which address very broad areas of 
application and others which are more discipline or application 
specific.  For example, the International Standards Organization has 
an Open Systems Interface protocol with seven different layers of 
interconnection for communications systems.  This work is 
stimulated by many industries and potential users far beyond the 
global change research community.  The Committee on Earth 
Observations Satellites is an international organization comprising 
satellite operators and is developing standard formats for user 
products from specific types of sensors on remote sensing satellites.  
These efforts and others should be encouraged and supported by 
IWGDMGC agencies, and the resulting standards and protocols should 
be used in global change research projects.<p>

The critical objective of standards use is to ensure the widespread 
availability and use of data.  The emphasis is on ensuring that data 
sets are available to users in standard formats and through agreed 
communications protocols where applicable, not necessarily that the 
internal details of individual agency data handling and data 
archiving systems be common.<p>

<strong>Data should be provided at the lowest possible cost to global 
change researchers in the interest of full and open access to data.  
This cost should, as a first principle, be no more that the marginal 
cost of filling a specific user request.  Agencies should act to 
streamline administrative arrangements for exchanging data among 
researchers.</strong><p>

Agencies are governed by a wide variety of policies and practices in 
data charging and pricing.  For researchers (defined differently at 
different agencies) data are usually, but not always, provided either 
free of cost or at the marginal cost of reproduction and distribution. 
<p>

There was recognition by the IWGDMGC that charging the marginal 
cost of reproduction and distribution can be an effective tool for 
managing requests for large data sets without restricting access.  It 
also permits data distribution agencies to support widespread data 
use without adverse budget impacts.  For small data sets and those 
accessed infrequently, the administrative burden of marginal cost 
recovery may outweigh the benefits of charging such costs, and data 
may be more efficiently provided at no cost.  The essential principle 
is that research users should not be subject to commercial, profit-
based pricing for data sets to be used in support of publicly-
sponsored global change research.<p>

In addition to the charging practices, administrative arrangements 
should be streamlined to facilitate data access and exchange.  The 
Global Change Data and Information System development effort is 
beginning to address these issues.<p>

<strong>For those programs in which selected principal investigators 
have initial periods of exclusive data use, data should be made 
openly available as soon as they become widely useful.  In each case, 
the funding agency should explicitly define the duration of any 
exclusive use period.</strong><p>

The agreed objective of this data policy statement is to facilitate full 
and open access to quality data on a timely basis.  Although some 
data are made available as soon as the data are collected, some 
agencies provide initial periods of exclusive data use for selected 
investigators so that data evaluation and validation can be 
accomplished before general release.  Data are not always fully 
documented and useful during the initial data collection and analysis 
period, and the need for flexibility in data release was recognized by 
the IWGDMGC.<p>

Deciding when data became widely useful is the responsibility of the 
funding agency, which should explicitly define the period of 
restricted access, if any.  In the past, some Principal Investigators 
have retained data for indefinite periods, and this has inhibited their 
widespread use.  This practice should be eliminated through active 
consideration of the tradeoffs between widespread distribution of 
data sets and the need to assure data quality and validity.  The 
guiding principle is that as soon as data might be useful to other 
researchers the data should be released, along with documentation 
which can be used by the other researchers to judge data quality and 
potential usefulness.  In this way users can determine for themselves 
if they want to proceed with data of questionable quality or wait for 
additional developments.<p>

<strong>The U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) was 
conceived and developed to be policy-relevant, and hence, to support 
the needs of the United States and other nations to address 
significant uncertainties in knowledge concerning the natural and 
human-induced changes now occurring in the Earth's life-sustaining 
environmental envelope.</strong><p>

<center><h2>TITLE I--UNITED STATES *GLOBAL CHANGE* RESEARCH 
PROGRAM</h2></center>
 
<h3>SEC. 101.  FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.</h3>

(a) FINDINGS.--The Congress makes the following findings:

<ol><li>Industrial, agricultural, and other human activities,
coupled with an expanding world population, are contributing to
processes of *GLOBAL CHANGE* that may significantly alter the
Earth habitat within a few human generations.

<li>Such human-induced *CHANGES*, in conjunction with natural
fluctuations, may lead to significant global warming and thus
alter world climate patterns and increase *GLOBAL* sea levels.  Over
the next century, these consequences could adversely affect
world agricultural and marine production, coastal habitability,
biological diversity, human health, and *GLOBAL* economic and
social well-being.

<li>The release of chlorofluorocarbons and other stratospheric
ozone-depleting substances is rapidly reducing the ability of the
atmosphere to screen out harmful ultraviolet radiation, which
could adversely affect human health and ecological systems.

<li>Development of effective policies to abate, mitigate, and
cope with *GLOBAL CHANGE* will rely on greatly improved scientific
understanding of *GLOBAL* environmental processes and on our
ability to distinguish human-induced from natural *GLOBAL*
*CHANGE*.

<li>New developments in interdisciplinary Earth sciences,
*GLOBAL* observing systems, and computing technology make 
possible significant advances in the scientific understanding and
prediction of these *GLOBAL CHANGES* and their effects.

<li>Although significant Federal *GLOBAL CHANGE* research 
efforts are underway, an effective Federal research program will
require efficient interagency coordination, and coordination
with the research activities of State, private, and international
entities.</ol>

(b) PURPOSE.--The purpose of this title is to provide for development 
and coordination of a comprehensive and integrated United States 
research program which will assist the Nation and the world to 
understand, assess, predict, and respond to human-induced and 
natural processes of *GLOBAL CHANGE*.

<b>Who wrote these brochures?</b>

<p>

The primary authors of these brochures were Granger Morgan and Tom 
Smuts of Carnegie Mellon University. They had help from a number of 
colleagues including Hadi Dowlatabadi, Baruch Fischhoff, Lester Lave, and Ed 
Rubin.  Before the brochures were published they were reviewed by a number 
of experts and groups of laypeople who offered extensive advice on how the 
brochures could be improved.  While we followed much of this advice, the 
final product is the authors' responsibility. 

<p>

Granger Morgan is Head of the Department of Engineering and Public Policy 
at Carnegie Mellon University.  He holds a Ph.D. in applied physics and has 
worked for many years in environmental problems and risk analysis.  Tom 
Smuts holds a BA in philosophy and is particularly interested in ethical 
issues related to the environment.  Hadi Dowlatabadi holds a Ph.D. in physics 
and directs Carnegie Mellon's program of integrated assessment of climate 
change. Baruch Fischhoff holds a Ph.D. in psychology and is an expert in risk 
communication.  Lester Lave holds a Ph.D. in economics and has worked 
extensively on risk and environmental economics.  Ed Rubin holds a Ph.D. in 
mechanical engineering and is an expert on energy systems and their 
environmental impacts.

<p>

In preparing these brochures, the authors have worked hard to present a 
balanced and impartial treatment of this controversial topic.  A number of 
laypeople assisted us with evaluations.  In addition, we thank the following 
for their assistance and reviews: Peter Ashcroft, Cindy Atman, Jesse Ausubel, 
Matt Ball, Ann Bostrom, Edith Brown-Weiss, Stewart Cohen, Rob Coppock, 
Cliff Davidson, Michael Fischer, Paul Fischbeck, Ann Fisher, Shane Frederick, 
Willett Kempton, Millett Morgan, Eleanor Morgan, William Nierenberg, Ted 
Parson, Anand Patwardhan, George Perkins, Daniel Read, Sue Rowley, Tom 
Schelling, Stephen Schneider, Jhih-Shyang Shih, Mitchell Small, Richard 
Sonnenblick, Patti Steranchak, Billy Turner, Randy Urbano, and Robert 
White.  The drawings for the brochures were done by Frederick Carlson.  The 
work was supported by a grant from the Scaife Family Foundation.

<html><head><title>Global Warming and Climate Change - Part1:  What 
is climate change?</title></head>
<body>

<h2>PART 1: What is climate change?</h2>

Weather changes all the time. The average pattern of weather, called 
climate, usually stays pretty much the same for centuries if it is left 
to itself.   However, the earth is not being left alone.  People are 
taking actions that can change the earth and its climate in significant 
ways.  

<p>

<b>Carbon dioxide is the main culprit. </b>
<br>
<i>The single human activity that is most likely to have a large 
impact on the climate is the burning of "fossil fuels" such as coal, oil 
and gas</i>.  These fuels contain carbon.  Burning them makes carbon 
dioxide gas.   Since the early 1800s, when people began burning 
large amounts of coal and oil, the amount of carbon dioxide in the 
earth's atmosphere has increased by nearly 30%, and average global 
temperature appears to have risen between 1&#176; and 2&#176;F.
<p>
Carbon dioxide gas traps solar heat in the atmosphere, partly in the 
same way as glass traps solar heat in a sunroom or a greenhouse.  
For this reason, carbon dioxide is sometimes called a "greenhouse 
gas."  As more carbon dioxide is added to the atmosphere, solar heat 
has more trouble getting out.  The result is that, if everything else 
stayed unchanged, the average temperature of the atmosphere 
would increase.  
<p>
As people burn more fossil fuel for energy they add more carbon 
dioxide to the atmosphere.  If this goes on long enough, the average 
temperature of the atmosphere will almost certainly rise.  You can 
learn more about how this works, and uncertainties in scientific 
understanding, from <a href="booklet1.html">Details Booklet Part 
1</a>.  
<p>
If global warming occurs, not every day or every place will be 
warmer.  But on average most places will be warmer.  This will cause 
changes in the amount and pattern of rain and snow, in the length of 
growing seasons, in the frequency and severity of storms, and in sea 
level.  Farms, forests, and plants and animals in the natural 
environment, will all be affected.
<p>
<b>Other gases and dust also matter.</b>
<br>
Carbon dioxide is not the only gas released by human activities that 
can cause warming. Human emissions of methane and nitrous oxide 
together contribute almost half as much warming.
<p>
Not all things that enter the atmosphere cause warming.  Dust from 
volcanos, and from human activities, can reflect sunlight (like a 
window shade) and cool the earth.  
<p>
Coal and oil contain sulfur.  When they are burned the sulfur is 
transformed into fine particles in the atmosphere.  This sulfur 
pollution contributes to various environmental problems. Most 
scientists think that sulfur particles cool the planet. In the northern 
hemisphere, this cooling has partly canceled some of the warming 
that should have come from the growing concentrations of 
greenhouse gases.  However, since emissions of greenhouse gases 
continue to grow, and most countries are working hard to reduce 
emissions of sulfur air pollution, this canceling will probably not 
continue in the future. In that case, the average temperature may 
rise more rapidly.

<p><b>How much warming will there be?</b><br> 
If things go on pretty much as they have been, scientists' best guess 
is that the amount of warming will be about 2.5&#176;F 
(1.4&#176;C) by the year 2050.  The range of uncertainty stretches 
from almost no change to over 4&#176;F (2.3&#176;C).  

<a href="booklet1.html">Details Booklet Part 1</a> tells you more 
about how scientists reach these estimates, how much confidence can 
be placed in them, and what actions could increase or decrease the 
size of the change.

<p>

<b>The ozone hole is a different problem.</b><br>
Many people confuse the hole in the ozone layer with climate change.  
However, these two problems are not closely related.  The ozone 
layer protects the earth from harmful ultraviolet light that can cause 
skin cancer and damage plants and animals.  The main cause of the 
hole in the ozone layer is chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), gases that are 
used in refrigerators, air conditioners, and industrial applications.  
While CFCs alone cause warming, their ozone destruction can cause 
cooling.  So far these warming and cooling influences have 
approximately balanced.  Prior to 1978 CFCs were used as a 
propellant in aerosol spray cans, but that use has ended in the U.S.  
Under an international agreement most uses of CFCs are now being 
phased out to protect the ozone layer.

<b>Is climate change just speculation?</b><br>
No, as the drawings show, the earth's climate has been changing 
continually for millions of years.  Scientists know many of the things 
that cause these changes.  Some, like the amount of carbon dioxide in 
the atmosphere, are now being affected by human activities.  You can 
learn more from <a href="booklet1.html">Details Booklet Part 1</a>.

<b><i>weather</i></b> is the condition of the atmosphere at a

temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, cloudiness, and 
precipitation (rain, snow, etc.).  In most places, weather can change 
from hour-to-hour, day-to-day, and season-to-season.  <br>

<b><i>climate</i></b> is the average pattern of weather in a place.  For 
example, San Diego, California  has a "Mediterranean climate" which 
means temperatures are generally moderate year round, there is 
limited rainfall, and humidity is typically low.

climate changes what might happen?</title></head>
</body>


<h2>PART 2: If climate changes what might happen?</h2>

<a href="figures/mainpg5a.gif"><img src="figures/mainpg5asmall.gif"
align =right></a>

Obviously, climate has a big influence on plants and animals in the 
natural environment, on oceans, and on human activities, such as 
agriculture, water supplies, and heating and cooling.  The effects of 
climate change depend upon how much change there is, how fast it 
occurs, and how easily the world can adapt  to the new conditions.

<p>

<b>Impacts on people.</b><br>
The effects of climate change on people would  change a lot from 
place-to-place.  Economically developed societies, like those in North 
America, Europe and Japan, could use technology to reduce direct 
impacts. For example, they might develop new crop varieties, 
construct new water systems, and limit coastal development.  Some 
northern countries, such as Canada and Russia, might even benefit 
from longer growing seasons and lower heating bills if the climate 
becomes warmer.

<p>

In contrast, economically less developed societies, like those in parts 
of Africa, Asia, and South America depend much more directly on 
climate, and could be hit much harder by sudden or large changes.  
Places like coastal Bangladesh and low-lying islands, could be flooded 
by storms or rising sea level.  Droughts in Africa might become more 
serious.  Developing countries have far fewer resources for adapting 
to such changes.  They may not be able to afford large projects such 
as sea walls or aqueducts.  Peasant farmers may have difficulty 
adopting new agricultural practices.  The resulting social tensions 
could lead to more political unrest, large-scale migrations, and 
serious international problems such as terrorism and wars.

<p>

<b>Impacts on nature.</b><br>
When scientists look at the past they find the natural environment 
has often adapted to climate changes that have occurred gradually 
over many thousands of years.  However, they also find instances in 
which changes have  occurred rapidly, brought about by events such 
as sudden shifts in ocean currents.  These rapid changes have often 
caused widespread species extinctions and the collapse of natural 
ecosystems. 

<p>

One way to understand the importance of the speed of change is to 
think about native plants that grow in North America.  Global 
warming could mean that those currently growing in Georgia might 
be better suited to New England.  If climate changes gradually, many 
plants may be able to "migrate"  by spreading seeds into new areas 
where they can now grow.  But if climate changes rapidly, many 
plants may not be able to spread their seeds far enough to reach the 
new area.  If they die out, so may many of the animals that depend 
upon them. 

<p>

<p>

<b>Why do scientist disagree about possible impacts of climate 
change?</b><br>
Scientists disagree about whether climate change will be a serious 
problem in the next 50 to 100 years.  The main reason for this 
disagreement is that nobody knows for sure whether climate changes 
caused by human actions will be large enough and fast enough to 
cause serious damage.  Many scientists believe that they may be.  
Others argue that if changes occur, the problems they cause will be 
minor compared with problems caused by today's storms and

<b>Will more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere cause trees and other 
plants to grow more?</b><br>

It might.  Plants need carbon dioxide to grow.  Using sunlight and 
photosynthesis, plants change carbon dioxide and water into food.  If 
plants have all the nutrients they need, then giving them more 
carbon dioxide will cause many to grow more.  Commercial growers 
often do this in greenhouses.  However, plants growing in natural 
environments often do not have all the nutrients they need, and may 
not grow faster, even if there is more carbon dioxide.  If some plants 
on land and in the oceans are naturally able to take more carbon 
dioxide out of the atmosphere, they will grow faster.  This would 
change the mix of plants, but might also slow global warming.  You

<b>Sea level rise and coastal storms.</b><br>
Most of the rise in sea level would occur because water expands 
when it is heated.  An increase in the earth's  average temperature of 
about 3.5&#176;F, which is probably too little to melt most polar ice, 
would result in an increase in sea level of between 8 and 30 inches. 

<a href="figures/mainpg5b.gif"><img src="figures/mainpg5bsmall.gif" 
align=left></a> 

This is too little to flood most coastal cities, but could damage some 
coastal plants and animals, beaches, and water supplies.  While 
flooding under normal weather conditions might be small, higher sea 
level would mean that hurricanes and similar large storms could do 
more damage than in the past.  Some experts argue that such storms 
would become more frequent and intense in a warmer climate.  This 
could have large impacts.  Other experts doubt such changes will 
occur.

can be done about climate change?</title></head>
<body>


<h2>PART 3: What can be done about climate change?</h2>

<p>

If carbon dioxide and other gases released by human activities cause 
climate change, what can people do about it?  Three basic strategies 
are available, abatement, adaptation, and geo-engineering.

<p>

<b>Abatement:</b>  To <i>abate</i> means to slow or stop.  Abatement 
strategies aim to reduce the emissions of carbon dioxide and other 
gases that can cause climate change.  They include improving energy 
efficiency, so that we burn less fuel, and using sources of energy that 
emit no greenhouse gases, such as solar or nuclear power.

<p>

<b>Adaptation:</b>  Under this strategy people find ways to live 
successfully with the changed climate.  For example, land use may 
change.  Aqueducts can be built to bring water into newly dry areas. 
Coastal populations can be protected from rising sea level by building 
dikes and sea walls, by relocating populations inland, and by 
protecting fresh-water supplies from salt-water intrusion.

<p>

<b>Geo-Engineering:</b>  <i>Geo</i> means earth, so geo-engineering 
means to engineer the earth's atmosphere and oceans to reduce the 
amount of climate change.  For example, the amount of sunlight that 
strikes the earth might be reduced by putting more small particles 
into the high atmosphere.  The idea is to off-set the warming effect 
of more greenhouse gas by reflecting more sunlight back into space.  
Many people oppose geo-engineering because they think there might 
be unintended side effects.  However, if rapid and severe climate 
change occurs, some are likely to press for geo-engineering because 
it may be relatively inexpensive.

<p>

Choosing the appropriate combination of strategies is difficult.  Each 
will cost money, pose problems, and offer benefits.  It is unlikely that 
any single strategy can do the job.  Uncertainty is added because 
scientists do not yet know enough about the costs, risks, and benefits.  
It is important for researchers to study the options quickly and 
carefully so that people can make informed choices.  You can learn 
more about what is already known by reading <a 
href="booklet3.html">Details Booklet Part 3</a> in the back of this 
section.

<h4>Things that an individual can do to reduce the chance of climate 
change:</h4>
<p>
<b>Most effective actions.</b><br>
Since most of our energy comes from oil, coal and gas, actions that 
reduce energy use will reduce the emissions of carbon dioxide.  For 
example:<br>
<ul>
<li>	When you buy a car, choose one that gets good mileage.
<li>	Insulate and weatherize your home or apartment.
<li>	Carpool or drive less.
<li>	Replace old, worn-out appliances (e.g., refrigerators, heat 
pumps) with the most efficient new models.
If the average U.S. citizen undertakes all of these actions, they can 
reduce their carbon dioxide emissions by about 25%, which equals 
about 5 tons of carbon dioxide per year.
</ul>

<b>Less effective, but helpful, actions.</b>
<ul>
<li>	Turn off lights and appliances when not needed.
<li>	Plant trees.
<li>	Set the thermostat lower in winter and higher in summer.
<li>Recycle. 
</ul>

If the average citizen undertakes all of these actions, they can reduce 
their carbon dioxide emissions by about 3%, which equals just over 
half a ton of carbon dioxide per year.
<p>

<b><i>Ineffective</i> actions.</b><br>
Using aerosol spray cans does not cause climate change.  In the U.S., 
they no longer contain CFCs.
<p>

<b>Individual actions that influence others.</b>
Become informed and help your family and friends to learn about 
climate change. Actively support the government policies you decide 
are most appropriate. <p>

<p>

<tr>
<td>

<b>What might nations do?</b>
<p>

<i>Improve energy efficiency:</i>  More efficient cars, appliances, and 
industrial systems use less energy, which means that less fuel is 
burned and less carbon dioxide is emitted.  Substantial energy 
efficiency improvements can be obtained by replacing individual 
devices.  In the longer run, even larger savings may be possible 
through structural changes, such as being able to work closer to 
home or redesigning the way houses and cities are built.
<p>
<i>Develop and use energy sources that emit little or no carbon 
dioxide:</i>  
Hydro power, solar power and windmills, as well as other "renewable 
energy" sources, emit no carbon dioxide.  Neither does nuclear power.  
Burning natural gas emits less carbon dioxide than burning coal or 
oil.  In the future, hydrogen, which emits no carbon dioxide when it 
is burned, may become a practical fuel.  Ways of capturing and 
storing carbon dioxide might also be developed.
<p>
<i>Improve forest and agricultural management practices:</i>  Trees 
remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store it in wood.  
Methane produced by some agricultural activities, such as raising 
cattle and rice farming, can be reduced. 
<p>
<i>Reduce the impacts of climate change:</i>  New varieties of crops 
can be developed to grow in changed climates.  Aqueducts can carry 
water to regions affected by drought. Coastal settlements and water 
supplies can be protected from rising sea level with dikes and sea 
walls.  Coastal ecosystems, especially wetlands, are harder to protect.    
<p>

<b>How might government help do these things?</b>

<p>

<i>Government regulation:</i> Government can require desired 
behaviors (e.g., force auto companies to build more efficient cars).  
An advantage of regulation is that it specifies the desired outcomes 
and can force action.  However, regulation can be inflexible and 
discourage innovation. 

<p>

<i>Prices and markets:</i>  Higher prices for fossil fuels encourage 
people to save energy by promoting energy efficient devices and 
behavior (e.g., expensive gas prompts companies to make and people 
to buy more fuel efficient cars).  Government subsidies and taxes can 
also influence behavior.  An advantage of using prices is that they 
present a constant incentive to innovate.  However, using prices can 
have undesirable side effects, such as imposing a relatively larger 
burden on the poor.

<p> 

<i>Information and education:</i>  People often do not know how to 
improve efficiency or reduce emissions.  Government can provide 
them with the information they need to make better choices. 

<p>

<i>Research and development:</i>  Government and industry can 
support research to demonstrate and improve existing technology, 
and to develop new technologies that use less energy or emit no 
carbon dioxide (e.g., refrigerators that use less electricity, cheap 
practical solar water heaters, and inexpensive solar/hydrogen 
technology).
</td></tr></table>

<p>



<b>What about other countries?</b><br>

The atmosphere covers the entire globe and climate affects everyone.  
If abatement strategies are to be effective they will require 
international cooperation.  Until now, developed countries have been 
the major sources of emissions.  In the future, large developing 
countries, such as China, will be an increasingly important source of 
emissions.  These countries argue that if the world must reduce 
emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, the U.S., 
Europe, and Japan should reduce the most.  For years, they argue, 
these developed countries have been the largest emitters and they 
have already enjoyed the associated benefits of economic 
development.  While this is true, developing countries could also help 
by doing more to control population growth.

change</title></head>

<h3>Common misconceptions about climate change:</h3>

<b>Misconception:</b> <i>Climate change and the loss of the ozone 
layer are pretty much the same thing.</i>
<br>
<b>Fact:</b>  <i>Climate change and the loss of the ozone layer are two 
different problems that are not very closely connected.</i>

<blockquote>The largest contributor to global warming is carbon 
dioxide gas released when coal, oil, and natural gas are burned.  CFCs, 
gases which cause stratospheric ozone depletion, play only a minor 
role in climate change.  The depletion of the stratospheric ozone 
layer, including the ozone hole, is a serious environmental problem 
because it causes an increase in ultraviolet radiation which can harm 
people, animals, and plants. This is a different problem from the 
problem of climate change.</blockquote>
<p>

<b>Misconception:</b>  <i>Aerosol spray cans are a major contributor 
to climate change.</i>
<br>
<b>Fact:</b> <i> Using aerosol spray cans has almost no effect on 
climate change.</i>

<blockquote>In the past, aerosol spray cans contained CFCs which 
contributed to the depletion of the ozone layer (not the same as 
global warming).  Under U.S. law, aerosol spray cans no longer 
contain CFCs.</blockquote>


<b>Misconception:</b>  <i>General pollution and toxic chemicals are 
major contributors to climate change.</i>
<br>
<b>Fact:</b>  <i>Most forms of pollution play little or no role in climate 
change. The invisible carbon dioxide released when coal, oil, and gas 
are burned is the single most important contributor to climate 
change.</i>

<blockquote>The burning of fossil fuels, such as coal and oil, to 
produce energy for 
electricity, heat and transportation is the primary source of carbon 
dioxide, which is the most important contributor to global warming. 
Carbon dioxide does not contribute to general air 
pollution.</blockquote>
<p>

<b>Misconception:</b> <i> The space program is a major contributor to 
climate change because it punches holes in the atmosphere.</i>
<br>
<b>Fact:</b> <i> The space program has almost no effect on climate 
change.  The local changes rockets make in the atmosphere soon 
disappear.</i>

<blockquote>Gases released by rocket exhaust have no real impact on 
global warming.  They have only a small, largely short-term, local 
effect on the different problem of stratospheric ozone 
depletion.</blockquote>
<p>

<b>Misconception:</b><i>  Using nuclear power causes climate 
change.</i>
<br>
<b>Fact:</b> <i> Nuclear power does not contribute to climate change. 
If nuclear power is used instead of coal or oil, it will reduce 
emissions of carbon dioxide.  "Renewable energy" sources, such as 
solar power, can also reduce carbon dioxide emissions.</i>

<blockquote>While nuclear power plants present a variety of other 
environmental problems, they do not emit gases which contribute to 
global warming.</blockquote>

<h2>More on "What can be done about climate change?"</h2>

<b>Who is the "decision maker" on the issue of climate change?</b>

<p>

There is no single decision maker who is responsible for either the 
choices that are likely to lead to climate change, or for the actions 
that people might take to respond to change.  At the international 
level many countries add greenhouse gases to the atmosphere.  
Today's top emitters of carbon dioxide are:

Analysis Center, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, 1990.</td></tr>

</table>

<p>
In the future, emissions from a number of developing countries such 
as China and India are likely to rise dramatically as these countries 
follow the example set by the developed countries and burn large 
amounts of coal and oil in order to raise their people's standards of 
living. The effect will be further amplified if the population in these 
countries continues to grow.

<p>

Any serious effort to control the future emissions of carbon dioxide 
and other greenhouse gases will require international cooperation.  

<p>

In order to protect the ozone layer, an agreement to phase out most 
uses of CFCs was reached in 1987.  In many ways, this agreement 
was much easier than the kinds of agreements that will be needed to 
control carbon dioxide emissions to slow climate change.  CFCs play a 
key role in only a few parts of the economy. It has been relatively 
easy to develop affordable substitutes.  The "world environment 
summit" held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in 1992 reached a much looser 
agreement on carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.  Nations 
pledged to work to reduce their emissions.  While the wording is 
vague, and there are no legally binding obligations, there is now an 
international framework for monitoring and reviewing progress 
towards reducing emissions.

<p>

The burning of coal and oil, which is the principle source of carbon 
dioxide, underlies almost all economic activities.  So far, abundant 
low cost alternative sources of energy have not been identified.  
Developed countries could probably afford to reduce their energy 
consumption, and invest in more energy efficient technologies.  
Without help in such forms as economic assistance and technology 
transfer, developing countries may find the cost of such changes 
unacceptable.  After all, in the name of some very general long term 
"common good" they are being asked to give up on some of the very 
real short-term economic benefits that their citizens will experience 
through development.

<p>

For this reason, many developing countries argue that the developed 
countries should take the lead and contribute the most to reducing 
emissions of greenhouse gases.

<p>

The same situation of "many decision makers" applies on the 
response side of the climate problem.  Residents and regional 
managers in areas such as the low lying coastal resort of Hilton Head, 
South Carolina are likely to have very different views about climate 
change from the residents and regional managers of a city such as 
Fairbanks, Alaska.  Wealthy Sierra Club members in Boulder, 
Colorado are likely to have very different views from the 
impoverished members of a rural economic development cooperative 
in central China as they struggle to build a stronger economy.

<p>

In short, the problem of climate change is not a single problem.  It is 
a multitude of problems that will be faced by many different groups 
with different needs and different concerns.  At the end of this 
details booklet we will elaborate on these issues.  First, however, we 
need to explore some of the specific things that might be done.

<img src="figures/pt3pg2trans.gif" align=left>
<br clear=all>


<p>

<b>What impact might specific policy options have? How much might 
they 
cost?</b>

<p>


As we explained in <a href="part3.html">Part 3</a> of the main 
brochure, there are three broad policy options for dealing with the 
climate problem.  These are: abatement, adaptation, and geo-
engineering.  The next five pages explore these options in somewhat 
more detail and consider how effective they may be and how much 
they may cost.  Of course, a number of other considerations will play 
an important role in determining the options a country, state or 
business chooses, including whether the policies are acceptable to the 
public, whether they are fair, and whether they are more important 
than other goals society might have.  These considerations can be 
very important, but they are basically a matter of a choice among 
different values.  There is no single right answer to such choices.  
Economists and engineers are still somewhat uncertain about how 
effective some policies might be and what they would cost, but rough 
estimates are possible.  In the discussion that follows, we will focus 
only on how much each option can reduce U.S. carbon dioxide 
emissions and how much it will cost.  We  leave it to you to consider 
the other value choices each option involves.    

<p>

<b>Abatement options</b> are strategies that reduce emissions.  We 
will consider three kinds, improved energy efficiency, use of cleaner 
energy sources, and changes in agriculture and forestry.

<p>

<b><i>Improving energy efficiency</i></b> will reduce emissions of 
carbon dioxide, the most significant greenhouse gas.  If it is pursued 
wisely, it should also improve economic performance.  Here are 
examples of three strategies that the U.S. might pursue to improve its 
energy efficiency:

<blockquote>

<i>Reduce energy use in buildings.</i> About 1/3 of all the energy 
used in the U.S., and 2/3 of all the electricity, goes into buildings.  
Most goes to heating, cooling and lighting.  Researchers estimate that 
with improved insulation, glazing, weather-stripping, furnaces and 
air conditioners, and lighting in residential and commercial buildings, 
U.S. carbon dioxide emissions could be reduced by about 360 million 
tons per year, about 5% of total U.S. emissions.  
They also estimate that such changes would lead to reduced energy 
use, and actually save money, between $25 and $75 per ton of 
carbon dioxide saved.

<p>

<i>Improve fuel efficiency of new cars. </i> Currently the average 
mileage obtained by new cars in the U.S. is 27.5 mpg.  If this were 
raised to 32.5 mpg, and held there, over time, U.S. emissions would 
decline by about 250 million tons per year, about 4% of U.S. 
emissions.  Estimates of the costs of such a program range from a 
savings of $76 per ton of carbon dioxide removed to a cost of $16 
per ton of carbon dioxide.  The savings result if the reduced fuel cost 
outweighs other cost increases.

<p>

<i>Make appliances more efficient. </i> Currently available technology 
allows refrigerators, dishwashers, water heaters and other home 
appliances to be substantially more efficient than they are.  If this 
technology were used in place of older, less efficient technology, the 
U.S. could reduce carbon dioxide emissions by about 75 million tons 
per year (1.3% of U.S. emissions) while at the same time saving $35 
to $44 per ton.
</blockquote>

<b>What is energy efficiency?</b>

<img src="figures/pt3pg4trans.gif" align=right>
<p>


When we drive a car chemical energy stored in gasoline is converted 
into mechanical energy and used to create motion.  When we use an 
electric stove, a power plant first converts chemical energy stored in 
coal to electrical energy which is carried through the electrical 
system.  Then the stove converts it to heat energy.  The proportion of 
the original energy which ends up being used for the final purpose 
(motion, cooking) measures the <i>energy efficiency</i>.  Nature sets 
some basic limits on how efficiently energy can be used, but in 
most cases our products and manufacturing processes are still a long 
way from operating at this theoretical limit.

<p>

<b>Why does energy efficiency matter?</b>

<p>

If we can make things like cars and appliances do their job just as 
well while using less energy, then we do not need to burn as much 
coal and oil.  Burning fossil fuels like coal and oil produces carbon 
dioxide.  Increasing the energy efficiency in transportation, homes, 
offices, and factories is the best way we have to reduce carbon 
dioxide emissions without lowering our standard of living.

<img src="figures/pt3pg5trans.gif">
</td></tr></table>

<p>

<b><i>Replacing coal, oil and gasoline with cleaner energy sources and 
technologies</i></b> would reduce carbon dioxide emissions and 
improve efficiency.  The main issue for this strategy is whether there 
are enough abundant, low cost alternatives to coal, oil, and gasoline.

<p>

<blockquote>
<i>Instead of gasoline, use ethanol, hydrogen or electricity in cars and 
trucks.</i>  Technology currently exists to allow cars to run on these 
and other alternative fuels.  Ethanol is a kind of alcohol made from 
corn.  If ethanol were made from sustainable agriculture, or if 
hydrogen or electricity were generated by renewable means, 
converting all vehicles would eventually reduce carbon dioxide 
emissions by over 1000 million tons per year (17% of U.S. emissions).  
However, the technology for some alternative fuel options (i.e., 
electric and hydrogen powered cars) is presently too expensive 
to be widely adopted by consumers, and researchers do not know 
whether farmers can produce enough corn for ethanol to replace 
gasoline.  Such changes would cost between $50 and $177 per ton of 
carbon dioxide saved.

<p>

<i>Switch 10% of building electricity use from electric resistance heat 
to natural gas heating.</i>  Natural gas, whether it is used to warm 
rooms or heat water, is more efficient than electric heat.  As a result, 
it is also cheaper and releases far less carbon dioxide than the coal 
burned to make electricity.  By switching only 10% of commercial 
and residential electricity use to natural gas heating systems, U.S. 
carbon dioxide emissions could be reduced by about 75 million tons 
per year (1.3% of U.S. emissions) at an estimated savings of $90 per 
ton.


<p>


<i>Replace all existing coal and oil fired electric power plants with 
new high efficiency plants that use natural gas.</i>  The combustion 
of natural gas emits less carbon dioxide than the combustion of coal.  
If all existing coal and oil power plants were replaced by modern 
high efficiency natural gas systems, the U.S. would reduce its 
greenhouse gas emissions about 1000 million tons per year (17% of 
U.S. emissions).  Some scientists doubt that there is enough natural 
gas to make this possible.  The cost of such a plan, though uncertain, 
is estimated between $0 and $177 per ton of carbon dioxide.

<p>

<i>Replace half of the existing oil and coal fired power plants with 
solar power plants.</i>   The amount of solar energy reaching the 
earth's surface each year is enormous, thousands of times greater 
than worldwide annual fossil fuel use.  While costs are still high, 
technology currently exists to use this solar energy to provide elec-
tricity, light, heat, and steam for buildings and industry.  If it were 
used wherever possible, it could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 
about 1000 million tons per year (17% of U.S. emissions).  However, 
substantial progress is necessary before solar technology is 
affordable as a basic source of electricity.  The cost of reducing 
emissions through this program is estimated to be between $76 to 
$177 per ton of carbon dioxide.

<p>

<i>Where possible, replace all fossil fuel plants with nuclear power 
plants.</i>  Nuclear power currently provides about 7% of electricity 
in the U.S., but concerns over the safety, cost, and environmental 
impacts of nuclear energy have halted development.  Improvements 
in nuclear power might allow it to be considered as an option for 
reducing carbon dioxide emissions.  If nuclear power were widely 
adopted in the  U.S., the reduction in carbon dioxide emissions could 
reach as high as 1500 million tons per year (25% of U.S. emissions). 
Estimates of the cost of this policy range from $0 to $51 per ton of 
carbon dioxide saved.

</blockquote>
<p>

<b><i>Agriculture, deforestation and other human activities</i></b> 
are also responsible for significant quantities of greenhouse gas 
emissions.  Reductions can be achieved through improved waste 
management, altered use and formulation of fertilizers, and changes 
in land use. 

<p>

<blockquote>

<i>Establish an international "forestry fund" to prevent 
deforestation.</i>  Deforestation in the developing world accounts for 
over 20% of the man-made greenhouse effect.  The U.S. can play a 
role in policies to limit deforestation.  Because deforestation is due 
largely to population and economic pressures, tropical rain forests 
will be preserved only if they have more value standing than cut 
down.  One idea is an international "forestry fund," an endowment, 
funded by the developed world, which places $80 per acre ($200 per 
hectare) of protected forest into an investment account.  The interest 
from the account is given to people living near or in the protected 
forests, to help them develop sustainable forestry practices, and to 
support them during the transition away from "slash and burn" 
agriculture.  Residents would receive the interest as long as they 
practiced sustainable forestry.  Fully implemented, the program 
could reduce global carbon dioxide emissions by 7000 million tons 
annually, at a cost of about $0.40 per ton of carbon dioxide saved.

<p>

<i>Reduce methane emissions by improving waste management 
practices and changing agricultural techniques.</i>  Though it 
accounts for only a small share of the man-made greenhouse effect, 
methane is a powerful greenhouse gas.  Emissions come from rice 
paddies, cows and other "ruminant" animals, and from decomposing 
waste. Emissions can be reduced by cultivating fast-growing rice or 
high-density paddies, by placing ruminant animals on diets that 
reduce the amount of methane they emit as a byproduct of digestion, 
and by handling plant and animal wastes in a manner that reduces 
the amount of methane produced as they decompose.  Such actions 
could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by over 200 million tons of 
carbon dioxide equivalent per year, at a cost of $0 to $5 per ton.

<b>Adaptation options</b> are actions taken to minimize the global 
environment's impact on humans.  
<p>
<blockquote>

<i>Relocation of people, agriculture and industry</i> is one way to 
adapt to 
the 
changes in temperature, sea level and water distribution that might 
result 
from climate change.  For example, state and federal governments 
often 
subsidize the rebuilding of homes and replenishment of beaches in 
areas that 
have experienced severe storms or floods.  If sea level rise makes 
devastating 
storms and floods more common in certain regions, government 
could use 
these subsidies to help people relocate to less vulnerable areas, 
instead of 
rebuilding in the same spot.  Banks and insurance companies may 
begin to 
influence building choices if they believe climate change may affect 
the 
properties they finance or insure.  In the U.S. people migrate all the 
time for a 
variety of reasons.  For this reason, it is difficult to say which portion 
of the 
costs of relocation should be assigned to climate change.

<p>

<i>Improving irrigation and developing new crop strains</i> would 
allow 
agriculture to adapt to moderate climate change.  The efficiency of 
irrigation 
systems improved 35% between 1950 and 1980, and some 
researchers believe 
efficiency can be improved substantially more by making some 
relatively 
cheap changes to existing technology.  As for crops, state, federal, and 
private 
labs today cultivate and test thousands of strains of agricultural 
plants.  There 
are, for example, about 450 different strains of corn in commercial 
use.  The 
costs of adapting to modest climate change would probably be a few 
percent or 
less of the overall costs of agriculture.  Maintaining funding for 
research on 
crop varieties is a good way to prepare for the possible impacts of 
global 
warming on agriculture.  

<p>

<i>Migration corridors for plants and animals in the natural 
environment</i> 
might help the re-establishment of ecosystems in new locations as a 
response 
to climate change.  As discussed in <a href="booklet2.html">Details 
Booklet Part 2</a>, gradual change would allow many natural 
ecosystems to migrate with the climate.  However, natural migration 
of ecosystems can be blocked by human development, such as cities, 
highways, and farms.  One way to help these ecosystems adapt to 
global warming might be to provide them with "corridors" of 
undeveloped land through which ecosystems can migrate as 
necessary.  The costs are uncertain partly because such corridors 
might have other "open space" benefits and partly because it is 
unclear how many would be needed to be effective.  
</blockquote>

<p>


<b>Geo-engineering options</b> are potentially powerful, but as yet 
untested, ways either to stop the accumulation of carbon dioxide in 
the atmosphere, or to counteract its effects on our climate.  

<p>

<blockquote>
<i>Global reforestation programs</i> could be designed to plant large 
numbers of 
trees to extract carbon dioxide and store it.  A global reforestation 
program 
could remove 250 million tons of carbon dioxide per year (4% of U.S. 
emissions) at a cost of $3 to $10 per ton.
</blockquote>

Almost everyone thinks planting trees is a good idea.  However, 
because there may be unintended side effects, many people are 
strongly opposed to other forms of geo-engineering.  At the same 
time, because they may be cheap, and can be done "once we're in 
trouble," there will probably be some strong supporters of other geo-
engineering strategies if serious warming occurs.
<p>

<blockquote>
<i>Adding iron to fertilize the ocean</i> may cause phytoplankton in 
the top layers of the ocean to absorb more carbon dioxide.  While not 
all scientists agree that this strategy is safe, and recent tests in the 
ocean suggest it might not work, the absorption potential is very 
large, from 600 million to as high as 3000 million tons of carbon 
dioxide per year (10% to 50% of U.S. emissions).  If it turns out to be 
a safe, viable option, it would probably cost somewhere between 10 
and $15 dollars per ton of carbon dioxide removed. 

<p>

<i>Screen out sunlight to counteract the effects of increased 
concentrations of greenhouse gases.</i>   Either large thin screens in 
low orbit or small particles of dust placed very high in the 
atmosphere could be used to reduce the amount of sunlight striking 
the earth.  Thus, as the earth's atmosphere trapped more heat, less 
heat energy would be put into the earth's system by the sun, 
maintaining basically the same temperature.  While untested, this 
strategy has the potential to counteract the warming effect of large 
amounts of carbon dioxide, at a cost of between 3 and $2.5 dollars 
per ton of carbon dioxide.

</blockquote>
<p>

<b>How can people decide for themselves what should be done about 
climate change?</b> 

<p>

The climate problem affects everyone, and everyone has a stake in 
deciding what should be done.  It is for you to decide what actions 
you should take as an individual (in your home, your car, and so 
forth).  Equally important, as a citizen you must decide which policies 
to support or oppose.  It may be tempting to decide that the climate 
problem is just too complicated to deal with.  Without telling you 
what to choose, we can offer some advice on how to organize the 
choices and make decisions.

<p>

We will simplify the problem by reducing it to a choice between 
three broad policy alternatives:
<p>

<blockquote>

POLICY 1:  <i>no abatement; </i>
<p>
POLICY 2:  <i>moderate abatement;</i>
<p>
POLICY 3:  <i>stringent abatement.</i>

</blockquote>
<p>

First, we will discuss the goal of each of these policies.  Then we will 
suggest some of the factors that might be important to you in making 
a choice.  Finally, we will give examples of the sorts of people who 
might choose each one.

<p>

As its name suggests, the <i>no abatement</i> policy takes no 
immediate action on climate change or greenhouse gas emissions.  
Proponents of this policy may view the science of global warming as 
too uncertain to justify action, may believe that the impacts of global 
warming will be very small, or may think that abatement actions are 
too expensive.

<p>

The goal of <i>moderate abatement</i> is to slow greenhouse gas 
emissions and give society more time to solve the problem.  One 
version of this policy would commit every economically developed 
nation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 20% below 1988 levels 
per dollar of gross domestic product (GDP) by the year 2000.  
Because this emissions limit is stated in terms of GDP, total emissions 
could still grow as the population or economy expands.  Moderate 
abatement  would not prevent climate change.  But, if all the world 
did it, it would reduce the impacts of climate change by about 25% 
by the middle of the next century.  

<p>

<i>Stringent abatement</i> is the most ambitious climate change 
policy.  By reducing total greenhouse gas emissions worldwide to 60% 
below 1988 levels and holding them there permanently, it aims to 
prevent climate change altogether.  Unlike moderate abatement, 
which allows emissions to rise as the economy grows, moderate 
abatement does not allow any emissions growth beyond 60% below 
1988 levels.  Thus, in order for the world economy to grow and for 
living standards to rise in the developing world, ever more 
innovative ways to prevent emissions from growing would have to 
be found. If all the world did it, stringent abatement would prevent 
global climate change.

<p>

Suppose you or a friend wants to decide which of these three policies 
to support.  Your decision should depend on at least two 
considerations:
  

<p>
<ol>
<li><i>What do you think the impacts of climate change are likely to 
be?</i>  
That is, how much do you think climate will change, and what impact 
do you believe that change will have on the things you care about?  
Again to make things simple, assume that there are only three 
possible beliefs about the impacts of climate change: it can be <i>not 
bad, moderately bad</i>, or <i>very bad</i>.  Of course your judgment 
not only depends on what you believe about climate change, but also 
on what you value.  For example, two people might agree that 
climate change will destroy many of the world's most sensitive 
ecosystems, but disagree about how much they value those 
ecosystems.  These people would rate the impact of climate change 
differently.  The person who values them highly will probably rate 
the impacts of climate change as <i>moderately bad</i> or <i>very 
bad</i>. The other person, who is perhaps mainly concerned with the 
economic impacts of climate change and doesn't think sensitive 
ecosystems are of great importance, might rate the impact of climate 
change as not bad. In short, how you rate the impacts of climate 
change depends on what you value.

<p>

<li><i>How much do you think abatement will cost?</i>  Again, for the 
sake of simplicity assume that there are only three possible beliefs 
about the cost of abatement:  <i>low, medium</i>, or <i>high</i>.  
Unlike the case above, where we were dealing with values which are 
very difficult, if not impossible, to measure in dollars, here we are 
dealing with costs that can be quantified.  By <i>low cost</i> we mean 
that moderate abatement can be achieved in the U.S. at a net 
<i>savings</i> of $50 billion per year (because the energy 
conservation involved would save money), while stringent 
abatement would cost about $250 billion per year (or about $1000 
per person per year).  By <i>medium cost</i> we mean that moderate 
abatement will cost nothing in the long-term, while stringent 
abatement will cost about $500 billion per year.  By <i>high cost</i> 
we mean that moderate abatement will cost about $60 billion per 
year, while stringent abatement would cost as much as $3 trillion per 
year (about 60% of GDP).

</ol>

By combining your beliefs about these two considerations, you or a 
friend can come to a general conclusion about which abatement 
strategy to support.


<p>

To show how this might work, consider three friends named Ann, 
Sue, and Pat.  Like you, each of these imaginary citizens must 
consider the two questions outlined above:  (1) "What do you think 
the impacts of climate change are likely to be?" and (2) "How much 
do you think abatement measures will cost?"  The two pages that 
follow give a summary of their positions.

<p>
<br>

ANN <img src="figures/pt3pg10annt.gif"  align=bottom >

<br>
<br>

<b>Beliefs:</b> She thinks climate change is a possibility, but isn't 
convinced it will occur.  If climate change does occur, she believes it 
may damage the environment to some extent, but have only minor 
effects on the economy.

<p>

<b>Values:</b> She cares about the environment, but cares more 
about the economy and impacts on people's incomes and jobs.

<p>

<b>How Ann reasons:</b>  Using the terms discussed above, Ann 
concludes that the impacts of climate change will be <i>not bad</i>.  
She acknowledges that there may be some environmental impact, 
but is concerned only if the environmental impact is really serious.  
It's the economy she cares about, and she thinks that won't suffer 
much.  That's why she rates the impacts of climate change <i>not 
bad</i>.

<p>

As a result, the policy she chooses will depend on how she assesses 
their costs.  If she expects abatement costs to be <i>low</i> or 
<i>medium</i>, she will support moderate abatement because this 
will either result in a net savings or have no cost.

<p>

On the other hand, if she expects abatement costs to be <i>high</i>, 
she will support the "no abatement" policy at least until 
environmental harm is shown to be important.  This is because she 
cares more about the economy than the environment and does not 
want to spend a lot of money to reduce what she judges to be small 
and perhaps unlikely environmental damage.

<p>
<br>

SUE  <img src="figures/pt3pg10suet.gif"  align=bottom >

<br>
<br>

<b>Beliefs:</b> She thinks climate change is very likely and believes 
the environmental consequences would be disastrous.  
 
<p>

<b>Values:</b> She cares a great deal about the environment, and 
much less about the economy.

<p>

<b>How Sue reasons:</b> Sue thinks that the accumulation of 
greenhouse gases in the atmosphere will cause a great deal of 
environmental damage.  She also thinks global warming is very 
likely to come about unless we dramatically reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions.  Because she cares so much about protecting the 
environment, she rates the impacts of global warming as <i>very 
bad</i>.  She would do this even if she believed the economic impacts 
would be <i>high</i>.  Therefore, her top priority is preventing 
climate change altogether, not just slowing climate change with the 
policy of moderate abatement.  If abatement costs are <i>low</i> or 
<i>medium</i>, she'll favor the "stringent abatement" policy.  She is 
optimistic about the costs of energy efficiency and new energy 
technologies and doesn't believe that abatement costs will be 
<i>high,</i> but if she did, she would probably still favor stringent 
abatement.

<p>
<br>

PAT  <img src="figures/pt3pg11patt.gif"  align=bottom >


<br>
<br>

<b>Beliefs:</b> She is uncertain about the possibility of climate 
change and worried about the unlikely but catastrophic 
consequences.  

<p>

<b>Values:</b> She wants to avoid huge impacts on both the 
environment and the economy.

<p>

<b>How Pat reasons:</b> Pat rates the impacts of climate change as 
<i>moderate</i>.  Neither the environment nor the economy is more 
important to her, and she wants to protect both against large losses.  

<p>

If she thinks abatement costs will be <i>low</i>, she supports 
"stringent abatement."  She reasons that $250 billion is a reasonable 
price for the U.S. to pay to completely prevent global warming.

<p>

If she expects abatement costs to be moderate, she supports 
<i>moderate</i> abatement.  At moderate cost, stringent abatement 
costs $500 billion, which she thinks is too expensive given the 
uncertainties associated with the issue.  Moderate abatement, which 
under this scenario costs nothing in the long-term, seems reasonable 
to her because it provides protection against the most catastrophic 
consequences of global warming.

<p>

If she believes abatement costs are <i>high</i>, she supports the "no 
abatement" policy.  Under the <i>high</i> cost scenario, stringent 
abatement costs $3 trillion, enough to cripple the economy.  
"Moderate abatement" under this high cost scenario is a lot cheaper, 
only $60 billion, but it also provides a lot less protection.  In Pat's 
opinion, too little protection for the money.

<a name="gloss"</a>
<b>Glossary</b> <p>

<b>aerosols:</b>  Extremely small particles of liquid or dust in the 
atmosphere.  Burning coal releases sulfur dioxide which in the 
atmosphere is transformed into sulfate aerosols. One geo-engineering 
strategy would put more aerosols into the atmosphere to reflect 
sunlight back to space.

<p>

<b>afforestation:</b>  Establishing new forests on unforested land.  
<i>Afforresting</i> large areas of land so that trees will absorb and 
store carbon from the atmosphere could slow carbon dioxide buildup.

<p>

<b>albedo:</b>  The fraction of sunlight that is reflected by earth, ice, 
and clouds back into space.  The value for today's earth is about one-
third (i.e., two-thirds of the sunlight is absorbed).

<p>

<b>biodiversity:</b> The number of different kinds of plant and 
animal species that live in a region. On land, tropical rain forests 
have the highest biodiversity.   

<p>

<b>biomass:</b> The amount of living matter in a particular region, 
usually expressed as weight (mass) per unit area (e.g., tons per acre).
<p>

<b>carbon cycle:</b>  The processes by which carbon is cycled 
through the environment.  Carbon, in the form of carbon dioxide, is 
absorbed from the atmosphere and used by plants in the process of 
photosynthesis to store energy.  Plants and animals then return 
carbon dioxide to the atmosphere through respiration when they 
consume this entergy.  On a <i>much</i> long time-scale, carbon is 
also cycled into and out of rocks.<p>

<b>carbon dioxide:</b>  A gas made up of two atoms of carbon and 
one atom of oxygen which is produced whenever carbon-based fuels 
are burned (or oxidized more slowly in plants and animals).  Carbon 
dioxide is the most important "greenhouse gas" which may cause 
climate change.  Human sources of carbon dioxide include burning 
fossil fuels for electricity, transportation, heating, cooling, and 
manufacturing.  Burning trees in the process of deforestation also 
produces carbon dioxide.  Abbreviated CO<SUB>2</SUB>.

<p>

<b>chlorofluorocarbons:</b>  A family of greenhouse gases used in air 
conditioning, as industrial solvents and in other commercial 
applications.   Abbreviated CFCs.  CFCs destroy ozone in the 
stratosphere (see ozone).  CFCs were once widely used in spray cans 
but in the U.S. this use has now been banned. Other uses are also 
being eliminated under an international agreement negotiated 
in Montreal in 1987.  

<p>

<b>climate:</b>  The average pattern of weather in a place. While 
weather may change substantially from day-to-day, when changes in 
climate occur, they usually happen gradually over many years.  

<p>

<b>deforestation:</b>  Cutting most or all of the trees in a forested 
area.  Deforestation contributes to warming by releasing carbon 
dioxide, changing the albedo (amount of sunlight reflected from the 
surface) and reducing the amount of carbon dioxide taken out of the 
atmosphere by trees. Today, deforestation may contribute about 20% 
of possible warming.  

<p>

<b>discount rate:</b>  A measure of how cost and benefits that will 
happen in the future compare to cost and benefits today.

<p>

<b>energy intensity:</b>  The amount of energy used by an appliance 
or an industry to produce a product or service.  For example, a 
fluorescent light requires only 20 watts to produce the same amount 
of light as a regular 100 watt light bulb, so its energy intensity is 5 
times lower.  Reducing energy intensity is one way to increase 
energy efficiency and emit less carbon dioxide.

<p>

<b>feedback:</b>  The mechanism by which changes in one part of 
the earth-atmosphere system affect future changes in other parts of 
that system.   Feedbacks come in two kinds.  In climate change, 
negative feedbacks work to slow down or offset warming while 
positive feedbacks work to speed up or amplify warming.

<p>

<b>fossil fuel:</b>  Coal, oil (from which gasoline is make), and natural 
gas are called <i>fossil</i> fuels because the chemical energy they 
contained is left over from plants and animals that lived long ago.

<p>

<b>greenhouse effect:</b>  The process by which energy from the sun 
is trapped under the atmosphere to cause warming.  Light energy 
can easily pass in through the atmosphere.  Once some of this light is 
absorbed by dark surfaces, the resulting heat energy has greater 
difficulty getting back out.  Through the naturally occurring 
greenhouse effect, water vapor, ozone and carbon dioxide have kept 
temperatures on the earth moderate for several billions years.  
Today, people are adding more gases which might increase the 
temperature.

<p>

<b>greenhouse gas:</b>  Any gas in the atmosphere that contributes 
to the greenhouse effect.  These include carbon dioxide, methane, 
ozone, nitrous oxide, CFCs, and water vapor.  Most occur naturally as 
well as being created by people.

<p>

<b>methane:</b>  A greenhouse gas consisting of one molecule of 
carbon and four molecules of hydrogen.  Pound-for-pound it 
produces between 5 to 10 times more warming than carbon dioxide.  
Methane is produced naturally from rotting organic matter.  Human 
sources of methane include agricultural activities such as growing 
rice and raising live stock, land-fills, coal mines, and natural gas 
systems.  Abbreviated CH<sub>4</sub>.

<p>

<b>Montreal protocol:</b>  An international treaty signed in 1987 
that limits production of chlorofluorocarbons.

<p>

<b>natural gas:</b>  Gas obtained from wells used as a fuel.  While it 
contains many chemicals the principle component of natural gas is 
methane. 

<p>

<b>nitrous oxide:</b>  A greenhouse gas consisting of two molecules 
of nitrogen and one molecule of oxygen.  Pound-for-pound it 
produces about 300 times more warming than carbon dioxide.  
Nitrous oxide is created when fuels are burned and is also released 
during the use of nitrogen-based crop fertilizers.  Abbreviated 
N<sub>2</sub>O.

<p>

<b>ozone:</b>  An unstable gas in which three molecules of oxygen 
occur together.  Ozone is a greenhouse gas.  In the atmosphere ozone 
occurs at two different altitudes.  Low altitude <i>tropospheric 
ozone</i> is a form of air pollution (part of smog) produced by the 
emissions from cars and trucks.  High in the atmosphere a thin layer 
of <i>stratospheric ozone</i> is naturally created by sunlight.  This 
ozone layer shields the earth from dangerous (cancer-causing) 
ultraviolet radiation from the sun.  Chlorine gas from 
chlorofluorocarbons speeds the breakdown of ozone in the ozone 
layer.  While important, this is largely a different problem from the 
problem of global warming.  Abbreviated O<sub>3</sub>.

<p>

<b>sea level rise:</b>   An increase in the average level of the ocean 
caused by expansion when water is warmed and by addition of more 
water when ice caps melt. 

<p>

<b>sequester:</b>  To remove or segregate.  Scientists sometimes say 
that activities, such as planting trees, which remove carbon dioxide 
from the atmosphere, <i>sequester</i> carbon dioxide.

<p>

<b>sink:</b>  A place where material is removed or stored.  For 
example, the oceans absorb about 50% of the carbon dioxide released 
into the atmosphere.  Scientists refer to the oceans as a carbon 
dioxide <i>sink</i>.

<p>

<b>stratosphere:</b>  The upper part of the earth's atmosphere, 
above about seven miles.

<p>

<b>sustainable development:</b>  Economic activities which can meet 
the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future 
generations to meet their own needs.  

<p>

<b>troposphere:</b>  The lower portion of the atmosphere in which 
we live.

<p>

<b>weather:</b>  The condition of the atmosphere at a particular 
place and time measured in terms in wind, temperature, humidity, 
atmospheric pressure, and precipitation (rain, snow, etc.).  In most 
places, weather can change from hour-to-hour, day-to-day, and 
season-to-season.

<h3><p align=center>CONTENTS OF VOLUME 1, NUMBER 1 Spring 1995</h3>

<dl><dt><h3><a href=CONed.html>Editorial</a></h3>

<dt><h3><a HREF=Climate.html>Trends in U.S. Climate During the
Twentieth Century</a></h3>

<dd>By Thomas R. Karl, Richard W. Knight, David R. Easterling, Robert G. Quayle

<p>
The last several decades of weather records for the United States reveal
trends that are consistent with the specific expectations of greenhouse
warming, although were they to persist, these documented changes in the
American record cannot be taken as con clusive evidence for a global
effect. 

<dt><h3><a Href=Water.html>America's Water Supply: Status and Prospects for
the Future</a></h3><p>

<dd>By Kenneth D. Frederick

<p>
Over 1300 gallons of freshwater are withdrawn each day for each person
living in America, counting direct and indirect uses such as irrigation
and the production of electric power.  Although the U.S. has seemingly
abundant supplies, the infrastructure of storage and delivery is growing
old, while new factors, including the value of water left in the stream,
now weigh heavily in apportioning it.<p>

<dt><h3><A HREF=Land.html>Past and Present Land Use and Land Cover in the
U.S.A.</A></h3>

<dd>By William B. Meyer

<p>
In 1850, old growth trees still grew on nearly half of America; forest
cover of all kinds reached a low point in about 1920, rising to 31% today. 
Cropland now covers some 22% of the U.S., and urban development about 4%. 
Roughly half of our original wetl ands have disappeared.  Changes in how
the land is used are closely coupled with other aspects of the
environment. </dl>

<h3><a href =population.html>Global And U.S. National Population 
Trends</a></h3>
by Carl Haub<p>
<blockquote>
An unprecedented 5.8 billion people now live on the Earth, and in 
about 10 more years there will be 6.8 billion, with almost all the 
growth in the less developed countries.  The U.S. is the most populous 
and rapidly growing of the more developed nations, in part through 
immigration; each year it adds about 2.5 million people--the 
equivalent of another San Diego.</blockquote><p>

<h3><a href = impacts.html>Impacts of a Projected Depletion of the 
Ozone Layer</a></h3>

by Frank R. de Gruijl<p>
<blockquote>
The growth of ozone-depleting substances in the stratosphere has 
now been slowed, but increasing ozone losses are predicted through 
the end of the present decade, with a gradual recovery in the 21st 
century.  Throughout this time health hazards will persist, although 
what is known of these and other deleterious effects of enhanced 
ultraviolet radiation is far from complete. </blockquote><p>

<h3><a href = agriculture.html>Potential Impacts of Climate Change On 
Agriculture And Food Supply</a></h3>

by Cynthia Rosenzweig and Daniel Hillel<p>
<blockquote>
Computer models that include the direct effects of enhanced CO2 on 
plant growth predict that global greenhouse warming will generally 
benefit agriculture in the U.S., Canada and Australia, while 
diminishing agricultural productivity in the lower latitude, 
developing countries that can least afford it.</blockquote><hr>

<h3><a href="envir.html">The Environment Since 1970</a></h3>
<p>by Jesse H. Ausubel, David G. Victor, and Iddo K. Wernick<p>
<p>
Much has changed in the environment and how it is managed in the quarter
century since the first Earth Day in April of 1970.  Environmental awareness
has undeniably increased, and while progress has been uneven, both in the U.S.
and among other countries of the world, a number of indicators show marked
improvement.<p>
<h3><a href="mod.html">Climate Models:  How Reliable Are Their Predictions?</a></h3>
<p>by Eric J. Barron<p>
<p>
Expectations of significant global greenhouse warming rest on a combination of
scientific fact, what is now known of atmospheric and ocean behavior, and
projections, based on these, that are obtained from a diverse battery of
computerized, General Circulation Models (GCMs).  Weighing the level of
confidence in what goes into GCMs and the limitations of what they can do helps
in evaluating the reliability of their overall predictions.

<h3><a href = "geoclimate.html">Remembrance Of Things Past:Greenhouse Lessons From The Geologic Record</a></h3><p>
by Thomas J. Crowley<p>

Since the beginning, the story of the Earth's climate has been a tale of
continual change:  sometimes warmer, often far colder than the present day.  What is known of natural climatic variations of the past 100 million years provides invaluable insights into projected greenhouse warming, and the only meaningful tests of some of the modeled predictions.

<h3><a href = "oceanfish.html">How Bountiful Are Ocean Fisheries?</a></h3><p>
by Brian J. Rothschild<p>

The annual catch of fish from the sea, long an ever-increasing quantity, declined and leveled off in recent years, while the world's population continues its upward climb.  Overfishing is often blamed, but a great deal more is involved, including inherent problems in fisheries management and emerging problems of environmental changes of many kinds.

<h3><a href = "sunclimate.html">The Sun And Climate</a></h3><p>
by Judith Lean and David Rind
<p>
The climate system receives almost all of its energy from the Sun, and recent measurements from space have revealed that what the Sun delivers on our doorstep varies from day to day and year to year.  While known solar variations are less significant than the expected effects of enhanced greenhouse warming, they could either slow, for a time, or accelerate its eventual impact.<p>

<h3><a href="article1.html">Ending Hunger:  Current Status and Future 
Prospects </a></h3>
<p>
by Robert W. Kates
<p>


Starvation, undernutrition, and nutrient-depleting sickness are part of 
everyday life 
for at least one in every six people who dwell on the planet, and about one of 
every 
three children.  Severe hunger, defined in this way, has always stalked 
mankind, but 
it could today be eliminated, had we the collective will to do it.
<p>


<h3><a href="article2.html">Impacts of Introduced Species in the United 
States</a></h3>
<p>
by Daniel Simberloff
<p>
Many of the non-native animals, plants, and pathogens that are brought into 
the 
country each day are quite harmless, but about one in seven can cause
 long-lasting 
problems that cost us billions of dollars each year.  It is far easier to keep 
questionable species out than to erase or control them, once they are in.
<p>

<h3><a href="article3.html">Population Policy:  Consensus and 
Challenges</a></h3>
<p>
by Lori S. Ashford and Jeanne A. Noble
<p>

The conference in Cairo, two years ago, marked a turning point in how 
nations 
view the challenge of containing global population growth.  Out of Egypt 
came a 
harder look at the social roots of the problem, and the hope of broadening the 
focus 
from simple birth control to concerns regarding the health and human rights 
of 
those who bear children.

<body>
<a href = "http://gcrio.ciesin.org/"><img align = bottom src = "/gifs/gcrio-header.gif"></a><br>
<hr><br>
<p align=center>EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT
<strong><br align=center>OFFICE OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY POLICY</strong>
<br align=center>WASHINGTON, D.C. 20500
<p>Members of Congress:

<p>I am pleased to forward to you a copy of "Our Changing Planet: The FY 1996 U.S. Global Change Research Program."  This supplement to the President's Fiscal Year 1996 Budget was prepared by the Subcommittee on Global Change Research (SGCR) of the Committee on Environment and Natural Resources Research (CENR), a committee of the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC). This document complements the report, "Preparing for the Future Through Science and Technology: An Agenda for Environmental and Natural Resources Research," that was prepared by the CENR last winter. 

<p>The U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) has spurred much improved scientific insight into the processes and interactions of the Earth system. As a result, we're making progress in our ability to forecast seasonal to interannual climate changes that can lead to significant events such as floods, droughts, and heat waves. Improved forecasting of these events can save human lives and billions of dollars.

<p>Recent measurements made through the USGCRP confirm that the growth rates of total organic chlorine and bromine in the troposphere are slowing, which suggests that the depleted stratospheric ozone layer will recover over the next several decades in response to measures taken as part of the Montreal Protocol and its amendments. USGCRP research in FY1996 is expected to improve our understanding of how ozone depletion relates to increased UV radiation. In parallel, health research on the mechanisms by which UV radiation causes skin cancer, immunosuppression, and cataracts will lead to better methods of prevention.

<p>General Circulation Models (GCMs), which were developed to predict climate changes over the next few decades, have improved substantially and can now better account for the observed global warming of the last century of about 0.5 &#176C. Improvements in GCMs enable us to better understand the potential for significant climate change and its impacts over the next century, so that we can develop wise adaptation and mitigation strategies. Equally important is our improved ability to observe changes in global land cover by remote sensing and to assess and prevent undesirable impacts on the global productivity of forests, fisheries, and agriculture  through USGCRP supported field programs.

<p>The USGCRP, a program initiated under President Reagan and elevated to a Presidential Initiative under President Bush, has brought our nation huge dividends by greatly increasing our knowledge of Earth system science, thereby giving us a better understanding of the global ecosystem on which we so greatly depend. President Clinton strongly endorses this program and proposes to maintain federal support of the USGCRP at a level of $1.8 billion for FY 1996.

<p>I would like to commend Dr. Robert Corell of the National Science Foundation and Chair of the SGCR, for leading the efforts which have made this program a success. We look forward to another productive year for the support of Earth system science as an investment for the nation's future.
<p>John H. Gibbons
<br>Director, OSTP

<h1><p align=center>Executive Summary</h1>

The U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) focuses on the scientific study of the Earth system and its components. Global change research provides short- and long-term benefits to the nation in a number of different ways:
<blockquote>
<ul><li>Global change research contributes to fundamental scientific knowledge leading to important insights into the interactions of the Earth system, including the oceans, the continents, snow cover and sea ice, and the atmosphere;

<p><li>Global change research improves capabilities for documenting and assessing potential changes in the Earth system and the implications of these changes on climate, surface UV radiation, land cover, the health of terrestrial and marine ecosystems, and the availability of future resources such as water, food, and fiber;

<p><li>Global change research assists in the development of improved predictions of extreme events such as floods, droughts, and heat waves, thereby allowing actions to reduce the vulnerability of people and property to natural disasters;

<p><li>USGCRP research is organized around a framework of observing and documenting change, understanding processes and consequences, predicting future changes, and assessing options for dealing with change. The large quantities of data generated through these activities require the design and implementation of a sophisticated data- and information-management system. This system is designed to make global change data easily accessible to researchers worldwide. In addition, most USGCRP agencies sponsor public information and education programs, and the USGCRP operates a Global Change Research Information Office to assist with disseminating scientific information; and

<p><li>Global change research remains a high priority for the United States. The President's budget for FY 1996 proposes to invest $1.8 billion in global change research, including $749 million for space-based observations of the Earth. This request represents an investment in the future health and security of the nation's citizens.</ul></blockquote>

<hr><br>
<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>Global change research brings significant benefits to the nation 
and the world by providing a well-founded scientific understanding 
of the Earth system to ensure the availability of future resources 
essential for human survival, such as water, food, and fiber. The <a 
href="http://www.usgcrp.gov">U.S. Global Change Research Program 
(USGCRP)</a>, along with its international partners, provides the 
foundation for expanding the ability to both predict and respond to 
extreme events such as floods, droughts, and heat waves. The 
USGCRP also aims to reduce vulnerabilities to changes in important 
environmental factors, such as climate, ultraviolet (UV) radiation at 
the Earth's surface, and land cover. Scientific knowledge is essential 
for informed decision making on environmental issues and to ensure 
the social and economic health of future generations. Thus the 
USGCRP is a critical investment for the future of this nation, its 
economy, and the health and safety of its citizens.

<p>The USGCRP was created in 1989 and formalized in 1990 by the <a href="/gcact1990.html">Global Change Research Act of 1990</a>. Since 
that time, global change research has remained a key science 
initiative. Continuing to improve scientific understanding of the Earth 
system is a priority of the <a 
href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/WH/EOP/OSTP/NSTC/html/NSTC_Home.html">National Science and Technology Council's</a> Committee 
on Environment and Natural Resources. 

<h2><p align=center>WHAT IS GLOBAL CHANGE?</h2>

<p>Global change encompasses the full range of natural and human-
induced changes in the Earth's environment (see <a 
href="figs/gecword.gif">figure</a>). Global change can be defined as 
changes in the global environment (including alterations in climate, 
land productivity, oceans or other water resources, atmospheric 
chemistry, and ecological systems) that may alter the capacity of the 
Earth to sustain life. Issues related to global change include:

<ul>
<li><a href="ch2.html">SEASONAL TO INTERANNUAL CLIMATE 
FLUCTUATIONS.</a>
<li><a href="ch3.html">CLIMATE CHANGE OVER THE NEXT FEW 
DECADES.</a>
<li><a href="ch4.html">STRATOSPHERIC OZONE DEPLETION AND 
INCREASED UV RADIATION.</a>
<li><a href="ch5.html">CHANGES IN LAND COVER AND IN 
TERRESTRIAL AND MARINE ECOSYSTEMS.</a>
</ul>

<p>Increased scientific knowledge of global change can reduce the 
vulnerabilities of human and ecological systems to major 
environmental changes. Scientific research provides the foundation 
for building a strong society through continued advances in 
improving human health and longevity, advancing economic growth 
and prosperity, and ensuring adequate food supplies and the 
availability and quality of fresh water.

<p>Major economic losses occur annually from events such as 
drought, floods, and heat waves. The USGCRP supports research on 
seasonal to interannual climate change that helps to expand society's 
capabilities to anticipate and respond to such events. Better 
understanding of changes in temperature and precipitation patterns 
and their impacts on crops, forests, and human pathogens will enable 
society to be better prepared to cope with potentially costly future 
changes in climate on times scales of decades to centuries. Similar 
benefits will be evident with respect to enhanced knowledge about 
the impacts of increased UV levels associated with ozone depletion, 
changes in biological diversity, and changes in the productivity of 
land and water resources. 

<blockquote>
<h3><a href="p2box.html">Major Scientific Challenges</a>
<br><a href="p3box.html">Additional Challenges</a></h3>
</blockquote>

<h2><p align=center>WHAT IS THE FOCUS OF THE USGCRP?</h2>

<p>The USGCRP focuses on the scientific study of the Earth system 
and its components. Comprehensive investigation of Earth system 
processes and their interactions is a complex scientific challenge. 
Human influences and interactions with the environment range from 
local to global and extend over time periods from days and seasons 
to as long as decades and centuries. Understanding these diverse 
scales and interactions requires the participation of an extensive 
community of scientists from a wide range of scientific disciplines 
and from all regions of the globe. Therefore, USGCRP activities are 
coordinated with other related national and international research
programs.

<p>USGCRP research is organized around a framework of observing, 
documenting, understanding, and predicting global change; assessing 
the consequences of these changes and the vulnerability of human 
and ecological systems to their potentially adverse impacts; and 
developing the tools and capabilities to conduct integrated 
assessments to synthesize and communicate this body of knowledge.

<h2>Observing Global Change</h2>

<p>A coordinated program of land, ocean, airborne and satellite-
based observing systems that measure and monitor different facets 
of the Earth system is central to documenting changes in the global 
environment and gaining a predictive understanding of them. The 
most comprehensive set of sensors for observing global change is a 
space-based observing system that is being planned and 
implemented by the U.S. in cooperation with many international 
partners (see <a href="p53box.html">box</a>). Other space-based 
systems that are currently operating or being planned include 
operational weather satellites and satellites that measure ozone and 
other atmospheric chemicals, global sea level, topography, soil 
moisture, sea-ice dynamics, and ocean temperatures.

<p>These space-based measurements are complemented and 
enhanced by many surface and airborne systems. For example, an 
extensive ocean observing system in the tropical Pacific is providing 
critical information on ocean-atmosphere interactions. Other in-situ 
systems measure important Earth system parameters such as 
greenhouse gases, aerosols, ozone, ultraviolet radiation, and land-
atmosphere interactions.

<h2>Documenting Global Change</h2>

<p>Global change research activities generate and require massive 
amounts of highly diverse data and information to document change, 
to improve understanding of global change processes, and to carry 
out integrated assessments of impacts on society. The scope of global 
change research is very broad, ranging from studies on ecological 
systems, biodiversity, ocean and atmospheric interactions, and the 
human dimensions of change, to the development of tools and 
methods for scientific assessment. Important data therefore need to 
be archived, preserved, and made available for individual research 
activities, and related data from various disciplines and disparate 
sources need to be identified and combined to maximize 
interpretation.

<p>Providing access to comprehensive global change data and 
information in usable formats is vital to investigators worldwide. An 
interagency <a href="http://www.gcdis.usgcrp.gov/">Global Change 
Data and Information System (GCDIS)</a> is being implemented to 
accomplish this task (see <a href="p7box.html"> box</a> and <a 
href="ch6.html#global">discussion</a>). 

<h2>Understanding Global Change</h2>

<p>Research on fundamental processes and mechanisms that control 
the physical, chemical, biological, and human processes that govern 
Earth-system behavior provides the foundation needed for 
predicting future changes and for analyzing potential consequences 
and impacts (see <a href="fig5.html">figure</a>). Process research 
within the USGCRP includes studies of the atmosphere, ocean, 
cryosphere (snow, ice, glaciers, etc.), lithosphere (land surfaces), 
marine and terrestrial ecosystems, and the relationships among these 
components. Understanding the significance of these processes over a 
wide range of scales in time and space is especially important to 
predicting future change.

<p>Ongoing programs include studies of clouds and of solar and 
infrared radiation processes; of the radiative effects of aerosols, 
especially sulfate particles; and of the interactions of both terrestrial 
and marine ecological processes with atmospheric composition and 
climate. The results of this research provide the basis for improved 
models for predicting future changes in climate and in ozone 
concentrations, changes in surface UV radiation levels, and changes 
in the global productivity of fisheries, forests, and agricultural lands.

<h2>Predicting Global Change</h2>

<p>Global observations and process research studies help scientists 
develop and improve models that explain and reproduce past global 
changes and project future changes and their consequences. Accurate 
predictions of future global change depend on how well models can 
simulate the dynamics and interactions of the many components of 
the Earth system, including the oceans, atmosphere, land, and 
biosphere. Field and observation programs provide the basis for 
efforts to relate regional-scale and global-scale patterns and 
variables (especially precipitation, temperature, and surface 
roughness) and to compare model results with real world conditions. 

<p>Improvements in global environmental models are continually 
being made as modelers extend their efforts to include interactions 
of the climate system with vegetation, biological productivity, soil 
processes, trace gas exchange, hydrology, atmospheric circulation and 
chemistry, radiation budgets, and ocean circulation patterns. For 
example, recent climate models that incorporate the influence of 
atmospheric aerosols have been able to predict changes in climate 
over the last century that are similar to observed changes.  These 
models predict that  atmospheric aerosols currently are exerting a 
nonuniform cooling effect over the globe that is moderating, 
especially in industrialized regions, the predicted warming from 
increases in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations.

<h2>Analyzing Global Change Consequences</h2>

<p>Evaluating the consequences of changes in the global environment 
includes determining and interpreting the economic, health, and 
environmental impacts of these changes and understanding the 
potential for adaptation to and mitigation of potential adverse 
impacts. Ongoing research efforts are focused on improving the 
understanding of the physiological and ecological responses of plants 
and animals to global changes in climate, atmospheric gas 
concentrations, increased UV radiation, changes in land cover, and 
changes in other environmental factors. These efforts include forest 
health monitoring; studies of threatened, endangered, and sensitive 
species; and research into the physiological basis of resistance to 
environmental stresses such as drought, UV radiation, and the 
introduction of new pest and predator species. Such programs enable 
scientists to develop more resistant crop cultivars that are less 
vulnerable to environmental changes. 

<p>Economic research programs are ongoing to analyze the 
interactions of environmental changes with societal changes, such as 
changes in consumption patterns, adjustments to technological 
developments and diffusion, and changing patterns of regional and 
global trade (see <a href="fig8.html">figure</a>). Other programs 
important for evaluating the consequences of global change include 
those to evaluate substitutes for ozone depleting compounds, efforts 
to analyze the costs and benefits of a changing mix of energy supply, 
and projects to study the effectiveness of soil restoration and 
reforestation. 

<h2>Developing Integrated Assessments</h2>

<p>The USGCRP is continuing to provide strong support for the 
conduct of scientific assessments on issues of relevance to decision 
makers. An important aspect of this activity is the development of 
tools and methodologies for integrating data from the physical, 
biological, social, and economic sciences. Integrated assessments can 
help policy makers develop options for responding to global change 
by providing them with a comprehensive framework for evaluating 
the effects of different options. This same framework is also useful 
for identifying priorities for future research to increase scientific 
knowledge relevant to an issue.

<p>The USGCRP has played a major role in supporting the 
contributions of U.S. scientists to the international assessment 
process. International assessments are carried out to develop a broad 
consensus on scientific findings from information gathered by tens of 
thousands of scientists throughout the world on issues of global 
interest. Examples of international assessments are those conducted 
by the <a href="http://unep.unep.no">United Nations Environment 
Programme (UNEP)</a>/<a href="http://www.wmo.ch">World 
Meteorological Organization (WMO)</a> on ozone depletion and by 
the <a href="http://www.unep.ch/ipcc/ipcc-0.html">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)</a> on

<h1>Seasonal To Interannual Climate Fluctuations And
Related Events</h1>
<ul><li><h3><a href="p11box.html">Science Goals for Research on Seasonal to 
Interannual Climate Fluctuations and Related Events</a>
<li><a href="p12box.html">Some Recent Scientific Accomplishments in Predicting 
Seasonal to Interannual Climate Fluctuations and Related Events</a></h3></ul>

<p>
The climate of the Earth continually experiences natural fluctuations on 
seasonal to interannual time scales, as evidenced by the El Ni&ntilde;o cycle 
(see <a href="fig10.html">figure</a>).  These naturally occurring fluctuations 
can lead to extreme climate events such as droughts, heat waves, and floods. 
Extended periods of drought and heat can increase the susceptibility of urban 
settlements and forest lands to fire, can disrupt food production and water 
supplies, and in developing regions, can
occasionally lead to massive human migrations. Prolonged and excessive periods 
of precipitation can cause flooding, delay planting, contaminate water 
resources, and temporarily disrupt patterns of production and trade.<p>
<p>
An improved ability to document and then forecast trends and patterns of 
change in ocean temperature, snow cover, sea ice, and other factors that 
contribute to changes in the global climate over seasonal to interannual 
scales could lead to a reduction of adverse impacts from potentially 
destructive climate events.  Early warnings enable communities to develop 
strategies to better prepare for
these events by, for example, implementing revised planting schedules, 
switching crops, and modifying water management, all of which have been 
demonstrated to lead to reduced costs and impacts.<p>
<p>
Observations and analyses indicate that in some regions of the globe, seasonal 
to interannual variations of atmospheric conditions can be predicted up to two 
years in advance. These predictions are based on observed variations in 
parameters such as sea surface temperature, soil moisture, and snow and sea-
ice cover. Significant changes in seasonal to interannual climate may be a key 
to the detection of longer-term climate changes.
<p>
<h3>Proposed Future Research on Seasonal and Interannual Climate</h3>

<strong><em>Highlights of USGCRP research in FY 1996 include programs 
to:</em></strong> <p>
<p>
<ul><li><strong>Monitor the tropical Pacific to better determine its influence 
on climate and
to improve predictions.</strong> Variations in the tropical Pacific Ocean, 
particularly
variations of sea surface temperature, exert a tremendous influence on the
climate of many tropical and mid-latitude countries, including the United
States. The USGCRP, in collaboration with its international research partners,
has put in place a unique observation array of instruments to constantly
monitor the state of the tropical Pacific Ocean and transmit data to research
and operational centers in real time.<p>
<p>
<li><strong> Incorporate field data into models to improve forecasts of 
climate variability.</strong> Air-sea interaction processes in the western 
tropical Pacific Ocean are important to the evolution of the <a 
href="p14box.html">El Ni&ntilde;o</a>-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon. 
High quality data sets resulting from a recent international field campaign in 
the western Pacific are being analyzed to improve understanding of the 
coupling between the ocean and the atmosphere in this climatically important 
region.<p>
<p>
<li><strong> Map global precipitation and its relationship to climate 
change.</strong> Rainfall
distributions in the tropics and in several key locations outside the tropics
are closely tied to large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns that are
forced by the interactions between the atmosphere and the tropical oceans. By
merging estimates from a wide range of ground based and satellite measuring
systems, the USGCRP, in cooperation with many international partners, has
produced the first reliable maps of global precipitation. Continued
improvements in mapping global precipitation will benefit the global community
through improved management of water resources and through better 
understanding
of and ability to predict the climate system.<p>
<p>
<li><strong> Conduct research to improve prediction skills, particularly over 
the U.S.</strong>
While USGCRP research has made possible the ability to forecast El Ni&ntilde;o
events up to a year in advance, the forecasts are limited in that they focus 
on
the evolution of the tropical Pacific sea surface temperature and related
climate impacts. Forecast skill is highest in the tropics, near the source of
El Ni&ntilde;o events and diminishes at higher latitudes (e.g., over North
America) where other processes may play a greater role. Further research is
planned to extend predictability of climate fluctuations beyond the tropical
Pacific to include the effects of the other tropical oceans, higher latitude
oceans, and land-surface processes that are believed to contribute
significantly to seasonal-to-interannual climate variability, particularly at 
higher latitudes. The results of such research will improve modeling of 
precipitation anomalies like those that occurred in the U.S. Midwest in 1993 
and this past winter in California (see <a href="fig19.gif">figure</a>).
<p>
<li><strong> Establish research centers to improve forecast model 
development.</strong>USGCRP-supported modelers are making their experimental 
forecast products available to a limited number of tropical countries (e.g., 
Brazil and Peru).  These forecasts are rudimentary and are presently prepared 
in a research mode,
without the routine system for production and distribution that is required 
for worldwide use. A multi-national planning process is underway to establish 
a network of research centers to enhance the development of regional climate 
forecast models and methodologies and to sponsor training of scientists from 
participating countries. One center, the International Research Institute for 
the Seasonal-to-Interannual Climate Prediction Program, will have the 
specialized responsibility of producing, assessing, and distributing forecast
guidance to interested nations on a regular basis.<p>
<p>
<li><strong> Assess human vulnerability to climate variations and identify 
options for
adaptation</strong> based on improved prediction information. An understanding 
of the
social and economic factors that render individuals, communities, and economic
sectors more or less vulnerable to seasonal or yearly climatic fluctuations is
critical for reducing that vulnerability and improving adjustment. To
capitalize on advances in climate analysis and predictive capability, climate 
information needs to be incorporated into management decisions in climate-
sensitive sectors (e.g., hydropower, insurance, transportation, fisheries, and 
agriculture). Moreover, lessons learned from adapting to natural variability 
will help society be prepared for the possibility that longer term climate 
change may manifest itself as changes in the frequency and magnitude of 
extreme events.

<h1><p align=center>Climate Change Over The Next Few Decades</h1>
<ul><li><h3><a href="p21box.html">Science Goals for Research on Climate Change 
over the Next Few Decades</a>
<li><a href="p24box.html">Some Recent Scientific Accomplishments in Observing, 
Understanding, and Predicting Climate Change over the Next Few 
Decades</a></h3></ul>

<p>Human society is highly dependent on the Earth's climate. Climate patterns 
and human adaptations determine the availability of food, fresh water, and 
other resources for sustaining life. The social and economic characteristics 
of society have also been shaped largely by adapting to the seasonal and year-
to-year (interannual) patterns of temperature and rainfall. While anomalous 
variations in these shorter time scale patterns can have serious effects on 
society, the vulnerability of society to longer-term climate change, occurring 
over periods of decades to centuries, will depend on its ability to understand 
and respond to this change. Thus, it is imperative that society develop the 
strongest possible scientific understanding of the causes and dynamics of 
climate change and greenhouse warming, the potential ecological and 
socioeconomic impacts of change, and the implications of alternative courses 
of action to mitigate and adapt to change. 

<p>Scientists have determined that climate can be influenced by both natural 
forces and human activities. For example, habitable temperatures are 
maintained on Earth by a natural phenomenon known as the "<a 
href="p30box.html">greenhouse effect</a>." Solar radiation is absorbed by the 
Earth's atmosphere and land and water bodies. The resultant heat is re-emitted 
as long-wave radiation, some of which escapes to space and some of which is 
absorbed and trapped by atmospheric gases such as water vapor, carbon dioxide, 
methane, nitrous oxide, chlorofluorocarbons and ozone. While some of these 
gases are present naturally, increased concentrations of greenhouse gases as a 
result of human activity can enhance this natural greenhouse effect, creating 
additional warming of the surface and the atmosphere(see <a href="fig22-23.html">figure</a>). Human activities such as fossil fuel combustion 
and land-use change have resulted in a 30% increase in atmospheric carbon 
dioxide and have contributed to more than a doubling of the methane 
concentration since preindustrial times.

<p>Human-induced and natural changes in global land cover (such as 
deforestation and desertification) and emissions of aerosols (from fossil fuel 
burning and volcanic eruptions) also influence climate. Although much has been 
learned, there are still significant improvements to be made in estimating how 
human activities will combine with natural influences to affect the future 
global climate.

<p>IPCC assessments conducted with the participation of thousands of 
scientists from more than 150 countries and with significant USGCRP 
participation, suggest that emissions of greenhouse gases and sulfate aerosols 
could, by the end of the next century, lead to an increase in global mean 
temperatures of about 1-4 &#176C, a rise in sea level, and a global change in 
precipitation patterns. Among other uncertainties, the magnitude and location 
of projected shifts in global precipitation patterns remain particularly 
difficult to predict.

<p>Observational data show an increase in global average temperature of about 
0.5 &#176C over the last 100 years. The likelihood that this warming is due 
primarily to natural variability is low. This observed warming trend is 
continuing despite the influence of the Mt. Pinatubo volcanic eruption, which 
caused volcanic emissions to reduce incoming solar radiation for nearly two 
years. The most recent <a href="p32box.html">climate model</a> simulations 
have been able to explain the magnitude and temporal pattern of this observed 
trend reasonably well. To build greater confidence in predictions of future 
climate, further improvements are needed in modeling the influence of 
atmospheric aerosol concentrations, the cycling of atmospheric water in all 
its phases, cloud-radiation interactions, ocean-atmosphere coupling, and in 
predicting the expected range of natural climate variability.

<p>Projected climate change over the next few decades, including changes in 
temperature, precipitation, and sea level, can add to other stresses on 
natural systems caused by other factors such as population growth, land-use 
changes, and pollution, posing risks to managed and unmanaged resource systems 
(see <a href="p29box.html">Potential Impacts on Various Sectors Associated 
with Climate Change Predictions over the Next Century</a>). Although 
temperature changes of the magnitude expected from the enhanced greenhouse 
effect have occurred in the distant past, the evidence suggests that the 
changes generally took place over centuries or millennia instead of decades. 
Because rates of natural migration and adaptation of species and communities 
appear to be much slower than may be forced by the predicted rate of climate 
change, populations of many species and inhabited ranges could decrease as the 
climate to which they are adapted effectively shifts northward or to higher 
elevations. 

<p>Overall, various strategies for coping with climate change can be 
identified for "intensively managed" systems (such as agriculture, water 
resources, and developed coastlines). For these systems, technological and 
management options exist to some extent today, although they may be costly to 
implement. By comparison, fewer options have been identified for natural 
systems such as wetlands and wilderness areas.

<p>Changes in climate may also have significant impacts on human health. These 
impacts may include increases in mortality and morbidity as a result of a 
higher frequency of heat waves and synergistic effects from higher 
temperatures and air pollutant mixtures (higher temperatures may cause changes 
in urban air chemistry). There is also evidence that a changing climate will 
cause a migration into higher latitudes and altitudes of some diseases, such 
as malaria and dengue, the incidence of which is highly correlated with 
rainfall and elevated nighttime temperatures.

<h1>Stratospheric Ozone Depletion And Increased UV Radiation</h1>

<ul><li><h3><a href="p35box.html">Science Goals for Research on 
Stratospheric Ozone Depletion and Increased UV Radiation
<li><a href="p36box.html">Some Recent General Scientific Accomplishments in 
Understanding Stratospheric Ozone Depletion and Increased UV 
Radiation</a></h3></ul>
<p><br>
<p>Life at the surface of the Earth is protected from the harmful 
ultraviolet (UV) radiation of the Sun by the stratospheric ozone layer. Over 
the last several decades, synthetic chemical compounds, such as 
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and halons, were developed to provide a new 
generation of refrigerants, insulating foams, fire retardants, and other 
products. Unfortunately, after extensive use of these compounds, it was 
discovered that they remain inert in the atmosphere until they reach the 
stratosphere, where they break down into an active form that destroys 
ozone. One chlorine atom originating from a CFC molecule can destroy 
thousands of protective ozone molecules.

<p>Satellite and ground-based observations confirm that losses of ozone 
are occurring seasonally, particularly in the springtime polar vortex of the 
Antarctic stratosphere, leading to what is known as the ozone 
&#34hole.&#34  Also of concern is the more moderate ozone depletion 
observed in mid-latitudes, where a large portion of the Earth&#39s population 
resides. In the absence of changes in clouds or pollution, decreases in 
atmospheric ozone will increase ground-level UV radiation.

<p>Analyses of data related to human health, Antarctic marine 
phytoplankton production, and careful field and laboratory experiments on 
the impacts of elevated UV exposure, indicate that increased UV radiation 
at the surface could have substantial negative impacts on human health, 
fish populations, and many terrestrial and marine ecosystems. In humans 
and other animals, impacts include immune system suppression, increased 
incidence of serious sunburn, cataracts and epidermal lesions, reduced 
vitamin D synthesis, and cancer. In plants, exposure to enhanced UV 
radiation can inhibit the essential process of photosynthesis. Increased UV 
radiation can also influence agricultural productivity and cause 
deterioration of synthetic materials such as plastics.

<p>Due to global recognition of the implications of ozone depletion, 
emissions of many CFCs and halons are to be phased out over the next few 
years. Global observations of CFC concentrations in the atmosphere 
indicate that actions taken in response to the Montreal Protocol and its 
amendments are having the desired effect. Atmospheric measurements of 
trichloroethane, a short-lived ozone-depleting substance, indicate that its 
concentrations are actually declining.
<p>
<h2><center>Proposed Future Research on Stratospheric Ozone Depletion and 
Increased UV Radiation</h2></center>

<strong><em>Highlights of USGCRP research in FY 1996 include programs 
to:</strong></em><p>
<p>

<ul><li><strong>Monitor the recovery of the ozone layer. </strong>Total 
stratospheric chlorine/bromine loading is expected to peak in the late 
1990s, and a slow recovery of ozone is then expected to follow. Continued 
space-based measurements of stratospheric ozone and the reactive 
chemical species that affect it (oxides of chlorine, bromine, nitrogen, and 
hydrogen) are needed to ensure public safety and health and verify whether 
actions taken in response to the Montreal Protocol and its amendments are 
having the intended effect. <p>

<li><strong>Continue to monitor CFC concentrations and other ozone 
depleting gases in the atmosphere.</strong> Global compliance with 
international agreements will be needed if the emissions of CFCs, halons, 
and other ozone depleting gases are to continue to decline as expected. 
Only by continued long-term space-based monitoring of these gases can 
international policymakers be assured of compliance with the agreed 
phase-out schedule.<p>

<li><strong>Continue efforts to detect and understand extremes in ozone 
depletion. </strong>While the average behavior of the ozone layer is 
expected to  recover during the next century, significant depletions could 
still occur over the next decade. For example, an unusually cold Arctic 
winter could lead to Arctic ozone depletion. Large amounts of sulfur gases 
ejected into the stratosphere (e.g., from volcanic eruptions) could cause 
significant ozone loss through subsequent chemical reactions involving 
sulfates and human-emitted chlorine and bromine. Such eruptions, if they 
were to occur over the next few years, could be particularly damaging as 
the stratospheric chlorine burden reaches its maximum.<p>

<li><strong>Provide scientific information about the ozone depletion 
potential and environmental fate of CFC substitutes. </strong>As CFCs and 
halons are phased out, a wide range of new substitute molecules has 
emerged. Only by fully understanding the physical and chemical properties 
of each gas can scientists acquire the information needed to compare the 
effects of each upon the ozone layer, and the toxicity and fate of each 
compound in the environment and its potential to contribute to climate 
change, thus providing an improved scientific basis for choosing among 
alternatives. This information helps avoid costly errors in the promotion 
of substitutes.<p>

<li><strong>Fully establish UV trends. </strong>High-quality measurements 
of ozone and other factors that affect surface UV radiation (e.g., clouds) 
are needed in order to understand the physical processes affecting the 
relationship between ozone depletion and surface UV-trends. Only in this 
manner can a baseline be established and the variables that affect variance 
from the baseline be defined. In addition, high-quality UV measurements to 
define the response to ozone trends in higher impact areas (e.g., managed 
ecosystems such as forests and croplands) are needed.<p>
<p>(See <a href="fig40.html">Global Ozone Trend/Increases in 
Erythermal[Sunburning] UV Radiation Due to Ozone Reductions</a>)<p>
<li><strong>Better quantify the role of methyl bromide in ozone depletion 
and identify substitute compounds. </strong>Methyl bromide is a 
significant ozone-depleting gas with both natural and anthropogenic 
sources. The sources and sinks of methyl bromide must be better 
quantified to more accurately determine the current and future ozone 
depletion potential of this compound. Given the wide range of methyl 
bromide uses in agriculture, a variety of alternatives to this chemical 
compound are needed to replace its use as it is phased out.<p> 

<li><strong>Better understand processes that affect the chemistry 
associated with NOx emissions from aircraft. </strong>Supersonic aircraft 
emissions can contribute to ozone decreases in the stratosphere (and hence 
lead to potential UV increases at the surface). Subsonic aircraft emissions 
can lead to ozone increases in the upper troposphere that may contribute to 
climate change.
<p>(See <a href="p38box.html">Atmospheric Effects of Aviation</a>)<p>
<li><strong>Understand the connection between stratospheric ozone and 
surface climate. </strong>As stratospheric ozone is depleted, the 
stratosphere cools, tending to cool the surface. The exact relationship 
depends upon the vertical profile of ozone depletion and perhaps on 
indirect chemical feedbacks. These relationships must be better quantified 
if past and future perturbations to the Earth&#39s climate system are to be 
adequately understood.</ul>

<h1>Changes In Land Cover And In Terrestrial And Marine Ecosystems</h1>
<ul><li><h3><a href="p43box.html">Science Goals for Research on Changes in Land Cover and in Terrestrial and Marine Ecosystems</a>
<li><a href="p45box.html">Some Recent Scientific Accomplishments in Observing and Understanding Changes in Land Cover and in Terrestrial and Marine Ecosystems</a></h3></ul>

Human-induced changes in <a href="p49box.html">land cover</a> have occurred throughout human history. Large tracts of land have been cleared for agriculture, forestry, the collection of fuelwood, and for urban and industrial growth. Ecosystems have been transformed both in response to land-cover change and as the result of the inadvertent and intentional introduction of plants and animals from outside their normal habitats, thereby introducing new pests, diseases, and competitive species. The damming, diversion, and rechanneling of rivers, the development of intensive agricultural irrigation systems, and the dramatic increases in the consumption of water for urban and industrial purposes have altered the natural water cycles of many regions, the impacts of which were often felt in remote locales because of the far-reaching character of hydrologic systems.

<p>Worldwide land-cover and ecosystem changes have become especially pronounced in recent decades. As the rates of change in many places have accelerated, so also have the magnitude of those changes and their impacts. More than ever, a comprehensive view of land-cover and ecosystem change is needed. Fortunately, new techniques for acquiring and managing information about these elements have been developed. The science and new technologies for measuring and understanding the dynamics and consequences of land-use and land-cover change have improved dramatically in the last decade. Studies in both tropical and temperate regions using Landsat data have demonstrated that rates of deforestation can be documented, and regrowth and reclearing of secondary growth also can be measured. Satellite data can be combined with ground-based and airborne measurements to determine the influence of land-cover change on biological diversity, hydrologic processes, and the potential for future resource production and utilization of an area. Research results and methods for measuring large-area land-cover and land-use change are now being used by commercial interests to develop sustainable plans for the production of livestock and forest products and to manage public lands for multiple uses.

<p>The increasing volume of data on land cover and related variables greatly facilitates analyses of the dynamics of land-cover change. USGCRP-sponsored research has examined the patterns and rates of land-cover change in a wide range of different areas, exploring different ways for classifying land cover and related land-use practices. These efforts have led to delineation of a set of land-cover regions for the globe. Regional case studies have begun in many of these regions using a common protocol developed by scientists involved in the Land-Use and Land-Cover Change (LUCC) project, a core project of both the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme and the international Human Dimensions of Global Environmental Change Programme (HDP). Through the use of comparable approaches in the conduct of these regional case studies, analyses of the dynamics of land-cover change in each of the regions form the basis for more general advances in understanding the complex interactions among human and natural processes. In the next decade, major new advances in the capabilities for remote sensing of land-cover and land-use dynamics are expected, resulting in an even greater increase in data available for documenting the dynamics of land-cover change.

<p>In addition to gaining a better understanding of changes associated with the land, changes affecting or affected by the oceans (which cover 70% of the Earth's surface) are also critical to understanding the dynamics of the total Earth system. Warmed by the Sun and driven by winds, this vast mass of flowing water regulates the planet's seasonal and interannual climate fluctuations. The oceans are home to diverse communities of plants and animals, which take in and release dissolved carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and other elements. Marine organisms participate in the global cycles of such elements, affecting their concentrations in the oceans, atmosphere, and land. Studies of ocean biology and circulation are crucial to understanding these biochemical cycles and their role in the maintenance of life.

<p>The oceans now are under increasing pressure from human activities. Industrial waste, synthetic fertilizers, and other pollutants are carried by rivers into the ocean, where they can injure life and cause radical changes in the composition of marine ecosystems. The species composition of algal blooms is shifting, and "red tides" of toxic algae are more common along the coasts of the world. Coral reefs, which support a wide variety of organisms in the tropical seas, have been particularly hard hit. Fish and shellfish have suffered as well, with heavy impacts on marine industries. Through significant new remote sensing capabilities and the use of other satellites, aircraft, and ground-based instruments on ships, buoys, and moorings, USGCRP-sponsored research is studying the responses of marine life to various kinds of natural and human-induced global environmental change.

<p>Humans are placing increasing demands on terrestrial and marine ecosystems. The challenge is to understand the potential consequences of natural and human-induced transformations and the effects of industrial activity on the structure and function of terrestrial and marine and coastal ecosystems. Such understanding is essential to maintaining the goods and services essential for human life provided by ecological systems and for developing mitigation options. It is also essential that the potential benefits derived from human-induced land transformations and industrial processes be balanced against the potential costs associated with the reduction or loss of ecological goods and services which result from such activities.

<ul><li><strong>Classify and inventory North American land cover.</strong>  Federal agencies are cooperating to analyze Landsat satellite data (with resolutions of less than 100 meters) and to classify and inventory the land cover of North America and the entire equatorial tropics from 1970 to the present. This effort will document changes that affect the functioning of ecological systems and provides the global change research community and policy makers with valuable and accurate estimates of changes such as deforestation. A program is being developed to study land-cover change in portions of Mexico in cooperation with the Mexican government. This research is aimed at identifying land-cover changes on decadal time scales, especially those related to the conversion from agricultural to urban land uses and from forest to agricultural land use. This research will enhance knowledge related to productivity changes. 

<p><li><strong>Participate in the international Land-Use and Land-Cover Change Programme.</strong>  A comprehensive science plan has been developed for studying global land cover and land use to determine how these have varied over the past and to evaluate the current land-cover status. The program, which will aim for global coverage of land cover at 1 km spatial resolution, will examine the major human causes of land-use change in different geographical and historical contexts and project changes that may occur over the next few decades. Projecting the future responses of terrestrial ecosystems to land-cover change requires understanding the relationships between past changes in land cover and in the structure and function of ecosystems.

<p><li><strong>Study how ecosystems react to change and influence global phenomena.</strong>  The interagency program on Terrestrial Ecology and Global Change (TECO) will continue in 1996. New studies under the program will: (1) focus on improving the understanding of how species, ecological characteristics and processes, and ecosystems are related to land-cover change, and (2) enhance capabilities to predict consequences of multiple influences (e.g., when the physical environment and ecological parameters change simultaneously).

<p><li><strong> Work with international partners throughout North and South America to understand the dynamics of land use and land-cover change.</strong>  A comprehensive new project, building on research already underway, includes the development of a model of the deforestation process at work in the Amazon using demographic data linked to satellite observations. 

<p><li><strong>Study the response of marine life to global environmental change.</strong>  A science plan has been developed to study the effects of natural and human-induced environmental changes on marine life. Research focuses on (1) the inputs of nutrients from land, the atmosphere, or the ocean interior via upwelling, (2) temperature changes that alter physiological states, (3) radiation (e.g., UV) changes that affect primary productivity or damage cells, and (4) changes in circulation patterns and other oceanic processes that affect ecosystem structure and function. 

<p><li><strong>Develop a system for tracking changes in carbon flux resulting from land-use change.</strong>  A new research program has been initiated to quantify terrestrial carbon fluxes from changes in land use and land management. Information at both national and regional levels is being collected on the successional status of ecosystems, carbon densities, and carbon cycling, and their relationships to changes in land use. This information is needed to address scientific issues related to carbon sources and sinks, and to provide a scientific basis for developing response options to a CO<SUB>2</SUB> enhanced greenhouse effect. 

<p><li><strong>Apply new satellite ocean color data to coastal problems.</strong>  A coastal program will focus on: (1) distinguishing and tracking harmful algal blooms; (2) tracking coastal and estuarine sediments to determine the fate of suspended sediments and land runoff into coastal oceans; (3) tracking coastal dynamic processes (ocean circulation pattern) to determine dispersal patterns of pollutants and red tides; and (4) application to coastal fisheries and ecosystem management.</ul></blockquote>

<h1>Crosscutting Aspects Of Global Change Research</h1>

<h2><p align=center> GLOBAL OBSERVATION SYSTEMS</h2>

It is essential that long-term, comprehensive regional and global 
observations are collected, archived, and analyzed in order to 
advance scientific understanding of the entire Earth system and to 
develop a deeper comprehension of its components and the 
interactions among them. The USGCRP has a coordinated program of 
many land-, ocean-, airborne-, and satellite-based systems that 
measure and monitor different facets of the Earth system in an 
integrated observational strategy.

<p>A comprehensive global observing system enhances the ability to 
understand and predict the effects of many parts of the Earth 
system. These include:
<blockquote>
<ul><p><li>Hydrologic and dynamic processes, which control the Earth's 
temperature and the formation, maintenance, and dissipation of 
clouds and their interactions with solar radiation.

<p><li> Biogeochemical processes, which contribute to the formation, 
transport, and fate of trace gases and aerosols and their global 
distributions.

<p><li> Climatological processes, which govern the interactions of land 
and ocean surfaces with the atmosphere through the transport of 
water, heat, mass, and momentum.

<p><li> Geophysical processes, which have shaped and continue to 
modify the Earth's surface through volcanism and the melting of 
glaciers and ice sheets.</ul></blockquote>
<p>The USGCRP is participating in developing an international 
observation program to support measurements and research on 
atmospheric clouds, aerosols, water vapor, radiation budgets, and 
ozone, as well as on critical ocean and land parameters important to 
global change. The most comprehensive observation system in the 
USGCRP is the space-based Earth Observing System (EOS), which is 
being planned and implemented by U.S. scientists in cooperation with 
other nations. When implemented, following a series of launches 
scheduled between 1998 and 2014, EOS will consist of a series of 
polar-orbiting and low-inclination satellites providing global 
observations of the land surface, biosphere, solid Earth, atmosphere, 
and oceans for a minimum of 15 years. EOS will greatly enhance the 
ability to understand and predict the dynamics of many parts of the 
Earth system (see <a href="p52box.html">Critical Measurements to be 
Made by EOS</a> and <a href="p53box.html">EOS and Associated 
International Satellites and Mission Objectives</a>). Other space-
based sensors include weather satellites, satellites that measure 
ozone and other atmospheric chemicals, satellites that record global 
sea level with unprecedented accuracy, and radar systems that can 
observe the Earth's surface through cloud cover in order to record 
topography, soil moisture, sea-ice dynamics, and ocean temperatures.

<p>Space-based observations are complemented by surface-based 
systems that measure key Earth-system parameters such as 
greenhouse gases, aerosols, ozone, ultraviolet radiation, and critical 
variables of ocean-atmosphere-land system interactions. The U.S. 
collaborates with many nations to operate an extensive array of 
ocean monitoring instruments. An interagency UV monitoring 
network has been developed to provide intercalibrated UV data 
nationwide (see <a href="p7box.html">Interagency Cooperation</a>). 
Atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases and ozone-depleting 
substances are monitored through an informal worldwide network of 
in situ and flask-sampling sites. The U.S. also is developing a plan to 
establish a network of sites for long term observations and research 
on terrestrial and marine ecological systems. Existing USGCRP 
ecological observation systems are being considered for inclusion in 
this network. 

<h2><p align=center><a name="global">THE GLOBAL</a> CHANGE DATA 
AND INFORMATION SYSTEM</h2>

Global change research activities generate and require massive 
amounts of highly diverse data and information to document, 
understand, model, and assess global change. A major focus for data 
and information management efforts within the USGCRP is the 
development of the Global Change Data and Information system 
(GCDIS). The development of GCDIS is being coordinated with related 
activities within the U.S. Government, including those of the Federal 
Geographic Data Committee and the emerging National Information 
Infrastructure, in particular with the Government Information 
Locator Service. GCDIS will provide the infrastructure of the global 
change data and information management program. The GCDIS is a 
priority-driven system composed of individual agency systems made 
interoperable by the use of common standards and approaches, 
technology sharing, and <a href="p54box.html">data policy</a> 
coordination. The GCDIS functions include setting priorities for 
individual data and information sets, identifying and/or developing 
those sets, and incorporating them and the necessary related service 
into GCDIS. The USGCRP recently published the U.S. Global Change 
Data and Information System Implementation Plan. 

<p>GCDIS will also include a number of long-term, retrospective data 
sets that are critical for evaluating climate variability and for use in 
detecting global changes. These data sets include global data from 
historical marine meteorological observations, upper air 
observations, global and regional variations of temperature and 
precipitation, oceanographic observations, and baseline studies on 
atmospheric trace constituents, including aerosols and ozone. 
Retrospective data sets from Landsat, for example, have been 
invaluable for studying global land-cover change. 

<p>The Earth Observing System Data and Information System 
(EOSDIS), a component of GCDIS, is being built in an evolutionary 
manner to support launch of EOS platforms. EOSDIS is beginning to 
provide data sets through its Distributed Active Archive Centers 
(DAACs). Improvements scheduled for l996 will provide faster, more 
comprehensive user services and links to other global change data 
sets. EOSDIS is also providing access to existing long-term satellite 
data sets (Pathfinder data). Data from other major research 
programs, such as the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) 
program, are being incorporated as a component of GCDIS.

<h2><p align=center>RESEARCH ON THE HUMAN DIMENSIONS OF 
GLOBAL CHANGE AND TOOLS FOR CONDUCTING INTEGRATED 
ASSESSMENTS</h2>

<blockquote><ul><li><a href="p55box.html">Priorities for the Human 
Dimensions of Global Change Research</a></ul></blockquote>

As knowledge about the dynamics of global change increases, greater 
emphasis in the USGCRP has been placed on research on fundamental 
social and behavioral processes related to environmental change. U.S. 
research on the human dimensions of global change is coordinated 
with related efforts in other nations through the framework of the 
international Human Dimensions of Global Environmental Change 
Programme (HDP). Within the U.S., fundamental research is 
conducted on the economic, demographic, social, institutional, 
geographic, and human health-related aspects of global change. 
Attention is given to the processes through which human activities 
affect natural systems and the ways that humans respond to 
changing natural conditions. Among the most important forms of 
human-environmental interaction are transformations of the land 
surface, the product of the interaction between human land uses and 
natural processes that also alter land cover. 

<p>In addition to providing important understanding about the 
complex ways that human and natural systems interact with each 
other, USGCRP research has developed new tools and approaches to 
assist decision makers in thinking about global change. Several 
programs have supported the development and use of methods and 
models for integrated assessment of global change. Integrated 
assessments are a new approach for examining the complex 
interactions among the Earth's physical, biological, and human 
systems. Integrated assessments involve the effective linkage of 
quantitative models and other representations of different systems 
in ways that permit evaluation of the impacts of changes in one 
system on other systems. In addition to providing valuable 
information about the dynamics of change, integrated assessments 
can provide national and international decision makers in 
government and the private sector with a framework for identifying 
and evaluating the likely consequences of different alternatives. 
Among the topics on which research has focused are the 
development of rigorous modeling approaches that link physical, 
biological, and socioeconomic systems; meta-analyses of models and 
data; and the treatment of uncertainty and risk in integrated 
systems. 

<p>Human dimensions research also has focused on the processes, 
methodological tools, and formal models fundamental to the creation, 
implementation, and evaluation of environmental policies and other 
kinds of decisions. Among the methodological issues on which 
research has focused are the availability and reliability of data on 
human systems; the use of expert judgments in decision making; 
economic valuation of environmental resources; measures of 
sustainability; indicators of environmental quality; and the extraction 
of generalized relationships from case studies. Research projects also 
have examined the processes through which problems are identified 
and responses are outlined, implemented, and evaluated. Among the 
studies falling in this category are investigations of technological 
innovation and diffusion and the processes of international 
environmental negotiations. 

<h2><p align=center>GLOBAL CHANGE EDUCATION AND 
COMMUNICATION</h2>

An important goal of the USGCRP is to enhance knowledge about the 
state of the Earth system and the changes which are expected to 
occur. To achieve this goal, the USGCRP assists in training future 
scientists through supporting undergraduate, graduate and post-
doctoral research, as well as through the development of teacher-
training and curricular materials for K-12 educators. The USGCRP also 
sponsors public education efforts to provide people with scientific 
information about global environmental issues. Traditional education 
methods have been expanded to focus on multimedia communication 
and recognition of the complex interdisciplinary nature of global 
change science.

<p>The most important functions of interagency cooperation in global 
change education and communication are the encouragement of 
activities to educate and inform the public of progress in scientific 
research that increases human knowledge of society and its Earth-
system interactions. Specific elements of the strategy used to achieve 
this objective are to continue involvement of teachers and the 
general public in both formal and informal education activities 
through regionally focused programs; to emphasize an interactive 
approach to education through hands-on computational and 
experimental activities; and to continue supporting fellowships in 
undergraduate and graduate education to prepare the next 
generation of scientists. The education program also encourages the 
use of high-speed communications technologies to communicate new 
knowledge, and it promotes the dissemination of federal data and 
information on global change. 

<p>In addition, the USGCRP has established the Global Change 
Research Information Office (GCRIO) "to disseminate to foreign 
governments, businesses, and institutions, as well as citizens of 
foreign countries, scientific research information available in the 
United States which would be useful in preventing, mitigating, or 
adapting to the effects of global change," as called for in the 1990 
Global Change Research Act.  GCRIO also provides extensive 
information services to citizens and institutions within the United 
States.

<h1>International Cooperation</h1>

Understanding the fundamental nature of global change research requires world-
wide cooperation. For this reason, and in order to make the best use of 
available resources, the USGCRP cooperates extensively with other nations in a 
broad range of formal and informal global change research efforts.

<h2><p align=center>INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH PROGRAM</h2>

International scientific institutions have organized three cooperative global 
change research programs: (1) the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP), 
which is part of the World Climate Programme; (2) the International Geosphere-
Biosphere Programme (IGBP); and, (3) the Human Dimensions of Global 
Environmental Change Programme (HDP)<a href="fig58.gif">(see figure</a>). 
These and other international programs 
are coordinated at several levels, including scientist-to-scientist, agency-
to-agency, and government-to-government, through a broad range of multilateral 
and bilateral organizations and arrangements. The International Council of 
Scientific Unions (ICSU) provides strong leadership for scientific planning 
for many of the key international programs. The U.S. shares in funding ICSU's 
coordination of these activities, and U.S. scientists and agencies participate 
in and interact regularly with ICSU and related committees. U.S. agencies also 
work with their counterparts through informal international coordination 
groups, such as the International Group of Funding Agencies for Global Change 
Research (IGFA). IGFA recently completed a survey of international funding for 
global change research, which confirmed the leadership role of the U.S. in 
supporting this research.
<h2><p align=center>INTERNATIONAL ASSESSMENTS</h2>

International assessments document the current state of scientific 
understanding on global environmental issues through the involvement of 
thousands of scientists from more than 150 countries in reviews and analyses 
of recently published scientific literature. Recent assessments include the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) science assessments and the 
World Meteorological Organization (WMO)/United Nations Environment Programme 
(UNEP) Assessment of Stratospheric Ozone Depletion and Associated 
Environmental Impacts, Technology Development, and Economic Considerations. 

<p>In mid-1994, the IPCC released a Second Supplementary Report to the 1990 
IPCC Scientific Assessment, focusing on radiative forcing of the climate 
system. The IPCC expects to complete a second comprehensive assessment of 
climate change in late 1995. This assessment has been undertaken by three 
working groups. Working Group I, co-chaired by the United Kingdom and Brazil, 
is charged with assessing the state of science with respect to the climate 
system, including possible changes as a result of human activity. Working 
Group II, co-chaired by the United States and Zimbabwe, assesses potential 
impacts of, adaptation to, and mitigation measures for global change. Working 
Group III, co-chaired by Canada and South Korea, addresses cross-cutting 
issues, including the economic implications of climate change and of selected 
emissions scenarios. Many U.S. scientists have served as lead and contributing 
authors for chapters prepared by the three working groups.

<p>The USGCRP has established a small secretariat for IPCC-related activities. 
This secretariat staffs U.S. participation in IPCC activities and, in 
particular, supports the U.S. co-chairman of Working Group II. The USGCRP also 
assists in supporting U.S. authors and organizes the U.S. government review 
process for the 1995 IPCC assessments. This review process involves agencies, 
scientists, industry, business, and other interested stakeholders and groups, 
all of whom are invited to review and comment on the work of the IPCC and its 
working groups.

<h2><p align=center>INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTES</h2>

The USGCRP supports U.S. participation in the development of regional 
institutes that facilitate the conduct of collaborative global change research 
within regions and supports the augmentation of scientific and technological 
capacity in other parts of the world. Several emerging regional networks have 
been developed throughout the world, including ones in the Asia-Pacific region 
(APN), in Europe-Africa (ENRICH), and in the Americas. 

<p>Sixteen countries, including the U.S., have signed an agreement to 
establish the Inter-American Institute (IAI) for Global 
Change Research <a  href="fig61.gif">(see figure)</a>. Following the entry 
into force of the agreement in 1994, the IAI Conference of the Parties 
selected a Scientific Advisory Committee, an Executive Council, a site for the 
IAI Directorate (National Space Research Institute of Brazil), and an IAI 
Director. Regional cooperation fostered by 
the IAI is expected to promote optimal use of available resources for global 
change research and to augment the scientific capacity of the region. 
Scientific data and information provided by IAI researchers will be managed as 
a common resource for the region and should provide baseline information for 
use in regional planning.

<p>The international commitment to build capacities for global change research 
in the developing world is further reflected in the SysTem for Analysis, 
Research and Training (START), a joint effort of the HDP, IGBP, and WCRP. The 
START regional research networks promote focused research and training on 
regional issues of global importance, integrate and synthesize research 
results, and provide input to decision makers at national and regional levels.

<h2><p align=center>INTERNATIONAL COORDINATION OF GLOBAL CHANGE 
OBSERVATIONS</h2>

Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) - In order to coordinate global change 
observation programs undertaken by the U.S. and other nations, the World 
Meteorological Organization (WMO) has led efforts to organize a Global Climate 
Observing System (GCOS). The overall GCOS Plan and several related plans 
focusing on data and information management and on space-based observations 
are currently near completion. Because GCOS relies on national programs, both 
for planning and implementation, mechanisms to increase the flow of 
information about GCOS to participating countries have been initiated. The 
GCOS data and information system will be a comprehensive, distributed system 
that specifies procedures for collection, quality control, comparison of 
observations from different sources, dissemination, and utilization of all 
relevant data. Plans for observations concerned with the atmosphere, ocean, 
and land also are being coordinated with the WMO World Weather Watch and the 
Global Atmospheric Watch, the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS), and the 
Global Terrestrial Observing System (GTOS). Discussions are underway to 
develop plans for more complete integration of these different observing 
systems.
<p>Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) - The Committee on Earth 
Observation Satellites (CEOS), an informal international organization, is 
undertaking an analysis of all satellites, sensors, and data products in 
operation or planned over the next ten to fifteen years and the requirements 
of the major international scientific and intergovernmental user 
organizations. This study will establish priorities and provide an opportunity 
for CEOS members to voluntarily fill gaps and reduce overlaps. CEOS has 
prepared a future strategy document that calls for all CEOS participants to 
establish fully functioning interoperable user services and data systems with 
common functionalities over the next five years. CEOS also has adopted 
principles that promote increased access to and availability of satellite data 
for global change research.

<h1><p align=center>Highlights Of Recent USGCRP Research Results</h1>

The following section describes recent research results that represent 
scientific advances in addressing each of the four issues that are the current 
focus of the USGCRP. Thousands of scientists, researchers, and students, both 
nationally and internationally, contribute to the research results of the 
USGCRP. It often takes many small contributions before a major advance can be 
made in increasing human understanding of the Earth system and all its 
interactions. While it is impossible to list all of the projects and 
individual publications that have led to advancing this field of knowledge, 
this section highlights some of the recent results and accomplishments of 
USGCRP-supported research to provide a sense of the scope and depth of the 
increased understanding of the Earth system that is gained through this 
program. The research highlights in this chapter are organized by the current 
primary global change issue and science question addressed. For further 
information on any of these items, the reader may consult the one or two 
primary references given. Unfortunately, due to space limitations, all

<h1><center>APPENDIX A</h1>
<h2>The Proposed USGCRP Budget for Fiscal Year (FY) 
1996</h2></center>

<p>The FY 1996 interagency budget request for the USGCRP remains 
roughly constant at the FY1995 level of about $1.8 billion. The core 
USGCRP activities focus on developing a predictive understanding of 
climate change, stratospheric ozone depletion, natural variations in 
climates over seasons to years, and large&#45;scale changes in global 
land cover and in terrestrial and marine ecosystems.

<p>For comparison with earlier years, several changes deserve 
attention. Coincident with the establishment of the Committee on 
Environment and Natural Resources, NOAA now includes global 
change funding for the NOAA fleet of oceanographic vessels, the 
NOAA Corps that crews these vessels, the NOAA laboratories, and the 
National Undersea Research Program within the USGCRP budget. For 
FY 1995 and FY 1996, these expenses add $60.7M and $60.9M, 
respectively, to the Department of Commerce and to the overall 
USGCRP budget. For the Smithsonian Institution and EPA, several 
programs that were included in last year's total are now included 
under the purview of other CENR subcommittees and do not appear 
here. Another important adjustment has been made to recognize that 
NASA has assumed more responsibility for the Landsat program. As 
a result of these changes, comparisons with earlier fiscal years 
require a careful, program&#45;by&#45; program analysis. Such 
information is available upon request from the Office of the USGCRP.

<p>In addition to the focused USGCRP budget request which follows, 
the President's full FY 1996 global change budget request of about 
$2.15B includes funding proposed for NASA launch and satellite costs 
(about $50M in FY 95 and $80M in FY 96) and funding for DOE 
environmental technologies (about $245M in each year) and other 
minor additions related to programs within the Department of 
Transportation and the USDA.

<h2>Fiscal Year 1995-1996 USGCRP Budget by Program</h2>

The allocation of resources by program reflected in this table are estimates only and are subject to change based on discussions of scientific and programmatic priorities among CENR agencies, their individual advisory mechanisms, and the input of the national and international scientific communities.

<p>These budgets are for programs included in the focused budget of the USGCRP. In addition to these programs, the agencies conduct a broad range of additional activities, the results of which provide important contributing information for the USGCRP. A general description of focused and contributing programs in each of the agencies is also provided.

<h1><center>APPENDIX C</h1>
<h2>History of the USGCRP</h2></center>
<p><br>
<p>The U. S. Global Change Research Program was established in 1989 
to combine and coordinate the research and policy development 
interests of 15 departments and agencies of the U. S. Government and 
Executive Offices of the President. The USGCRP is organized under 
the auspices of the Subcommittee on Global Change Research (SGCR), 
which is one of the seven environmental issue subcommittees 
established by the Committee on Environment and Natural Resources 
(CENR) [which has replaced the Committee on Earth and 
Environmental Sciences (CEES)]. In turn, the CENR is one of the 9 
committees organized under the National Science and Technology 
Council (NSTC).

<p>The Subcommittee on Global Change Research includes 
representatives of the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce (the 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and National 
Institute of Standards and Technology), Defense, Energy, Health and 
Human Services (the National Institute for Environmental Health 
Sciences), Interior, Transportation, and State as well as the 
Environmental Protection Agency, the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration, the National Science Foundation, the Smithsonian 
Institution, the Tennessee Valley Authority, the intelligence 
community, the Office of Science and Technology Policy, the Council 
of Economic Advisers, and the Office of Management and Budget. 
<p>To implement the activities described in the USGCRP research 
framework, the SGCR has established Working Groups that bring 
together representatives of the participating agencies for regular 
consideration of program coordination, review of program plans, and 
development of plans for new projects and activities. The Chairs of 
these groups, along with the Chair and Vice-Chairs of the 
Subcommittee, form the Executive Committee of the USGCRP. To 
ensure effective Program integration across these activities, the 
SGCR established the Office of the USGCRP in July 1993. This office, 
which is staffed by the participating agencies and departments, is 
responsible for drafting of the annual edition of <em>Our Changing 
Planet</em> and periodic research plans, as well as facilitating the 
year-to-year planning and day-to-day coordination and 
communication needs of the Program.

<p>The planning, coordination, and execution of USGCRP research 
activities are carried out in close association with and in support of 
the science priorities of the international research community; 
particularly those put forth by the Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change (IPCC); the World Climate Research Programme 
(WCRP), the Human Dimensions of Climate Change Programme (HDP); 
and the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP). These 
efforts underpin the United States participation in and contribution 
to the international assessments related to aspects of global change. 
<p>The USGCRP maintains an active interaction with the National 
Academy of Sciences through its Board on Sustainable Development, 
its Committee on Global Change Research, and several other 
committees and panels of the National Research Council that 
interface with many of the international scientific research 
programs.
<p><br>
<h2><center>Program Evaluation</h2></center>

<p>The overall USGCRP is evaluated periodically for scientific merit 
and continued relevance to the policy process, both domestic and 
international, by the National Academy of Sciences. Their review 
draws representatives from academic, institutional, and industrial 
groups conducting global change research.

<p>Proposed and existing agency programs within the USGCRP are 
evaluated based on (i) their relevance and contribution to the overall 
USGCRP goal and objectives, including the needs of decision makers; 
(ii) scientific merit as documented by peer review; (iii) readiness for 
implementation and likelihood of early results; (iv) potential for 
and/or progress toward meeting Program milestones; (v) agency 
approval for inclusion in the USGCRP; and (vi) conformance to data 
and information management policies. The framework and evaluation 
criteria are an essential part of the program and budget development 
strategy of the USGCRP. They provide the structure through which the 
USGCRP evaluates and develops: (1) essential, high priority national 
and international components of the USGCRP in each fiscal year; and 
(2) the recommended budgets to support those critical components. 

<p>In addition to USGCRP review of the overall set of agency research 
programs, each agency is responsible for the review of individual 
projects within its programs. These reviews are almost exclusively 
based on an external peer-review process, which is deemed an 
important means of assuring continued program quality.

Program</A></H2>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="description"><i><b>Program Description and
Objectives</B></I></A></H3>
<H5>The U.S. Country Studies Program provides financial and
technical assistance to developing and transition countries for
climate change studies.  The program was announced by the
President prior to the United Nations Conference on
Environment and Development<A
HREF="http://infoserver.ciesin.org/datasets/unced/unced.html">
(UNCED)</A> in Brazil in 1992.  The first round of two-year
studies began in October 1993, and a second round followed in
October 1994.  <A HREF="country.html">Fifty-five countries</A> on
five
continents currently participate in the program.  Regional and
sectoral oversight for
this program is provided by the U.S. Country Studies Management
Team (CSMT). Each participating
country has both a U.S. Project Officer and its own Country Study
Coordinator. For a list of these country project contacts, see
the <A HREF="sc.html">Country Contacts</A> list.

<P>The participating countries are developing inventories of
their anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases, assessing
their vulnerabilities to climate change, evaluating response
strategies for mitigating and adapting to climate change,
formulating national climate change action plans, and performing
technology assessments. If you would like more information about
a specific sector or region, contact the <A
HREF="cspstaff.html">(CSMT)</A>.<BR>
<P>The program provides technical assistance to countries through
<A HREF="workshop.html">workshops</A>, guidance documents and
analytical tools, and consultations with technical experts.
<P>The objectives of the program are to assist countries as
they:<UL>
<LI>establish a process for developing and implementing
national policies and measures, including formulation of National
Communications
<LI>develop information to further national and international
discussions
<LI>support principles and objectives of the U.N. Framework
Convention on Climate Change</UL>
<P>The program recently initiated a new activity to help
countries prepare national climate change action plans and to
conduct technology assessments.  This component of the program
will support countries' efforts to build on the results of their
current studies in the compilation of their national
communications, which are required by the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change.  It also enables
countries to conduct in-depth evaluations of climate change
technology needs and opportunities to promote technology
diffusion.

<P>To help identify measures for these plans, countries will
conduct in-depth evaluations of potential applications and
markets for key energy and non-energy technologies. These
assessments will allow countries to develop suitable projects and
programs to promote the diffusion of these technologies.</H5>

<P>
<HR>
<H3><I><A NAME="nextphse.html">Next Phase: Support for National
Action Plans (SNAP)</A></I></H3><BR>
<P><H5> Nine countries are currently participating in the
"Support for National Action Plans (SNAP)" phase of the U.S. CSP.

These countries are China, Czech Republic, Egypt, Indonesia,
Mexico, Micronesia, Philippines, Russia, and Venezuela.  The
program will provide technical and financial support for the
preparation of National Action Plans to additional countries in
1996. These countries are Bangladesh, Bolivia, Bulgaria, Hungary,
Kazakstan, Tanzania, Thailand, Ukraine, and Uruguay. In this
phase the countries will prepare national climate
change action plans and perform technology assessments.
<P>
<P>National Climate Change Action Plans describe specific
policies and programs that countries will implement to reduce
anthropogenic GHG emissions, preserve GHG sinks, and adapt to the
potential impacts of climate change. The plan will describe
national economic and environmental impacts of these actions, and
include an implementation strategy that addresses the integration
of the plan with other national environmental or development
plans. Under the UNFCCC developed nations are required to prepare
and submit a national action plan as part of their national
communications to the FCCC Secretariat. Developing countries have
more flexibility on the content and schedule for their
communications, with most developing country communications due
in 1997 and 1998.

<H5><P>Through the U.S. Country Studies Program, 55 countries
will have completed greenhouse gas emission inventories,
vulnerability and adaptation assessments for various sectors, and
evaluations of mitigation options for energy and non-energy
sectors.  These assessments will generate a large volume of
information that will be of significant value not only to each
country, but also to the international scientific and policy
community.  Many countries have expressed interest in having the
U.S. CSP facilitate collaboration between countries in the
synthesis and distribution of key results and findings that
emerge from the studies. <BR>
<P>The U.S. CSP has established several resources to create
mechanisms for countries to disseminate their results and
identify common findings and conclusions in FY95.  The U.S. CSP
co-sponsors regional workshops and global conferences where
countries can present results and discuss common methodological
issues.  The U.S. CSP will work with countries and support the
preparation of several major synthesis reports and journal
articles that will describe key results and findings for each
major assessment topic and for the country studies as a whole. 
In addition, the U.S. CSP will help countries identify and take
advantage of other international opportunities to present and
publish their results.<BR>
<P>
<P>Where appropriate, the U.S. CSP also works with countries
to help prepare and update global databases in cooperation with
the IPCC, U.S. Global Change Research Program, UNFCCC
Secretariat, and other appropriate organizations.<BR>
<P>
<P>
<P>If you would like to receive copies of these reports, or if
you have questions about specific
sectors, contact <A HREF="cspstaff.html">the U.S. CSP</A>.<BR>
<P>The "Interim Report on Climate Change Country Studies" is
available from the U.S. CSP, as well as on the<A HREF="http://www.gcrio.org/CSP/IR/title.html"> worldwide web</A>. In addition, an Inventory database and reports on Inventory, Vulnerability and Adaptation, and Mitigation will be published and available in 1996. Final reports for country studies will also be available on-line from the <A HREF="http://solstice.crest.org/sustainable/csp/index.html"> Center for Renewable Energy and Sustainable Technology (CREST)</A> server.</H5>

<P><H5>The U.S. Country Studies Program houses a functional
library of policy and technical documents, databases, books,
maps, and other items to support development of climate change
assessments and national plans.  The documentation is drawn from
sources worldwide and concentrates on the major areas of country
studies: emissions inventory, vulnerability and adaptation
assessments, and climate change mitigation response options.  It
dispatches technical information to scientists, engineers and
analysts participating in the U.S. CSP worldwide. The U.S. CSP
encourages other countries and international organizations to
contribute materials and information to the library.  An on-line
catalog of  <A HREF="http://www.gcrio.org/usgcrp.html">library
resources</A> is available. Hard copies are also available from
the U.S. CSP.<BR>
<P>The U.S. CSP also maintains a <I>Current Publications List</I> of documents (technical reports, journal papers, books, proceedings, national reports and communications, guidance documents, and informational materials) provided by cooperators.

and copyright notice</title></head>
<body>
<strong>NOTICE:</strong>  The project that is the subject of this report 
was approved by the Governing Board of the National Research 
Council, whose members are drawn from the councils of the National 
Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering, and the 
Institute of Medicine.<p>

This report has been reviewed by a group other than the authors 
according to procedures approved by a Report Review Committee 
consisting of members of the National Academy of Sciences, the 
National Academy of Engineering, and the Institute of Medicine.<p>

The National Academy of Sciences is a private, nonprofit, self-
perpetuating society of distinguished scholars engaged in scientific 
and engineering research, dedicated to the furtherance of science and 
technology and to their use for the general welfare.  Upon the 
authority of the charter granted to it by the Congress in 1863, the 
Academy has a mandate that requires it to advise the federal 
government on scientific and technical matters.  Dr. Bruce Alberts is 
president of the National Academy of Sciences.<p>

The National Academy of Engineering was established in 1964, under 
the charter of the National Academy of Sciences, as a parallel 
organization of outstanding engineers.  It is autonomous in its 
administration and in the selection of its members, sharing with the 
National Academy of Sciences the responsibility for advising the 
federal government.  The National Academy of Engineering also 
sponsors engineering programs aimed at meeting national needs, 
encourages education and research, and recognizes the superior 
achievements of engineers.  Dr. Harold Liebowitz is president of the 
National Academy of Engineering.<p>

The Institute of Medicine was established in 1970 by the National 
Academy of Sciences to secure the services of eminent members of 
appropriate professions in the examination of policy matters 
pertaining to the health of the public.  The Institute acts under the 
responsibility given to the National Academy of Sciences by its 
congressional charter to be an adviser to the federal government 
and, upon its own initiative, to identify issues of medical care, 
research, and education.  Dr. Kenneth I. Shine is president of the 
Institute of Medicine.<p>

This work was sponsored by the federal agencies participating in the 
interagency Committee of Environment and Natural Resources (CENR) 
of the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC):  The 
Department of Housing and Urban Development, Department of 
Agriculture, Department of Defense, Department of Interior, National 
Science Foundation, National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration, Department of State, National Aeronautics and 
Space Administration, Department of Health and Human Services, 
Domestic Policy Council, Federal Emergency Management 
Administration, Tennessee Valley Authority, National Economic 
Council, Department of Energy, Department of Transportation, and 
Central Intelligence Agency.  "This report is funded 'in part' under

<h2>20 September 1995</h2>

<h2>Forum on Global Change Modeling</h2>

On 12-13 October 1994, a <a href=/ipcc/cover.html>Forum on Global Change 
Modeling</a> was held at the
invitation of the Subcommittee on Global Change Research (SGCR) to help
address requests from the White House Office of Science and Technology
Policy (OSTP) and from Congressman Dingell to the General Accounting
Office (GAO).<p>

The charge to those contributing to the Forum was to develop a brief statement
on the credibility of projections of climate change provided by General
Circulation Models (GCMs) as background for potential interpretation of model
results in the context of developing and considering national policy
options.  The focus of this effort was specifically on the climate
aspects of the entire global change issue - thus not on the emission
scenarios, the consequences of change to ecosystems and natural resource
systems, or the socio-economic implications and potential for responses.<p>

<h2>The U.S. Global Change Data and Information System 
Implementation Plan</h2>

Global change research activities generate and require massive 
amounts of highly diverse data and information.  These data and 
information are needed to document change, to improve 
understanding of global change processes, and to carry out integrated 
assessments of impacts on human affairs.  The Global Change Data 
and Information System (GCDIS) is being developed to archive, 
preserve and make available the vast amount of data on all aspects 
of global change.  The GCDIS is the set of individual Federal agency 
data and information systems linked together to make global change 
data easily accessible to researchers and others.<p>

The <a href=/GCDIS/iplan/tocgcdip.html>U.S. 
Global Change Data and Information System 
Implementation Plan</a> describes the specific interagency 
agreements and arrangements established to implement the GCDIS.  
The plan also discusses the services (for example, guides to data or 
data browsing capabilities) that will be available to users.  A 
comprehensive overview of agency implementation activities, and a 
schedule of reaching overall goals are presented in the <a 
href=/GCDIS/iplan/tocgcdip.html>GCDIS 
Implementation Plan</a><p>

The Federal agencies involved in the GCDIS are:<p>

<blockquote>
Department of Commerce<br>
Department of Defense<br>
Department of Energy<br>
Department of the Interior<br>
Environmental Protection Agency<br>
National Aeronautics and Space Administration<br>
National Science Foundation<br>
U.S. Department of Agriculture<p>
</blockquote>


<hr width=65% size=3>
<h2>The U.S. Interagency UV-Monitoring Network Plan</h2>

The <strong>U.S. Interagency UV-Monitoring Network Plan</strong> 
was developed by the USGCRP's Ultraviolet Radiation Panel 
Observations Working Group, which is comprised of Federal experts 
in UV monitoring and research, to:<p>
<ol><li>Establish guidelines for the U.S. Federal government UV-
monitoring community to ensure that the data collected at each site 
are accurate, intercalibrated and easily available to UV-data users 
through the use of common data archival and retrieval mechanisms.

<li>To inform decision makers, scientists, and other persons with an 
interest in U.S. Federal UV-radiation monitoring and research 
activities of the capabilities and plans of the agencies active in this 
field.</ol><p>

This plan is the first such integrated national plan for UV monitoring, 
and is the starting point for developing a national UV monitoring 
network.  The report includes:  An Executive Summary;   maps;  a 
listing of Members of the USGCRP UV Panel;   a Selected Reading List 
on UV Radiation Activities and Issues;  and, a listing of UV-related 
activity points of contact within the agencies of the USGCRP.<p>

<h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
Perhaps the most well known example of an emerging virus 
outbreak in the US in recent time is the "hantavirus", which is 
resident in rodent populations and can be transmitted from rodents 
to humans.  Hantavirus broke out in the southwestern US in 1993, in 
the aftermath of heavy spring rains following six years of drought.  
In the case of the hantavirus there was a relatively clear set of 
feedbacks leading to the outbreak of this virus.  Prolonged drought 
altered the ecological balance in the southwestern US by bringing 
about changes in the balance between the populations of rodent 
predators (coyotes, owls, snakes) and rodents, while the rains led to 
an abundance of rodent food (pinion nuts and grasshoppers). Rodent 
populations increased ten-fold from May, 1992 to May, 1993. 
Hantavirus was amplified and transmitted to humans as a 
consequence of environmental changes driven by a change in climate 
and climate variability.<p>

Dr. Epstein will  discuss the implications of climate change and the 
emergence of diseases and viruses such as the  hantavirus, dengue 
fever, ebola, cholera, malaria, and eastern equine encephalitis.  These 
"signals" of global change can be costly to health, commerce, tourism, 
and transportation.

<h3>SUMMARY</h3>
Temperature, precipitation, and humidity are critical determinants of 
breeding sites, generation times, and intrinsic parasitic incubation 
periods of disease vectors. Bioclimatic conditions interact with 
ecological thresholds to influence their geographical extent.  
Interannual climate fluctuations thus alter the altitudinal and 
longitudinal presence of many disease vectors by allowing the 
establishment of new breeding sites and bursts of disease carriers. 
Examples of such events include the 1994 drought in Puerto Rico, 
which led to a dengue fever upsurge (due to local securing of water). 
A wet spring also preceded dengue fever in Costa Rica and Fortaleza, 
Brazil.  Changes in the underlying climate are thus likely to 
contribute to the redistribution of disease vectors into new latitudes 
and new altitudes.<p>

While proliferating megacities and non-biodegradable containers 
provide the setting, the influence of climate must be viewed against 
the backdrop of social vulnerability.  Studies in Mexico demonstrate 
significant correlations of dengue fever with temperature and rain.  
Dengue fever has also appeared at higher altitudes in Costa Rica, 
Colombia, and India, than previously reported, as temperatures have 
warmed.  The northern extent of Aedes aegypti (dengue) in the US is 
now at approximately 35 &#176 N.  The National Weather Service 
projects climate conditions conducive for a significant increase of 
dengue fever in the southeastern US this summer.<p>

The occurrence of malaria also resurged in the 1980s and the pace 
continues to accelerate.  Ecological effects such as road building, 
clearing, and deforestation have played important roles in addition to 
climate.  In deforested areas of northern Honduras, cases of malaria 
rose from 20,000 in 1987 to 90,000 in 1993.  In Pakistan, annual 
incidence of malaria is highly correlated with temperature and 
rainfall variations, and the distribution of epidemics correlates well 
with the El Ni&#241 o signal.  Malaria transmission in the mountains 
of Rwanda  in 1987, an anomalously hot, wet El Ni&#241 o year, 
represented a geographic extension of malaria in altitude.  Malaria 
cases in Houston, Texas indicate the occurrence of malaria at higher 
latitudes than in recent years.  These clusters and emerging patterns 
of malaria are consistent with climate changes that favor the 
redistribution and spread of conditions conducive to malaria.  Models 
project that future climate change will extend these conditions much 
further into the Northern and Southern hemisphere.<p>

El Ni&#241 o warm events are associated with upsurges of cholera in 
Bangladesh, typhoid, shigellosis and hepatitis in South America (after 
flooding), viral encephalitides in Australia, and eastern equine 
encephalitis in Massachusetts.  Disease events across taxa appear to 
cluster during ENSO (El Ni&#241 o Southern Oscillation) years.<p>

Biography of Dr. Paul R. Epstein<p>

Dr. Epstein is on the faculty of the Harvard Medical School.  For the 
past five years he has also served as director of the Cambridge 
Hospital multidisciplinary AIDS program, and has been involved with 
HIV vaccine trials.  Dr. Epstein has served in medical, teaching, and 
research capacities in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, and has also 
recently coordinated and co-edited an eight-part series on health and 
climate change for The Lancet.  Dr. Epstein is a member of the 
Harvard School of Public Health Working Group on Emerging 
Diseases, a principal author of the chapter on health effects and 
climate change for the WHO/WMO/UNEP/IPCC intergovernmental 
assessment, and is a member of the federal government's Working 
Group on Emerging and Re-Emerging Infectious Diseases.  Dr. Epstein 
received his bachelor's degree from Cornell University in 1965, his 
MD from Albert Einstein College of Medicine in 1969, and received a 
master's degree in tropical public health from the Harvard School of 
Public Health in 1983. In 1986 Dr. Epstein was awarded the 
Community Service Award for his outstanding contributions to 
community health.<p>

Biography of Mary Gant<p>

Since 1987 Mary Gant has served as Assistant to the Director for 
Legislation at the National Institute for Environmental Health 
Sciences (NIEHS).  From 1984 to 1987 she served as a senior policy 
analyst with the White House Science Office.  Ms. Gant also served as 
a policy analyst in energy science and energy policy with the 
Department of Energy.

<title>NSF IPCC Working Group I Draft Report</title>
</head>
<body>
<a href = "http://gcrio.ciesin.org/"><img align = bottom src = "/gifs/gcrio-header.gif"></a>
<hr>
Federal Register Notice (submitted, expected to be published 
about May 1)

<h2>NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION</h2>

<strong>AGENCY:</strong> National Science Foundation<p>

<strong>ACTION:</strong> Notice of the availability of draft report 
and request for comment.<p>

<strong>SUMMARY:</strong> Working Group I of the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has prepared a 
draft Second Assessment on Climate Change. The IPCC Secretariat 
requires comments on this report from national governments so that 
the Secretariat can meet its obligations to member governments of 
the IPCC. The U. S. Government is expected to receive its copy of the 
draft assessment for formal government comment on May 8, 1995. 
The U. S. Subcommittee on Global Change  Research (SGCR) is 
responsible for coordinating the preparation of the comments of the 
United States Government. Through this notice, the SGCR is 
announcing the availability of the draft Second Assessment upon its 
receipt from IPCC and is requesting comments on the draft report by 
June 2, 1995 from experts and interested groups and individuals. 
These comments will be reviewed, combined, and incorporated as 
appropriate, in  the process of preparing the set of official U. S. 
comments to the IPCC.<p>

<strong>DATES:</strong> Written comments (hard copy and if possible 
on a 3.5 inch diskette in either Microsoft Word or WordPerfect 
format) on the draft Second Assessment should be received on or 
before June 2, 1995. The SGCR cannot extend this deadline because 
the member countries of the IPCC have established a strict timetable 
for the review process.<p>

<strong>ADDRESSES:</strong> Comments should be submitted either 
by mail to: IPCC WG I Comments, Office of the U. S. Global Change 
Research Program, 300 D Street, SW, Suite 840, Washington, DC 
20024, or by E-mail in ASCII format on Internet to:  
"wg1@usgcrp.gov".  A list of chapters making up the draft Second 
Assessment is included with this notice.  Review is sought by those 
individuals and groups having specific expertise or interest in the 
various aspects of the assessment. Copies of individual chapters 
making up the draft Second Assessment can be obtained by: (1) 
telephone request to Mr. Earley Green at (202) 651-8240; (2) 
sending E-mail to "office@usgcrp.gov"; (3) faxing a request to (202) 
554-6715; or (4) sending a letter to the USGCRP Office directed to Mr. 
Earley Green at the address shown above.<p>

<strong>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</strong> Dr. Michael 
C. MacCracken, Office of the U. S. Global Change Research Program, at 
202-651-8250.<p>

<h3>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</h3>

<h3>I. Background</h3>

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was jointly 
established  in 1988 by the United Nations Environment Programme 
and the World Meteorological Organization to conduct periodic 
assessments of the state of knowledge concerning global climate 
change. The IPCC has formed working groups  to study various 
aspects of climate change. Working Group I addresses the state of the 
science concerning what is happening and is projected to happen to 
the climate; Working Group II addresses the state of the science 
concerning  (i) vulnerability to and impacts of climate change and (ii) 
adaptation and mitigation strategies; and Working Group III 
addresses the state of science and understanding concerning 
economics and cross-cutting issues associated with climate change. 
Each Working Group is charged with issuing periodic assessments. 
The first Scientific Assessment of Climate Change, for example, was 
prepared in 1990. Working Group I provided a supplementary report 
in 1992 and a report on radiative forcing of climate change in 1994. 
Periodic assessment reports such as these provide a comprehensive 
statement of the state of knowledge concerning topics such as 
scientific information, environmental impacts, response strategies, 
and other issues concerning climate change.<p>

<h3>II. Public Input Process</h3>

The member countries of the IPCC have established a timetable that 
includes a brief period for comments from governments so that the 
IPCC Secretariat can meet its obligations for a timely completion of 
the  IPCC Second Assessment. The Subcommittee on Global Change 
Research is responsible for coordinating preparation of the U. S. 
Government response, and through this notice is seeking the views of 
experts and interested groups and individuals to help in the 
formulation of its response. Comments that are provided will be  
reviewed, integrated, and used, as appropriate, in the preparation of 
the official U. S. comments. An information sheet providing specific 
requests for formatting submissions will be provided with each 
mailing of a chapter. In this review process, the emphasis should be 
on providing detailed recommendations on specific chapters for 
which the reviewer has established expertise or interest. To be most 
useful, comments should be specific in suggesting wording changes to 
the text of a particular paragraph or chapter and, where appropriate, 
offer supporting information and peer-reviewed references 
supporting the proposed changes. Comments on the overall tone and 
scientific validity of the chapter and comments expressing agreement 
and disagreement with specific major points in the Executive 
Summary of the chapters are also solicited.  Reviewers should 
request for review those specific chapters of the draft IPCC Working 
Group I Second Assessment for which they have expertise or special 
interest. The materials available for review include 11 chapters and 
a Summary for Policymakers. In addition to a specific chapter, a copy 
of the draft Summary for Policymakers will be provided for each 
reviewer in order to provide an opportunity for the reviewer to 
consider the consistency of the chapter and the selection and 
representation of its major points in the draft Summary for 
Policymakers.<p>

<title>GCDIS Implementation Plan - Foreward</title>
<body>
<h2><p align=center>THE WHITE HOUSE
<p align=center>WASHINGTON</h2>

<h3><p align=center>February 14, 1995</h3>

I am pleased to release "The U.S. Global Change Data and Information 
System (GCDIS) Implementation Plan," a report of the Subcommittee 
on Global Change Research.<p>

The importance of effective management of data and information on 
global change has been highlighted by the U.S. Global Change 
Research Program.  Global change research activities generate and 
require massive amounts of highly diverse data and information.  
These data and information are needed to document change, to 
improve understanding of global change processes, and to carry out 
integrated assessments of impacts on human affairs.  Because global 
change issues are so broad, including human and natural forcing 
factors, ecological change, biodiversity, human interactions, and 
comprehensive assessments, a data and information management 
challenge is to archive, preserve, and make data available in a useful 
form for researchers and other stakeholders.  To help meet this 
requirement, a coordinated interagency Global Change Data and 
Information System (GCDIS) is being initiated.<p>

GCDIS coordination is between all the applicable elements of the 
federal government as well as with GCDIS's national and 
international user communities.  This user community spans the full 
range from K-12 educators to senior researchers and from 
governmental to non-governmental policy makers to public interest, 
commercial, and industrial organizations.<p>

The conceptual design for GCDIS has been developed through a 
number of National Academy of Sciences studies, U.S. Global Change 
Research Program reports, national data policy principles adopted in 
1991, and the 1992 GCDIS program plan that commits the agencies to 
its establishment.  Building upon these accomplishments, this GCDIS 
Implementation Plan describes the structure the agencies will use to 
provide the multifaceted coordination required to meet the needs of 
the broad spectrum of GCDIS users.<p>

I especially want to highlight the leadership of the Interagency 
Working Group on Data Management for Global Change (IWGDMGC) 
for developing and drafting this implementation plan.  Additionally, 
this Plan required the active help and support of all the participating 
agencies and of the Committee on Geophysical and Environmental 
Data of the National Academy of Sciences.<p>

Sincerely,<p>

John H. Gibbons<br>
Assistant to the President for Science and Technology<p>

<title>GCDIS Implementation Plan - Executive Summary</title>
<body>
<h2>Executive Summary</h2>

The United States Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) was 
established to observe, understand, and predict global change, and to 
make its results available for use in policy matters. Fundamental to 
the understanding and prediction of global change and its associated 
human impacts is the timely availability, in useful forms, of the data 
and information required to conduct the research, develop the 
models, and make the assessments required. Much of these data and 
information originates in many separate programs of agencies of the 
Federal Government.<p>

Activities of the USGCRP are coordinated by the Committee on 
Environment and Natural Resources Research (CENR). Because data 
and information are of fundamental importance to the USGCRP, the 
Committee on Earth and Environmental Sciences, which has been 
superseded by the CENR, published the U.S. Global Change Data and 
Information Management Program Plan in 1992 in which the 
participating Federal agencies committed to work with each other, 
with academia, and with the international community to make it as 
easy as possible for researchers and others to access and use global 
change data and information. The program plan was based on 
guidance received during a number of years from the user 
community and especially from the Committee on Geophysical and 
Environmental Data of the National Academy of Sciences. This 
document builds on that program plan to define the implementation 
of a Global Change Data and Information System (GCDIS).<p>

The GCDIS is the set of individual agency data and information 
systems supplemented by a minimal amount of crosscutting new 
infrastructure, and made interoperable by use of standards, common 
approaches, technology sharing, and data policy coordination. The 
GCDIS user community extends from global change researchers to 
other researchers, policymakers, educators, private industry, and 
private citizens. Through the GCDIS, this user community will be able 
to learn what data and information are available, have the key 
holdings available in useful forms with ready access, and be assured 
of their quality and continued availability. This U.S. Global Change 
Data and Information System Implementation Plan documents the 
specific interagency agreements and arrangements established to 
implement the GCDIS.<p>

The individual agency components of the GCDIS are funded through 
their respective budgets. There will be neither a lead agency nor a 
separately funded budget for the GCDIS. Interagency GCDIS 
implementation coordination will be through the Interagency 
Working Group on Data Management for Global Change (IWGDMGC), 
serving as the panel for the USGCRP Working Group on Data and 
Information Management. Where commonality or interoperability is 
essential for the GCDIS, the agencies will make decisions in concert.
Under this implementation plan, all data and information functional 
activities are the responsibility of individual agencies. The global 
change data and information management program adds the 
following multiagency capabilities:<p>

<ul><li>Coordinated response to the needs of the other management 
elements of the USGCRP and of its overarching themes;
<li>Full involvement of users in GCDIS development, operation, and 
management;
<li>Provision to users of a view of all priority data and information 
regardless of source (agency, university, state, or international), type 
(digital, analog, or text), or whether or not the data or information 
were obtained through the focused programs of the USGCRP;
<li>Provision to users of the ability to identify, search, view, order, 
and (where possible) take electronic delivery of all data managed 
under this plan through access to any single agency system;
<li>Coordination of archiving and data product production 
activities, including production of data and information products that 
combine multidisciplinary data sets, to provide both continuity and 
the highest possible quality; and
<li>Coordination of budget and system planning under the 
CENR.</ul><p>

Essential to these capabilities are the adoption and implementation of 
data and information management standards, adherence to common 
data and information policies governing user access, and the 
development and implementation of additional data and information 
system functionality necessary to provide interoperability of the 
multiple agency systems. The following principles guide the 
implementation.<p>

<h3>Implementation Drivers</h3>

<ul><li>There will be consistency with USGCRP research and policy 
priorities.
<li>The implementation will be driven by research, policy, and 
other user requirements.
<li>User satisfaction and extent of use will be employed to assess 
the success of the system and to guide its evolution.
<li>Individual agency-managed implementation efforts within a 
framework for cooperation will be provided by the implementation 
plan.
<li>There will be an open and extensible system architecture that 
plans for evolution and provides pointers to all priority data and 
information that are available with user support.
<li>Multilevel, multipath access that recognizes the needs of 
individual user communities will be available to users.
<li>Easy access to data and information resources, such as those 
maintained by States, other countries, and national and international 
organizations, will be facilitated by the adoption of locator technology 
freely available on the international Internet.</ul><p>

<h3>Funding Assumptions</h3>

<ul><li>Resource requirements for the focused program activities of 
the individual agencies for data and information management have 
been included in USGCRP planning.
<li>A USGCRP program will be implemented to provide access 
through the GCDIS to large quantities of priority data and 
information obtained by programs outside the global change 
program.
<li>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration will seek 
funding to provide the information services to enable users to locate 
data and information across the full set of agency systems.
<li>The network interconnection of the agency systems and their 
connection to the user community will be provided by the High 
Performance Computing and Communications Program and the 
National Research and Education Network.
<li>The pace and level of the GCDIS implementation will be limited 
by the availability of resources in each of the participating 
agencies.</ul><p>

<h3>Implementation Approach</h3>

<ul><li>The GCDIS implementation will ensure that the data and 
information priorities for the necessary aspects of the USGCRP are 
established. 
<li>The GCDIS will be built upon many other agency programs that 
are vital to the USGCRP as a source of data and information, as well 
as of systems infrastructure without degrading the services those 
programs are now providing. 
<li>GCDIS implementation will use and build upon the agency 
infrastructure and technology developed to meet agency-specific 
requirements.
<li>Federal Information Processing Standards and national and 
international standards will be used wherever possible to promote 
interoperability, extensibility, and capability for evolution.
<li>Agencies will implement procedures to ensure that the priority 
data and information resulting from their funding of individual 
global change researchers are made available to the GCDIS in forms 
useful to the user community.
<li>Libraries and information centers, with their data and 
information resources, services, and standards, will be an integral 
part of the GCDIS.
<li>Global change data and information will be accessed 
electronically through the Internet and its successor network, and 
will be distributed by a variety of methods.</ul><p>

Each of the participating agencies will play a role appropriate to its 
agency mission, consistent with the funds available to it. Brief 
descriptions of each agency's role follow. Each agency will implement 
the GCDIS at its own pace.<p>

<strong>The Department of Agriculture (USDA)</strong> will identify 
data and information among its holdings that are of value to the 
global research program and make these metadata available through 
the standard locator approach defined by the IWGDMGC.<p>

<strong>The Department of Commerce (DOC)</strong> will provide 
user access to global National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration (NOAA) and DOD environmental data and information 
of value to the USGCRP through the interoperable NOAA Data and 
Information System; it also will provide access to the census data and 
information.<p>

<strong>The Department of Defense (DOD)</strong> will make 
unclassified and unrestricted data and information and limited 
metadata available to appropriate U.S. national archives; agencies 
receiving DOD data products will assume the responsibility for GCDIS 
functions (i.e., archive, directory, distribution, network, and user-
support functions).<p>

<strong>The Department of Energy (DOE)</strong> will provide access 
to data and information from its programs through a set of individual 
data and information systems focused on specific data bases to which 
interoperable functionality will be added.<p>

<strong>The Department of the Interior (DOI)</strong> will provide 
access to data and information from its programs and other sources 
for which the DOI is custodian through standard locator technology 
among data and information systems of DOI bureaus. GCDIS 
interoperability beyond the locator level initially will be provided at 
the U.S. Geological Survey's Earth Resources Observation Systems 
Data Center and may be added to other systems.<p>

<strong>The Department of State</strong> will maintain and 
coordinate links with intergovernmental organizations and United 
Nations technical agencies having programs relevant to the GCDIS. A 
high-priority objective is to promote wide adoption of a policy of full 
and open sharing of global change data in multilateral forums, as 
well as in bilateral agreements.<p>

<strong>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)</strong> will 
initially provide its data and information produced under the USGCRP 
through other participating agencies and then will develop a unified 
electronic data and information system to make other relevant data 
and information from agency activities available.<p>

<strong>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration 
(NASA)</strong> will make all the data and information from its 
Mission to Planet Earth available on an interoperable basis through 
the Earth Observing System Data and Information System and will 
seek funding to develop, as needed, the interoperable functionality 
for implementation by all participating agencies. NASA will provide 
also for the data and information archiving and management, where 
needed, of socioeconomic data and information through its 
Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center.<p>

<strong>The National Science Foundation (NSF)</strong>, from the 
National Center for Atmospheric Research, the Long-Term Ecological 
Research (LTER) program, and the Center for Ecological Analysis and 
Synthesis in Environmental Biology, will provide access to archived 
data and information through an existing data system to which 
interoperability will be added. An electronic data system for data 
and information from the LTER sites will be developed. Researchers 
funded by the NSF will be required to make available all global-
change-relevant data and information developed in the performance 
of publishable research through one of the participating data 
systems.<p>

GCDIS participation will be broadened to include other agencies with 
data and information needed for the USGCRP. To encourage such 
participation, the GCDIS is planned as a system that an agency can 
join with only a modest commitment. Later, the agency can work 
toward a fuller implementation of the information service objectives 
of the GCDIS. While the desirable level of enhanced participation will 
involve provision by the agency of the full suite of metadata 
appropriate for their data and information, the minimal requirement 
for agency participation will be<p>

<ul><li>Availability of data or information relevant to global change,
<li>Directory-level metadata describing these data or information,
<li>A credibly permanent commitment to maintaining these data 
and information and making them available,
<li>Interoperability with the rest of the GCDIS sufficient to make 
its directory-level information accessible from any other GCDIS 
entity, and
<li>User support for the data or information by somebody.</ul><p>

Because of the evolving nature of the USGCRP, of which the IWGDMGC 
is an integral part, this implementation plan will be updated as 
necessary to reflect program changes and accomplishments. With 
these updates, the implementation plan will provide the basis for 
individual agency implementation plans, some of which have already 
been initiated. By the activities included in this implementation plan, 
the resources of the agencies, the power of new technologies, and the 
capabilities of users and the international community will be brought 
to bear on providing the global change data and information needed 
by users to understand global processes critical to human well-being 
on Earth.

<title>GCDIS Implementation Plan - Chapter 1</title>
<body>
<a href=tocgcdip.html>
<img align=bot alt="Back to Table of Contents"

<h1>1.  Introduction</h1>
<img src=gifs/bluegrad.gif>

The United States Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) was 
established to observe, understand, and predict global change, and to 
make its results available for use in policy matters. To meet this goal, 
the USGCRP researchers must investigate issues that extend across 
traditional disciplines. The data and information needed include both 
discipline-specific and assimilated data sets that are combinations of 
data and information from disciplines that range from the 
geophysical and biological sciences to economics and social sciences. 
These data and information will result from physical observations, 
sociological surveys, or model results, and will transcend agency and 
national boundaries. Thus, the data and information management 
component of the USGCRP is challenged to build upon existing data 
center structures to create a more comprehensive and versatile 
resource.<p>

In 1992, the Committee on Earth and Environmental Sciences (CEES) 
published the <em>U.S. Global Change Data and Information 
Management Program Plan</em> to address these challenges. In that 
plan, agencies participating in the USGCRP committed program 
resources (consistent with their roles and missions) to the goal of an 
interagency global change data and information management 
program, consistent across agencies, that involves and supports 
university, international, and other user communities. This present 
document uses that plan to define the implementation of a Global 
Change Data and Information System (GCDIS). It defines the 
interagency mechanisms that will be established to coordinate the 
efforts of individual agencies involved in implementing the GCDIS, 
overall timetables, and agency-by-agency overviews with schedules 
of the implementation efforts. This GCDIS implementation plan will 
evolve through regular updates to reflect changing USGCRP research 
priorities, agency plans, technology advancements, program 
accomplishments, and the changing needs of global change data and 
information users.

<h2><a name=GCDIS>The Global Change Data and Information 
System</a></h2>

The goal of the U.S. Global Change Data and Information Management 
Program is to make it as easy as possible for researchers and others 
to have ready access to and use of global change data and 
information. To achieve this goal, the USGCRP agencies are organizing 
the GCDIS, which builds upon the mission resources and 
responsibilities of each agency and links the data and information 
services of the agencies to each other and to the users.<p>

The use of the word <em>system </em> in GCDIS embraces the full 
range of people, infrastructure (e.g., hardware, software, networks, 
telephones, mail), and procedures for identifying, assembling, 
documenting, archiving, and disseminating that as a whole can 
provide users with data and information services.<p>

The GCDIS is the set of individual agency data and information 
systems supplemented by a minimal amount of crosscutting new 
infrastructure, and made interoperable by use of standards, common 
approaches, technology sharing, and data policy coordination. Thus, 
portions of each agency's own data and information system will be 
that agency's component of the GCDIS, and the GCDIS will emerge 
through this coordinated interagency participation. Some agencies 
may arrange to have other agencies assume responsibility for 
selected aspects of their GCDIS-related functions. This is how 
Department of Defense (DOD) data will be made available to the 
GCDIS.

<h2><a name=Scope>Scope</a></h2>

The scope of the GCDIS implementation effort is described in this 
plan in terms of the user community it serves, its data and 
information content, and the access services it provides. Each of these 
will be discussed in more detail later in this plan.

<h3>User Community</h3>

The primary users of the GCDIS are the global change researchers in 
agencies, academia, and the international community who conduct 
process research, integrative modeling and prediction investigations, 
and science assessment studies; researchers, policymakers, and 
educators who assess the state of global change and global change 
research to provide information for policy decisions; and the 
public.<p>

The level of services, data, and information each class of user 
requires will vary significantly. For example, process researchers will 
more likely need large samples of raw data that may include 
combinations of data streams from several experiments or 
observational systems. Assessment studies will include the synthesis 
of the output of models that, for example, may characterize the world 
economy, atmospheric chemistry, ocean circulation, ecological 
systems, and social preferences and dynamics. Policymakers more 
likely will seek summarized and evaluated information, much of 
which will be in the form of text, graphs, and tables.<p>

The GCDIS user community also extends to those agencies, programs, 
projects, individuals, and others that are sources of the data and 
information in the GCDIS and for which the GCDIS will provide 
archiving and distribution. The GCDIS services required by each of 
the different types of users will differ, but have many aspects in 
common. 

<h3>Data and Information Content</h3>

The scope and priorities for GCDIS data and information content are 
driven by the data and information required to carry out current and 
planned USGCRP activities. The scope of data and information for the 
GCDIS comprises the Earth science data holdings (including in situ 
and satellite) of the agencies, selected analyzed and assimilated data 
sets, selected output from global change models, published 
documents, and socioeconomic data and information (including the 
areas of population, economic systems, and political systems and 
institutions) necessary for the study of human dimensions of global 
change. A large fraction of these data and information will come from 
contributing sources rather than from the focused global change 
research program.<p>

The USGCRP encompasses the geophysical, geochemical, biological, 
social, and economic sciences and the research involved with 
integrated assessments of environmental policy issues. Of these areas 
of activity, however, only a subset of the geosciences has a tradition 
of institutional support for data and information services provided 
through data centers. The other disciplines, having no such traditions, 
presently lack the funding or other incentives to build this structural 
capability. This difference is reflected by the near-term 
implementation emphasis in this plan on geophysical data and 
geophysical data centers.<p>

For the longer term, agencies face a significant task simply to 
identify the vast array of data and information they currently hold 
that would contribute toward a better understanding of the 
environment. Following this identification, based on the highest 
priority areas of interest, the task is to design and subsequently 
implement data and information services adequate to support the 
full breadth of the USGCRP. To start this process, the agencies plan to 
implement several pilot projects that are intended to broaden the 
scope of the GCDIS beyond its present emphasis on geophysical data 
and information. 

<h3>Data and Information Access Services</h3>

The scope of the data and information access services to be provided 
by the cooperative action of agency elements of the GCDIS includes 
user service procedures; generic and specialized user interfaces; a 
hierarchical structure with multiple points of access for identifying 
relevant data and information sets including directory, guide, and 
inventory information, library and information center resources, and 
browse products; data dictionary; search and order functions; data 
formats for users; and standards for distribution media and user 
documentation.

<h2>International Context</h2>

The GCDIS is designed to permit extension to international data and 
information holders, providers, and users. An important means to 
access international data and information will be provided initially 
through existing agency participation in the World Data Center 
system. This system, conceived and fostered by the International 
Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU), is responsible for archiving and 
exchanging important environmental data and information among 
almost all nations. A number of agency data centers associated with 
the implementation of the GCDIS currently has responsibility under 
this system for a broad range of important global change data and 
information. All GCDIS archive sites will be linked to agency data 
centers with World Data Center status. 

<h2><a name=Impl>Implementation Principles</a></h2>

The data and information management program will be implemented 
in the context of the following set of high-level principles.

<h3>Implementation Drivers</h3>

<ul><li>There will be consistency with USGCRP research and policy 
priorities.
<li>The implementation will be driven by research, policy, and 
other user requirements.
<li>User satisfaction and extent of use will be employed to assess 
the success of the system and to guide its evolution.
<li>Individual agency-managed implementation efforts within a 
framework for cooperation will be provided by the implementation 
plan.
<li>There will be an open and extensible system architecture that 
plans for evolution and provides pointers to all priority data and 
information that are available with user support.
<li>Multilevel, multipath access that recognizes the needs of 
individual user communities will be available to users.
<li>Easy access to data and information resources, such as those 
maintained by States, other countries, and national and international 
organizations, will be facilitated by the adoption of locator technology 
freely available on the international Internet.</ul>

<h3>Funding Assumptions</h3>

<ul><li>Resource requirements for the focused program activities of 
the individual agencies for data and information management have 
been included in USGCRP planning.
<li>A USGCRP program will be implemented to provide access 
through the GCDIS to large quantities of priority data and 
information obtained by programs outside the global change 
program.
<li>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) 
will seek funding to provide the information services to enable users 
to locate data and information across the full set of agency systems.
<li>The network interconnection of the agency systems and their 
connection to the user community will be provided by the High 
Performance Computing and Communications Program (HPCC) and 
the National Research and Education Network (NREN).
<li>The pace and level of the GCDIS implementation will be limited 
by the availability of resources in each of the participating 
agencies.</ul>

<h3>Implementation Approach</h3>

<ul><li>The GCDIS implementation will ensure that the data and 
information priorities for the necessary aspects of the USGCRP are 
established. 
<li>The GCDIS will be built upon many other agency programs that 
are vital to the USGCRP as a source of data and information, as well 
as of systems infrastructure without degrading the services those 
programs are now providing. 
<li>GCDIS implementation will use and build upon the agency 
infrastructure and technology developed to meet agency-specific 
requirements.
<li>Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) and national 
and international standards will be used wherever possible to 
promote interoperability, extensibility, and capability for evolution.
<li>Agencies will implement procedures to ensure that the priority 
data and information resulting from their funding of individual 
global change researchers are made available to the GCDIS in forms 
useful to the user community.
<li>Libraries and information centers, with their data and 
information resources, services, and standards, will be an integral 
part of the GCDIS.
<li>Global change data and information will be accessed 
electronically through the Internet and its successor network, and 
will be distributed by a variety of methods.</ul>

<h2><a name=Meas>Measures of Success</a></h2>

In order to help evaluate how well the GCDIS is meeting the data and 
information management needs of the USGCRP community, a set of 
criteria for measuring the success of the GCDIS has been established. 
Such means of evaluation are critical both for identifying and 
resolving problem areas and for helping guide the evolution of the 
GCDIS. The criteria themselves will evolve based on experience with 
their use and changes of the constraints and environment within 
which the GCDIS must function. The criteria are as follows:<p>
<pre>
<ul><li>Satisfaction of users by	To help assess user's perception
each user category		perception of the GCDIS

<li>Rate of increase in the		To assess the rate of growth of the
number of repeat users in	number of users who find the GCDIS
each category			important enough for their work that
				they continue to use it

<li>Fractional use of the GCDIS	To help assess GCDIS coverage and

				and information

<li>Satisfaction of the other	To assess how well the GCDIS meets the
program elements of the 	programmatic needs of the 
USGCRP
</ul></pre><p>

The user categories for these evaluations will evolve, but initially 
they will be research (physical, biological, human dimensions), 
assessment and policy, operations, education, and 
international.</ul><p>

<a href=tocgcdip.html>
<img align=bot alt="Back to Table of Contents"

<h1>2. Implementation Coordination</h1>
<img src=gifs/bluegrad.gif>


Implementing the GCDIS elements will be a cooperative effort by the 
agencies involved, with individual agencies being responsible for 
managing their own implementation efforts within a framework of 
coordination by the agencies. The individual agency components of 
the program are funded through their respective budgets. There will 
be no lead agency or separately funded budget for program 
coordination. Program leadership for GCDIS implementation will be 
provided at two levels. At the highest level, program advocacy, 
evaluation and problem resolution will continue to be the domain of 
the Interagency Working Group on Data Management for Global 
Change (IWGDMGC), serving as the USGCRP Data and Information 
Working Group (see <a href = "gifs/fig1.gif">Figure 1</a>). On a day-to-day 
basis, program monitoring and coordination with the research 
components of the USGCRP will be provided by the associate scientist 
for data located in the USGCRP program office.<p>

Implementation of the GCDIS will be embedded in each agency's 
implementation plan or upgrade of its own data and information 
system. This GCDIS implementation plan will provide an overall view 
of agency efforts, showing how they fit within the overall program 
implementation. Individual agency implementation plans will contain 
specific details for the agency elements involved in GCDIS, including 
linkage with international programs and institutions. GCDIS 
implementation must be consistent with USGCRP research priorities 
as reflected in agency plans and with the required services that flow 
from those plans.<p>

Closely synchronized implementation across the agencies is neither 
required nor practical. Agency missions vary, and not all agencies 
will be active in all of the GCDIS functional areas at the same time. 
Each agency may retain as much autonomy as is necessary. Where 
commonality or interoperability is essential for the GCDIS, decisions 
affecting the content or access system functionality will be taken by 
the IWGDMGC agencies in concert. The GCDIS will be open and 
extensibile. This chapter describes the management and coordination 
of the program.

<h2><a name=Program>Program Management</a></h2>

The Global Change Research Act of 1990 prescribed that the activities 
of the USGCRP were to be coordinated by the CEES. The CEES has been 
superseded by the Committee on Environment and Natural Resources 
Research (CENR). The data and information management component 
of the USGCRP reports to the CENR Global Change Research 
Subcommittee through the Working Group on Observations and Data 
Management (see <a href=gifs/fig1.gif>Figure 1</a>). The global change 
data and information management program is coordinated at the 
working level by a standing group of agency representatives, one 
from each participating agency, a chairperson, and outside experts as 
needed. This group, the IWGDMGC, is responsible for program 
implementation and represents the agencies in budget coordination 
and planning for the data and information component of the 
USGCRP.<p>

Policies relevant to global change data and information will be 
reflected in individual agency implementation plans and collectively 
in the GCDIS implementation plan. In particular, the principles 
endorsed in the <em>Data Management for Global Change Research 
Policy Statements</em> <a href=tab1gcdip.html> (Table 1)</a> 
provide a high-level framework for GCDIS implementation. Agencies 
participating in the USGCRP will develop corresponding internal 
policies and procedures that conform to the Data Policy Statements. 
The interagency coordination for GCDIS implementation will ensure 
that the collective efforts of the agencies result in the fulfillment of 
national policy requirements. For example, U.S. data policy requires 
that there should be at least one explicitly designated archive for 
each and every global change data parameter and that a 
clearinghouse should be established to prevent the purging and loss 
of important data sets. This plan provides for these national 
capabilities as well as others specified by the data policy statements 
(see chapters <a href=ch4gcdip.html>4</a> and <a 
href=ch5gcdip.html>5</a>).<p>

As currently established by the CENR, guidance, review, and 
oversight of the USGCRP is provided by the NAS Board on Global 
Change and other relevant committees of the Academy. The 
Committee on Geophysical and Environmental Data, working with the 
Board on Global Change, serves this function for the data and 
information management component of the USGCRP.

<h2>GCDIS Operations</h2>

The GCDIS is an evolving distributed data and information 
management system that will initially consist of interconnected, 
loosely organized agency data and information centers. As the GCDIS 
evolves, the system will improve its connectivity, performance, and 
responsiveness to user requirements.<p>

No one agency is in charge of the GCDIS. The GCDIS operates by 
participating agencies providing data content and data access 
services that have been identified, recommended, and coordinated 
through the IWGDMGC. The IWGDMGC is responsible for GCDIS 
implementation. This responsibility is carried out by IWGDMGC 
agency contacts, subgroups of the IWGDMGC, and the IWGDMGC 
Executive Secretary. The Associate Scientist for Data also provides 
coordination with the IWGDMGC in GCDIS requirements and 
implementation activities. <a href = "gifs/fig2.gif">Figure 2</a> shows the 
GCDIS implementation organization, and the organization that will be 
in place during initial operations of the GCDIS. Descriptions of specific 
data and information centers begin on <a 
href=ch6gcdip.html#Agency>page 83</a>.<p>

Users will be able to interact directly with the GCDIS at various levels 
of sophistication, ranging from a simple phone call to a data center to 
online search, browse, and network data set transfers. Initially, a 
user services group or contact at agency data centers, information 
centers, and libraries will provide assistance, guidance, and 
information. The extent of user services will vary within and 
between agencies, and will be improved in response to user needs 
and current technology.<p>

For GCDIS-related content and access matters at the interagency 
level, users will also be able to contact the appropriate IWGDMGC 
agency representative, subgroup chairs, and agency contact 
members, or the IWGDMGC Executive Secretary concerning GCDIS 
problems, information, and comments. In addition, there will be a 
bulletin board system for users to get the latest information about 
the GCDIS, make suggestions, and request special interagency 
products and services.

<h2><a name=GCDIS>GCDIS Coordination</a></h2>

The IWGDMGC, through agency representatives, maintains the GCDIS 
implementation plan and coordinates data and information 
implementation activities of participating agencies. This coordination 
includes tracking the progress of individual agency implementation 
efforts - each managed within the agency - against the overall 
implementation plan. The IWGDMGC identifies problems and 
recommends actions to facilitate implementation.<p>

The USGCRP has been organized around four interconnected streams 
of activity: observations and data management, integrative modeling 
and prediction, process research, and assessments. These activity 
streams, coupled with a supporting stream focused on 
communicating the findings to the public and to students, continue to 
provide a sound basis for carrying out an encompassing scientific 
program and are suited to strengthening the coupling to evaluation, 
assessment, and policy analysis. This functional architecture is 
depicted in Figure 1, which illustrates the interconnections among 
these streams of activity and the growing links to policy 
development.<p>

Within this structure, the participating USGCRP agencies continue to 
maintain control of their budgets. The CENR, through the 
Subcommittee on Global Change Research (SGCR), provides the 
interagency coordination, implementation, management, and 
oversight, including the interagency review of programmatic needs 
and budgets.<p>

This coordination mechanism will facilitate interagency cooperation 
and will help ensure completeness of coverage of USGCRP high-
priority needs, including links to crucial data and information from 
outside the USGCRP programs. To help this effort, full-time, collocated 
associate scientists for each of the areas (observations and data 
management, process research, integrative modeling and prediction, 
and assessments) have been assigned to the Office of the USGCRP.<p>

IWGDMGC GCDIS coordination will focus on two primary areas: data 
content and data access. Data content issues address data and 
information content, metadata, documentation, user coordination and 
related areas (<a href=ch4gcdip.html>Chapter 4</a>). A Data Content 
Subgroup will be responsible for coordinating these aspects of the 
GCDIS. Data access issues address how users gain access to the data 
and information of the GCDIS (<a href=ch5gcdip.html>Chapter 5</a>). 
Data access issues will be coordinated by the combined efforts of the 
Catalog, Networks, Standards, and Libraries Subgroups.<p>

Successful implementation of the GCDIS includes appropriate use of 
standards for both the enabling technology and applications-specific 
content. Wherever possible, there will be full coordination with 
existing standards bodies, and implementation of existing standards 
will be used. A Standards Subgroup will work on both data content 
and access issues and will recommend appropriate standards for 
adoption by the IWGDMGC.<p>

Direct coordination among agencies is essential for achieving program 
goals. For example, those agencies upgrading or developing their own 
data and information systems as their components of the GCDIS will 
coordinate the technical details of the design and implementation of 
their systems within the framework provided by this 
implementation plan. Agencies are encouraged to invite other 
agencies engaged in parallel efforts to participate, where practical, in 
specific design choices or implementation decisions to help realize 
the interoperability required for the GCDIS.<p>

Each agency will attempt to incorporate GCDIS recommendations into 
its own data and information system implementation whenever 
possible, given cost and schedule constraints. When an agency must 
delay or forgo implementation of a key GCDIS feature, it will notify 
the IWGDMGC as soon as possible.

<h2><a name=External>External Coordination</a></h2>

Liaison will also be maintained with government organizations at the 
State, Federal, and international levels, including some 
nongovernmental organizations. These liaisons will be maintained 
through the IWGDMGC, often through cross-representation by 
IWGDMGC member agencies in these external organizations. The 
IWGDMGC will conduct a thorough review of such organizations and 
will establish formal links with those organizations determined to 
have significant related purposes and activities.<p>

It should be noted that versions of the U.S. global change data policy 
have been formally adopted, in whole or in part, by several 
international organizations. While not binding on the member 
countries, this represents an initial step toward establishing an 
international norm and the facilitation of GCDIS international 
linkages and coordination. Representative international organizations 
whose work has already been identified as being important to the 
GCDIS are identified in <a href=ch7gcdip.html>Chapter 7</a>.<p>

In addition, there are a number of other programs outside the 
USGCRP, evolving in parallel with the GCDIS, that can make important 
contributions to the broad information needs of researchers, policy 
analysts, and others attempting to understand the many aspects of 
our environment. Since users are best served through seamless 
access, the GCDIS will adopt or support interfaces that accommodate 
the information access approaches being developed in such 
overlapping national and international initiatives as the U.S. National 
Information Infrastructure, which includes the Government 
Information Locator Service and the National Spatial Data 
Infrastructure.

<h2><a name="Policy">Policy Coordination</a></h2>

There are aspects of data and information management that impinge 
on policies beyond the immediate USGCRP, but are addressed within 
the Federal structure for information and technology policy 
coordination. Examples include private enterprise - government 
interactions, the HPCC initiative, scientific and technical information 
policy, education initiatives, and the National Information 
Infrastructure (NII). In these areas, the IWGDMGC will coordinate 
policy issues through the structures established in the Federal 
Coordinating Council for Science, Engineering, and Technology.
As one example of such policy issues, the increase in public access 
capability creates an issue involving the confidentiality of data and 
information. Social science data, at the finest level of analysis, deal 
with individuals. Most social science researchers protect the identity 
of individuals, and even groups, as a fundamental part of their 
research. Even nations restrict the availability of social and economic 
data and information or distort it substantially for political purposes. 
Mere aggregation will not necessarily solve the problem, since 
individual-level data may be needed for integrated assessments. 
USGCRP agencies and departments may need congressional action to 
provide the protection required for the confidential elements of the 
GCDIS.<p>

This problem is not limited to the social sciences. Biological data and 
information, such as forest inventory data and agricultural statistical 
data, sometimes have economic and social (privacy) issues associated 
with their use. In the process of associating field data with pixels in 
satellite images, for example, sensitive location and ownership 
information may be revealed. The Federal mechanisms to protect 
these data, while making them available for USGCRP analyses, do not 
yet exist. They must be developed both technically and politically as 
a priority item. This will require action by the executive and 
legislative branches of the Government and will probably be tested 
in the judicial. Until adequate safeguards are in place, both biological 
and socioeconomic data will be limited to publishable data and 
information and thus compromise the ability of the USGCRP to meet 
its objectives.

<h2><a name="User">User Coordination</a></h2>

The GCDIS will be structured to make certain that users can provide 
their insights and opinions at all levels of the system. At the level of 
the IWGDMGC, such input will come from multiple sources. These 
include

<ul><li>The liaison member on the IWGDMGC from the Committee on 
Geophysical and Environmental Data (CGED) and the Board on Global 
Change of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS),

<li>A continuing series of forum reviews by the CGED,

<li>Participation in IWGDMGC subgroup-level activities by user 
groups not represented by the CGED, such as library, education, and 
State government associations, 

<li>Regular user surveys based on the GCDIS measures of success 
<a href=ch1gcdip.html#Meas>(see page 6)</a>,

<li>The CENR and the working groups of the USGCRP, each of which 
has its own user advisory processes, and

<li>The agency members of the IWGDMGC.</ul><p>

At the agency level of the GCDIS, the IWGDMGC will continue to 
establish general policies for user coordination. The program plan 
and this implementation plan are examples of this coordination 
process. Within this process, agencies (or their designees) providing 
GCDIS access will have their own user-advisory structure. These 
agency structures will remain the responsibility of the particular 
agency and will include data center advisory committees, project and 
program advisory committees, and a multitude of types of 
interactions with individuals - both those who supply and those who 
use GCDIS data and information.<p>

Although the GCDIS initially is designed to meet the critical needs of 
the global change research program, new categories of users will be 
accessing the system as it evolves. Several factors will contribute to 
broadening interest in the GCDIS. For example, the links to 
contributing data and information from the natural resources and 
human dimensions areas; the increased focus on data and 
information supporting global change assessments; and the 
availability of tools to assist users in identifying, accessing, and 
combining data and information in meaningful ways will open doors 
to new classes of users. These will include users such as students 
below college level, policymakers, and environmental interest groups 
who find the current system too limited in scope or too difficult to 
use.<p>

These new users will bring fresh viewpoints that will be invaluable 
to the continued development and measured success of the GCDIS 
and that will require specific outreach programs to obtain their 
input. Each of the participating agencies has the responsibility to 
reach out to the users of their data and information because the 
agencies can more readily identify their own users and have more 
opportunity for informal and formal contact with them.<p>

<title>GCDIS Implementation Plan - Chapter 3</title>
<body>
<a href=tocgcdip.html>
<img align=bot alt="Back to Table of Contents" 
src=gifs/cover4sm.gif></a>
<h1>3. Users and the GCDIS</h1>
<img src=gifs/bluegrad.gif>

Several different types of users will require data and information 
contained in or pointed to by the GCDIS. Each will need different 
means of information identification, access, and documentation, and 
each will need different information products to suit its applications.
User requirements will fall into three broad categories. The first 
major category of users will be the general research community, 
which will primarily need access to raw and lightly processed data 
for basic studies. This group will include discipline-oriented 
researchers, graduate students, and educators requiring data and 
information for advanced college courses. This group will require 
sophisticated browse capabilities, and will have access to the more 
sophisticated computers, interfaces, and networks. The data volume 
for this group will be the largest of the three general user 
communities, but the information content per datum will also be the 
lowest.<p>

The second major user group comprises those needing summary or 
multidisciplinary integrated data sets that have been assembled by 
researchers or data centers to address a particular global change 
problem. These higher-level integrated data sets are assembled from 
primary discipline-oriented data. Examples of such products include 
long-term climate records (carefully quality assured) used to 
estimate historic climate changes and integrated geologic, geographic, 
oceanographic, ecological, and meteorological data sets used to 
predict the effects of potential sea level rising. Access to such data 
sets will require less browse capabilities and will be used by 
researchers and others with less data-handling capability. These data 
products will also be used by those investigators pursuing integrated 
assessment activities or teaching environmental courses.<p>

The third group of users will be those interested in high-level 
information products that directly address global change issues in 
ways helpful in decision-making processes for anticipating and 
adapting to environmental changes. These products will be rich in 
information and might include, for example, summaries of expected 
changes of agricultural crop ranges due to temperature and moisture 
changes. Such products have the highest information density and 
could also be used by those in private enterprise and government 
concerned with planning for changes in the projected economic basis 
for a region's industry. That such products are directly linked to 
recognizable environmental conditions may make them the most 
useful data products for the general public and primary or secondary 
school use. Access to these products may be through more traditional 
means, such as responding to paper announcements or phoning data 
centers directly. Their actual production media may often be paper 
based.<p>

Users in the second and third categories will need specially tailored 
GCDIS directory capabilities for locating the data and information 
applicable to their initial needs without being confronted by the 
confusing (to them) amounts of data and information available 
through the GCDIS system.

<h2><a name=Diversity>Diversity of the Users</a></h2>

The complexity of global change issues is reflected in the diversity of 
the potential users of the GCDIS. Since the GCDIS will be responsive to 
users of the system, it is important that there be a systematic 
approach to characterizing users in order to understand their needs 
better. The design and implementation of a system like the GCDIS 
depend on the nature of the functions the users are performing in 
their interaction with the system. The access components of the 
system will depend on the sophistication of the users or their 
intermediaries, and the contents will be driven primarily by the 
types of questions the users need to answer within their own 
particular problem domains.<p>

For example, the following user scenario (and <a href = 
"gifs/fig3.gif">Figure 3</a>) illustrates that an individual researcher doing 
a scientific assessment can take advantage of the internal 
connectivity provided by the GCDIS.<p>

International negotiators of the United Nations require the answers 
to many policy-relevant questions on greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions, including, for example, the importance of global, regional, 
and national biomass burning to the emissions of GHGs. In this 
scenario, the CENR SGCR assigns the science assessment of the 
importance of biomass burning to EPA, which designates a manager 
and forms an interagency, international team that defines the scope 
of the investigation to answer two questions (see the bottom of 
<a href=gifs/fig3.gif>Figure 3</a>) on the current status of emissions and 
their sensitivities to natural and managed changes, and future 
emissions for various managed scenarios.<p>

The science assessors agree to attack the questions by producing a 
science assessment report that will be produced in sequence (moving 
from right to left in the diagram) from global or regional modeling 
products, data products, archives, observations, measurements, and 
process studies. The science assessors specify the accuracy, precision, 
representibility, and comparability characteristics of the modeling 
and data products to permit the integration of the products as the 
basis of the science assessment.<p>

The data and modeling products may be either pure data bases from 
the archives, transformed data bases, or data bases synthesized by a 
combination of various observed data, process results, and modeling 
results. In this example, several archives are combined to form 
synthesized data products (e.g., Landsat data and National Fire 
Statistics to give an accuracy assessment or calibration of combined 
Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and Defense 
Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) burn area estimates).<p>

The role of the GCDIS is critical in forming data products. The 
archives shown must be part of GCDIS for ready access, 
comparability problems must be solved to allow merging of data 
bases, and data and modeling products must be placed in accessible 
archives.

<h2><a name=Problem>The Problem Domain of the Users</a></h2>

At the highest level, the problems addressed by the GCDIS user 
community can be organized in parallel with the four working groups 
associated with the USGCRP: observations and data management, 
process research, integrative modeling and prediction, and 
assessments. The USGCRP, through the four working groups, defines 
the problem domain for the GCDIS. The process for implementing this 
problem definition is outlined in <a href=ch4gcdip.html>Chapter 4</a> 
of this plan.<p>

As a problem domain example, there are special needs that come 
from considering the problem domain of a user interested in process 
research. A wide variety of processes exist, ranging from basic 
meteorological processes through ecological processes to social and 
economic processes. Further, the problem domains in process 
research interact strongly with data access as well as data content 
issues.<p>

One aspect of meteorological research aimed at understanding 
climate-related processes is the deployment of field programs. There 
are two aspects of the GCDIS user community involved in field 
programs. On one hand this community relies on the GCDIS to 
preserve and distribute its data and information, and on the other it 
also requires data and information from the GCDIS to support both 
the operation of the experiment and interpretation of its results. In 
general, the needs of this community for data and information 
preservation and analysis support are well known. The support of 
field programs, however, can generate a requirement for the 
timeliness of data delivery that can have an effect on the GCDIS 
considerably different from an archive-oriented user strategy. In 
particular, the nature of quality control procedures may change, and 
the necessity for standard data exchange protocols becomes even 
more important.

<h2><a name=Uses>The Uses of the Data and Information by the 
User</a></h2>

Approaching the user community according to the way the user will 
use the information is important. The use of the data and information 
may depend on the skills or the sophistication of the user, 
recognizing two important factors: the level of expertise of the user 
in locating and accessing data and information, and the user's level of 
understanding of their use.<p>

There are three levels of individual interaction with respect to data 
use: interacting directly, which leads to personal use of data or 
information; acting as an agent for someone requiring data or 
information held within the GCDIS; and acting as an intermediary 
who not only accesses the data or information, but also performs a 
value-added function upon the data for a user who does not choose 
to, or who cannot either interact directly with the system or perform 
the analysis.<p>

By addressing the sophistication of the user, those implementing the 
GCDIS will make it possible to decide explicitly whether a user group 
should be served as though it were going to interact directly with the 
GCDIS or whether it would be more appropriate for the user group to 
interact through agents or intermediaries. In this fashion, design 
criteria will be developed for software to ease user interaction with 
the system.<p>

Although there will be activities within the GCDIS that provide 
value-added products, a substantial portion of the products of the 
GCDIS will be generated by entities external to the GCDIS. These 
entities, acting as intermediaries, will range from international 
scientific assessment groups to policy analysts at the State and 
Federal level, to authors of monographs and textbooks, and to the 
press. These intermediaries are the trained analysts, educators, and 
information specialists who have the expertise necessary to convert 
data into information for the myriad of users that have a need for 
global change information, but not necessarily raw data.<p>

These external intermediaries include the four major working groups 
of the USGCRP. In this context, it should be noted that the GCDIS not 
only supports the working groups as their activities generate 
products for external users not in immediate contact with the GCDIS, 
but it also facilitates the interchange of data, information, and 
analytic results among the working groups. A major implementation 
goal of the program will be to facilitate this interaction and to 
promote the achievement of the goals of the USGCRP.<p>

The use of an intermediary by a high-level decision maker is 
illustrated in the following example.<p>

To help formulate a position on a bill before Congress, a 
Representative from Louisiana needs the best possible information 
about this question:<p>

<blockquote>Will sea level rise caused by global warming inundate 
parts of my congressional district in coastal Louisiana? If so, how can 
the adverse effects on my constituents be 
alleviated?</blockquote><p>

The Representative asks a staff member to provide this information 
before the vote on the bill. The vote is scheduled to occur in a few 
days.<p>

Members of the staff have been made aware of the capabilities of the 
GCDIS by IWGDMGC-coordinated outreach efforts. If staff members 
have access to the Internet, they will electronically access the GCDIS 
directly and find the required information. If they need an 
intermediary to obtain GCDIS access, they will call a group such as 
the Congressional Research Service for help.<p>

Since the GCDIS has experts and agency systems linked by 
interagency cooperation and networks, the staff quickly obtains a 
comprehensive view of the data and information available about the 
Representative's question. The staff finds the required information 
and reports the next day that some global change model predictions 
do in fact predict a large enough sea level rise to inundate certain 
parts of low-lying coastal areas (such as Louisiana) that contain 
substantial population, potentially serious environmental pollution 
problems (such as abandoned hazardous waste sites), and so forth. 
The staff also reports that continuing efforts are being made to 
evaluate the accuracy of the sea level rise predictions, assess their 
multiple effects, and explore possible mitigation measures and their 
costs.<p>

From this example several points can be made. First is the 
importance of a problem statement. The staff member or the 
information specialist in the Congressional Research Service needed 
to have a clearly articulated question to interact with the system - 
the question provided by the Representative. Next, the 
Representative did not actually interact with GCDIS. An intermediary 
was used to interact with the system and obtain data for someone 
else. It is important that how the system was used did not depend on 
the fact that a Representative asked the question. Anyone acting 
through the intermediary could have gotten the same answer. The 
Representative may have been able to investigate the matter, but, as 
in the case of many information-related activities, there exists an 
existing information infrastructure that is ready to use the GCDIS to 
meet its function of providing information.

<h2><a name=Affiliation>Organizational and Group Affiliation of 
Users</a></h2>

While it could be argued that the immediate user of GCDIS is always 
ultimately an individual, individuals acting in groups or as part of 
organizations can take on very specialized roles. These roles can 
affect the range of activities that need to be supported by the GCDIS, 
and the group or organization may place requirements on the system 
that might not normally be part of an individual's approach to the 
GCDIS. Group or organization requirements can be particularly 
important when delivering data to the GCDIS.<p>

The organization of the user group is important because the nature of 
the GCDIS implementation can be very different if the user is an 
individual, part of a user group, or a member of a large team of 
researchers involved in a major field program. <a 
href=tab2gcdip.html>Table 2</a> illustrates the different kinds of 
users that will interact with the GCDIS. The column labeled 
<em>single user </em> identifies individuals who might interact with 
the GCDIS and what they might try to accomplish with that 
interaction. The columns referring to aggregations of individuals give 
examples of real organizations that are likely to be represented in 
their interaction by an agent (usually the case of small groups) or 
that may be acting as an intermediary with the GCDIS.

<h2><a name=Libraries>Libraries and Information Centers as 
Intermediaries and Facilitators</a></h2>

Libraries and information centers are major gateways to data and 
information resources. Librarians and information specialists are 
experienced in organizing, categorizing, conceptualizing, retrieving, 
and disseminating information. These skills and knowledge are 
critical to many GCDIS users who need to navigate the vast amounts 
of printed and electronic GCDIS data and information.<p>

As the USGCRP evolves, there will be increasingly more printed and 
electronic material about global change issues and research. Much of 
this information will appear in books, reports, and journal articles 
scattered throughout the world's literature and in data bases 
accessible over electronic highways. Some research information will 
describe the state of understanding of global change and some will 
suggest further observations needed to test proposed models. 
Policymakers, students, and the informed public will find such 
interpretative information necessary. Integrated data and 
information, at various levels of detail, will be most useful for such 
users. In addition to integrated data and information, research users 
may need digital and analog data directly. Common to all types of 
users is the potential value of the librarian or information specialist - 
not only to help users navigate the GCDIS, but also to synthesize the 
available data and information into the particular products and 
knowledge needed by users.<p>

In a number of the participating GCDIS agencies, management of data 
is handled by major data centers or other organizations. Similarly, 
the management of much of the agencies' published information is 
handled through centralized Scientific and Technical Information 
(STI) programs. These STI programs comprehensively aid in 
collecting literature produced by their agencies, their contractors, 
and through their agencies' cooperative international and other 
research and development efforts. This literature is compiled into 
bibliographic data bases for searching and retrieving. The central 
agency STI programs also maintain systems that provide archiving 
and full text retrieving of such material. The USGCRP will take full 
advantage of these STI services in the Federal agencies.<p>

The GCDIS will encourage efforts by libraries and information 
centers - of all sizes and types - to collect and make available the 
needed global change research data and information. To help such 
institutions in their roles as intermediaries and facilitators, special 
library and information center capabilities will be developed when 
necessary, and the GCDIS will take a proactive approach in soliciting 
their continuing feedback, comments, and recommendations.

<h3>User Scenario</h3>

An example of a library user of the GCDIS is a graduate student 
working with interbasin water transfer. By using the capabilities of 
the university's library system, the researcher accesses the GCDIS to 
obtain both data and information on rainfall, water supply, water 
demand projections, and details from documented proposals for 
alleviation of the regional water shortages. The researcher browses 
various water deficit scenarios depicted on regional contour maps. 
The sensitivity factors, such as rainfall, are accessible for browsing or 
manipulation. Water management plans are searched for interbasin 
proposals that were implemented in areas having comparable 
population sizes. The researcher scans the management plans for text 
concerning project cost and environmental impacts, and then uses 
the results of the search not only to determine both the data and 
information available on this subject, but also to guide the future of 
the research. Throughout this process, the librarian or the 
information specialist is available as the human interface, or 
intermediary, easing the task of data system navigation.

<h2><a name=Implications>Implications of the User Attributes on the 
GCDIS</a></h2>

A critical step in implementing the GCDIS is the systematic 
examination of users by the Content and Access Subgroups to 
establish priorities for the content and access implementation 
strategies. In doing this it is very likely that several things will 
happen.<p>

With respect to content, interaction with users about addressing their 
problems will lead to the identification of particular data sets outside 
the USGCRP. For example, the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis 
Center (CDIAC) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory estimates that more 
than half of the data in its data center are not of U.S. origin. Also, the 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has indicated that a 
substantial fraction of its data is generated by and held by the States. 
These examples show that the satisfaction of user demands will lead 
to an expanding network of data and information that will 
necessitate strong and reciprocal interaction with both international 
partners and State agencies. This implies that an evolutionary growth 
of the GCDIS will continue for the life of the program, and that many 
of the holdings will be the result of interactions with users beyond 
the USGCRP.<p>

With respect to user access, the data and information must be 
delivered to users in a fashion consistent with their use of the data 
and information. Issues of connectivity of results, quality of 
metadata, and the timeliness of delivery of the data and information 
as indicated in the scenarios will be critical to successful 
implementation. As the use of GCDIS data changes, access and content 
also will change. This requires an active user feedback mechanism 
that will be implemented at each user contact.<p>

Finally, additional complexity for GCDIS implementation is derived 
from GCDIS development originating from a collection of individual 
agency systems - each with its own existing user community. This is 
especially true for data sets from outside the USGCRP focused 
programs. The GCDIS users are effectively superimposed on the 
existing user community, whose composition, attributes, and needs 
have driven fundamental data base design, composition, and access 
decisions that may or may not be appropriate for GCDIS use. 
Individual agency implementation plans will move toward 
reconciling these differences by adopting common standards and 
guidelines.

<h2><a name=Support>User Support</a></h2>

The GCDIS will identify a point of contact for user questions about 
each data and information source. For example, the GCDIS will 
identify a user support source for each directory or data source to 
which the GCDIS provides a pointer and also for each data set and 
information collection in the Global Change Master Directory (GCMD) 
itself. The minimal requirements for the GCDIS to provide pointers to 
particular data sets will be the continuing availability and the 
identification of a continuing source of user support for that data 
set.<p>

The GCDIS will provide support to the users through a variety of 
mechanisms at whatever level the users interact with the system - 
as an individual for personal use, as an agent, or as an intermediary. 
In most cases, this support will be provided by the agency or other 
entity that is the repository of the data or information in question. 
Service will be provided with the distributed support of libraries, 
information centers, data centers, and individual sources. To provide 
for the diversity of users, the service providers will employ a wide 
range of information technology, service, and search tools and 
mechanisms, ranging from manual, print-based resource guides to 
the most sophisticated computer-based expert systems. The specific 
types of user support services for the GCDIS will be developed in 
stages based on both actual user needs and on what is technologically 
feasible and affordable.<p>

A bulletin board system will provide centralized support to users, 
such as the latest information about the GCDIS. It will be a means for 
users to share experiences in using the GCDIS as well as a mechanism 
for users to provide input on problems and suggestions for change - 
including requests for special interagency products and services. 
Agencies participating in the IWGDMGC will evaluate user inputs 
received through the GCDIS bulletin board in their more formal 
agency reports on customer satisfaction consistent with Executive 
Order 12862, <em>Setting Customer Service Standards</em>.  A major 
portion of 
the bulletin board will be operated by the Global Change Research 
Information Office (GCRIO).<p>

The USGCRP established the GCRIO in 1993 within the Consortium for 
International Earth Science Network (CIESIN). The purpose of the 
GCRIO is to disseminate to foreign and U.S. individuals and 
organizations scientific research information available in the United 
States that would be useful in preventing, mitigating, or adapting to 
the effects of global change. Worldwide sources of data and 
information are available to the GCRIO to satisfy requests about 
global change topics. These sources are being documented and made 
available over the Internet for use by GCRIO staff and researchers 
worldwide. Most are available at no charge to the GCRIO user.
The GCRIO uses information services that already exist. A primary 
source of information is the GCDIS. Users are pointed to the GCDIS as 
one of the sources of information available from the GCRIO. 
Documents and online information about the USGCRP are also 
referenced. The GCRIO functions as a major access facility for 
worldwide users to the data and information available from the 
USGCRP.<p>

<title>GCDIS Implementation Plan - Chapter 4</title>
<body>
<a href=tocgcdip.html>
<img align=bot alt="Back to Table of Contents"

<h1>4. Content System Implementation</h1>
<img src=gifs/bluegrad.gif>

This chapter discusses the responsibilities of the Content Subgroup 
relative to GCDIS implementation. Included are a conceptual view of 
GCDIS content; scope of the Content Subgroup responsibilities; 
coordination activities necessary to facilitate interagency cooperation, 
interactions with State and local governments and international 
organizations; discussions of the content functional areas; and future 
considerations.<p>

<h2><a name=Conceptual>Conceptual View of GCDIS Content</a></h2>

The USGCRP requires data and information of many types and from 
many sources to achieve the understanding needed both for 
developing a predictive capability for global changes and to assess 
the effects of such changes. An objective of this implementation plan 
is to provide an interagency framework for the coordination of the 
Federal agency data and information activities related to global 
change.<p>

This implementation plan recognizes that data and information 
management activities designed for a particular agency program are 
most responsive to the community of users within that program. In 
responding to mission objectives, agencies have used diverse data 
and information management approaches. It is the thrust of this 
interagency global change data and information management effort 
to help coordinate the multiple individual agency programs related 
to global change and provide the necessary broad interdisciplinary 
capability needed by the USGCRP. This coordination will not only lead 
to the availability of more comprehensive data and information, but 
also help both to reduce redundancies and increase the ability to use 
data and information from disparate sources.<p>

A major focus of the GCDIS implementation plan is to develop 
procedures and criteria for establishing priorities for some of the key 
data and information sets needed to meet the objectives of the 
USGCRP. The establishment of priorities will be implemented by 
actively involving the other organizational elements of the USGCRP, 
the NAS, and the research and user communities. In following 
sections, three levels of service, corresponding to three levels of 
priority, are provided as guidelines for the agencies in implementing 
specific functions. These levels of service are summarized in <a 
href=tab3gcdip.html>Table 3</a>.

<h2><a name=Scope>Scope of Content Subgroup</a></h2>

The Content Subgroup will provide the links between the data and 
information needed to answer key USGCRP questions and the 
activities required to provide the data and information. The 
subgroup will identify the data and information contributions from 
each agency and ensure that they are available through the GCDIS to 
the other agencies, users, and working groups of the USGCRP. To 
enhance the intercomparability of data and information, the Contents 
Subgroup will work with the Standards Subgroup to provide 
appropriate FIPS and voluntary standards and guidelines to be 
adopted by agencies in their implementation plans relevant to the 
delivery of information about data and information holdings that 
include descriptions, quality assessments, supporting information, 
and guidance and aids for locating and obtaining the data and 
information. To expedite implementation of these criteria and 
guidelines, mechanisms will be developed for agencies to share 
experience and expertise.<p>

A particular activity of the GCDIS implementation will include 
coordinating activities needed to produce special data and 
information products needed by the users of global change data and 
information. These will include value-added data sets that require 
data from multiple agencies. For example, assessment studies will 
require the synthesis of models from individual parts of the global 
change system. Process studies data sets that result from the 
synthesis of data from different platforms will also be needed by 
researchers in other agencies or their programs. Information 
summarizing the global environment and its change will be produced 
by the USGCRP; these results will have high-priority availability. 
Many of the summary products will be in text, graph, and table 
formats rather than in numeric.

<h2><a name=Coordination>Coordination of Content 
Implementation</a></h2>

Working under the framework of the IWGDMGC, the Content 
Subgroup will provide programmatic focus to develop and coordinate 
this framework. User oversight will be provided through formal 
mechanisms with the NAS and other advisory bodies. The subgroup 
will use ad hoc panels to address issues; to develop guidelines, 
priorities, and processes; and to review other data and information 
topics.<p>

The Content Subgroup, in coordination with other elements of the 
USGCRP, will identify and address those issues that affect the content 
of the GCDIS. This will include data from Federal agencies, State and 
local governments, and international organizations.<p>

The ad hoc panels will comprise experts identified by the agencies, 
and will be called on to respond to many of the content issues. The 
panels will assist in the coordination of identifying and providing 
data holdings and special products needed to respond to the user 
needs-for example, interagency efforts such as the Global Energy 
and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX).

<h3>User Coordination</h3>

The user is the central focus in the GCDIS implementation plan. Users 
both contribute and draw on the system's data and information 
resources. Thus, the research and other user communities must be 
actively involved in all facets of the system - design, implementation, 
and maintenance. Specific aspects of user coordination are:<p>
<ul>
<li>Identify the parameters that are key to global change research, 
in building a priority list of global change research parameters 
required to achieve the recommended milestones.<p>

<li>Assemble and document priority data sets, and develop and 
recommend value-added data and information products for 
subsequent analysis (e.g., browse products, literature, citations, 
bibliographies).<p>

<li>Identify priority data and information resources to be accessed, 
acquired, or developed.<p>

<li>Participate in advisory committees toward the development 
and enhancement of policies and procedures for archiving and 
purging data.<p>

<li>Identify international partners to share global change data and 
information for mutual benefit.<p>

<li>Assist with the development of cross-training opportunities 
(e.g., workshops, conferences, programs, feedback mechanisms) for 
computer and information scientists and others to interact with 
global change researchers, including university programs for the 
purpose of reviewing and identifying problems and 
improvements.<p>

<li>Provide feedback in determining problems, gaps, omissions, or 
errors in the coverage for priority data sets and recommended 
remedies.<p>

<li>Assist with the validation of selected data and information 
products through such processes as peer reviews and assessments 
after actual use.<p>

<li>Deliver selected derived data and information, with 
documentation, from process studies, predictive models, or 
assessment activities to the appropriate data center and/or user.<p>

<li>Assist with participation in projects to assemble retrospective 
data sets and data rescue projects when needed to preserve crucial 
data that are at risk.<p>

<li>Assist with building upon existing digital and nondigital data 
and information resources to improve access to high-quality global 
change data and information by integrating appropriate activities or 
participant data centers, archives, libraries, and other 
information-disseminating organizations, and providing products in 
appropriate media, depending on the particular user's need.<p>

<li>Help solicit active involvement of the national and international 
research and user communities in reviewing the effectiveness of the 
GCDIS, in facilitating access to and use of global change data and 
information, and in articulating the changing needs of the GCDIS 
users.</ul><p>

<h3>Coordination of Research Data Input</h3>

The Content Subgroup, in coordination with other elements of the 
USGCRP, will investigate various mechanisms to encourage 
submission of data sets to data centers for broader use. This activity 
will focus on those data sets that are produced in USGCRP research 
projects that have resulted in peer-reviewed publications. Possible 
avenues include contractual as well as professional incentives. 
Discussions with professional societies will be initiated to investigate 
journal status for the preparation of data sets for use in the broader 
community. These discussions will address both the inclusion of data 
set articles and citations for the use of data sets in other research 
publications.

<h3>State, Regional, and Local Government Coordination</h3>

State, regional, and local governments generate data and information 
that may be necessary for climate and global change research. 
Dialogues with these government entities will be developed to ensure 
that their data and information are made available to the GCDIS and 
that the GCDIS data and information are available to these 
government organizations, in return. Examples of relevant data are 
inventories of biogenic and anthropogenic emissions, land use and 
comprehensive plans, air and water quality measurements, 
biodiversity data, and inventories of living resources.<p>

Mechanisms and links to State, regional, and local governments must 
be developed to transfer priority data, metadata, documentation, and 
related software to appropriate local or national archives. Procedures 
will be developed in the mid-1990s to begin making these data and 
information available and to integrate these data and information 
into the existing archive systems. These procedures will include 
potential funding mechanisms to assist States with the transfer of 
nonfederally funded data. The procedures also will include 
recommendations for transferring data collected for federally funded 
projects to an archive accessible by the GCDIS. Examples of existing 
federally funded programs are the EPA State Data Management 
Program and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 
(NOAA) Coastal Zone Management Program. The USGCRP can use 
these existing funding mechanisms as models for future funding to 
State and local governments as part of the USGCRP budget.

<h3>International Coordination</h3>

Most high-priority data sets are global, and, since the extant global 
data sets are generally compilations of older data that have disparate 
spatial scales and represent regions at different times, new global 
data sets are needed. In many cases, it is most practical to recompile 
new global data sets from newer, better documented, higher 
resolution data directly from the scientific groups in larger countries 
or in regions. Some pilot data projects recently finished at NOAA's 
National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) in Boulder, Colorado, 
indicate that this approach is practical. It involves direct 
collaboration between data groups in the United States (National Data 
Centers [NDCs] or World Data Centers [WDCs], for example) with 
scientists and institutions in other countries, particularly in 
developing countries, since it may be assumed that modern data will 
be more easily exchanged with developed countries.<p>

Some U.S. global change scientists and institutions already know of 
such modern data in developing countries. Otherwise, it may be 
necessary to explore the existence of such data through the 
International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP) committees of 
these countries or through national institutions. The WDC system also 
may be of help in searching out such modern data sets.<p>

The Content Subgroup will identify disciplinary regional and global 
data and information that are known to exist but that are not 
available within the United States. The subgroup also will identify 
potential priority disciplinary regional and global data and 
information for which a source is not known.<p>

Rescue of data needed for global change research but in danger of 
deteriorating or no longer being archived is another activity that will 
be actively pursued while the data and information in question are 
still accessible. The process of rescuing such data will include 
selective conversion to digital format. Another form of data rescue 
involves digitizing older tabular data, especially when these data 
represent important time series, to provide these data in maximally 
useful form for computer-assisted analyses.<p>

Successful data rescue and digitization projects have been conducted 
with colleagues in Russia and China by units of WDC-A, at low cost. 
These collaborative projects can also be of benefit to scientists in the 
respective countries by providing access to technical assistance and 
data products. For example, receiving copies of their own data back 
in digital form (on compact disk-read only memory [CD-ROM] 
devices, for example) may make their data more useful for national 
studies.

<h2><a name=Data>Data and Information Identification, Acquisition, 
and Priorities</a></h2>

Identifying and setting priorities for data and information sets 
necessary for global change research are iterative activities. These 
are the first steps in a process that involves including data and 
information sets in an archive, collecting (or creating) a data and 
information set if it does not already exist, managing data and 
information, and distributing data and information to GCDIS users. A 
recognition of the critical importance of data and information 
management, including necessary resource requirements for each 
step, is key to making the best decision to include a new data and 
information set for archive and distribution.<p>

The Content Subgroup, as a standing group, will make links from the 
data and information needed for key USGCRP research questions to 
the identification of, provision of, and priorities for the necessary 
data within the GCDIS. This will be done in the context of the USGCRP 
framework, which provides overall direction for the collection of data 
and the use of information for supporting global change research.<p>

To provide such direction and to coordinate the interagency activities 
necessary to meet the goals of the USGCRP, four parallel, but 
interconnected, streams of activity and working groups have been 
established. These are<p>

<ul>
<li>Documenting global change (Working Group 1: Observations 
and Data Management),
<li>Understanding key processes (Working Group 2: Process 
Research),
<li>Predicting global and regional environmental change (Working 
Group 3: Integrative Modeling and Prediction), and
<li>Assessing and synthesizing the state of scientific, technical, and 
economic knowledge and implications of global change (Working 
Group 4: Assessments).</ul><p>

All four streams not only provide data and information, but also 
have specific requirements that the data and information 
management program must address. These requirements are driven 
by questions that the USGCRP must answer. These questions, in turn, 
may be used to set priorities for data content in the GCDIS.<p>

The four working groups will be asked to provide priority questions 
that require information from the GCDIS. Expert advice will be sought 
from the agencies and from outside groups, such as the NAS, to 
develop detailed lists of data and information needed to develop the 
information to answer the USGCRP questions. Priorities for data and 
information will be derived from priorities associated with the 
questions that generated the information request. These data and 
information priorities will then be used to develop priorities for data 
and information from archives external to the USGCRP and will be 
used by the Access Subgroup to develop the level of implementation 
required for data and information in the GCDIS. In addition to this 
primary method of setting priorities for data and information, 
external advice will be sought from a number of sources.<p>

To that end, the Content Subgroup will survey existing data and 
information, such as the documentation of scientific reports, 
assessment reports by the NAS, and written reports by the 
international scientific community. In addition, the subgroup will 
survey written reports from time to time and will attend meetings 
on an informal, member-by-member basis in order to identify new 
data sets that the process just described may have missed. Review of 
new national and international program requirements as they 
become available will be coordinated by the Content Subgroup.<p>

To determine the availability of needed data and information, the 
subgroup will survey such current holdings as are defined by 
existing catalogs in the GCDIS. In this manner, gaps in the needed 
data can be determined. The survey will also identify and describe 
library and data collections important for global change use, 
beginning with GCDIS agencies' collections, then other Federal 
collections, then non-Federal collections (e.g., universities', State and 
local governments', nongovernment organizations', international). 
This information will then be made widely available through the 
GCDIS directory.<p>

The Content Subgroup will use the existing international framework 
for identifying international data and information that may be 
needed. Representative organizations include the Intergovernmental 
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which was established by the World 
Meteorological Organization (WMO), and the United Nations 
Environment Program (UNEP). The IPCC assesses climate change for 
policymakers every several years, focusing on immediate issues and 
consequences. The IPCC prepares in-depth summary information for 
policymakers so that realistic response strategies can be created to 
manage climate change issues.<p>

Many of the requirements underlined in the IPCC documents are 
addressed by continuing international programs. For example, 
international projects are coordinated by the World Climate Research 
Programme (WCRP), sponsored by the WMO and the ICSU, and by the 
IGBP, sponsored by the ICSU. Both the WCRP and the IGBP have 
addressed questions of data set identification.<p>

For example, an IGBP report <a href=ftnt1.html>[1]</a> presents a 
summary of the scientific requirements for a 1-km data set. The 
identification of such a high-priority need by IGBP and other 
scientific groups led to a high priority for the collection of the data 
set. An international and interagency Global Land 1-km AVHRR Data 
Set Project is now underway. This is an unprecedented effort to 
collect a daily global data set for a 1.5-year baseline. The project 
includes the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), NASA, and NOAA (in the 
United States) and the European Space Agency and Australia, along 
with several dozen high-resolution picture transmission stations as 
participating collection sites. The Committee on Earth Observations 
Satellites (CEOS) has endorsed this project, and asked its Working 
Group on Data to provide support needed for international 
coordination of project data management issues.

<h2><a name=Assembly>Assembly</a></h2>

Data and information set assembly, or acquisition, is a major function 
within the GCDIS. Assembly functions will be implemented in 
conjunction with and closely coordinated with the identification, 
location, and priority-setting functions described in this 
implementation plan. Assembly involves basic data and information 
set acquisition, along with related ancillary data, quality assurance, 
and data set documentation, by the responsible agency in order to 
provide data and information access and archiving functionality. For 
some high-priority data and information sets, reassembly may be 
necessary where the data and information sets must be reformatted 
or migrated to higher density media, such as CD-ROM or 8-mm tape, 
or combined with other data to develop value-added, 
multidisciplinary data bases.<p>

The focused programs of the USGCRP are major sources of global 
change data and information. Resource requirements for the focused 
programs' associated data and information management functions 
have been included in the USGCRP planning. Other major sources are 
the many Federal and other programs with objectives primarily for 
purposes other than global change whose data and information are 
vital to the USGCRP. Examples include the daily satellite and in situ 
weather observations, information output from climate models, tree 
ring and ice core measurements, forest inventories, biological and 
ecological observations, cartographic data, stream flow records, 
bathythermograph data, fossil fuel statistics, demographic data, and 
soil maps.<p>

Such data and information from these other programs are critical not 
only for global change research, modeling, and assessments, but also 
to the focused data and information program to fill gaps in coverage, 
tie together diverse data sets, and improve the quality and 
usefulness of the data and information by providing ground truth at 
selected points for calibration. The latter is specially important for 
the remotely sensed data required by the USGCRP. Some of these 
critically important data and information now are available to the 
USGCRP because they are intermingled with material subject to 
security, proprietary, or regulatory constraints, or are the property 
of entities outside the Federal Government, such as State and local 
governments, international sources, or individual researchers.<p>

These other programs do not have global change as their primary 
theme. Therefore, the resources needed to make these data available 
to global change researchers (appropriate formats, products, and so 
forth) may not be available. A special effort is required to make the 
high-priority data and information from other programs available to 
GCDIS users in useful forms. The framework that will be used to 
accomplish this required aspect of GCDIS implementation is described 
in <a href=appAgcdip.html>Appendix A</a> on data capture. The 
IWGDMGC will coordinate with these other programs through 
appropriate interagency mechanisms to avoid duplication and to 
maximize efficiency.

<h3>Search and Locate</h3>

A process of continuing search and review for global change data and 
information will be used to uncover data and information to be 
included in the GCDIS. Using the programmatic guidance available, 
the Content Subgroup will identify those data and information 
potentially available in Federal agencies. Using this and information 
about other volunteered data and information, the Content Subgroup 
will then determine what additional data and information are 
needed. The scope of additional searches will be guided by the 
priority level of the particular data or information set needed.<p>

<table border>
<tr><td>Level of search service</td><td>Level 1</td><td>All 
sources</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>Level 2</td><td>All U.S. sources</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>Level 3</td><td>All Federal sources</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>Not rated</td><td>As made available</td></tr></table>

<h3>Ancillary Data Streams and Metadata</h3>

The assembly function also will identify and provide ancillary data 
and metadata necessary for users to understand fully the 
characteristics and quality of the data and to be able to interpret 
results accurately. Important ancillary data include data-set-specific 
sensor calibration, sensor degradation rates and biases, geolocation 
data, and quality control information. Important metadata include 
calibration algorithms, sensor information, measurement procedures, 
correction factors, functions for derived values, experimental design 
and purpose, and so forth. It is important to point out in the 
metadata the weaknesses of the data set and both its appropriate 
and inappropriate applications.

<h3>Data Set Documentation</h3>

Documentation (or metadata) is the bane of most research data sets. 
Unless developed by professionals, it often is inadequate, incomplete, 
and perhaps wrong. Important global change data sets must pass the 
20-year test - can someone 20 years from now, not familiar with the 
data, fully understand and use the data set (perhaps for an analysis 
unanticipated at time of data collection) based solely on its printed 
and electronic documentation? This is a serious test, but one that 
must be passed for many of our data collections if long-term, global 
environmental programs are to be useful well into the future.<p>

Complete documentation must do more than just describe the values 
represented in each field and the format information needed to read 
the media. It must fully document the data set from all possible 
points of view. The extent of data documentation, as with quality 
assurance, will depend on the importance of any particular global 
change data set. At a minimum, data set documentation for those 
data sets deemed of highest priority should contain the following:<p>

<ul>
<li><em>Identification of contributors</em>.  Who are the principal 
investigators providing the data? It is important to identify original 
investigators so that they obtain credit for providing data to the 
archive and so that users can know the history and perhaps the 
quality of the data. No matter how much work the archivist does to 
prepare the data set for publication (quality assurance, reformatting, 
documentation, etc.) the original data contributors should be credited 
with authorship of the final data product. This provides an incentive 
for principal investigators to submit their data to the archive.
<li><em>Background information</em>.  Why was the data collected, 
who funded the project, and what connection do the data have to 
other (historic or contemporary) data collections?
<li><em>Scope and purpose of the program</em>.  These cover the 
specific objectives of the data-gathering effort, the statistical design 
of the sampling effort, and the hypothesis being tested, if any.
<li><em>Data collection procedures</em>.  This covers the detailed 
description of the data collection procedures, including analytical 
procedures, calibrations, processing algorithms, and so forth. 
Photographs of the collection apparatus and topographic maps of the 
collection area, for example, should be included in the documentation 
of the collection procedures when appropriate.
<li><em>Station history</em>.  If the data were taken at a station (e.g., 
meteorological data), then the complete station history for the length 
of the data stream should be provided.
<li><em>Description of instrumentation</em>.  This is the description 
of the instruments in data collection and processing, including make 
and model number (some investigators might require actual 
instrument serial number to be recorded).
<li><em>Definitions of calibrations applied</em>.  This describes 
exactly how the data were processed after collection, and will include 
standard processing procedures that may not be the norm 20 years 
hence.
<li><em>Full variable definitions</em>.  Define every variable in the 
data set and their connection to any other. Fully describe any special 
processing of variables and whether any are derived, averaged, or 
estimated values.
<li><em>Definition of calculated variables</em>.  Provide not only the 
description of how derived variables were calculated, but also 
formulas used and copies of the completed code used to implement 
the calculations (in case there were errors in the computer code).
<li><em>Description of adjustments</em>.  Describe any adjustments 
of the data set made by the data gatherer after the initial data 
collection. Data not in the data set may have to described: for 
example, suspect values that were discarded before compilation of 
the final data set.
<li><em>Quality assurance at the data center</em>.  Describe the 
quality assurance procedures applied at the data center.
<li><em>Modifications made at the data center</em>.  Describe any 
modifications to the data set made at the data center, such as 
summarization or merging with other data sets.
<li><em>Limitations of the data</em>.  Every data set has limitations 
in its accuracy or appropriateness for certain uses. Explicitly 
acknowledge limits in precision, accuracy, and application, and work 
with principal investigators to identify and resolve such problems.
<li><em>Data transport verification statistics</em>.  Provide statistical 
summaries for every variable in the data set (e.g., number of 
observations, minimum, maximum values, average value) so that the 
user can ascertain whether the data were correctly transported to 
the user's system.
<li><em>Full or sample listings</em>.  Partial listings of voluminous 
data sets (a listing for every file) provide examples of how the data 
should look. Full listings of small data files provide data to those 
without electronic capabilities and provide an alternate method of 
archiving the data.
<li><em>Input/output routines on the transport medium</em>.  
Provide listings and the actual code on the medium for the input/out 
routines to read the flat files into appropriate languages or 
applications packages (e.g., FORTRAN, SAS, ARC/INFO) in order to 
eliminate transcription errors.
<li><em>References</em>.  Provide references to papers describing the 
sampling process used to produce the data set or papers reporting on 
the analysis of the data set by other users. For gray literature, 
provide the full reprints themselves, because these may be hard to 
obtain in 20 years.</ul><p>

The IWGDMGC activities relative to the adoption of standards and 
guidelines for the documentation of global change data sets will be 
coordinated with other groups addressing similar issues, such as the 
FGDC.

<h3>Reassembly</h3>

The identification and priority-setting functions of GCDIS will 
produce an inventory of essential or high-priority data sets. It is 
expected, however, that repackaging or reassembling some of these 
data sets will be required to best meet the needs of the users. As one 
possibility, a data set could be reassembled by reformatting: that is, 
modifying its structure to conform to a more widely accepted 
standard. Also, the data set could be migrated to more efficient 
media that would permit wider distribution to the user community 
or merging with other data sets.<p>

A specific example of reassembly services is represented by the need 
for the detection of significant long-term global change. As stated in 
a recent report by the National Research Council, "We believe that 
the detection of significant long-term global change is so central to 
the goals of the USGCRP, and so clear an obligation to future 
scientists, that it should be considered explicitly for added emphasis 
in the early stages of the program."<a href=ftnt2.html>[2]</a><p>

This central requirement for the detection of global change, and the 
determination of its natural or human-induced origin, requires that 
long-term data bases of key parameters be established and updated 
regularly as the data and information from new observations become 
available. These special data bases each need to be of the highest 
quality and must combine the data and information from all the 
applicable observations into a standard, regularly produced, special 
data and information product with continuity from year to year. 
Examples include global ozone profiles, solar irradiances, cloud cover, 
snow cover, land cover, land and ice surface temperatures, and sea 
surface temperatures. All these special-standard products will have 
the functional service levels of essential priority data and 
information sets.<p>

The importance of these special-standard products makes it 
particularly important that international agreements on both the 
individual parameters and on their formats and other aspects be 
reached as soon as possible. In addition to its need by the USGCRP, 
this special-standard product data and information activity will lay 
the groundwork for the United States to help lead the development 
of such international working relationships and agreements, 
wherever appropriate.

<h2><a name=Production>Production of Derived, Value-Added Data 
Products and Services</a></h2>

Data management by principal investigators and at data centers 
organized by scientific discipline are the traditional mechanisms used 
to maintain research data. These mechanisms developed to serve the 
needs of discipline-oriented researchers, especially in support of the 
geophysical sciences.<p>

The advent of global change research has changed the way 
researchers investigate scientific issues. The issues of interest in 
global change research are some of the most complex ever 
contemplated. They go far beyond inquiries bounded by clear 
disciplinary lines. For example, assessing the effects of sea level rise 
on coastal regions requires data from more than a half-dozen 
disciplines to be integrated into one geographically registered data 
base. In response, agency data centers are adding new data and 
information products that are built with other GCDIS holdings.<p>

In particular, existing issue-oriented Information Analysis Centers 
(IACs) - the Department of Energy's (DOE's) CDIAC, for example - 
provide these interdisciplinary services. The IACs proactively 
participate in the identification and creation of needed data sets from 
multiple extant sources to support specific issues. IACs support a 
user community beyond researchers, specifically including educators 
and the assessment staff that support policymakers.<p>

The IACs focus on the integrated, value-added data and information 
products needed by both the research and policy-making 
communities to assess and mitigate specific global change issues. 
Whether global change IACs are formed as new entities within the 
GCDIS or incorporated into existing data centers, the establishment of 
IAC functionality is critical.

<h3>User Scenario-Model Development</h3>

An example of the type of value-added, derived-data product that an 
IAC functionality would produce would be in support of researchers 
working with General Circulation Models (GCMs). GCMs are used to 
predict future global climate, and are based upon a number of 
assumptions. One of the parameters GCM researchers need is 
estimated future levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). Among 
other things, future levels of CO2 are calculated based on historic 
fossil fuel consumption and estimates of future fossil fuel 
consumption. The data set of historic emissions of CO2 due to the 
fossil fuel consumption and other anthropogenic sources is a derived 
data set. It includes data on energy use from the United Nations 
Statistical Office, data on cement production (cement production 
involves substantial amounts of CO2 in developed countries) obtained 
from the U.S. Bureau of Mines, and data on well head flaring (burning 
of large amounts of natural gas at the well head - data not included 
in energy production figures) at oil fields from the DOE. These data 
sets must be in common formats, combined across time and country, 
and quality assured before fuel-specific algorithms can be applied 
that ultimately provide CO2 emission estimates. These derived, 
value-added data sets are typically needed in the address of complex 
global change issues such as climate change, sea level rise, and 
socioeconomic questions. The data sets' production has been cited as 
a key component of the GCDIS in the NAS strategy 
report.<a href=ftnt3.html>[3]</a>

<h3>User Scenario - Policy Decisions</h3>

A further example of synthesis services relates to the immediate 
need for policy decisions on how to prevent or adapt to climate 
change. For these decisions to be based on the best available 
information, models that integrate smaller models of parts of the 
global change system are needed. There are many of these smaller 
models, including models of the world economy, atmospheric 
chemistry, ocean circulation, ecological systems, and social 
preferences and dynamics. The scale of some of these smaller models 
already strains the largest computers and makes it unlikely that it 
will ever be possible, or even desirable, to combine them all directly 
into an integrated assessment model. Rather, integrated policy 
assessments will need reduced-form data from these other models 
that captures their most salient features. Providing such 
reduced-form special data and information products is essential - not 
only for policy decisions, but also for a whole range of education and 
interdisciplinary research needs.

<h2><a name=Supporting>Supporting Functions</a></h2>

<h3>Browse Information</h3>

The browse function will provide low-resolution, summary, or 
visualization information about the data set. Since this information is 
discipline dependent, each implementation team will define the 
criteria and guidelines for data sets in its area of research.

<h3>Quality Indicators</h3>

Quality assurance is of paramount importance in the creation of 
global change data sets. The data must be carefully reviewed for 
consistency and accuracy, with adjustments made for changes in 
operation or instruments when possible, especially in long-term 
monitoring data sets. This is important if we are to identify small-
scale trends in long-term data sets. This quality assurance effort is 
shared by the principal investigators originating the data, the 
scientific projects under which the multidisciplinary data sets are 
being collected, and the data centers that archive and distribute the 
data.<p>

Researchers must be the primary source of quality assurance for 
checking their data, since they are closest to the collection process 
and are most knowledgeable about problems with the 
measurements. However, researchers are often reluctant to quality 
assure and document their data to archive standards. This is 
understandable because they often do not need such high standards 
for their own use of the data, and especially because they are not 
rewarded to do so. (In some cases they may not be particularly good 
at it.) The project under which the data may be collected by many 
principal investigators has the obligation to enforce standards of 
formatting, definitions, documentation, and quality assurance among 
the various data streams being generated to produce a consistent, 
integrated data base useful in systems analysis. The archive data 
center also has a major obligation in ensuring the quality of the data 
being archived. It is the last chance to review data quality before 
distribution to the research community at large. It is at this step that 
shortfalls in the quality assurance process at the principal 
investigator and project level can be identified and corrected.<p>

Experience has proved that few complete data sets produced by 
researchers are without problems. Often, quality assurance includes 
simple checks for missing or unreasonable values or inconsistent 
correlation. But a good data center will question further. Some large 
observational data sets are received unfiltered (for completeness); 
but by applying reasonable constraints on the quality of observations 
(always working with the principal investigator), they can be made 
beyond question.<p>

The resulting data set may be smaller, but confidence in the 
reliability of the data is greatly increased. In the case of computer 
models, appropriate quality assurance measures include error and 
sensitivity analysis requiring special codes and research techniques. 
Of course, any changes made are in conjunction with and with full 
approval of the original researchers to ensure their appropriateness. 
The accompanying documentation clearly explains what was done 
during the quality assurance process.<p>

Depending on the data involved, the effort can be extensive and 
often can be the single most expensive step in processing a data set 
for distribution. The cost of full-quality assurance for a large data set 
makes it imperative that priorities be set within each data center so 
that only the most valuable data sets receive the maximum level of 
quality assurance. However, for these pivotal data sets, this level of 
quality assurance is absolutely necessary since future research and 
policy decisions may rest on careful analysis of these important data 
sets.<p>

Data set documentation should specifically identify what quality 
assurance procedures were applied to the data either by the 
principal investigator(s), the project team, or the archive data center. 
Data variables themselves may have quality tags associated with 
them to indicate the level of confidence placed in their value or to 
indicate known problems with measurements. The value and use of 
data quality tags will vary between data sets and the analyses to 
which they will be subject.<p>

<h3>Outreach and Education</h3>

There are multiple aspects to the outreach and educational needs 
that the global change data and information management program 
must satisfy. Satisfying these needs will be one of the functions of 
the Content Subgroup. Examples of these outreach and education 
needs include the following:<p>
<ul>
<li><em>Public information</em>.  There is a broad spectrum of users 
who need global change data and information. Furthermore, the 
global change data and information themselves are in multiple 
disciplines. For the data and information to be used to the fullest, it is 
necessary that the total user community be made aware not only of 
the data and information themselves that are available, but also of 
the related services that can be provided. Special products will be 
produced to meet this need. The data and information management 
system will not be successful unless it is used, and it will not be used 
unless potential users know enough about it to use it.<p>
<li><em>K-12</em>.  It is clear that learning about the global changes 
of our home planet is not only important, but also interesting and 
challenging at all levels of the educational system. Global change data 
and information help provide the fuel for such education. However, 
most of the data and information are not in forms that can be readily 
used at the K-12 levels or even by the general public. With the 
advice of K-12 educators, special attention will be given to the 
production of special data and information products suitable for use 
by K-12 teachers and students and by the media.<p>
<li><em>Training</em>.  Clearly, the mandate of the global change 
data and information program to have data and information 
available in useful forms for the broad user community will require 
the efforts of an increased number of individuals cross-trained in 
both research and information science. Such individuals must also be 
professionally motivated to use their skills in the program. The data 
and information management program will encourage such cross-
training through such mechanisms as graduate and undergraduate 
student programs at universities and visiting researcher programs at 
agency data centers. Such education initiatives also will help develop 
the professional acceptability needed to draw other talented 
individuals into both providing their data and information and to 
putting it into useful forms.</ul><p>

<h2><a name=National>National Policy Issue Data and 
Information</a></h2>

The Content Subgroup will ensure that the necessary data and 
information are available to resolve the important global-change-
related policy issues the United States faces. Two examples of such 
policy related issues are shown in <a href=gifs/fig3.gif>Figure 3</a>. 
Other policy-related issues are being identified by the CGED.<p>

As a specific example of GCDIS content system implementation, the 
Content Subgroup will assume responsibility for the coordination 
necessary to identify a limited number - a dozen, more or less - of 
such policy-related issues. This will require coordinating with 
multiple groups, including other elements of the USGCRP and the 
NAS. For each such policy issue established, the Content Subgroup 
will form an ad hoc panel that includes representatives of the 
appropriate NAS groups, agency program managers, and agency data 
centers. It will be the responsibility of this panel of experts to 
identify<p>

<ul>
<li>The priority data and information that are potentially available, 
<li>The data and information for which the existing level of service 
is below the requirement,
<li>Holes in the data and information coverage that need to be 
filled both with existing data and information and with their long-
term continuation, 
<li>Special products required, and
<li>The data and information management actions and schedules 
necessary to meet the imperatives of a particular policy-related 
issue.</ul><p>

This approach - working group interactions among advisory- , 
management- , and working-level experts that span particular 
issues - will help ensure that the best data and information will be 
available so that progress can be made on problems of central 
national importance. Further ensurance will be provided by giving 
the priority policy-related data and information identified by this 
approach the highest level of service, level 1.<p>

A pilot study has been initiated to test and demonstrate the 
applicability of this approach for GCDIS content coordination on an 
actual policy issue before implementing this approach on the full 
range of USGCRP policy issues. Because of the imperative to fill the 
planning gap on requirements for CO2 emissions monitoring that is 
an integral part of the Climate Framework Convention, the issue 
selected for the pilot study is the ability to determine regional 
sources and sinks for atmospheric CO2 for application as a part of a 
monitoring system for a GHG emissions reduction agreement (see <a 
href=gifs/fig3.gif>Figure 3</a>). Based on preliminary estimates of the 
data and information needed to investigate this problem that are 
presently available through processes such as those outlined in 
Figure 3, it seems likely that one immediate result of the pilot study 
will be the identification of the additional data and information 
management efforts that must be mounted for the determination of 
the regional sources and sinks of atmospheric CO2. 

<h2><a name=Emerging>Emerging Trends</a></h2>

In the course of GCDIS implementation, the richness of approaches to 
the analysis and interpretation of global change data and information 
will continue to increase. Currently, three critical trends are 
emerging: the increasing use of model output from one scientific 
domain as input into the study of another domain, the use of data to 
drive data assimilation models in order to interpolate among 
measurements that are relatively sparse in space and time, and the 
increasing dependence of field campaigns on the data from existing 
ground-based and satellite assets that are managed by a variety of 
agencies. These activities and others that can be expected to arise as 
the study of global change matures will cause major shifts in the way 
in that global change data are approached and the assets needed to 
support their effective utilization. The subgroup will work with other 
elements of the USGCRP to address these issues.<p>

These three trends lead to the need for early consideration of several 
issues. The ways in which model output is captured and preserved 
will be critical. Learning from the Program for Climate Modeling 
Diagnosis and Intercomparison, the GCDIS will address guidelines for 
what data and information need to be preserved from particular 
models, as well as which models will have their output regularly 
preserved. Data assimilation is becoming an analytic method of 
choice. Not only will it be necessary to address the preservation of 
assimilated data products, but the extensive computational assets 
needed for a global data assimilation will increasingly become a 
necessary aspect of the data access question. Specifically, without 
assimilation, many data will be far less valuable.<p>

Finally, the data assets of the various national and international 
agencies have value beyond their support of researchers seeking 
access in the sense of a library or archive. In the coming years 
significant field programs, such as the World Ocean Circulation 
Experiment (WOCE) and GEWEX, will mount major field campaigns 
that will depend heavily on these data assets. They will depend on 
other data not only for the postcampaign analysis, but also in support 
of the field operations during the experiments themselves.<p>

<h1>5. Access System Implementation by Functional Areas</h1>
<img src=gifs/bluegrad.gif>

This chapter discusses implementation of the GCDIS access services, 
including an overview of the GCDIS access system, a discussion of 
how GCDIS access function implementation will be coordinated, a 
summary of the GCDIS access services, and discussions of each GCDIS 
access system functional area. This will be followed by discussions of 
the relation between GCDIS access functions and State, local, and 
international programs with which GCDIS must work.<p>

For the GCDIS, the definition of system embraces the full range of 
people, procedures, hardware, software, and infrastructure (e.g., 
networks, telephones, mail) that together constitute a system 
providing users with access to data and information services (a mix 
of online and offline).

<h2><a name=Access>Access System Overview</a></h2>

The GCDIS is the set of individual agency data and information 
systems: a mix of manual and automated, online and offline 
functions, supplemented by a minimum amount of new crosscutting 
infrastructure, and made interoperable by use of standards, common 
approaches, sharing of technology, and coordination of data policies. 
Thus, each agency's own data and information system will be that 
agency's component of the GCDIS.<p>

The GCDIS comprises individual agency systems that must evolve to 
meet changing agency user needs and agency missions, and to take 
advantage of emerging information system technology. Such 
evolution will pose a major challenge to the agencies to ensure that it 
does not disrupt the interoperability that allows the GCDIS to exist. 
Also, changing needs of global change users and technology will 
create an evolutionary pressure to which agencies must respond 
while protecting agency missions and users. The coordinating 
mechanisms and the agency implementation approaches, including 
the standards used, must allow flexibility and change. 

<h3>Conceptual View of the GCDIS Access System</h3>

The conceptual view of the GCDIS access system is in marked 
contrast to the present system where, for the most part, individual 
agencies service only their own user communities. Although with the 
GCDIS each agency will continue to serve its own user community, 
agency data and information systems will be interconnected.<p>

Users accessing any of the agency data and information systems 
making up the GCDIS access system will be able to obtain a 
comprehensive view of common GCDIS access system services 
(common across the GCDIS agencies), while also continuing to have 
access to the specific services of that agency (which are tailored for 
the user community specific to that agency according to the agency's 
own individual mission requirements). The actual physical 
configuration within this conceptual framework will evolve 
dramatically as user needs and technology change and as the 
different agencies attain increasing degrees of GCDIS interoperability.
The system will also evolve in terms of the number of participating 
agencies. The IWGDMGC will actively work to broaden GCDIS 
participation to include the other agencies with data and information 
needed for the USGCRP. To encourage their participation, the GCDIS is 
planned as a system that an agency can join with only a modest 
commitment and then work toward a fuller implementation of the 
information service objectives of GCDIS. Although the desirable level 
of enhanced participation will involve provision by the agency of the 
full suite of metadata appropriate for their data and information, the 
minimal requirement for agency participation will be<p>

<ul><li>Availability of data or information relevant to global 
change,<p>
<li>Directory level metadata describing these data or information,<p>
<li>A credibly permanent commitment to maintaining these data 
and information and making them available,<p>
<li>Interoperability with the rest of GCDIS sufficient to make their 
directory level information accessible from any other GCDIS entity, 
and<p>
<li>User support for the data or information by somebody.</ul><p>

There is now and always will be significant diversity among and 
within agencies regarding their data and information systems, 
ranging from highly automated systems to largely manual systems. 
The evolution of systems within agencies will proceed at different 
rates, given agency user requirements, mission needs, and budget 
constraints (this plan assumes that the GCDIS access system 
implementation must be accomplished within currently projected 
agency budgets). The GCDIS access system approach must be 
sufficiently flexible and adaptable to function in such a highly 
heterogeneous and changing environment.

<h3>Interoperability of Services</h3>

From the users' point of view, the interoperability required for the 
GCDIS access system implementation to be successful must result 
from a sufficient degree of commonality among agency data and 
information systems and services. Commonality does not imply major 
changes to the data and information systems. Locator technology 
freely available on the international Internet will be used to provide 
a common look and feel at a general level for systems that differ 
radically from each other, although the underlying systems may be 
quite different in supporting more specific functions. This enables 
users to view the overall aggregate global change data base and 
supporting services as a coordinated whole and yet still have the 
potion of accessing agencies' data and information services by the 
methods defined by each agency. Sufficient commonality in this 
context can not be defined <em>a priori</em> - continuing 
involvement of global change users in advising, testing, and 
evaluating the evolving implementation of the GCDIS access system 
will be essential to ensure that the degree of interoperability 
attained by the GCDIS access system meets their needs. The agency 
elements that will become agency components of the GCDIS access 
system are and will be a heterogeneous collection, ranging from 
almost entirely manual systems to highly but never completely 
automated systems. Interoperability must be addressed in terms of 
common standards and guidelines for manual procedures as well as 
information system functions.<p>

There must be interagency <em>coordination</em> on the common 
standards and approaches required to meet the needs of the global 
change user community, while also meeting the needs of agency-
specific user communities. Sufficiency will be measured by users 
evaluating the usefulness of the GCDIS access system.<p>

Underlying the interoperability seen by the user will be a variety of 
implementation approaches, such as use of a client-server 
architecture that will evolve with advances in information systems 
technology. The pace and extent to which individual agencies are 
able to implement interoperability will vary with the agency's own 
mission, schedule, and cost constraints. Attainment of the goal of 
making disparate services and systems look like a common logical 
system to the user will, therefore, not be achieved uniformly across 
all agencies. Thus interoperability and the GCDIS access system 
gradually will evolve.

<h3>Standards and Procedures Approach</h3>

The GCDIS will adopt recommended common standards and 
procedures in areas critical to the consistency and coherence of the 
global change data and information holdings and supporting access 
services. The purpose of reliance on standards is not only to facilitate 
use of the system and its products by users but also to facilitate 
evolution of elements of the system by building in technology 
independence through adoption of such standards as the Portable 
Operating System Interface (POSIX), the Spatial Data Transfer 
Standard (SDTS), and related approaches.<p>

The Standards Subgroup will provide support to all the IWGDMGC 
subgroups. Examples of support will be to provide information on 
training, documentation, and contacts; to be the focal point for the 
coordination of recommendations on standards for agency 
implementation plans; and to promote the development of new 
standards where needed. The Standards Subgroup will submit these 
recommended standards to the IWGDMGC for adoption.<p>

<strong>Standards</strong><p>

In the functional areas described in this plan, the objective will be to 
identify and use existing standards, whenever possible, rather than 
to develop new standards. Where FIPS either do not exist or are not 
applicable, preference will be given to adopting international and 
national standards developed by recognized voluntary standards 
bodies such as the International Standards Organization (ISO) and the 
American National Standards Institute. If no FIPS or voluntary 
standards exist for an important area of need, and if timely 
development by existing standards bodies seems unlikely, then 
consideration will be given to establishing an interagency standard to 
meet the need.<p>

<strong>International Standards</strong><p>

Implementation of the GCDIS access system by U.S. agencies will 
facilitate international cooperation by making use of international 
standards and protocols (e.g., the Unicode and the ISO standards, the 
CEOS standards) wherever practical. The U.S. GCDIS access system 
will be a node on an international global change data and information 
system.<p>

<strong>Procedures</strong><p>

Procedural guidelines in areas such as user services and billing and 
other related administrative functions will be adopted and 
implemented to improve services important to the global change 
researcher.

<h3>Technology Sharing among Agencies</h3>

Technology sharing initially will focus on software needed to provide 
commonality required to reduce differences among agency data and 
information systems. The exchange of software will simplify 
interagency mediation needed to bring about the interoperability 
needed for the GCDIS access system. Technology sharing also may 
offer cost savings for agencies and facilitate more rapid 
implementation of needed capabilities. Bilateral or multilateral 
technology sharing will expedite implementation of the GCDIS access 
system.<p>

Software will be shared among agencies participating in the GCDIS 
access system. The software will be fully documented and will 
embody architecture and design approaches, such as layering and 
use of standard interfaces to avoid hardware dependence or vendor 
dependence, and to allow modification or addition of modules 
without redoing architecture. The agency accepting software will be 
responsible for implementing the software in its own environment, 
establishing the capability to support it, and adapting or extending 
the software as needed to meet the agency's own needs while 
maintaining the agreed degree of commonality needed to support the 
GCDIS access system. The agency providing the software will provide 
full documentation, technical assistance, and support to the extent 
possible within its program constraints, but the receiving agencies 
will need to have or develop their own capabilities.

<h2><a name=Coordinating>Coordinating Access 
Implementation</a></h2>

<h3>Access Subgroup</h3>

Data access issues will be coordinated by the combined efforts of the 
Catalog, Networks, Standards, and Libraries Subgroups. The Catalog 
Subgroup will act as the IWGDMGC overseer of the GCMD. The 
Network Subgroup will analyze requirements for internal and 
external networking required for the success of the GCDIS access 
system.<p>

The Standards Subgroup will develop recommendations for FIPS and 
voluntary standards to be adopted in the functional areas described 
in this plan. These recommendations will be submitted to the 
IWGDMGC for adoption. Agencies will decide whether to adopt the 
recommendations and the appropriate time frame for their 
implementation. An overall decision to accept a recommended 
standard will be by agreement of the agencies involved in the GCDIS 
access system implementation.<p>

The IWGDMGC Library Information Subgroup will coordinate the 
identification, organization, creation, and distribution of library and 
information products and documents related to global change 
research, referral, and educational activities, and serve as a 
clearinghouse that coordinates library and information center 
collection efforts among organizations involved in global change 
research.<p>

Other GCDIS access system functions will be implemented entirely 
within the participating agency elements, with specific coordination 
of existing implementation efforts to be accomplished through the 
mechanisms discussed in the next section. In addition, the Access 
Subgroup will include a catalog and distribution services team, which 
will include representatives from agency implementation efforts, to 
ensure that these efforts are coordinated across the agencies.

<h3>Agency Implementation Coordination</h3>

Agencies in the process of upgrading or developing their agency data 
and information systems as their components of the GCDIS access 
system will coordinate the technical details of the design and 
implementation of their systems within the framework provided by 
this implementation plan. Agency representatives participating at 
this level will be directly involved in each agency's data system 
implementation effort; these people are in the best position to arrive 
at a consensus on specific technical recommendations to the GCDIS 
access system agencies. They also can help establish appropriate 
links to other interagency data and information access programs.<p>

Each agency will establish its own mechanism within its own 
implementation effort, inviting participation of agencies engaged in 
parallel efforts, to make recommendations concerning specific design 
choices or implementation decisions to allow the interoperability 
required for the GCDIS access system. Each agency should then 
incorporate the GCDIS access system recommendations into its own 
systems to the extent possible, given cost and schedule constraints. 

<h2><a name=Services>Access Services</a></h2>

This section defines the system functionality required for GCDIS 
access services. Access services include a complete range of data and 
information services to users - catalog, order, browse, distribution, 
and user support - and underlying archive and network services. 
Electronic access to these services will be provided to users via the 
Internet. For the GCDIS access system to succeed, participating 
agencies must cooperate to achieve interoperability among their 
various methods of providing these services. That interoperability 
will allow users to see a consistent set of services spanning the 
agencies; users will be able to identify, order, and receive ensembles 
of data and information products held by some or all of the agencies. 
Their use of these products will be facilitated by common media and 
formats and consistent documentation.<p>

Some agencies' participation in the GCDIS access functions will be 
limited. In particular, DOD participation in the GCDIS is limited to 
making unclassified and unrestricted data and information available 
to appropriate civil agencies; GCDIS access functions for DOD data and 
information will be assumed by those other agencies.<p>

Although it is a driving assumption that development and extension 
of electronic, online capabilities is needed for GCDIS access services, 
GCDIS access services always will be provided by a mix of manual 
and automated, online, and offline functions. Whereas that mix might 
include more electronic services in the future, the need for manual 
services in such key areas as user support will remain. Thus, the 
broad definition of <em>system</em> in the GCDIS is a combination of 
hardware, software, people, and procedures.<p>

A user view of the functional areas and an overall schedule 
establishing goals for progressively achieving interoperability in 
these areas will be presented. This will be followed by a discussion of 
each functional area in detail, including definitions of levels of 
implementation of the functionality within each functional area, and 
milestones for progressive, phased implementation by the 
agencies.<p>

Therefore, the overall plan for the GCDIS access system 
implementation will be presented as a combination of efforts for the 
individual functional areas, and within each area implementation will 
be addressed on an agency-by-agency basis, with individual agency 
implementation plans set in the context of the overall schedule and 
priority.

<h3>User View of the Functional Areas</h3>

The following is a presentation of the GCDIS access system functional 
areas from a user point of view. This is not intended to suggest a 
strictly sequential approach to implementing the GCDIS, but to 
provide guidance based on user needs for phased and overlapping 
progressive implementation of the GCDIS access system. There is a 
fundamental requirement for user support services, provided by 
expert personnel, accompanying any and all access functions, 
regardless of the degree of automation of the functions.<p>
<ul>
<li><em>Archive</em>.  The user must be able to rely on the long-
term integrity of priority global change data and information, and 
required documentation must be preserved.<p>

<li><em>Offline access</em>.  At the most basic level, the user must 
have access to priority global change data and information, including 
full hard-copy documentation of all data sets and related reports and 
publications, in an offline, manual mode.<p>

<li><em>Directory</em>.  At a minimum, the user must be able to 
identify readily and locate priority global change data sets, data 
systems, and related information across GCDIS agency global change 
holdings and related holdings of external organizations (national and 
international).<p>

<li><em>Inventory</em>.  The user must be able to identify and 
select, using (at a minimum) common spatial and temporal 
references and the particular combinations of data and information 
from multiple agencies needed for the research effort, drawing upon 
priority global change data sets held by the agencies.<p>

<li><em>Order</em>.  Having identified needed data and information, 
the user must be able to order it.<p>

<li><em>Distribution</em>.  Timely delivery and common formats 
offer important advantages to users by reducing the time between 
when a data set (and especially combinations of data sets) is 
requested and when the user can begin actual research with the data 
set(s).<p>

<li><em>Browse</em>.  This allows the user to screen data sets to 
minimize the amount of data actually ordered, thus saving the user 
time in sifting through whole data sets instead of browse samples or 
subsets, conserving GCDIS capacity.<p>

<li><em>Guide</em>.  Online as well as hard-copy availability of 
detailed documentation ancillary to key data sets provide essential 
information in convenient form.<p>

<li><em>Information</em>.  This means access to and integration of 
library and information center collections, services, and information 
products (such as a wide array of published research in the form of 
books, journals, conference proceedings, technical reports, maps, 
geographic information systems, and multimedia, as well as gray 
literature, metadata, and small data sets). Identifying and creating 
access to papers relevant to particular global change data sets will 
receive special emphasis.<p>

<li><em>Billing and administrative</em>.  Possible implementation 
efforts in this area will be considered in the future.</ul><p>

Networking is an underlying requirement for all these functions, 
except offline access. Each functional area requires network support, 
therefore network requirements will be addressed for each 
functional area.<p>

International access is the extension of these services to provide 
access to global change data sets held internationally and, in turn, to 
allow international access to GCDIS functionality. The program plan 
calls for implementation of international access during the period 
2001-2010. Some GCDIS access system agencies are now actively 
involved in international efforts that will be broadened in the future.

<h3>Access Function Implementation Link to Data Set Priorities</h3>

Resources for implementing GCDIS access functions will be limited. It 
is essential that data sets of greatest importance to the USGCRP 
receive the highest levels of support. <a href=tab4gcdip.html>Table 
4</a> maps the level of implementation for each access functional 
area against the categories of data set priority, and is a companion to 
the similar table in <a href=ch4gcdip.html>Chapter 4</a> that maps 
content areas against data set priority. The <a 
href=tab4gcdip.html>table</a> should be interpreted as establishing a 
goal for a floor level of implementation in each case. For example, an 
inventory implementation level of 2 for a high-priority data set 
would be the minimal goal for the GCDIS access system. The access 
functional areas and the levels of implementation for each will be 
discussed in detail in later sections.<p>

In the case of the directory function, the levels of implementation 
are not readily correlated with data set priority. Rather, it is most 
urgent that the directory information be assembled and made 
available for the most important data sets; priorities for these efforts 
will be consistent with data set priorities.

<h3>Access Function Implementation Link to Type of User</h3>

The wide spectrum of the user community includes users with<p>
<ul>
<li>Access capabilities ranging from mail to telephone to the 
Internet,<p>
<li>The ability to handle data and information from paper only to 
optical disk and electronic, and<p>
<li>Very limited technical knowledge of a particular discipline to 
expertise in that discipline.</ul><p>

The GCDIS will recognize and meet these disparate user access 
requirements. The technical capability for meeting such a spectrum 
of needs in the first two areas is well developed and available. To 
meet the needs in the last area, it will be necessary to build special 
directory capabilities to help guide specific classes of users to the 
data and information products that they require.<p>

For example, educators in the K-12 levels will need to be directed to 
those products suitable for their use without being immediately 
confronted upon entry into the GCDIS with the total contents of the 
GCDIS. Similarly, many of the users interested in policy aspects will 
need to have identified data and information products that can either 
meet their needs or help guide them to more detailed information.<p>

A final example of the need for these special directory capabilities is 
that of researchers in one discipline wanting to work on 
interdisciplinary problems. Many such users will need special help in 
finding summary-level information in disciplines outside their own 
to guide them in their more detailed use of the GCDIS.

<h2><a name=User>User Support and Outreach</a></h2>

<strong>Description</strong><p>

User support services include providing expert staff personnel to 
assist users with any of the GCDIS access system functions. 
Regardless of the degree to which the GCDIS access system functions 
become automated or accessible online, a requirement will exist for 
user support personnel to interact directly with users, answering 
questions, and providing advice and guidance. This function also 
includes preparation and distribution of user aids of various 
types.<p>

The data or information center should reach out to the researchers, 
policy makers, educators, and the general interested public that 
make up the user community. Data and information product 
announcements in scientific journals, flyers to discipline departments 
at universities, and maintenance of mailing lists that include 
attendance lists from major workshops or meetings are effective 
ways of informing the user community of a center's holdings and 
services. A periodical center newsletter is one means to establish a 
stable audience for center communication.<p>

Just as it is important to reach out to users to inform them of the 
system capabilities, user feedback is critical to the growth of the 
global change data and information program. The components of the 
system of user services, directory or catalog offerings, networks, and 
procedures must be capable of responding to such changes as 
increased user sophistication, priorities' changes, and technology 
advances. The direction of these changes often come from the users. 
Information about problems experienced by users can provide 
valuable guidance on system technical shortcomings. Feedback 
through user forums and questions that come into information 
centers offer indicators about needed data and information lacking in 
the system. These and other techniques, such as automatic collection 
of access system search statistics, will be implemented to guide 
enhancements to the overall system.<p>

<strong>Needed Interoperability</strong><p>

The user support staffs of the various agency GCDIS access system 
elements will exchange information about their organization's data 
and services so that a user contacting the user support staff of any 
GCDIS element can obtain information about all other GCDIS 
elements, and obtain referrals to GCDIS access system elements 
offering data and services of interest to the user.<p>

<strong>Agency Applicability</strong><p>

This function applies to all agencies (or their designees) participating 
in the GCDIS access system at any level.<p>

<strong>Agency Implementation Overview</strong><p>

Continual coordination of agency user support functions will be 
provided through the standing User Support Team, composed of 
agency user support staff with active participation of members of the 
User Advisory Group and other user representatives.

<h2><a name=Networks>Networks</a></h2>

<strong>Description</strong><p>

Each GCDIS agency will establish a suitable level of connectivity to 
the Internet, a global network of networks connecting the research 
and education communities throughout the United States and to 
nearly 60 (as of March 1993) other countries. In the United States, 
the Internet consists of NSFNET, regional and State networks, agency 
networks, and local networks such as campus networks. The future 
development of the U.S. infrastructure will be strongly influenced by 
the NREN program, the networking component of the HPCC program, 
and the NII program. Connections to this networking infrastructure 
are required to support external user access to GCDIS access system 
services and internal operations between the GCDIS access system 
components needed to support user services.<p>

This set of connections is referred to as the GCDIS access system 
virtual network. Connections on the GCDIS access system virtual 
network will be set up to handle the types of operations that may 
take place to support GCDIS functions accessed by a user at one 
GCDIS access system node. For example, if a user connects to agency 
A's system and performs an inventory search spanning the 
inventories of agencies B and C as well as A, some communication 
between agencies A, B, and C will be necessary to relay the search 
request to the inventories and then transfer the search results back 
to agency A for assembly and presentation to the user. The nature of 
the communications between the agency systems will be a high 
frequency of small transactions that require very rapid response in 
order that the end-to-end or net response time to the user be rapid 
enough to meet user needs. Also, in some cases, the connections will 
be needed to support other global-change-related functions, such as 
supercomputer access.<p>

In the case of both external and internal network requirements, an 
analysis of the frequency and size of the transactions that the 
network must support will be made. Response times will be 
established that meet user needs. Attention will be paid to peak as 
well as average capacity requirements (e.g., in terms of concurrent 
user support).<p>

<strong>Needed Interoperability</strong><p>

In order to support open electronic access by users or electronic 
exchanges with other GCDIS access system elements (in the same or 
other agencies), agency GCDIS access system elements must have the 
appropriate network connections, including Internet access. The 
capacity of the agency elements network interface must be sized to 
support the GCDIS access system functions requiring network 
support.<p>

<strong>Agency Applicability</strong><p>

The need for networking support as an integral part of the GCDIS 
access system applies to all agencies (or their designees).<p>

<strong>Agency Implementation Overview</strong><p>

Agency plans for implementing online GCDIS access system functions 
will include implementation of required network support. For 
example, agency plans for implementing online GCDIS access system 
inventory services will include identifying agency elements involved 
and establishing network connectivity for those agency elements, 
and sizing the networking capacity to meet the needs of the 
inventory function.<p>

Three levels of network user performance requirements have been 
identified that are needed to provide access to GCDIS user 
services:<p>

</ul>
<li><em><a name="level1">Network user performance level 
1</a></em>:  Online data services. Network user performance level 1 
supports online dynamic science, which means transfer of data in 
real time, access to supercomputer computational models, and 
scientific conferences.  This level of network performance requires 
sustained transfers of up to 1 megabit per second (Mbps) or more. 
This network performance level is provided with either dedicated 
Ethernet and T1 services (1.544 Mbps and higher), or shared fiber-
optic networks (e.g., a fiber-optic digital data interface local area 
network [FDDI LAN] with T3 or switched multimegabit data service 
access, or asynchronous transfer mode).<p>

<li><em><a name="level2">Network user performance level 
2</a></em>:  Online browse.  Network user performance level 2 
supports user access to precomputed browse products that are stored 
online or near line.  Near-line data are staged dynamically into the 
online hierarchy at the time of an initial preview request, so that 
whereas the initial browse product may not be transmitted back to 
the user for as long as a minute, subsequent products in the same 
data set may be sent within a few seconds. This level of network 
performance requires sufficient bandwidth to support burst 
transfers of up to 100 kilobytes per second (Kbps) for up to 1 or 2 
seconds. This network performance level is typically provided with 
shared Ethernet connections using T1 access lines.<p>

<li><em><a name="level3>Network user performance level 3</a></em>:  
Metadata access. Network user performance level 3 supports user 
access for directory, guide, and inventory searches of metadata. The 
metadata typically are text records accessed with brief text queries. 
This level of network performance requires sufficient bandwidth to 
support a number of short interactive messages with rapid response 
times.  This network performance level typically is provided with 
voice-grade telephone line access (i.e., direct modem connection at 
2.4 to 14.4 Kbps, or shared Ethernet connection via 56-Kbps access 
line).</ul><p>

In addition, networking between GCDIS access system elements is 
also required to support GCDIS user services. Within a given agency, 
its GCDIS element might be a collection of agency elements linked 
together as a single but distributed agency GCDIS element, or a set of 
agency elements, each functioning as separate GCDIS access system 
nodes. Internal GCDIS access system networking refers to networking 
between the GCDIS access system nodes required to support GCDIS 
access system user services. These internal GCDIS access system 
network services are required to support the rapid searching and 
relaying of metadata and data in support of services provided at 
each agency's GCDIS access system node user interface. The nature of 
network communications within agencies and among agencies in 
support of each of the network user performance levels is similar to 
the levels seen by the users, except that in some cases there may be 
more system-to-system interaction than seen by the user, and that 
the internal GCDIS access system networking must be able to support 
a higher level of concurrent use than individual GCDIS access system 
node concurrent user support (i.e., concurrent users at a number of 
GCDIS access system nodes might invoke GCDIS access such system 
services as inventory searches that each spread out across all GCDIS 
nodes).

<h2><a name=Directory>Directory</a></h2>

<strong>Description</strong><p>

The GCDIS directory will provide information to its users on all 
priority, global-change-related data and information that are 
available and that have sources identified for user help with both 
acquisition and use. This applies whether the source of the data and 
information is international, National (agency), State, local, or from an 
individual.<p>

The GCDIS directory consists of several elements. At the core is the 
GCMD and associated Directory Interchange Format (DIF)-based 
directories, such as the Consortium for International Earth Science 
Information Network (CIESIN) directory, which contain descriptions 
of data sets relevant to global change. The descriptions are provided 
by the agencies in a standard DIF which is automatically loadable 
into the DIF-based directory data bases. Conformance to DIF allows 
this core information to be searched by standard methods and to 
return data descriptions that are consistent in the type of 
information content. The DIF-based GCDIS directory function makes 
possible coherent searches across agencies by providing functional 
consistency in terms of space and time references and terminology 
used to name and describe data.<p>

The DIF is one of many formats that are used to convey locator 
information, and DIF can be converted to and from the Government 
Information Locator Service (GILS) core elements format without loss 
of information. This allows DIF-based directories to be easily 
incorporated into many other directory services, and also allows DIF-
based directories to bring in entities from other directories 
throughout the world. To accommodate existing library information 
systems, the DIF also supports a representation in the U.S. Machine 
Readable Cataloging (USMARC) format. Transformation from the DIF 
format to the USMARC format, however, is not easily reversible 
because the DIF format has more specificity than is currently defined 
for the USMARC format.<p>

A number of data set directories for agency data and information 
existed before the creation of the DIF-based directories. These are 
the second element of the overall GCDIS directory. None of these 
directories are specifically oriented to the topic of global change, but 
many have relevant data descriptions. The information content 
varies in format, so it is not always easy to obtain comparative 
information. Nonetheless, the directories do represent a valuable 
resource and need to be made searchable through the GCDIS. These 
directories are searchable by the standard methods used in the past, 
but it is important also to be able to search multiple directories 
simultaneously for relevant data and information. The present way 
to do this is to use network tools such as Gopher and Wide-Area 
Information Server (WAIS) to allow access to these directories and 
make their information content searchable by standard text retrieval 
and field-searching methods. The DIF-based directories can also be 
made searchable by these methods, but these methods do not 
presently allow the user to know valid values that can be entered in 
some of the controlled fields. Consequently, it is important to 
continue the work of describing high-priority global change data sets 
in the DIF-based directories.<p>

Information other than data set descriptions, such as reference 
documents, regulations, study papers, and so forth, also needs to be 
locatable through the GCDIS directory. This could include, as well, 
pictorial materials such as maps and sample images. For this much 
broader amount of information, the GCDIS needs to function like a 
digital library and use the techniques that have been and are being 
developed for this purpose. Abstracts or summary descriptions for 
these materials (or even the documents themselves) can be retrieved 
through the GCDIS directory using the network tools mentioned 
earlier. The GCDIS directory will also lead the user to the standard 
online library search capabilities wherever available to the user 
community. The data set directories can be considered as one small 
part of this very large body of information. <p>

Finally, the GCDIS directory must provide pointers at the guide and 
inventory level to other data and information systems and allow the 
user to gain more detailed information about global change data or 
even the data themselves. In many cases the GCDIS directory 
provides automated connections to these other systems. The user 
must know or be told, however, that these systems can be accessed 
directly and that it is not always necessary to go through the GCDIS 
directory to use them. In the same way, the other systems can make 
known to their users that the GCDIS directory exists and, perhaps, 
offer an automated connection to it to get directory-level information 
about data being pursued.<p>

The GCDIS directory will be accessible by networks and dial-in lines 
from around the world. The directory will contain information from 
around the world and will not be limited to just U.S. entries. There 
will be at least one distributable version of the DIF-based directories 
available for stand-alone use on personal computers that retains as 
much of the functionality of the online versions as possible.<p>

The DIF-based directories are part of the CEOS International 
Directory Network (IDN), which is a federation of directory systems 
from around the world bound by sharing information about data in 
the Earth and space sciences through the exchange of DIF files. The 
GCMD is the U.S. coordinating node of the CEOS IDN. There are two 
other coordinating nodes in Italy and Japan that are the European 
and Asian coordinating nodes, respectively. These coordinating nodes 
are gathering points for information exchange within the CEOS IDN, 
and each of them have complete and identical data bases and 
software that are kept consistent with each other through biweekly 
automated information exchanges. Thus, the GCMD receives global 
change data information from international sources as well.<p>

The GCMD and the CIESIN directory employ client-server 
architecture, with multiple clients accessing distributed servers. The 
DIF-based directories may evolve to become a single virtual GCMD 
directory composed of a federation of DIF-based servers, perhaps 
one for each participating agency, which can all be accessed through 
queries initiated by client software. These would support standard 
national and international protocols for information search and 
retrieval, such as ANSI Z39.50 and ISO 10163. This possible evolution 
of the DIF-based GCDIS directory function is now being tested with 
the GCMD and CIESIN servers. <p>

<strong>Needed Interoperability</strong><p>

Agencies describe their priority global change data and information 
holdings according to GCDIS directory standards for scope, content, 
space-time references, and terminology used in names and 
descriptions or abstracts. The directory function should be 
interoperable with guide and inventory functions as described 
previously.<p>

Four levels of contribution by agencies to the GCDIS directory are 
defined as follows:<p>
<table border>
<tr>
<td>Level 1.</td><td>Agencies will operate a directory node containing 
information prepared to GCDIS directory standards describing agency 
global change data and information. This will include the resources 
necessary to keep the server's information up to date about the data 
and information resources to which it points. If a distributed server 
approach is adopted for the GCDIS directory, each agency directory 
would be one of the servers in the distributed GCDIS access system 
directory. If a centralized approach is continued, each agency node 
will contribute information to the central, coordinating node. This 
node will hold all information contributed by all of the agencies. This 
also will include the connection of underlying information systems to 
the distributed GCDIS directory using interoperable techniques to the 
extent possible.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Level 2.</td><td>Agencies contribute directory information for 
all global change data and information, prepared to GCDIS directory 
standards, to be added to the GCDIS directory data base.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Level 3.</td><td>Agencies contribute directory information for 
priority global change data and information, prepared to GCDIS 
directory standards, to be added to the GCDIS directory data 
base.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Level 4.</td><td>Agencies provide existing documentation of 
priority global change data and information to the GCDIS directory 
staff personnel, who in turn prepare directory entries and add these 
to the GCDIS directory data base.</td></tr>
</table><p>

<strong>Agency Applicability</strong><p>

The GCDIS directory applies to all U.S. agencies holding global change 
data and related information or supporting global change research 
and related data generation in outside agencies. The U.S. agencies 
work with their international counterparts to ensure that relevant 
international information is included in the directory function as 
well. <p>

<strong>Agency Implementation Overview</strong><p>

The present directory implementation activities for the GCDIS access 
system are as follows:<p>
<ul>
<li>NASA will continue to operate and develop the existing GCMD 
client and server;<p>
<li>NASA will continue to develop and distribute the PC-based 
version of the GCMD;<p>
<li>NASA will seek and review agency, academic, and other source 
global change data descriptions for inclusion in the GCMD; and <p>
<li>NOAA will operate a Gopher server providing a structural 
hierarchy, access paths, information, and automated connections to 
the GCDIS directory and other parts of the GCDIS.</ul><p>

Agencies will continue to provide global change data set information 
descriptions to the GCMD by adding to and updating their data set 
descriptions in the present GCMD server. Useful and usable data sets 
will be described in DIF files and the DIF files loaded into the GCMD 
(in either the NASA or the CIESIN server). Adjunct products to the 
online GCMD, such as printed versions of selected information and 
CD-ROMs with information, data, and incorporated browse capability, 
will continue to be developed and distributed as resources permit. If 
the GCMD evolves to include multiple servers, agencies also may 
contribute information conforming to GCMD standards for new 
servers or provide access to servers containing agency directory 
information conforming to GCMD standards. All agencies will identify 
any data and information systems that can usefully be accessed 
through the automated connections (links) from the GCDIS directory 
level. Developments necessary to make these systems more 
interoperable will be carried out as resources permit.

<h2><a name=Guide>Guide</a></h2>

<strong>Description</strong><p>

The guide function of the GCDIS access system provides detailed 
information about all agency global change data sets, to allow users 
to assess suitability of data sets for their research or application or to 
aid users in the use of the data set. This information includes 
bibliographic references to publications relevant to the data set and, 
in some cases, the abstracts or actual publications.<p>

The guide function of the GCDIS access system will make possible 
coherent searches across agencies by providing functional 
consistency through including a standard set of topics (as they apply 
to each data set) and consistent terminology (e.g., data set 
references). There will be agency interfaces to agency-based guide 
systems that may include other agency guide information, or access 
or point to other agency guide systems or information.<p>

Guides accomplish several functions within the GCDIS access system. 
Guides augment the general information in the directories with 
specific information about the data, such as detailed descriptions of 
the instruments and platforms used to acquire the data. This 
information permits the user to determine the availability and 
appropriateness of the data. Any information critical to the use and 
understanding of the data is collected in the guide. Explanations of 
projects under which the data were gathered also should be included. 
Short-term instrument outages, specifics about the recording 
instruments, and other factors that determine the suitability of the 
data are included.<p>

The guide also fulfills the need to document carefully information 
about how the data set was derived. Detailed instrument logs, 
including instrument location, response, calibration and external 
factors affecting the instrument, may be included. Information 
regarding the platform, such as description of satellites, stations, and 
observatories, also may be documented. Discussion of algorithms 
used to process the data must be detailed. Any information essential 
to the complete understanding of the data must be documented in 
the guide. This type of information is used to validate the data, and 
thereby the quality of research results. Without this information the 
data are useless.<p>

In the case of data sets consisting of multiple granules (see the 
inventory functionality - <a href=ch5gcdip.html#Inventory>page 
66</a>), the guide will include a generic description of a granule for 
that data set (i.e., the content and documentation included with each 
granule). The guide will describe any subset creation or other options 
available to a user for the given data set.<p>

<strong>Needed Interoperability</strong><p>

Functional consistency for the GCDIS access system guide requires a 
degree of consistency in the guide information across all data sets. 
This is limited to a standard set of topics, which will be addressed for 
each data set where they apply, and to standard terminology for 
terms such as data set names and parameter names.<p>

The guide function will be interoperable with directory and 
inventory functions: that is, to allow a user to access guide 
information corresponding to a given directory entry, or to allow a 
user to access guide information concerning a data set that contains 
granules meeting the user's inventory search criteria.<p>

Four levels of agency contribution to the GCDIS access system guide 
function are defined as follows:<p>
<table border>
<tr><td>Level 1.</td><td>Agencies provide access to their online guide 
information for guide searches originating from other agencies' 
online guide systems, and support online access to other agencies' 
guide systems for their own guide users. This requires network 
connectivity for guide sites and <a 
href=ch5gcdip.html#level1>network performance level 1</a> for user 
access and internal GCDIS access system communications supporting 
the guide function.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Level 2.</td><td>Agencies make available online GCDIS access 
system standard guide information. This requires network 
connectivity for guide sites and <a 
href=ch5gcdip.html#level3>network performance level 3.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Level 3.</td><td>Agencies make available in hard-copy form 
standard guide information about the GCDIS access system (i.e., 
addressing GCDIS access system guide topics as they apply, and using 
GCDIS access system standard terminology).</td></tr>
<tr><td>Level 4.</td><td>Agencies make available in hard-copy form 
(e.g., user guides or handbooks) existing detailed documentation of 
global change data sets.</td></tr>
</table><p>

<strong>Agency Applicability</strong><p>

The guide function applies to all agencies that hold global change 
data sets, unless for a given data set the directory level description 
constitutes a full description meeting the intent of the GCDIS access 
system guide functionality.<p>

<strong>Agency Implementation Overview</strong><p>

Each agency will independently implement its GCDIS access system 
guide functionality according to its own approaches and methods, 
including establishing network connectivity at guide sites where 
needed. This implementation overview will indicate when the 
various levels of GCDIS access system guide functionality will be 
available at a user or interagency interface for each agency element 
separately implementing that functionality.

<h2><a name=Inventory>Inventory</a></h2>

<strong>Description</strong><p>

The GCDIS access system inventory function provides the user with 
the ability to identify particular combinations of parts of data sets 
(or whole data sets if the data set is most useful as a whole), ranging 
from one to all agencies, that meet user-provided search criteria (e.g., 
common space-time reference, or selected descriptors - information 
internal to the content of a data set that either distinguishes between 
parts of a data set or otherwise is important to the use of a data 
set).<p>

Where a directory entry provides a summary description of an entire 
data set, and a data set guide provides detailed descriptive 
information about an entire data set, a data set inventory provides 
detailed information about individual parts of a data set in those 
cases where single or multiple parts of a data set are of greatest use 
to users rather than the entire data set. The individual parts of a 
data set are called granules. The decision about what constitutes a 
granule for a given data set is based upon patterns of use of the data 
set. The goal is to provide a user with the most meaningful way to 
identify and ascertain the availability of specific data to work with. A 
granule is a logical subset of a data set (or a whole data set if the 
data set is most often used as a whole) that may correspond to a 
physical subset of a data set. The information describing each 
granule (the descriptors) would distinguish one granule from another 
in ways important to the use of the data, such as space-time 
reference, presence or absence of a given condition or feature, or the 
value of a parameter.<p>

As examples, an inventory of in situ data might contain information 
about an individual ship track's sequence of measurements or time 
sequence of observations taken at a particular site; an inventory of 
AVHRR satellite data would contain information about individual 
data acquisitions or passes; and an aircraft data set inventory would 
contain information about individual scenes or frames within a flight 
line.<p>

<strong>Needed Interoperability</strong><p>

Inventory information held by individual agencies must employ a 
consistent approach to space and time references to allow cross-
inventory searches, given user space-time criteria. In all cases where 
an internal attribute of a given data set granule is to be available to 
GCDIS users as a cross-inventory search parameter, it must be 
consistently named and defined in all applicable cases, using content 
standards enforced as the metadata are entered. The inventory 
function should be interoperable with the directory and guide 
functions; that is, it should allow a user to refer to summary 
(directory) or detailed (guide) information about a data set or data 
set's granules from which were identified by an inventory query as 
meeting the user's inventory search criteria.<p>

Four levels of agency contribution to GCDIS access system inventory 
functionality are defined as follows:<p>

<table border>
<tr><td>Level 1.</td><td>Agencies provide access to their online 
inventory information for inventory searches originating from other 
agencies' online inventory systems, and support online access to 
other agencies' inventory systems for their own inventory users. This 
requires network connectivity for guide sites and <a 
href=ch5gcdip.html#level1>network performance level 1</a> for user 
access and internal GCDIS access system communications supporting 
the guide function.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Level 2.</td><td>Agencies make available online, searchable 
inventory information using GCDIS access system standard space-
time references as applicable and, optionally, GCDIS access system 
standard descriptors as applicable. This requires network 
connectivity for guide sites and <a 
href=ch5gcdip.html#level3>network performance level 
3</a>.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Level 3.</td><td>Agencies make available in hard-copy form 
or via a manual service inventory information for priority global 
change data sets, using GCDIS access system standard space-time 
references where applicable and, optionally, standard GCDIS access 
system descriptors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Level 4.</td><td>Agencies make available in hard-copy form 
or via a manual service (e.g., user service personnel) existing 
inventories of priority global change data sets, using existing space-
time references and/or internal descriptors.</td></tr>
</table><p>

<strong>Agency Applicability</strong><p>

The GCDIS access system inventory function applies to all agencies 
that make global change data and information available to users.<p>

<strong>Agency Implementation Overview</strong><p>

Each agency will independently implement its GCDIS access system 
inventory functionality according to its own approaches and 
methods. The overviews in <a href=appBgcdip.html>Appendix B</a> 
summarize agency plans.
To establish a framework for individual agency efforts, a cooperative 
study will be conducted to develop an initial description of the 
inventory interoperability functional model and system architecture 
(including functional interface definitions) that will be used by GCDIS 
access system. This is critical since the scope and complexity of 
implementation issues and tasks will be greatly influenced by the 
chosen architecture. The study will address an inventory content 
guideline that describes the GCDIS access system standard approach 
to space-time reference and definition of GCDIS access system 
standard descriptors (possibly including an initial set, but developing 
a process for defining them in the future). This study will define 
GCDIS access system user inventory search capabilities. The initial 
search capabilities will evolve as users and agencies gain experience). 
This study will be completed in September 1994. An assessment of 
other interagency access systems will be included to maximize 
connectivity and to benefit from the lessons learned by others.

<h2><a name=Browse>Browse</a></h2>

<strong>Description</strong><p>

The browse function will allow GCDIS access system users to screen 
data for usefulness by examining samples of data or summary or 
reduced resolution versions of large data sets or large data set 
granules. Examples might include a sample surface meteorological 
observation, a sample publication of climatological information, a 
sample ship track of oceanographic observations, or a reduced 
resolution AVHRR scene (e.g., to check for cloud cover). Browse 
products can be available online or offline (e.g., printed hard copy or 
on CD-ROMs). Browse products may be precomputed and available 
for static browse, access, or may be computed on demand to a users 
specification dynamic browse.<p>

<strong>Needed Interoperability</strong><p>

The browse function will be data set dependent, but approaches to 
browsing should be consistent within data types to allow users to 
compare different data sets. Graphical and image browse products 
should be designed to facilitate their combined use. Agencies should 
coordinate in planning browse products for like data held across 
agencies so that a GCDIS access system user may be able to make 
meaningful comparisons when browsing similar data available from 
multiple agencies or agency elements.<p>

The browse function should be accessible from the GCDIS inventory 
function to allow users to browse granules that otherwise meet users' 
inventory search criteria or the directory or guide functions (if a data 
set is most often used as a whole and not described as containing 
multiple granules).<p>

Four levels of contribution of agency implementation of the browse 
function are defined as follows:<p>
<table border>
<tr><td>Level 1.</td><td>Online, on-demand generation of browse 
products accessible from GCDIS catalog functions. This requires 
<a href=ch5gcdip.html#level2>network performance level 
2</a>.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Level 2.</td><td> Online static browse products accessible from 
GCDIS catalog functions. This requires <a 
href=ch5gcdip.html#level2>network performance level 
2</a>.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Level 3. </td><td>Offline digital browse products (e.g., on CD-
ROMs).</td></tr>
<tr><td>Level 4. </td><td>Offline hard-copy browse products.</td></tr>
</table><p>

<strong>Agency Applicability</strong><p>

The browse function applies to all agencies providing global change 
data sets of substantial size.<p>

<strong>Agency Implementation Overview</strong><p>

Agencies will implement browse functionality individually, but will 
coordinate to ensure that browse products for similar data sets are 
similar and support intercomparison between data sets.

<h2><a name=Order>Order Placement</a></h2>

<strong>Description</strong><p>

The order placement function of the GCDIS access system allows a 
user, having selected specific global change data or information of 
interest through use of the GCDIS directory, guide, or inventory 
functionality, or by being able to specify completely the desired 
items without the need for use of those services or as a result of 
previous use of one or more of those services, to place an order for 
those data and information. The single order may be for a variety of 
items available from a variety of GCDIS agencies or agency elements. 
The order must be accessible either independently or from any of 
the GCDIS access system catalog system functions (directory, guide, 
or inventory).<p>

Processing and filling an order by the agency or agencies involved 
will be accomplished agency by agency according to each agency's 
own procedures and policies. Orders spanning agencies will be filled 
in parallel by the agencies as if they were independent single orders 
rather than parts of an overall order for data and information that 
spans agencies. Standard GCDIS approaches regarding such things as 
data formats and distribution media are discussed on <a 
href=ch5gcdip.html#Distribution>page 72</a>.<p>

<strong>Needed Interoperability</strong><p>

Agencies must provide an interface function for GCDIS access system 
user order placement at each agency participating in the GCDIS 
access system. This function must accept user orders, and be able to 
forward appropriate portions of the order to other agencies for 
processing.<p>

Three levels of agency contribution to GCDIS access system order 
placement functionality are defined as follows:<p>
<table border>
<tr><td>Level 1.</td><td>The agency provides an online order 
placement function that is fully integrated with the catalog system 
(directory, guide, or inventory) functionality of the GCDIS access 
system. This requires network connectivity for guide sites and 
<a href=ch5gcdip.html#level3>network performance level 3</a> for 
user access and internal GCDIS access system communications 
supporting the guide function.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Level 2.</td><td>In addition to a manual interface, the agency 
provides an online order placement function allowing users to order 
data from the participating GCDIS access system agency 
elements.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Level 3.</td><td>The agency provides a manual interface 
through user support staff at agency elements offering global change 
data and information and agreed manual procedures for forwarding 
orders to other elements of the agency and other agencies elements 
as needed.</td></tr>
</table><p>

<strong>Agency Applicability</strong><p>

This applies to all agencies from which users may order global 
change data and information.<p>

<strong>Agency Implementation Overview</strong><p>

A cooperative study will be done by December 1995 to develop 
interagency procedures for supporting this function, including 
determination of the information required from the user to 
accompany specification of the items ordered.

<h2><a name=Archive>Archive Function</a></h2>

<strong>Description</strong><p>

U.S. global change data policy states that preservation of all data 
needed for long-term global change research is required. For 
example, each regional or global observation of the Earth system 
represents a unique observation of the system, one that will never 
be repeated exactly; assessment of changes and the mechanisms 
responsible for them must rely on time series of such unique 
snapshots. The archives for global change data must be available for 
a long time, regardless of the changing interests of the researcher, 
group, or agency that collected and analyzed the observations. Each 
GCDIS access system agency has the responsibility to manage, store, 
and maintain data sets under its purview. A GCDIS access system 
agency may designate another GCDIS agency to archive some data 
and information.<p>

<em>Data set stewardship</em> is the safe storage and preservation 
of data sets that are clearly part of the normal operations of each 
archive site. Each participating GCDIS access system agency will 
follow government media, storage, and handling standards as 
prescribed by the National Archive and Records Administration 
(NARA), the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), 
and, where appropriate, WDC-A requirements. GCDIS access system 
archives will be staffed by professionals who understand the data 
and their sources and processing. Ideally, GCDIS access system 
archives also will be associated with an agency or university group 
that undertakes research using the data, verifying quality 
assessment and documentation of the data. GCDIS access system 
centers with scientists on the staff or associated with scientist groups 
are better able to seek out actively and acquire data needed for 
global change research, but might not be supplied to the archive as a 
matter of course.<p>

Examples of archive storage and maintenance practices that GCDIS 
access system archive sites should employ include provision of a 
clean environment; use of tested and certified media designated for 
long-term storage; provisions for media backup and off-site storage; 
adequate security and internal controls to safeguard equipment, 
software, and media; fire and water protection; and a routine, 
scheduled media maintenance program, including detection of media 
deterioration and migration of the data to newer, more stable media 
when proven reliable.<p>

As part of the archive function, guidelines will be developed for 
preparing data sets and associated documentation and metadata for 
long-term permanent retention at GCDIS access system archive sites.
Data-purging policies are the responsibility of the archiving agency. 
Nonetheless, the GCDIS access system will develop interagency 
coordination procedures to prevent the loss of important data sets. 
This will include notification of the IWGDMGC contacts concerning 
plans to purge a data set at least 1 year in advance of any action to 
do so, to allow other GCDIS access system agencies to state 
requirements for the data set or agree to assume responsibility for 
archiving the data set. NARA procedures will apply if no agreement 
can be reached on disposition of a data set identified for purging.<p>

<strong>Needed Interoperability</strong><p>

All participating GCDIS access system data centers responsible for 
long-term archiving of global change data sets should adhere to 
accepted standards for their safe storage and preservation. All 
centers should follow a common set of cross-agency procedures and 
guidelines for interagency notification before purging data sets that 
may be of potential value to global change research.<p>

Four levels of agency contribution to GCDIS access system archive 
functionality are defined as follows:<p>

<table border>
<tr><td>Level 1. </td><td>As in level 2, with off-site copies (or 
equivalent).</td></tr>
<tr><td>Level 2. </td><td>As in levels 3 and 4 with on-site backup 
copies (or equivalent).</td></tr>
<tr><td>Level 3. </td><td>Full compliance with NARA-NIST guidelines 
for data storage and preservation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Level 4. </td><td>Storage of data under controlled 
conditions.</td></tr>
</table><p>

<strong>Agency Applicability</strong><p>

GCDIS access system agencies holding global change data sets are 
responsible for archiving. Some agencies, however, may arrange to 
have their data sets archived and distributed by other GCDIS access 
system agencies, either when the data sets are generated or after the 
data sets have been generated and the originating agency's 
operational mission (or research program) for those data sets has 
been completed.<p>

<strong>Agency Implementation Overview</strong><p>

An ad hoc archive coordination team will be formed as a near-term 
interagency implementation activity. The team will develop 
guidelines by December 1994 for preservation of global change data.

<h2><a name="Distribution">Distribution Functions</a></h2>

<strong>Description</strong><p>

The GCDIS distribution function encompasses delivery of data to 
users on a variety of standard media, including (for moderately sized 
products) electronic delivery. Standard distribution media for digital 
data may include 6,250-bpi magnetic tapes, 3480 cartridges, 8-mm 
and 4-mm cartridges, floppy disks, CD-ROMs, and so forth. Digital 
data may be distributed electronically via a network, either by 
allowing online access to the data or by allowing users to request 
that data be temporarily staged for later access. Nondigital products 
include publications, charts, and photographic images.<p>

<strong>Needed Interoperability</strong><p>

Agencies will agree on a set of standard distribution media for digital 
data, allowing users a choice, and also allowing users to request data 
on common media from the GCDIS agencies.<p>

Agencies will agree on a set of standard formats for digital data 
(whether for offline delivery or online access), including standard 
distribution formats (for similar data sets), when possible, in addition 
to native formats that agencies might employ. Standard formats 
should be chosen on the basis of acceptance and usefulness to users 
and availability of support, such as software tools for supporting the 
formats.<p>

Agencies will agree on distributing documentation (including 
metadata) with the data. The documentation may be either 
embedded in data products or distributed as separate hard-copy or 
electronically accessible text.<p>

Three levels of agency contribution to the GCDIS access system 
distribution function are defined as follows:<p>

<table border>
<tr><td>Level 1.</td><td>Agencies offer delivery of data (online or 
offline) in access system standard formats chosen by the 
user.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Level 2.</td><td>Agencies offer electronic delivery of data. 
This requires <a href=ch5gcdip.html#level3>network performance 
level 3</a>.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Level 3.</td><td>Agencies offer GCDIS access system standard 
media as a user option.</td></tr>
</table><p>

<strong>Agency Applicability</strong><p>

This applies to all GCDIS agencies (or their designees) that provide 
digital and nondigital data and information products to users.<p>

<strong>Agency Implementation Overview</strong><p>

An ad hoc standard distribution format and media team will be 
formed as a near-term interagency implementation activity. The 
team will develop guidelines for standard distribution formats and 
media by December 1994.

<h2><a name=Billing>Billing and Related Administrative 
Functions</a></h2>

GCDIS access system billing and administrative functions will be 
addressed in the future when the agencies agree on the underlying 
policies.

<h2><a name=Information>Information Functions and 
Services</a></h2>

<strong>Description</strong><p>

Just as the management of data is handled by major data centers or 
other organizations in participating agencies, the management of 
information is handled through centralized scientific and technical 
programs in a number of GCDIS access system agencies. These 
programs enable a comprehensive collection of literature produced 
by the agencies and their contractors and allow aggressive 
acquisition of documented results of international research and 
development efforts. The results are compiled into bibliographic data 
bases for searching and retrieval by the global change community. In 
terms of U.S. federally funded documentation, the central STI 
programs maintain systems to provide full archiving and full text 
retrieval of this material for current and future research. The GCDIS 
will build upon these existing STI services in Federal agencies.<p>

The interfaces required to provide users with access to bibliographic 
and text information will be ubiquitous, easy to use, well publicized, 
and interoperable with the full GCDIS access system. Single-channel 
access should enable the user to step from data to information or to 
make decisions about the extent and depth of information desired. 
Libraries and information centers are experienced in providing 
access to a broad range of information through catalogs; networks; 
national and regional systems; and links among public, academic, 
Federal, nonprofit, and corporate institutions. Decisions concerning 
levels of access, user fees, summary or full-text information, and 
links to national and international data bases and networks will be 
embedded in the overall implementation of the GCDIS access system. 
These functions will be made as consistent as possible between the 
data and information providers and communities.<p>

<strong>Needed Interoperability</strong><p>

Information interoperability is needed in terms of systems 
development, standards in data base definition, and format of data 
base content.<p>

A new information architecture, whereby a user of global change 
data and information can sit at a workstation and navigate freely 
between data files and documentation, is being considered by these 
STI programs. This work involves systems development, including 
gateways, navigational tools (e.g., directories), standards 
development for both information content and for systems, and 
postprocessing technology for further analysis of the results from the 
data and information.<p>

Specialized library and information center functions that require 
interoperability or commonality in the GCDIS include the 
following:<p>
<ul>
<li><em>GCMD and library directories and catalogs</em>.  This process 
will identify components that can interface between the GCMD and 
comparable directories with library catalogs, data bases, and 
directories. Front-end software will be developed to assist the end 
user's search in identifying what resources are available in data 
centers, libraries, and information centers. A front-end menu will be 
established to enable the user to step among disciplines, data and 
information products, and free and fee-based systems.<p>

<li><em>External components</em>.  External components will connect 
through the Internet or similar networks for access by individual 
users not necessarily connected to institutions. For example, the 
general public, students, or staff of small businesses may need 
answers to crosscutting global change questions. These individuals 
should not be encumbered by highly technical, scientific findings if 
all they require is an overview or better understanding of a global 
change issue.<p>

<li><em>Interactive messaging</em>.  Interactive messaging protocols, 
practices, and procedures that enable users to relay their 
unanswered questions or requirements for a different level of 
assistance will be used. It may be the unserved users who will 
enable the GCDIS access system to evolve into the most effective 
system. An easy-to-use messaging system will provide libraries and 
information distribution centers with orders, requests for additional 
(perhaps human) intervention, and up-to-date feedback on the types 
of materials required. The schoolteacher who needs 50 copies of a 
publication for a class must be routed to a document delivery service 
that will distribute these materials. Neither a data center nor a 
library may be the appropriate source.<p>

<li><em>Information clearinghouse</em>.  An information 
clearinghouse will be established to respond to the increasing and 
changing information needs of the nonresearcher. Links with the 
clearinghouse will be automatic for users, whether individual, 
agency, or institutional. Since thousands of telephone, written, faxed, 
and other requests are received annually by libraries, inside and 
outside government, the front-end system should include menu 
options for large numbers of publications desired by a user. When 
appropriate, these requests may be handled directly by an agency 
library or information center or the requests may be directed 
through the GCDIS access system to another member of the network, 
such as the clearinghouse. The requester will automatically be 
notified of the rerouting of the request by the system to avoid 
confusion and duplication.</ul><p>

<strong>Agency Implementation Overview</strong><p>

The following initial steps will be taken through the Library 
Subgroup:<p>
<ul>
<li>Begin systematic efforts to inform librarians and information 
specialists about the existence, purpose, and activities of the USGCRP, 
the IWGDMGC, and the Global Change Data and Information 
Management Program.<p>

<li>Identify and describe significant library and data collections in 
the global change area, beginning with the GCDIS agencies, then other 
Federal collections, then non-Federal (e.g., international, university, 
nongovernment organizations). Make this information widely 
available through the GCDIS directory function.<p>

<li>Begin systematic efforts to identify and evaluate information 
products designed to aid users of global change information. 
Recommend the development of such products. Facilitate exchange of 
existing products between libraries and information centers.<p>

<li>Complete a strategy for mapping bibliographic information 
among the DIF, Committee on Scientific and Technical Information, 
and machine-readable cataloging formats, and make this information 
widely available to libraries.</ul>

<h2><a name=State>State and Local Government Access</a></h2>

State, regional, and local governments may require access to detailed 
global change information to support decisions at regional scales and 
to augment their own data collection efforts, especially when 
intergovernmental coordination is needed. For example, global 
change information may be used to manage fisheries or to control 
chlorofluorocarbon emissions.<p>

State, regional, and local governments will be able to access the 
GCDIS through the Internet and its successors. GCRP agencies will 
assist them in obtaining the necessary information to facilitate 
networking access and in obtaining the necessary software to use the 
GCDIS. Currently, States are able to use some Federal systems 
through special data-sharing arrangements. These arrangements will 
be extended to include the full array of GCDIS functionality. Outreach 
will be necessary through organizations, such as the National 
Governors Association, to assure that the States and local 
governments understand the range of services available and the 
extent and distribution of potentially useful data.<p>

State, regional, and local governments make extensive use of spatial 
data in their geographic information systems. It is expected that 
much of the data requested from the GCDIS access system will be 
spatial data at the highest resolution available. These requests could 
include the finest resolution available from predictive model runs, as 
well as remote sensing and in situ monitoring data. Links between 
the GCDIS and States' geographic data systems are expected.
Historical data may be required to develop status and trends 
assessments for varying environmental applications. The GCDIS 
access system will make it easier to obtain this information.

<h2><a name=International>International Access</a></h2>

In this section a discussion of international access will be followed by 
a discussion of several international efforts important to global 
change research in which GCDIS agencies are involved. Additional 
descriptions of international data and information systems are 
provided in <a href=ch7gcdip.html>Chapter 7</a>.<p>

<strong>Description</strong><p>

The agencies acting collectively under the GCDIS access system 
umbrella will provide international users with access to the same 
data and information quality and similar delivery services to those 
available to U.S. users. The agencies will act individually and 
collectively to secure for U.S. researchers access to internationally 
available global change data and information services.<p>

Access to global change research data and information anywhere in 
the world can be ensured more easily by an international extension 
of the GCDIS access system approach, with the GCDIS access system 
becoming the U.S. node of an international, distributed, global change 
data and information network system.<p>

<strong>Needed Interoperability</strong><p>

GCDIS agencies will cooperate in establishing bilateral or multilateral 
links (including offline and online interoperability of services) with 
international global-change-related agency, multiagency, and 
multinational groups and systems. These will include the ICSU-
sponsored WDC system (individual elements of GCDIS agencies are or 
may become ICSU WDCs), the ICSU International Geosphere-
Biosphere Program Data and Information System (IGBP-DIS, in which 
some GCDIS agencies now participate), the Human Dimensions of 
Global Environmental Change Programme (HDP) being conducted 
under the auspices of the International Social Science Council (ISSC), 
and the International Earth Observing System (IEOS) effort being 
coordinated by the Earth Observation-International Coordination 
Working Group (EO-ICWG) and the CEOS (in which some GCDIS 
agencies are now participating). In general, if one or more GCDIS 
agencies establish links with or interfaces to such efforts or if agency 
elements become participating nodes in such efforts, then, through 
the GCDIS access system mechanisms, all GCDIS agencies should gain 
access and participate. As a result, all users of GCDIS access system 
services provided by the agencies should benefit from these 
efforts.<p>

<strong>Agency Applicability</strong><p>

All agencies that participate in any way with international efforts, 
such as those mentioned previously, and that produce or hold 
unclassified or unrestricted global change data and information will 
ensure that those data and information are accessible through the 
GCDIS access system to scientists and researchers not only in the 
United States but also in other countries.<p>

<strong>Agency Implementation Overview</strong><p>

Each agency will implement its international access functionality 
according to its own mission and methods. Some agencies with 
existing international disciplinary or technical relationships have 
already established extensive links for exchanging global change data 
and information across the U.S. national boundaries.<p>

<h1>7. International Links and Coordination</h1>
<img src=gifs/bluegrad.gif>

Initially, GCDIS links and access to international data holders, 
providers, and users will be accomplished through existing agency 
participation in the ICSU WDC system. A number of U.S. data centers 
associated with implementation of the GCDIS currently have 
responsibility under the WDC system for a broad range of important 
climate and global change data. All GCDIS archive sites will pursue 
WDC status through the ICSU or be linked with existing WDCs. The 
links for exchanging and transferring global change data and 
information among WDCs vary from magnetic tapes and cartridges 
and CD-ROMs to data communications networks.<p>

GCDIS international links among WDCs will be completed or 
supplemented by other media or networks to transfer Earth 
observation data and information from satellite and in situ sources 
for other operational or noncommercial uses that benefit the public. 
Those existing and emerging international systems, services, and 
their coordinating mechanisms are described in subsequent sections. 
Expanding links to other international organizations and programs 
concerned with global change data management will be useful in 
several ways to implementation of the GCDIS.<p>

First, links to data centers and archives outside the United States will 
be necessary to access data relevant to the USGCRP and to make U.S. 
data and information available to collaborating researchers and 
governments abroad. To be useful, these must be permanent 
archives, so that the data will be readily accessible to users well into 
the future. This is particularly true for global change data, inasmuch 
as assessment of change and the mechanisms responsible for it must 
rely on long time series that are irreproducible. Archives for global 
change data must therefore be maintained on a long-term basis, 
irrespective of the changing interests of the scientist, group, or even 
agency that collected and analyzed the observations. Several existing 
internationally sponsored data management and archive systems, to 
be described briefly later, have the long-term commitment needed to 
serve as global change archives.<p>

Second, many of these international institutions are associated with 
an agency or university group that undertakes research using such 
data and are therefore more than just data libraries. The personnel 
associated with such centers perform the highly useful function of 
using the data themselves, and therefore perform quality assessment 
and ensure good documentation of the data. Such centers are in good 
position to seek out actively and acquire data that are needed for 
global change research, but that may not be supplied to the archive 
as a matter of course.<p>

Third, timely international agreement regarding standards, protocols, 
and formats for new types of global change data and information will 
facilitate access and exchange of global and regional data sets and 
research information. Several existing international technical forums 
for developing such agreement are described later in this chapter.<p>

Fourth, agreement on the part of international partners - particularly 
governments - will be necessary to overcome policy-related 
impediments to full and open exchange of data and information. 
Intergovernmental organizations provide a useful forum for 
discussion and agreement among governments on data management 
and exchange principles, policies, and practice.<p>

Major impediments to the full and open exchange and distribution of 
international data for global change research include<p>

<ul><li>Lack of a comprehensive worldwide inventory of major 
existing data bases;<p>
<li>Major uncertainties about the quality and accuracy of existing 
data sets;<p>
<li>Lack of consistent international policies and protocols for data 
exchange, particularly with regard to charging;<p>
<li>Unnecessary or inappropriate (overclassification) restrictions 
on data access on the part of some governments; and<p>
<li>Lack of long-term (10 to 20 years) commitment from any 
national or international organization to develop policies and support 
programs to facilitate data archiving and exchange in some new 
areas of global change research.</ul><p>

It should be noted that the international community is beginning to 
recognize the need for consistent policies for international data 
exchange. Several international organizations, including the 
Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC), the IGBP, and 
the CEOS, have formally adopted policy statements consistent with 
the principle of full and open exchange of scientific data and 
information. Although not binding on member countries, they 
constitute a first step toward establishing an international norm. The 
United States has adopted a similar policy - the <em>U.S. Data Policy 
Statements for Global Change Research</em> (see <a 
href=tab1gcdip.html>Table 1</a>).

<h2><a name=Existing>Existing International Data and Information 
Systems and Services</a></h2>

Some of the existing systems that may serve as GCDIS archives or 
that may in other ways be part of the data and information 
dissemination system needed for global change research will be 
described.

<h3>The ICSU World Data Center System</h3>

The ICSU WDCs were originally organized for the International 
Geophysical Year (1957-58) and, upon recommendation of the ICSU, 
have continued since as a network linking data providers to data 
users around the world. This system is operated by volunteering 
national organizations on agreed principles and policies contained in 
the ICSU's Guide to the World Data Center System. All the WDCs are 
staffed, funded, and maintained exclusively by the countries in 
which they are located. The four main activities of the WDCs involve 
acquisition, exchange, dissemination, and archiving of solar-
geophysical and related environmental data and information. As 
already noted, the WDC system will provide the initial GCDIS 
mechanism for international access.<p>

The WDC system now consists of 44 archive and data centers in 
several countries: The United States, Russia, China, Czechoslovakia, 
the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, Denmark, Japan, and India. 
WDC-A is hosted by the United States, and is sponsored by NASA, 
NOAA, the USGS, and the U.S. Naval Observatory. Oversight is 
provided by the NAS CGED, which maintains at the NAS the WDC-A 
Coordination Office. The individual U.S. centers are organized and 
funded by the parent agencies, but the NAS CGED is the 
information/organizational channel that connects the WDC-A system 
to ICSU's supervisory/advisory group, the Panel on World Data 
Centers.<p>

In the United States, USGCRP agencies now operate 12 WDC-As for 
glaciology (snow and ice), marine geology and geophysics, 
meteorology, oceanography, rockets and satellites, rotation of the 
Earth, seismology, solar-terrestrial physics, solid Earth geophysics, 
paleoclimatology, land cover, and atmospheric trace gases. All of 
these WDC-As are collocated with national disciplinary data centers 
throughout the United States. The WDC-As will provide a 
fundamental GCDIS mechanism for international access and data 
exchange among corresponding WDCs in other parts of the world.<p>

One of the weaknesses of the ICSU WDC system is that there are no 
specific recommendations for archiving and exchange of satellite-
based data that are essential for global change studies. Whereas 
some of the conventional data centers (e.g., oceanography, 
meteorology, snow and ice, the new center for remotely sensed land 
data) do receive and archive data products derived from satellite 
observations, the present configuration may not meet all needs of the 
GCDIS. However, the present system (WDC-A) maintains links with 
satellite data systems inasmuch as three of the WDC-A centers are in 
agencies or groups that also house NASA EOS DAACs, namely the 
USGS EDC in Sioux Falls, the DOE's CDIAC in Oak Ridge, and the 
University of Colorado's National Snow and Ice Data Center in 
Boulder. To further expand the connection between WDC-A and 
satellite data systems, further discussions are underway with NASA 
regarding four additional DAAC-related data centers at the Goddard, 
Langley, and Marshall Space Flight Centers, and the Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory.

<h3>The World Meteorological Organization Data System</h3>

Under the aegis of the WMO, several countries operate data centers 
closely related to the WCRP and IGBP-Global Change: The World 
Ozone Center at Toronto; the Global River Runoff Data Center at 
Koblenz, Germany; the WDC for GHG, Tokyo; and the Global 
Precipitation Center, Germany. A less active center that is being 
revived for WCRP and global change studies, and integrated again 
into the WMO system, is the International Radiation Center in St. 
Petersburg, Russia.

<h3>The Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission</h3>

The Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission's (IOC) 
International Oceanographic Data and Information Exchange system 
(IODE) consists of about 45 National Oceanographic Data Centers as 
well as seven specialized data centers for specific ocean observing 
systems and techniques. The three ICSU WDC's for oceanography, 
located in the United States, Russia, and China, form the apex of this 
pyramidal system, serving as the final archive and distribution 
centers for oceanographic data products once they have been 
processed and quality assessed through the other parts of the IODE 
system. The successful merging of the IOC and ICSU data center 
systems for oceanography may serve as a useful model for 
establishing relationships between the GCDIS and the ISCU WDC 
system.

<h3>The Federation of Astronomical and Geophysical Services</h3>

This ICSU system, sponsored by the International Union of Geodesy 
and Geophysics and the International Union of Radio Science, is also 
an outgrowth of the International Geophysical Year. The Federation 
of Astronomical and Geophysical Services centers that relate directly 
to the GCDIS are the Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level in the 
United Kingdom, the World Glacier Monitoring Service in Switzerland, 
and the Sunspot Index Data Center in Belgium.

<h3>Other Data Services</h3>

There may be other independent geophysical data services, but most 
of them relate to solid-Earth, upper-atmosphere, or space disciplines 
that have indirect relation to global change studies.

<h2><a name=International>International Mechanisms for Planning, 
Coordinating, and Implementing</a></h2>

<h3>The International Geosphere-Biosphere Program and the IGBP-
DIS</h3>

The IGBP, established by the ICSU, is designed to achieve an 
understanding of Earth and its environment, to improve our ability 
to detect global change and plan intelligent responses. Previous ICSU 
programs (concerning the lithosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere, 
atmosphere, biosphere, magnetosphere, and ionosphere, for example) 
have successfully studied components of the Earth system. The intent 
of the IGBP is to work toward realizing a synthesis on a global scale 
of how these individual components interact to produce the 
dynamics of the whole Earth system, with the goal of predicting the 
future state of the planet into the next century.<p>

In addition to the ICSU WDC's, which either act as archive and 
distribution centers, or which produce special data products for 
research, there is another ICSU data activity important to the 
evolution of the GCDIS. Detailed planning for IGBP data management 
has started under the Working Group on Data and Information 
Systems for the IGBP (IGBP-DIS). Based in Paris and supported by 
NASA and the French Ministry of Sciences, its overall goal is to 
improve the supply and management of data and information that 
will allow the IGBP to satisfy its agenda.<p>

The IGBP-DIS has been most successful as the focal point for IGBP 
Core Projects, to identify data needs, to build specifications for 
missing or presently inadequate data sets, to conduct IGBP data 
workshops, and to serve as an information link between such 
services as the GCMD and the user community. Four initial projects 
involving data or metadata have been identified in advance of the 
specification of data needs by Core Projects:<p>

<ul><li>Land-Cover Change Pilot Project,<p>
<li>Vegetation Imagery Diskette Pilot Project,<p>
<li>Overall systems analysis of important data sets for global 
change studies, and<p>
<li>Directory of national or disciplinary directories of data sets 
useful for global change studies.</ul><p>

These pilot projects have proved to be very useful. For example, as 
an adjunct to the Land-Cover Change Pilot Project, the IGBP-DIS was 
instrumental in defining the needs and specifications for the AVHRR 
1-km global pilot data set now being implemented by the USGS, 
NASA, and NOAA. A CD-ROM containing results from the 1st year will 
be issued during 1993. The IGBP-DIS also is sponsoring an 
investigation of the possibility of obtaining useful land surface 
temperature data from satellite observations, and was the initial 
sponsor of the IGBP African Diskette Pilot Projects, the successful 
implementation of which resulted in the NOAA-EPA Global Ecosystem 
Database (on CD-ROMs) and the African Diskette Educational Project. 
Additionally, a new global soils data base has been started.<p>

USGCRP agencies operating WDC-As have begun to participate in the 
IGBP-DIS diskette pilot projects. Those agencies' GCDIS plans need to 
be modified to include producing and disseminating space-based and 
in situ regional and global data sets on diskettes or other media to 
facilitate international access to global change research data and 
information.

<h3>The Human Dimensions of Global Environmental Change 
Programme</h3>

The HDP, established in 1990 under the auspices of the ISSC (the 
social-science counterpart to the ICSU) is initiating an international 
program of research to address the human dimensions of global 
environmental change. The HDP is defining its program, analyzing 
data and information system requirements, and initiating focused 
projects.<p>

Seven broad topical areas of research have been identified: social 
dimensions of resource use; perception and assessment of global 
environmental conditions and change; effects of local, national, and 
international social, economic, and political structures and 
institutions; land use; energy production and consumption; industrial 
growth; and environmental security and sustainable development. 
Focused projects include Land Use/Land Cover Change (together with 
IGBP), and the Global Omnibus Environmental Survey. Working 
groups are being formed to address focused projects in other areas of 
research.<p>

The HDP Data and Information System (HDP-DIS) will be developed 
through collaboration with extant social science archives and 
information sources by forming a data- and information-sharing 
network that will ultimately interoperate with natural science data 
and information system initiatives such as the IGBP-DIS. The 
functions of HDP-DIS include<p>

<ul><li>Developing science data and information resource 
requirements for HDP focused programs and determining their 
availability and sources;<p>
<li>Providing services in support of HDP science initiatives, to 
include data resource discovery, documentation (cataloging) and 
archiving; and maintaining information services such as guides and 
bulletin boards; <p>
<li>Identifying computer-processing and data-resource services in 
support of HDP science computing, analysis, and data integration 
needs such as geographical information systems, decision support 
and modeling capabilities; and <p>
<li>Accessing extant networks and developing interoperability 
among extant and future information archives and centers that will 
support HDP science intitiatives.</ul><p>

HDP-DIS is now undertaking an assessment of requirements and 
implementing elements of an emerging concept of operations. An 
HDP-DIS Data Users Group and two advisory panels are being formed. 
These are a Data Resources Panel, chartered to determine the 
requirements of the HDP focused programs, and a Data Sharing Panel 
that will develop working relationships among active archives and 
sources for relevant and required socioeconomic data.<p>

The development of an Internet-based HDP information service is 
being explored. A catalog interoperability test will explore the 
applicability of the CEOS metadata model and the IDN concept in the 
HDP domain. This metadata-sharing experiment will use 
socioeconomic data archives and sources worldwide in one of the 
first attempts to link data resources using network-based resource 
discovery tools. Coordination with the CEOS-IDN is planned to ensure 
future interoperability. Coordination with the System for Analysis 
and Training is essential to ensure technology access for developing 
countries. HDP-DIS activities have been integrated since inception 
with NASA's EOSDIS through the EOSDIS Socioeconomic Data and 
Applications Center, managed by CIESIN, which is providing initial 
HDP data services and coordinating system development.

<h3>The Committee on Earth Observations Satellites</h3>

The CEOS was created in 1984 as a result of the Economic Summit of 
Industrialized Nations to serve as a focal point for informal 
international coordination of space-related Earth observation 
activities. Its areas of concern are mission planning, data access, 
networking, data product standards, compatibility and 
interoperability of data products, services (including catalog, data 
access, etc.) and applications, as well as instrument calibration and 
validation of satellite data with ground truth data. The CEOS is a 
voluntary mechanism operating by consensus.<p>

The members of the CEOS are NASA and NOAA for the United States, 
the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) for Canada, the Chinese Academy 
of Space Technology and the National Remote Sensing Centre for 
China, the Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales for France, the Indian 
Space Research Organisation for India, the Instituto Nacional de 
Pesquisas Espaciais for Brazil, the Science and Technology Agency 
(STA) for Japan, the British National Space Centre for the United 
Kingdom, the Agenzia Spaziale Italiana for Italy, the Deutsche 
Agentur fr Raumfahrt-Angelegenheiten for Germany, the 
Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization for 
Australia, the Russian Space Agency and the Russian Federal Service 
for Hydrometeorologyand Environment Monitoring for Russia, the 
European Space Agency (ESA) and the European Organisation for the 
Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) for Europe, the 
Swedish National Space Board for Sweden, and the National Space 
Agency of Ukraine. In addition, CEOS observers include the 
Norwegian Space Centre for Norway, the Canadian Centre for Remote 
Sensing for Canada, , the Science Policy Office for Belgium, the Crown 
Research Institute for New Zealand, and the Directorate General 23 
for the European Community.<p>

NOAA and NASA have worked for the past several years to broaden 
the perspective of CEOS beyond its original narrow focus of land-
oriented applications of remotely sensed data to encompass the 
broader range of global change research and environmental 
monitoring. The CEOS Plenary group has accepted this view of CEOS, 
and has accepted as CEOS affiliates the Food and Agriculture 
Organization (FAO), the ICSU, the IGBP, the IOC, the WCRP, the WMO, 
the UNEP, the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS), and the Global 
Ocean Observing System (GOOS).<p>

The CEOS comprises a high-level plenary group with a policy focus 
and two supporting working groups. The Sensor Calibration and 
Performance Validation Working Group is now focusing on sensor 
intercalibration required for global change research. The Working 
Group on Data (CEOS-WGD) is concerned with coordination of data 
management. The CEOS-WGD is active in the development of the CEOS 
IDN as a first step toward international data and information system 
interoperability, networking, development and adoption of standards 
for international data exchange formats, development of a lexicon 
and data dictionary, and assembly of a global 1-km AVHRR data 
set.<p>

The WGD has developed a coordinating relationship with Panel 2 of 
the Consultative Committee on Space Data Systems, which is 
concerned with developing (through a formal process) internationally 
agreed recommendations for standards in areas relating to data and 
information exchange.<p>

The CEOS-WGD has created subgroups working at an implementation-
coordination level in several areas. These are a Formats Subgroup, 
working on data exchange formats; a Catalog Subgroup, working on 
the CEOS-IDN and catalog interoperability in general; a Network 
Subgroup, working on ground networking between CEOS agencies 
internationally; and a subgroup on Auxiliary Data Sets.

<h3>The Earth Observation-International Coordination Working Group 
and the International Earth Observing System</h3>

The objectives of the EO-ICWG are to promote the IEOS as an 
integrated Earth observing system to advance understanding of the 
Earth system, to promote effective use of Earth observation 
spacecraft (e.g., by coordinating payload planning), and to promote 
continuity of operational services provided currently by NOAA's 
polar-orbiting satellites and development of future operational 
services.<p>

The EO-ICWG was formed in 1986 by NASA, NOAA, and the ESA to 
coordinate polar platform programs and payload planning. Current 
participants are: NASA and NOAA for the United States; the ESA and 
the EUMETSAT for Europe; the STA, the Ministry of International 
Trade and Industry (MITI), the Japanese Environment Agency (JEA), 
the Japanese Meteorological Agency, and the National Space 
Development Agency (NASDA) for Japan; and the CSA for Canada. 
These agencies are known collectively as the International Partners. 
The current role of the EO-ICWG is to coordinate and implement the 
IEOS, which is seen as the coordinated aggregate of the participating 
agencies' end-to-end Earth observing systems (i.e., space and 
consensus).<p>

The EO-ICWG has to date identified the following missions and their 
supporting ground systems as elements of the IEOS: for the United 
States, NASA's EOS missions and NOAA's operational Polar-Orbiting 
Operational Environmental Satellite series; for Japan, NASDA's 
Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and Advanced Earth 
Observing System (ADEOS) missions; and for Europe, the ESA Polar-
Orbit Earth Observation Mission (POEM) missions. In many cases 
other agencies will provide instruments, including the MITI for EOS, 
the CSA for EOS, the MITI and NASA for ADEOS, NASA for TRMM, and 
NOAA and EUMETSAT for POEM.<p>

The EO-ICWG has recognized that implementation of the IEOS would 
require coordinated efforts in data management. Rather than form a 
new data management group, the EO-ICWG requested that the CEOS, 
which had already created an effective forum for informal 
international coordination, assume responsibility for addressing IEOS 
data management issues.

<h3>Proposed Global Climate Observing System and Global Ocean 
Observing System</h3>

The GCOS and the GOOS are two newly planned and interrelated 
global-scale observing systems with significant data management 
components. When even partially implemented, it will be essential 
for the GCDIS to establish links to its elements. This should not be 
difficult, since U.S. agencies - particularly NOAA - are playing key 
roles 
in the planning and implementation process. Internationally, the EOS 
is expected to provide a core component of the mature GCOS and 
GOOS systems. Related data management responsibilities have not 
been specified, but no doubt the WDC system will play a key role, at 
least in the interim.<p>

Planning for the GCOS is led by the WMO, with joint sponsorship by 
the UNEP, the IOC, and the ICSU. The GCOS will collect, manage, and 
distribute data and information relevant to prediction of climate 
variability and global climate change, including in situ and remotely 
sensed data. Four components are planned: oceans, atmosphere, 
terrestrial, and cryosphere. The WDC system is studying how various 
relevant centers can undertake data management roles for data 
resulting from the GCOS and the GOOS, bearing in mind that the data 
flow is primarily designed for operational (near-real-time) use, and 
special arrangements may have to be made for parallel or delayed 
processing for research-grade data products.<p>

Planning for the GOOS is led by the IOC, with joint sponsorship by the 
WMO, the UNEP, and the ICSU. The GOOS will consist of five modules - 
climate change, health of the ocean, living marine resources, oceanic 
conditions (for operations), and coastal zone management. The 
climate change module of the GOOS will, in large part, serve as the 
ocean component of the GCOS. Initially, the GOOS will be based on 
existing programs, including, for example, World Weather Watch, 
Voluntary Observing Ships, the Integrated Ocean Services Station 
System, and the IODE. Strong links are planned with such research 
programs as WOCE, the Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere 
Experiment (TOGA), and the Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS), 
and the GOOS will no doubt be modified by their results.<p>

Both the GCOS and the GOOS were strongly endorsed by delegations 
to the U.N. Conference on Environment and Development, held in 
June 1992 in Rio de Janeiro, and thus have broad support among 
both industrialized and developing nations. Access to relevant data 
and information on climate variability and global change is 
considered essential for developing countries to wisely manage their 
coastal areas, water resources, agriculture and fisheries, and land use 
for sustainable development.

<h3>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</h3>

The IPCC was established to advise the International Negotiating 
Committee for the Framework Convention on Climate Change, and is 
sponsored by the WMO and the UNEP. The IPCC conducts a scientific 
assessment of climate change every few years, focusing on 
immediate issues and consequences, and prepares in-depth summary 
information for policymakers, so that realistic response strategies can 
be created to manage climate change issues. Thus, the panel is both a 
user and a synthesizer or producer of information.<p>

Many of the requirements specified by the IPCC are being addressed 
by continuing international programs. Relevant international projects 
are coordinated by the WCRP, sponsored by the WMO, the IOC, and 
the ICSU, and by the IGBP, which is also sponsored by ICSU. The 
program on the Human Dimensions of Global Environmental Change, 
recently established by the ISSC, is expected to fulfill some of the 
IPCC requirements for social science data and information.<p>

<h1>A. Data Capture</h1>
<img src=gifs/bluegrad.gif>

<h2><a name=Sources>Data and Information Sources</a></h2>

To achieve its objectives, the USGCRP requires a wide variety of data 
and information from many disciplines for long periods of time. The 
data and information exist in both digital and nondigital forms and 
include raw data from observation systems and surveys; value-
added data from data assembly activities; derived data and 
information from models and other investigations; long-term as well 
as short-term data and information sets; historical, current, and 
future data and information; insitu and remote observations; 
information from other studies; and references to data and 
information that are produced outside the USGCRP, such as major 
international and national programs.<p>

Extensive collections of such data and information critical for global 
change research are now supported in the Federal agencies and 
many other sources such as libraries, State and local governments, 
university and other research efforts, and the international 
community. Within the USGCRP, the <em>focused</em> program 
includes data and information from those programs identified by the 
agencies as having the needs of the USGCRP as their primary 
objective. A wealth of other data and information, gathered for 
purposes other than global change research, also is critical for the 
USGCRP, including those identified in the USGCRP 
<em>contributing</em> programs. Some of these data and information 
may not reside in organized data and information systems, and are 
not easily accessible or well documented. <a 
href=tabA1gcdip.html>Table A1</a> shows agency sources for data 
and information critical for the USGCRP arranged by its central 
priorities. F indicates programs that have the USGCRP as their 
primary objective, and X indicates those that do not.

<h2><a name=Special>The Special Issue</a></h2>

The USGCRP recognized at its inception that a substantial part of the 
data and information needed for global change research would not be 
created by the focused programs created specifically for USGCRP 
purposes. The Federal Government supports thousands of individual 
research projects in Earth, environmental, and human sciences that 
are not part of the USGCRP focused programs. These projects have 
produced such national treasures as the archives held in the NDCs, 
the daily data collection and analyses provided by the National 
Weather Service, university-based holdings of tree ring samples and 
ice cores, forest inventories from the USDA Forest Service, 
cartographic data and stream flow records from the USGS, biological 
and ecological observations of the DOI, synoptic meteorological and 
bathythermograph data from the DOD), fossil fuel statistics from the 
DOE, demographic data from the Bureau of the Census, and soil maps 
from the USDA Soil Conservation Service. <a 
href=tabA2gcdip.html>Table A2</a> provides examples of data sets 
that are needed to help answer specific global change research 
questions.<p>

From the perspective of such other programs and projects, global 
change research constitutes a secondary use whose needs are 
generally not funded. Only some of the crucial programs and projects 
have already been identified as USGCRP <em>contributing</em> 
programs; their budgets in FY 1993 were about $1.4 billion - about 
equal in size to the total for the focused USGCRP.<p>

From <a href=tabA2gcdip.html>Table A2</a> it can be seen that not 
only are the sources of such data and information from many 
agencies, but also that they cover all the central priorities of the 
USGCRP. Such data and information are critical not only in their own 
right for global change research, modeling, and assessments, but also 
to the focused data and information program to fill gaps in coverage, 
tie together diverse data sets, and improve the quality and 
usefulness of the data and information by providing ground truth at 
selected points for calibration. The latter is particularly important for 
the remotely sensed data required by the USGCRP. Also not apparent 
is that some of these critically important data and information are 
unavailable to the USGCRP because they are intermingled with 
material subject to security, proprietary, or regulatory constraints.<p>

This special issue identifies the need for agencies participating in the 
USGCRP to assemble, document, archive, and disseminate the data 
and information critical to the USGCRP produced by programs that do 
not have global change research as a primary objective. The goal is to 
provide GCDIS access in useful form to data from such programs and 
projects through existing and planned data systems and centers or 
by creating new data centers for them. Within the framework 
established, agencies will propose individual or interagency activities 
to meet specific USGCRP requirements. These requirements then will 
be coordinated from an interagency perspective through the CENR. 
By using this coordinated approach, the program will reap the 
benefits of using data and information from outside the USGCRP and 
allow for deeper insights that arise from cross-disciplinary 
analysis.<p>

Although the existing USGCRP priorities and milestones help focus 
the data capture activities, many thousands of related data and 
information products of potential relevance still exist, with many 
needing an investment of resources to become well documented and 
accessible. As a result, it is essential to establish more specific 
priorities for data capture activities. This will be done in cooperation 
with the other elements of the USGCRP, the user community, and 
advisory groups such as the NAS.<p>

Agency planning for the special issue recognizes that global change 
data management efforts should be well coordinated with other 
established interagency data management activities, such as the 
FGDC, the Office of the Federal Coordinator for Meteorology, and other 
appropriate coordinating organizations and committees.

<h2><a name=Data>Data Capture Activities</a></h2>

To make relevant data and information resulting from data capture 
activities available to the USGCRP, a number of different activities 
are required. These are grouped here into the four activity areas 
described in The <em>U.S. Global Change Data and Information 
Management Program Plan</em>:  that is, <em>assembling, 
documenting, archiving</em>, and <em>disseminating</em>.  Specific 
activities that overlap activity areas are included in the area that is 
expected to require the most resources.<p>

<strong>Assembling</strong><p>

	1.  <em>Inventory of data</em>.  Agencies need to set specific 
objectives and conduct an inventory of previously generated data 
and information that focuses on those research areas most relevant 
to the highest priority science objectives and research milestones of 
the USGCRP. Library holdings will be included in the inventory. (It is 
estimated that more than half the publications in Federal scientific 
and technical libraries and information centers relate to global 
change.) Attention will be given to obtaining input from the NRC and 
other representatives of the user community in order to guide 
development of the inventory.<p>

	2.  <em>Inclusion in the GCDIS</em>.  Data and information 
included in the GCDIS will be based on the USGCRP priorities and the 
advice of the user community. Where agencies cannot provide direct 
access to their holdings, funds will be required for data transfer to 
data centers participating in the GCDIS. In some cases, extracts will 
be created, eliminating material that is sensitive due to security, 
proprietary, regulatory, or other considerations. In other cases, key 
data sets will be put into digital form in order to be generally 
useful.<p>

	3.  <em>Integrate preexisting programs</em>.  Many of the 
focused USGCRP programs were started before the widespread 
appreciation of the need to plan for interagency data and information 
management in the programs. For example, resources are needed to 
integrate with the GCDIS the data and information management 
components of programs such as the TOGA, the WOCE, and the 
GEWEX. <p>

	4.  <em>Data rescue</em>.  Many data and information products 
of vital importance for global change research need immediate 
rescue and long-term maintenance to avoid deterioration and loss.<p>

<strong>Documenting</strong><p>

	5.  <em>Priorities</em>.  It will be almost impossible to 
document adequately all data and information potentially useful for 
global change research so that they can be properly used decades 
after their creation. With participation of the NRC and the user 
community, priorities will be established for the data and 
information requiring such documentation - taking advantage of 
available expertise before such opportunities disappear forever. <p>

	6.  <em>Current data center holdings</em>.  The adequate 
documentation of holdings already in data centers is a major 
undertaking. The most critical holdings need sufficient 
documentation so that they not only will be accessible, but can also 
be used with confidence decades from now. This level of 
documentation is typically much more stringent than now exists and 
requires significant effort to remedy. <p>

	7.  <em>Data from other sources</em>.  Global change studies 
often require correlating data from disparate sources, such as 
remotely sensed data combined with in situ measurements. Even 
within a single set of data there are often discontinuities attributable 
to instrumentation changes or other events. It is essential that 
complete information describing these data is available to 
researchers in order that the data can be applied appropriately.<p>

	8.  <em>Training</em>.  Training of agency research staffs, 
information specialists, and managers will be required to institute 
the policies and procedures for managing data and information to 
support global change research, developing the skills needed for 
effectively using the wide range of GCDIS capabilities, and improving 
communication of technical specialists with the public. Attention will 
be given to creating global change research network information, 
information products, and electronic data base information 
appropriate to educators at the K-12 levels.<p>

<strong>Archiving</strong><p>

	9.  <em>Long-term storage facilities</em>.  Agencies 
participating in the GCDIS have agreed to manage all data and 
information in a manner that complies with archiving standards. 
Agency data centers will need significant additional resources to 
handle not only the large numbers of additional data and information 
products that need to be archived, but also - for such programs as 
the 
Next Generation Weather Radar (NEXRAD) - very large data 
volumes.<p>

	10.  <em>Small data centers</em>.  Libraries and small data and 
information centers will collect more and more data sets and 
information created through individual research efforts. These data 
and information will sometimes be available at Federal libraries, but 
more often they will be found at academic institutions. Such local 
reference and research systems need to be compatible with the 
GCDIS, and many need be upgraded in order to store, retrieve, and 
send large amounts of data and information to users.<p>

	11.  <em>Interagency coordination</em>.  The GCDIS will have a 
wide range of interagency coordination requirements, including 
inventory search and order, pricing, order tracking and billing, user 
services, submission guidelines, system interfaces, retention and 
purging, media, formats, and performance assessments. As the 
amount and scope of the data and information in the GCDIS increases, 
support for such interagency and external coordination will 
increase.<p>

	12.  <em>Researcher feedback</em>.  Agencies will actively 
involve users and others in the affected research communities in 
their global change data and information management activities. This 
will include periodic formal reviews by expert panels such as the 
NAS CGED, as well as surveys of user satisfaction and the soliciting of 
suggestions for improvement of the GCDIS.<p>

<strong>Disseminating</strong><p>

	13.  <em>User services</em>.  Data and information centers and 
libraries will need resources to provide the data and information to 
users and to respond to user questions both on the proper use of 
specific data and on the holdings of other data centers. This need will 
increase with the number of products in the GCDIS and with the 
number of its users. Among the Federal and academic libraries, as 
well as the Federal Depository Libraries, access to the Internet and 
CD-ROM equipment is essential.<p>

	14.  <em>Consolidated services</em>.  In some cases, data 
center services for data capture data and information exist but are so 
fragmented and incompatible with the GCDIS that they are almost 
unusable. For example, there are 18 separate Long-Term Ecological 
Research Centers that can only be accessed individually. The GCDIS 
will not only tie all the participating data centers together, but also 
create dissemination mechanisms to allow researchers to deal with 
groups of centers as a single entity.<p>

	15.  <em>International</em>.  Access to data and information 
holdings outside the United States that are critical to the USGCRP will 
require significant resources. For instance, data and information sets 
from international sources may need to be obtained by connecting 
them to the GCDIS through international mechanisms such as the 
UNEP Global Resources Information Database (GRID). Additionally, 
selected technical information received from international sources 
needs translation into English.<p>

	16.  <em>Standards</em>.  Compliance with national and 
international standards in use by libraries and data centers is crucial 
even though it may be costly. Access to major library collections, 
information centers, and bibliographic information systems is 
dependent upon implementation of standards developed for 
bibliographic control, communications, product formats, and product 
delivery.

<h2><a name=Fiscal>Fiscal Requirements</a></h2>

Although the annual USGCRP program plans have recognized a 
dependence on data and information from programs not focused on 
global change, resource requirements have not previously been 
identified to assemble, document, archive, and disseminate these 
crucial data and information. Since these data and information reside 
with groups whose primary mission is not global change research, in 
many cases an additional specific allocation of resources is needed 
for these data and information to be made available to support global 
change research.<p>

From the perspective of the agencies, the funding required by the 
special issue on data capture is over and above that which the 
agencies had previously planned as their part of the USGCRP. The 
individual IWGDMGC agencies, however, have been encouraged to 
submit budget requests to meet this critical need. Agency special 
issue plans will be a part of each agency's GCDIS implementation 
plan.<p>

<strong>Summary</strong><p>

NOAA is the primary agency within the DOC for GCDIS participation 
as both supplier and user of climate and global change data and 
information products. Other DOC agencies will participate in the 
GCDIS as their roles are better defined and as the system evolves. For 
example, the U.S. Bureau of the Census, through its Center for 
International Research, has initiated global change, data-related, 
collaborative activities with the CIESIN. The Census Bureau is also 
attempting to increase public awareness of and use of its own data 
through the development of its own Internet site and other online 
electronic collaboration with appropriate parties.<p>

NOAA's three NDCs, and the NOAA Satellite Active Archive, the NOAA 
Directory Services, the NOAA Library, and the NOAA NIC are agency 
components that will participate in GCDIS operations. As the GCDIS 
evolves, NOAA, through its NOAA-wide Data System Modernization, 
will add additional capabilities and improved interoperability for the 
GCDIS user community. NOAA's Data System Modernization is now in 
the planning stage; system implementation is expected to start in 
1995 and continue through at least 2004.<p>

<strong>NOAA GCDIS Capabilities Available April 1, 1994</strong><p>

Serving as the Nation's steward for the long-term climate data 
record, NOAA will provide GCDIS support through its NDCs - the 
National Climatic Data Center, the National Geophysical Data Center, 
the National Oceanographic Data Center - and their associated Solar, 
Geophysical, and Environmental WDCs. Each center provides a 
customer service facility and online access to metadata and data sets. 
Online access to operational satellite data is provided by the NOAA 
Satellite Active Archive. User access to NOAA-wide data and 
information is also available through the NOAA Directory Services 
and the NIC. The NOAA Environmental Services Data Directory 
provides users with online access to descriptions of more than 2,500 
NOAA data sets. The NOAA NIC provides Internet access for users 
seeking information about NOAA and its data and information 
holdings. The NOAA Library provides GCDIS users with online catalog 
access to 1.5 million volumes, including 10,000 volumes of historic 
worldwide meteorological and global change climatological data.<p>

<strong>NOAA GCDIS Components Available by April 1, 
1994</strong><p>

<em>National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) data content</em>.  The 
NCDC receives data from national operational observing systems 
managed by the National Environmental Satellite, Data, and 
Information Service (NESDIS), NOAA, the military services, the 
Federal Aviation Administration, and the U.S. Coast Guard. Foreign 
meteorological and climate data are received from international 
sources through the Global Telecommunications System of the WMO's 
World Weather Watch Program and through exchange of foreign data 
through the WDC system. Designated as the WDC-A for Meteorology, 
the NCDC also collects and manages the data bases of international 
experiments such as the WCRP sponsored by the WMO and the ICSU. 
In addition to the observational data, the NCDC maintains an archive 
of modeled meteorological data and products produced by NOAA 
centers and laboratories and by international experiments.<p>

Major in situ data sets archived at the NCDC include U.S. hourly 
surface weather observations (temperature, pressure, precipitation, 
weather, wind, etc.), global 3- and 6-hourly surface weather 
observations (land and marine surface ships), U.S. and global 
upper-air observations (temperature, wind, humidity, and height for 
various pressure levels), daily and monthly data (maximum, 
minimum, and mean temperature and precipitation) for 
approximately 7,000 U.S. locations, NOAA atmospheric trace gas data, 
weather radar photographs and other digital data from the new 
WSR88D national radar system (NEXRAD), and published daily and 
monthly data for foreign locations. Most of the data since 1949 are in 
digital form and (from before 1949) on hard-copy media.<p>

Satellite data are archived by the NCDC and its Satellite Data Services 
Division (SDSD). The archive consists of full-resolution and derived 
products from NOAA operational polar and geostationary satellites 
dating back to 1978. Non-NOAA satellite data are also archived, such 
as DMSP special sensor microwave data. A full-resolution 
Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) data 
archive is managed through a contract with the University of 
Wisconsin. Both the SDSD and the University of Wisconsin have 
customer service groups. <p>

NOAA is improving access to satellite data through the Satellite 
Active Archive (SAA). Internet access, browse, search and order, and 
Internet data set file transfer capabilities are available for selected 
AVHRR data sets. The SAA is also interoperable with NASA's 
Version 0 EOSDIS. Internet access is also available for NOAA-
generated Pathfinder Data Sets. The University of Wisconsin also has 
GOES browse images and selected NOAA-NASA Pathfinder Data Sets 
online, accessible through a Gopher server.<p>

The NCDC is preparing Baseline Data Sets to support research and 
monitoring of long-term climate trends. Some of these data sets are 
the Global Baseline Data Base of Atmospheric Trace Constituents, the 
Global Historical Climate Network (GHCN), the Comprehensive 
Aerological Research Data Set (CARDS), and the Comprehensive Ocean 
Atmosphere Data Set (COADS). Data are being prepared in a common 
format and processed using standard quality control processes.<p>

A Global Climate Perspectives System (GCPS) is being developed and 
implemented at a limited number of research locations. The GCPS will 
house several global climate data sets and provide a data base 
management system, analysis software and graphical software 
packages, and data export capabilities. Researchers will be able to 
access the system through the Internet; have access to data sets; and 
be able to perform analyses, display analyses and long-term trends, 
compare data parameters, and export and download data across the 
Internet. The capabilities of this system will allow researchers to put 
current climate trends into perspective relative to the entire climate 
history.<p>

The NCDC will also operate a rudimentary NOAA Environmental 
Watch (NEW) project. The NEW is aimed at integrating a variety of 
environmental data sets to produce primarily high-level, policy-
oriented information products on a variety of media, including CD-
ROMs, diskettes, hard copies, and electronic access.<p>

<em>NCDC access</em>.  Data are available by telephone, mail, 
automated facsimile, World Wide Web, WAIS, and online through the 
NCDC Online Access and Service Information System and the GCPS. 
Data sets available online are limited to most recent 2 years of data 
for U.S hourly surface observations, upper-air observations, NEXRAD 
data inventories, NOAA Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory 
modeled data sets, NOAA Global Climate Model data sets (100-year 
output), subsets of the NOAA Atmospheric Trace Gases data set, and 
daily data from 7,000 U.S. locations. Online access capabilities include 
limited browse capabilities, online ordering, and online and offline 
data delivery. Baseline Data Sets, the COADS Release 1a, the CARDS 
subset (kernel data set) and the GHCN Version 1 are available on 
magnetic media. A Research Customer Service Group provides 
customer services for research users requiring additional assistance 
in acquiring data or information about NCDC data sets.<p>

<em>National Geophysical Data Center content</em>.  The NGDC, in 
conjunction with its collocated WDCs (Paleoclimatology, Solid Earth 
Geophysics, Solar-terrestrial Physics, Marine Geology and Geophysics, 
and Glaciology-Snow and Ice), distributes a wide variety of global 
change data using many types of media and systems. NGDC's 
Paleoclimate Program distributes pollen count data, tree ring 
measurements, ice core accumulations, and fossil plankton counts, as 
well as historical records. The NGDC archives and disseminates data 
from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (including visible, 
infrared, and special sensor data) for global change investigations. 
The NGDC also distributes a suite of global environmental data bases 
including the Global Ecosystems series of CD-ROMs. These global data 
sets include land use, wetlands, vegetation, climate, global relief, 
soils, and outputs from various global environmental models. The 
NGDC, through the National Snow and Ice Data Center at the 
University of Colorado, provides global change data relating to the 
cryosphere. It disseminates such data as snow cover, sea ice, glacier 
mass balance, and information describing polar climatology. Other 
relevant global change disciplines at the NGDC are solar variability 
and the sea floor environment. Specific examples of data sets 
available from NGDC are lake and marine sediment, ice core, and tree 
ring data; topographic and bathymetric measurements, data 
illustrating natural hazards such as earthquakes, tsunamis and 
volcanoes; and historical sunspot activity data.<p>

<em>NGDC access</em>. All NGDC data and derived products are 
distributed online, on various media such as .5-in. and 8-mm 
magnetic tapes, floppy diskettes, CD-ROMs, or in hard-copy forms 
such as microfilm, paper, or 35-mm slides. Access to NGDC data is by 
mail, telephones, electronic mail, fax, personal contact, and through 
online activities. NGDC's online services include descriptions of NGDC 
data and services, phone lists, selected data sets, and sample images 
of data products. NGDC's online access system, using current 
technology, such as the Internet, Gopher, World Wide Web, and 
others, list many of NGDC's current data holdings, both as directory 
and guide information. A number of NGDC data bases are also 
available through the Internet, and these include all of NOAA's 
paleoclimate data as well as selected solar variability, global 
ecosystems, and marine environment data. <p>

<em>National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC) content</em>.  The 
NODC receives observations, publications, and other data and 
information products from nearly every country involved in 
oceanographic research. Through a system of bilateral data exchange 
agreements, and under the auspices of the WDC system, 
observational data and data products are routinely shared with more 
than 30 countries. Under separate agreements, the NODC also 
manages data for several multidisciplinary experiments operated 
under the WCRP.<p>

Data received, processed, and archived include in situ observations, 
remote sensing data products, and research reports and publications. 
Data received cover the breadth of ocean science, ranging from 
bathythermograph and Nansen casts to subtle ocean chemistries and 
plankton counts; and span the global ocean from the late 1800s to 
the present. The NODC archives are the largest single collection of 
global oceanographic data covering the longest time span. Satellite 
and other remote-sensing data types (such as acoustic Doppler 
current profiles) have been added to NODC archives during the past 
few years and, with adequate funding support, should be available to 
the GCDIS.<p>

With the support of the NOAA Climate and Global Change program, 
the NODC is preparing new ocean climatologies on a geographical and 
temporal scale never before available. The major physical 
oceanography data bases have been merged, quality-controlled, and 
statistically treated to produce a global ocean climatology for 
one-degree squares. In addition to the climatologies, a set of long 
time series observations for specific areas in the ocean and the 
largest and most frequently used data bases are being published on 
CD-ROMs, and are available online in limited quantities through the 
Internet and through dial-in access.<p>

<em>NODC access</em>.  Access to the entire holdings of the NODC are 
available by telephone, mail, Internet order, and fax. Funding 
permitting, online access is restricted to physical oceanography data 
bases including bathythermographs, hydrocasts, current meter, time 
series hydrocasts, Conductivity Temperature Depth/Salinity 
Temperature Depth, and one or more major experimental data bases 
(e.g., WOCE, JGOFS). In addition, a comprehensive catalog of holdings 
and the NOAA-USGS-EPA Taxonomic Code will be available.<p>

<em>NOAA Directory Services</em>.  NOAA Directory Services include 
four data bases. The NOAA Environmental Services Data Directory 
(NOAADIR) has more than 2,500 descriptions of NOAA information 
and data sets in Directory Interchange Format (DIF). The data sets 
described contain information about the atmosphere, oceans, climate, 
hydrology, geology, geophysics, and solar terrestrial physics. There 
are also data sets concerning astronomy, biology, diseases, and health 
issues. Most of the data sets regarding biology come from the NOAA 
National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) and the Foreign 
Meteorological Collection in the NOAA Library. The library collection 
contains records of weather observations and geologic phenomena, as 
well as records that enhance the human dimensions data available 
for global change studies. Some of these records cover demography, 
diseases, health issues, morbidity, mortality, and epidemics. So far, 
more than 800 data records in the library have been documented in 
the DIF format, with about 2,000 remaining to be done.<p>

Other data bases that are available in the NOAA Directory Services 
are the NOAA National Environmental Data Referral Service (NEDRES), 
the NOAA Product Information Catalog (PIC), and documents for the 
NOAA National Environmental Watch.<p>

The NOAA Environmental Services Data Directory will be available 
through two versions of the Master Directory (MD) software (as 
supplied by NASA), as well as through the WAIS. The NEDRES, the 
PIC, and the NOAA National Environmental Watch will be available 
through the WAIS. Users can access any of these data bases through 
dial-in services, including local phone service and a 1-800 service, or 
through the Internet. Access to the MD software and the WAIS will 
also be provided through a Gopher server.<p>

<strong>NOAA GCDIS Components Added by April 1, 
1995.</strong><p>

All NOAA components participating in the GCDIS will add incremental 
enhancements to data content and access functions for the GCDIS 
user community. A major area of enhancement will be improving 
online access to NOAA data. Summaries of some of these 
enhancements follow.<p>

The NCDC will add data to expand the period of record for online data 
sets, geographical coverage will be expanded, and high-interest data 
sets will be added. Browse and visualization capabilities will be 
enhanced. Information products will be available on the Internet 
through the NEW project. NGDC's Defense Meteorological Satellite 
Program (DMSP) digital imagery data will be available online for 
browse, visualization, access, and online and offline ordering. NGDC's 
paleoclimatology data base will have its regional spatial and 
temporal resolution increased while greatly improving online 
accessibility. The NODC will add chemical oceanography, biologic data 
containing primary productivity, and chlorophyll data sets. New 
releases and versions of the Baseline Data Sets will be added for 
online access at the NCDC. The NOAA SAA will expand the number 
and time period of operational and Pathfinder Data Sets available for 
online access. More than 6,000 DIFs will be added to the NOAADIR. 
Many of these DIFs will come from the Foreign Meteorological 
Collections at the NOAA Library, the NCDC, and the NMFS. The DIFs 
from the NOAA library will include many human dimensions 
parameters, whereas the NMFS's includes many biological 
parameters.<p>

<strong>NOAA GCDIS Components Added by April 1, 
1996.</strong><p>

Baseline Data Sets, the COADS Release 2, the CARDS Version 1, and 
the GHCN Version 2 will be available at the NCDC. The GCPS will be 
implemented and accessible to an expanded number of research 
groups. The NEW project will have its information content about 
environmental issues expanded to include major scientific 
assessment information, such as IPCC Climate Change and 
WMO/UNEP Ozone Assessments. Major enhancements will be made to 
high-priority global change data sets at the NGDC, such as 
paleoclimatology, DMSP, solar variability, global snow cover, and 
global ecosystems. The NODC will add acoustic Doppler current 
profiler data. The NOAA Directory Services will add another 3,000 
DIFs, and will be linked to the EOSDIS, with interoperability through 
the EOSDIS and the NOAA Satellite Active Archive.<p>

<strong>DOD GCDIS Capabilities Available April 1, 1994</strong><p>

The DOD routinely collects environmental data globally in support of 
DOD operations. The DOD also conducts mission-related research into 
environmental processes and conditions that affect defense 
operations, tactics, and systems. The DOD does not have a mission 
requirement to archive data for civil uses. DOD data products are 
made available to the appropriate U.S. national archives for 
subsequent use by the GCDIS.<p>

<strong>DOD GCDIS Components Available by April 1, 
1994</strong><p>

<em>GCDIS content: holdings available and identification of major 
data sets</em>. The Commander, Naval Meteorology and 
Oceanography Command, supports activities that provide 
meteorological, oceanographic, and mapping, charting, and geodetic 
products for DOD and U.S. Navy operations. Complete synoptic and 
aviation meteorological observations, bathythermograph and STD 
casts, bathymetry, and limited biological observations are routinely 
recorded. Routine synoptic meteorological measurements and 
bathythermograph data, plus a full set of air-ocean analysis and 
forecast products, are produced by the Fleet Numerical Meteorology 
and Oceanography Center. Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) 
Sensor Data Records, Temperature Data Records, and Environmental 
Data Records on an orbital basis for the DMSP are generated by this 
center.<p>

The National Ice Center, a cooperative effort among the Navy, NOAA, 
and the Coast Guard, provides routine ice products to military and 
civil users and provides global ice observations, analyses, predictions, 
and advisory information to military and civilian weather forecast 
offices with sea/lake ice responsibilities. Data parameters include ice 
edge, concentration, age, and temperature, as well as features such as 
ridges, leads, and polynyas.<p>

Operating Location-A (OL-A), United States Air Force Environmental 
Technical Applications Center, collocated with the NCDC, archives 
observational and analysis data for military purposes. Observational 
data sets archived at OL-A include Foreign Synoptic Data, 
Airways/METAR (Airport Weather) data, Foreign PIBAL (Pilot 
Balloon) data, and Worldwide Radiosonde and Rawinsonde data. 
Analysis data sets available at OL-A include Real Time Nephanalysis 
(RTNEPH) and 3DNEPH (precursor to the RTNEPH), the Air Force 
Global Weather Central (AFGWC) High Resolution Analysis System 
(HIRAS) data, and AFGWC surface temperature data sets. The HIRAS 
includes worldwide analysis of pressure, wind, temperature, 
moisture, and other analysis variables at mandatory pressure levels. 
The USAF DMSP satellites continually collect visual and infrared 
environmental data. The USAF and NASA initiated the effort to 
capture digital DMSP data at AFGWC on magnetic tape for archiving 
at the NGDC. Implementation will be in March 1994.<p>

The USAF also sponsors the Cloud Information Reference Library and 
Archive (CIRLA), a reference archive containing information on cloud 
and cloud-related environmental data. CIRLA was designed in 
response to the needs of DOD systems development and operational 
communities, but CIRLA is also responding to increasing emphasis on 
requirements to transfer environmental data from the DOD to the 
civilian scientific and engineering communities.<p>

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers maintains the Cold Regions 
Research Engineering Laboratory, which conducts research on snow, 
ice, and frozen ground and the effects on construction, transportation, 
and military operations. Additional data collected by the Department 
of the Army include meteorological observations collected by Army 
Meteorological Teams and observations made by the Army Corps of 
Engineers in support of various civil works projects. Complete 
synoptic-form meteorological observations, together with soil 
temperature, solar radiation, and optical transmissivity, are recorded. 
Temperature, salinity, water quality, precipitation, river stage, wave 
height, wave period, wave direction, and beach erosion rates are also 
routinely collected by the Army Corps of Engineers in support of 
specific continuing projects.<p>

The Defense Mapping Agency (DMA) is the DOD manager for 
mapping, charting, and geodesy (MC&G) data around the world, and 
adopts or establishes MC&G standards promoting interoperability 
within the DOD and with allies. In response to DOD requirements, the 
DMA compiles, produces, reproduces, and distributes maps, charts, 
and digital MC&G data. These types of data aid in determining 
watershed and shoreline changes, sea level rise, variations in coastal 
currents, rates of urbanization, and changes in the extent of 
vegetated areas. Release of DMA data depends on security 
classification, level of resolution, and any third-party restrictions 
that may be in effect.<p>

The Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC) is the central 
repository within the DOD for scientific and technical information 
generated in support of DOD research and development efforts. The 
DTIC primarily serves the DOD, other Federal government agencies, 
and their contractors. The DTIC forwards to the National Technical 
Information Service (NTIS) all DOD technical information provided to 
the DTIC by DOD organizations when cleared for public release. The 
NTIS serves the general public by providing access to these data for 
DOD and the other Federal research and development agencies.<p>

Research organizations including the Naval Research Laboratory, 
NASA, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the NSF, Rand Corporation, the 
Army Engineering and Topographic Lab, the Air Force Institute of 
Technology, and Rice University provide global change information 
for the DTIC to disseminate. Information on global change in DTIC's 
collection includes analytical reports about research conducted, as 
well as data sets, models, projections, research proposals, and 
summaries of research efforts. Specific research efforts are varied 
and include such topics as the impact of global climate change on the 
U.S. Navy, sea level and sea ice changes, a CD-ROM data base 
containing worldwide meteorological data, global climate modeling, 
temperature and trace gas trends, and global cloud analysis 
algorithms.<p>

Basic metadata, described as level 3 in the implementation plan, are 
currently provided by the DOD. Level 1 or 2 metadata are beyond 
DOD's mission. The DOD may, however, on a case-by-case basis, 
consider providing metadata at a higher level if a DOD public domain 
data set is identified to be an extremely high priority for the study of 
global change.<p>

<em>GCDIS access</em>.  Access to DOD unclassified and unrestricted 
data and information is provided through national archive centers: 
the NCDC, the NODC, the NGDC, the National Snow and Ice Data Center, 
and the NTIS. In addition, the USGS and NOAA serve as distribution 
agents for DMA products releasable to the public.<p>

The DOD and NOAA share responsibilities for processing polar-orbiter 
satellite data and exchanging unclassified satellite data and products 
using the Shared Processing Network (SPN). There are four centers of 
expertise that process satellite data: the Fleet Numerical Meteorology 
and Oceanography Center for microwave products, the NAVOCEANO 
for sea surface measurements, the AFGWC for visible and infrared 
cloud products, and NOAA's NESDIS for atmospheric sounding data. 
The NESDIS is also responsible for archiving any SPN data it receives 
and for distributing those data and products to civilian users.<p>

<strong>DOD GCDIS Components Added by April 1, 1995</strong><p>

The DOD will not add GCDIS components.<p>

<strong>Summary</strong><p>

The DOE's contribution to the GCDIS comprises three focused 
programs: the ARM Archive, the CDIAC, and the Program for Climate 
Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison (PCMDI). The ARM archive 
features data from measurements and observations of radiative and 
atmospheric phenomena, as well as the ancillary information and 
documentation that allow scientists to interpret the data. The CDIAC 
provides data and other information concerning carbon dioxide, other 
greenhouse gases, and climate change to the research, policy-making, 
education, and corporate communities, and to the public. The PCMDI 
archives a broad range of global data sets of gridded meteorological 
data to serve in the validation of climate models. The CDIAC and the 
ARM Archive data and information products (all provided free of 
charge) are presently provided in response to mail, telephone, fax, or 
email request. These data are available through the Internet by ftp 
or on a variety of physical media to meet the needs of the users: 
8-mm tape, nine-track tape, or floppy disk.<p>

<strong>DOE GCDIS Capabilities Available April 1, 1994</strong><p>

<em>The ARM Archive content</em>.  The ARM program is a DOE-
sponsored global change research effort designed to improve the 
modeling of cloud radiative forcing in general circulation models. The 
primary user community for ARM data is the atmospheric research 
community; secondary users are the broader scientific community 
that has interest in some of the meteorological or radiative 
measurements that the ARM can provide.<p>

The ARM Archive receives and manages a broad variety of data, such 
as<p>

<ul><li>Measurements and observations of radiative and atmospheric 
phenomena,<p>
<li>Information and documentation about the data streams that 
allow scientists to interpret the data,<p>
<li>Information about the instruments producing the data, and<p>
<li>General information about the ARM project.</ul><p>

This information comes from a variety of sources within the ARM 
project and from several external sources. The primary data source is 
the ARM CART, which will consist of three highly instrumented sites 
located worldwide. The first site, centered close to Lamont, 
Oklahoma, has been taking data since June 1992. Data fusion 
products and data quality measurement products are generated at 
the ARM experiment center using data from the CART sites and 
observations from such external sources as satellites. Information 
about instruments, data quality, and instrument operations comes 
from instrument developers, instrument mentors, site operations 
staff, and scientists.<p>

<em>ARM Archive access</em>.  The ARM Archive data and 
information products (all provided free of charge) are presently 
provided in response to mail, telephone, fax, or email request. The 
data are available through the Internet by ftp or on a variety of 
physical media to meet the needs of the users: 8-mm tape, nine-
track tape, or floppy disk.<p>

The ARM Archive will continue to enhance the number and types of 
scientific data available as the ARM project continues to add 
instruments and sites. In addition, the ARM Archive will increase 
and enhance the quality and quality of information available to assist 
in the understanding and interpretation of the ARM data.<p>

An automated user interface will be available early in 1994 for 
requesting ARM data and information files. This interface will allow 
users with X-windows-based workstations to specify the location, 
instrument platform, date range, and data processing level for the 
data they want to receive. Once that request is submitted, the ARM 
Archive Mass Storage System will retrieve the requested files and 
notify the user of their availability for transfer by ftp. If the user 
requests different delivery media, the system will package the data 
onto those media and notify an operator to ship the media to the 
user. Finally, the ARM Archive will maintain general information 
about the ARM project, instruments, and CART sites on a World Wide 
Web information server.<p>

<em>Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center data content</em>.  
The CDIAC provides data and other information about CO2, other 
greenhouse gases, and climate change to the research, policy-making, 
education, and corporate communities and to the public. Thus, 
CDIAC's mission is broad, and the suite of data and information 
products provided is correspondingly broad. CDIAC's data holdings, 
for example, include concentrations of greenhouse gases in the 
atmosphere and oceans, carbon storage in ecosystems, greenhouse 
gas emissions from industry and land use change, long-term global 
and regional climate, response of vegetation to elevated CO2, tree 
ring data, and data on the vulnerability of coastal areas to rising sea 
level.<p>

The CDIAC acquires data from a large number of investigators and 
institutions in the United States (not limited to DOE-funded 
programs) and around the world. Internationally, the CDIAC obtains 
climate and greenhouse gas data, in particular from China and Russia, 
through its participation in bilateral research agreements. The CDIAC 
also operates the WDC-A for Atmospheric Trace Gases, a component 
of the WDC system coordinated by the ICSU.<p>

The CDIAC quality assures, documents, archives, and distributes data 
in the form of numeric data packages (of which approximately 50 
currently exist). When a particular data base does not exist, the 
CDIAC compiles the data from various sources (e.g., its global and 
country-by-country data base on emissions of CO2 from fossil fuel 
use and cement manufacturing).<p>

In addition to numeric data packages, CDIAC products include the 
newsletter <em>CDIAC Communications</em>, the series <em>Trends: 
A Compendium of Data on Global Change</em>, the <em>DOE Research 
Summary</em> series, the <em>Glossary: Carbon Dioxide and 
Climate</em>, and specialized bibliographies. The CDIAC also 
distributes global-change-related reports from the DOE and other 
agencies.<p>

<em>CDIAC access</em>. The CDIAC data and information products 
(all provided free of charge) are currently provided in response to 
mail, telephone, fax, and email requests. In addition, direct access to 
CDIAC's data and documentation files is now available electronically 
in its anonymous ftp area. The CDIAC data are provided on a variety 
of physical media to suit the needs of the users: printed reports and 
hard-copy listings, 9-track magnetic tapes, floppy diskettes, 8-mm 
tapes, and CD-ROMs.<p>

<strong>DOE Components Added by April 1995</strong><p>

In late 1994 or early 1995 the ARM Archive will provide online, 
searchable, textural information about instrument operation and data 
quality. Also, information bearing directly on a set of requested data 
will be packaged and delivered with the data. Both of these 
capabilities will be available to users through the automated user 
interface.<p>

The CDIAC will expand the breadth and depth of its data holdings, 
particularly in the areas of greenhouse gas concentrations in the 
oceans and atmosphere and emissions of greenhouse gases from land 
use changes.<p>

The CDIAC expects to benefit from its collocation with the NASA 
EOSDIS DAAC for Biogeochemistry, also located at the Oak Ridge 
National Laboratory (ORNL). As the NASA EOSDIS matures, it is 
expected that hardware and software systems developed by and for 
the ORNL DAAC will also provide more online access to CDIAC data 
products.<p>

<strong>DOE Components Added by April 1, 1996</strong><p>

The CDIAC will continue to expand its data holdings, responding to 
the changing needs of the global change community. As the GCDIS 
approaches greater operability, information system components such 
as the GCMD will provide enhanced online access to CDIAC data 
products. Further, it is possible that the CIESIN will serve as an 
additional conduit providing access to CDIAC data products, 
especially for the social sciences and the international 
communities.<p>

<h2><a name=DOI>Department of the Interior</a></h2>

<strong>Summary</strong><p>

As the major Federal land manager and primary Federal agency 
responsible for managing the Nation's natural ecosystems, fish and 
wildlife, and energy and water resources, the DOI is particularly 
concerned about the potential short- and long-term effects of climate 
and other environmental change on these lands and resources. The 
DOI's global change research is addressing topics such as hydrologic 
and geologic processes and resources, land use, land cover, biological 
habitats, resources, and diversity; past global change recorded in the 
physical, chemical, and biological record; land surface and solid-Earth 
processes that relate to environmental change; geography and 
cartography; polar and arid region processes; ecosystem modeling 
and dynamics; and resource ethnology.<p>

The DOI bureaus collect, maintain, analyze, and interpret short- and 
long-term land, water, air, biological, and other natural resource data 
and information in support of their missions. These efforts have 
always included maintenance of high-quality, long-term data sets, 
including cartographic, land cover, geologic, hydrologic, ecological, 
and biological data from both satellite- and aircraft-based remote-
sensing and terrestrial-based observations. The DOI will provide 
access to directory-level descriptions of these data (and inventory-
level information where feasible) through DOI and other agency 
directories and clearinghouse mechanisms, such as the NOAA 
National Geophysical Data Center. The USGS GLIS will be one of the 
primary inventory-level interfaces with the GCDIS and an access 
point to DOI global change data. The DOI also participates in the 
NASA EOS program through the EOSDIS Land Processes DAAC at the 
USGS EROS EDC, where capabilities are being developed to process, 
archive, and provide online information system access to EOS land-
related data sets such as those from the MODIS. <p>

<strong>DOI GCDIS Components Available by April 1, 
1994</strong><p>

<strong>GCDIS Content</strong><p>

<em>The USGS EROS Data Center</em>.  The USGS's EROS EDC is a core 
element of DOI's focused global change data management activities. 
The EDC has archived, processed, and distributed Landsat data since 
the launch of Landsat-1 in 1972. With the enactment of the Land 
Remote Sensing Policy Act of 1992, the Center was designated as the 
National Satellite Land Remote Sensing Data Archive. This 
designation has broadened the Center's responsibility for preserving 
and providing long-term access to satellite-acquired remotely sensed 
data of the Earth's land areas. The Center's 21-year collection of 
approximately one million Landsat scenes is the largest component of 
the archive. These data are currently being converted from aging 
magnetic media to new cassette tapes to preserve them for future 
use. Current activities include conversion of approximately 300,000 
scenes of post-1978 MSS data (30 percent of these data were 
converted by the end of 1993) and 170,000 scenes of Landsat 
Thematic Mapper data, and the development of improved Landsat 
data processing capabilities.<p>

Other types of satellite data are being added to the EROS Data 
Center's Archive. Since 1992, the USGS has been working with NASA, 
NOAA, the ESA, and more than 20 foreign ground receiving stations 
to collect 1-km resolution AVHRR data for each daily pass over the 
Earth's land surface. These data support many applications, including 
efforts by the global change research community to produce a global 
land cover maps and to monitor vegetation conditions (greenness) on 
a periodic basis throughout the year. This program is being 
coordinated with the IGBP and the CEOS. It complements the 
operational NOAA programs that collect global AVHRR data at 4- and 
16-km resolution, primarily for oceanic and atmospheric 
applications.<p>

Long-term, consistent continental and global land data sets are being 
developed and produced to meet the needs of global change 
researchers. Emphasis is being given to data sets related to land use 
and land cover, vegetation, soils, terrain, and satellite-derived data, 
such as global vegetation index and albedo (brightness) data. The 
application of these data sets to process research is being tested in 
several projects, including modeling of land-atmosphere exchange 
processes, analysis of vulnerability of arid and semiarid land to 
changes in long-term productivity, and biogeochemical exchange 
processes in Alaska and the Arctic.<p>

<em>USGS Global Change and Climate History Program Data 
Management System</em>. The USGS is providing Internet access to 
data and information resulting from its Global Change and Climate 
History (GCH) Program through an online system. Users can obtain 
information about the GCH Program and its projects, data sets 
resulting from GCH-funded research, data from other sources of 
interest to USGS global change researchers, and freely distributable 
software tools that may be used to obtain and interpret data. The 
GCH Data Management System represents an effective approach for 
making the evolving results of GCH research available to a wider user 
community. Data sets that will be made available by 1994 include 
global-gridded Pliocene and Quaternary sea level; modern average 
global sea surface temperature and polar sea ice concentration; 
paleoceanographic data (Sea of Japan); methane release from 
submarine permafrost (Alaska); glacier velocity measurements 
(Antarctic); meteorological observations (North Slope of Alaska, 
Antarctica); fossil pollen data from terrestrial and ocean sediment 
cores; and eolian surficial deposits on the U.S. Great Plains. Other data 
sets will be released in future years as data collection and analysis 
are completed.<p>

<em>National Biological Survey global change data</em>. The global 
change research programs of the Bureau of Land Management, the 
Fish and Wildlife Service, and the National Park Service have been 
integrated under the new DOI bureau, the National Biological Survey 
(NBS). A Global Change Data Center was established in Fort Collins, 
Colorado, to manage the wide variety of global change data formerly 
collected by the Bureau of Land Management. Data sets will be made 
available from studies in meteorology, air quality, soil temperature, 
surface water chemistry, hydrology, vegetation, squirrel and 
grasshopper population density, aquatic insects, fire history, tree 
rings, and pack rat middens. Although some data have been provided 
to the Global Change Data Center, data sets are also maintained at the 
project level.<p>

Although NBS global change data management activities are 
coordinated by the NBS Division of Ecosystem Research, each site is 
responsible for maintaining, storing, and providing access to its data. 
Major data sets, formerly collected by National Park Service global 
change research projects, include multimillennial tree ring growth, 
Sequoia forest population, and fuel and fire dynamics data in the 
Sierra Nevada Mountains; tree ring data reflecting water yield along 
several rivers in the Ozark Mountains dating back to the 12th 
century; and data from Glacier National Park's Lake McDonald 
watershed, including physical attributes, vegetation, and AVHRR 
data. Data sets collected under the Fish and Wildlife Service include 
tree ring growth records and remote sensing measurements of 
coastal wetlands of the southeastern states; analysis of sea level 
changes in the Great Lakes from sediment cores; long-term (25-year) 
records from the North American Breeding Bird Survey; biology and 
hydrology of wetlands in the Northern Great Plains; snow cover in 
the Alaskan tundra from AVHRR data; and fish population, status and 
trends, and collections.<p>

<strong>GCDIS Access</strong><p>

<strong>Focused Programs</strong><p>

<em>Global Land Information System</em>. The USGS has developed 
the GLIS as an online, computer-based directory and inventory 
system to provide users with an interactive, user-friendly source for 
information about the land-related data sets described above. The 
GLIS is a primary node of the interagency Global Change Data and 
Information System. Examples of the kinds of data sets accessible 
through the GLIS are<p>

<ul><li>Satellite observations (daily AVHRR LAC and GAC, Global 
Vegetation Index, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index 
composites from AVHRR LAC data, and Landsat MSS and TM data);<p>
<li>Land cover/land use data (Mathews Global Vegetation Cover, 
World Ecosystem Complexes, and Holdridge Life Zones);<p>
<li>Soils and terrain data (UN-FAO soils map of the world, Zobler 
soils categories, and SOTER digital data bases); and<p>
<li>Terrain and cartography data (USGS and NGDC Digital Elevation 
Models, ETOPO-5 land elevation, USGS Digital Line Graphs, and Digital 
Chart of the World and elevation data derived from it).</ul><p>

The GLIS users can connect directly to other information systems 
such as the interagency GCMD, Japan's Earth Observation Information 
System, the ESA's On-Line Earthnet Data Availability system, and 
Canada's Global Change Network.<p>

Data set information in the GLIS will be maintained in three levels of 
detail. The directory level will contain high-level, summary 
descriptions of entire data sets. Data directory textual searches will 
be based on discipline, project, sensor key words, geographic location, 
and other data set parameters. The guide level will contain detailed 
descriptions of data sets, including information about sensor 
specifications, extent of coverage, processing history, data quality, 
and product availability. The inventory level will contain detailed 
information about individual data sets, such as the time and location 
of a Landsat scene or AVHRR pass.<p>

<em>National Biological Survey Science Directory</em>.  The NBS has 
developed a directory of science data bases that is available in hard-
copy form to help users identify and locate terrestrial natural 
resource data sets. The directory contains summary descriptions of 
each data set and information about its availability, location, and 
research staff contact name. Plans include providing this information 
to the GCMD. The NBS uses an Annual Work Plan to collect, describe, 
and maintain information about its data sets. This information is 
available upon request.<p>

<strong>Contributing Programs</strong><p>

The mission programs of the DOI bureaus have always included the 
establishment, maintenance, validation, description, accessibility, and 
preservation of high-quality, long-term data sets. Many of these data 
sets are pertinent to global change research; information about these 
data sets and access to them is provided by the appropriate 
information systems of the responsible DOI bureaus. In addition, the 
DOI plays a lead role in interagency coordination activities that relate 
to many of these data sets. The interagency FGDC was established in 
1990 through revised Circular A-16 to coordinate activities related to 
spatial data, and is chaired by the DOI. Major objectives of revised 
Circular A-16 are to avoid duplication and minimize costs in mapping 
and spatial data activities, while maximizing the availability of data 
to large numbers of users. Also, under the Office of Management and 
Budget (OMB) Memorandum M-92-01, the DOI is given responsibility 
for coordinating the water data acquisition and information sharing 
activities of all Federal agencies, including the quality and quantity 
of streams, lakes, reservoirs, estuaries, and ground water, plus water 
use and sedimentation.<p>

<em>Federal Geographic Data Committee activities</em>.  In the 
Federal Government, the OMB has identified a need for a "national 
digital spatial information resource," which has come to be called the 
National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI). To address this need, the 
OMB has created the FGDC and has charged it with the responsibility 
to coordinate various surveying, mapping, and spatial data activities 
of Federal agencies to meet the needs of the Nation. Executive Order 
12906 (Coordinating Geographic Data Acquisition and Access: The 
National Spatial Data Infrastructure") was signed by President 
Clinton on April 11, 1994 to guide the Federal Government's 
development of the NSDI. The FGDC has also been charged with 
coordinating a variety of activities with State and local governments 
and the private sector to develop the NSDI. A series of data-specific 
subcommittees and crosscutting working groups have been 
established to address the issues.<p>

NSDI is a framework within which organizations and technology 
interact to foster more efficient use, management, and production of 
geospatial data. The NSDI is primarily an umbrella of policies, 
standards, agreements, and partnerships among a variety of sectors 
and disciplines that will promote more cost-efficient production, 
ready availability, and greater use of higher quality geospatial data. 
The major objectives of the NSDI are to foster enhanced use of 
geospatial data through better management of existing geospatial 
data and through more efficient collection and production of new 
geospatial data in ways that maximize data usefulness for multiple 
data users. The NSDI will promote development and maintenance of 
and access to data sets that are needed for national, regional, state, 
and local analyses. Many of these data sets, developed by agencies to 
meet ongoing mission responsibilities, are important to global change 
research. The efforts of the FGDC will improve access to these data 
sets by global change researchers as well as a wide range of other 
users.<p>

The FGDC is developing the NSDI to provide a means to document, 
query, search, and access geospatial data in much the same fashion 
as is being developed for global change data through the GCDIS. The 
clearinghouse is based on a distributed approach to geospatial data 
management that relies on data producers to document their data 
consistently using the Content Standards for Digital Geospatial 
Metadata. Data searches will be conducted over electronic networks 
such as the Internet, using public-domain WAIS query software. 
Organizations not connected to the network will have access to the 
clearinghouse through sites such as the Earth Science Information 
Centers (1-800-USA-MAPS) or through agency-established data 
servers. A prototype test of the clearinghouse is in progress. <em>A 
Manual of Federal Geographic Data Products</em> was published in 
hard-copy form (an electronic version is being developed) to provide 
an initial reference source to the types of spatial data that will 
become available through the clearinghouse. It contains a 
comprehensive descriptions of more than 150 publicly distributed 
Federal geographic data products from 21 Federal agencies, including 
maps, computer-compatible (digital) data, aerial photography and 
multispectral imagery, and other geographically referenced data 
sets.<p>

<em>Earth Science Data Directory</em>.  In addition to the GLIS, the 
USGS maintains the Earth Science Data Directory (ESDD) with more 
than 2,300 descriptions of data sets from a number of Federal 
agencies and all 50 States. The ESDD directory-level descriptions 
provide high-level information about data sources, their size and 
geographic location, format and media, and technical contacts for 
each data set.<p>

The USGS also maintains the National Water Data Exchange, a 
computerized index to more than 450,000 sites for which water data 
are available from more than 450 organizations.<p>

<strong>DOI GCDIS Components Available by April 1, 
1995</strong><p>

<em>Global Land Information System</em>.  The GLIS will be 
enhanced to provide full graphical user interface (GUI) capability in 
the middle of 1994. This capability will include a full suite of X-
windows tools for selecting geographical search areas and displaying 
data coverage and browse files over the Internet. In addition, the 
XGLIS version will include data set user guides and sample data 
graphics files that are compatible with the World Wide Web 
document viewing tools. This will allow XGLIS users to link easily to 
relevant global change documents hosted by research centers all 
over the world that are also utilizing World Wide Web.<p>

<strong>DOI GCDIS Components Available by April 1, 
1996</strong><p>

Global Land Information System. The GLIS will be further expanded 
to support interactive query and online ordering from the National 
Digital Cartographic Data Base sales data base (including 1:250,000-
scale land use and land cover, 7.5-minute Digital Elevation Models 
(DEMs), 1:100,000-scale Digital Line Graphs (DLGs), 1-degree DEMs, 
1:2,000,000-scale DLGs, and 1:24,000-scale DLGs). This capability will 
include cross-inventory searching for identifying data sets covering 
the same geographic area and acquired during the same time period.
The following table represents the data and information access 
capabilities that will be provided at the EROS Data Center between 
1994 and 1996. Other individual DOI GCDIS components will provide 
a variety of capabilities on various time scales.<p>

<strong>DOI International Linkages Related to Global Change 
Data</strong><p>

The UNEP has established its North American GRID facility at the 
EROS Data Center to provide improved access to global change data 
and information on an international scale. The EDC was recently 
designated as the World Data Center for Land Remotely Sensed Data 
under the auspices of the ICSU. This recognizes its holdings of the 
world's largest collection of space- and aircraft-acquired imagery of 
the Earth's land surface, including more than 2 million images 
acquired from satellites and more than 8 million aerial photographs.
The DOI participates in the CEOS, an international group whose 
members include NASA, NOAA, the USGS, the ESA, Canada, and Japan. 
The DOI also participates in the Landsat Ground Station Operators 
Working Group. Participation by the National Park Service in the U.S. 
Man and the Biosphere Program facilitates use of the international 
network of biosphere reserves for comparative ecological studies and 
sharing of data.<p>

Other DOI bureau global change programs have links to international 
programs. For example, the USGS is participating in the GEWEX, the 
GCIP, a part of the WCRP. The USGS is also participating in the Land 
Cover Change Pilot Study of the IGBP Working Group on Data and 
Information Systems. Other participating countries include Canada, 
France, Russia, Australia, and the countries of the European Economic 
Community.

<h2><a name=EPA>Environmental Protection Agency</a></h2>

<strong>Summary</strong><p>

The EPA has the primary responsibility for data on environmental 
quality and the distribution and effects of pollutants on human and 
ecological health. As such, it is both a supplier and consumer of 
information on the environment, with a large potential for beneficial 
interchange with the GCDIS that goes well beyond its current role in 
the USGCRP.<p>

The EPA has relatively small holdings that are derived from the 
focused USGCRP and more than five terabytes of data that are 
derived from its regulatory and related programs. For the short term, 
the EPA will seek agreements with existing GCDIS centers to house its 
data derived from the focused USGCRP programs. In the longer term, 
the EPA intends to modernize its potentially contributing data 
systems in ways compatible with the GCDIS, but the EPA is not 
currently budgeted to do this at a level that would meet the GCDIS 
projected schedules. To meet the GCDIS schedules, the EPA will need 
enhanced funding beyond the current EPA USGCRP budget, as 
outlined in the USGCRP special issue on data capture (see <a 
href=appAgcdip.html>Appendix A</a>). <p>

If the EPA is successful in obtaining the necessary funding, the EPA 
intends to develop a full catalog and access system that is 
interoperable with the GCDIS, maintaining a level of functionality 
appropriate to the priority of the data assigned by the GCDIS ranking 
process. Under current funding, the EPA is beginning an effort to 
develop directory and inventory information for some of its 
contributing program data, it is developing extensive network and 
telecommunications connectivity, it is enhancing its supercomputing 
center activities, and it is developing plans to become a consumer of 
USGCRP data and information (especially satellite data from the 
NASA EOSDIS).<p>

The EPA's potentially contributing data result from a broad range of 
programs aimed at improving human and ecological health, assessing 
environmental risks, and preventing environmental pollution. Data 
from the EPA's own programs, as well as data from programs 
delegated to the states, are stored in a variety of data bases at the 
EPA's National Computer Center (NCC) in Research Triangle Park, 
North Carolina. These include<p>

<em>Ambient air quality, source, emissions, and compliance</em><p>

<ul><li>Emissions and compliance from industrial plants,
<li>Overall status of air quality,
<li>Reference information (i.e., FIPS codes),
<li>Emissions from area and mobile sources.</ul><p>

<em>Ambient water quality, source, emissions, and 
compliance</em><p>

<ul><li>Public water supplies and compliance with regulations,
<li>Marine monitoring data pertaining to water quality, 
oceanographic descriptions, sediment pollutants, physical/chemical 
characteristics, biological characteristics, and estuary information,
<li>Permit compliance data,
<li>Waterway parametric data, ambient, intensive survey, effluent, 
and biological water quality,
<li>Specific releases of oils and hazardous substances.</ul><p>

<strong>Summary of EPA GCDIS Capabilities Available April 1, 
1994</strong><p>

As of April 1, 1994, the EPA portion of the GCDIS will consist of the 
components, listed below, accessible at various prototype levels over 
the Internet through a UNIX public access server at Research 
Triangle Park, North Carolina. The public access server will be 
developed as part of the EPA's general strategy to increase access to 
environmental data and includes efforts focused on the USGCRP as 
well as other areas.<p>

Extracts from selected program data bases and model results will be 
made available as part of the Envirofacts data base. The server will 
support Internet search tools (e.g., Gopher, WAIS, and Mosaic), and 
contain both data and pointers to data and information. Supported 
tools will be interoperable with appropriate components of the 
GCDIS. Electronic versions of <em>Access EPA</em>, the <em>Toxic 
Release Inventory</em>, the Guide to Selected National 
Environmental Statistics in the United States, the Online Library 
System, and the Information Systems Inventory will also be 
available on the server to assist users in obtaining EPA information 
available on line and by hard copy.<p>

Data and information from the focused portion of the USGCRP (e.g., 
the North American Landscape Characterization data set) will be 
made available through arrangements with other GCDIS archives. 
<em>Contributing</em> data and information from EPA's regulatory 
and scientific programs, not derived from the USGCRP activities, will 
be incorporated into the Envirofacts data base, as funding becomes 
available and requirements are known from the USGCRP.<p>

<strong>EPA GCDIS Components Available by April 1, 
1994</strong><p>

<em>The National Computer Center</em>.  The EPA's National 
Computer Center, located at Research Triangle Park RTP), was 
founded in 1971 as the Research Triangle Computing Center with a 
primary focus on EPA's air quality research and enforcement 
programs. It was renamed the NCC in 1975, to reflect a more 
nationwide mission. In 1980, all the agency's data processing and 
telecommunications capabilities were consolidated under the NCC. 
Today the NCC is a large, standardized, integrated, high-speed 
computing center with a computing environment that varies from 
workstations to a large IBM mainframe.<p>

The NCC responds to the demands of new environmental legislation, 
serves as the central medium for storing and processing information, 
and provides nationwide services and support to more than 25,000 
Federal, State, and local users of the agency's information resources. 
Each year it receives information inquiries from these users and 
solves and documents problems for them. In addition, it supports 
their hardware, software, telecommunications, and operations needs. 
The NCC would form the cornerstone of EPA's implementation of the 
GCDIS and would contain most of the contributing data provided by 
the agency.<p>

<em>The National Environmental Supercomputing Center</em>. The 
National Environmental Supercomputing Center (NESC) at Bay City, 
Michigan, is the world's only supercomputer center devoted 
exclusively to environmental problems. The NESC supports EPA 
modeling efforts in regional air models, in large ecosystems such as 
the Chesapeake Bay and Great Lakes, and in computational chemistry 
for the study of toxic substances.<p>

The NESC provides EPA programs with the ability to simulate 
environmental systems by mathematical models too large to be 
executed on conventional computers. The cost and time savings of 
modeling compared with that for field testing allow EPA to test 
environmental strategies on the computer without going through the 
costly and time consuming process of trial and error using the 
regulatory process. Its role in the GCDIS will be to provide a vehicle 
for processing environmental models and remote sensing data to 
create information supporting both research and policy 
formulation.<p>

<em>The EPA data communications network</em>. The EPA's data 
communications network is designed to provide support to a wide 
range of clients, including EPA regional offices and laboratories, state 
and local agencies, and public access. RTP, Washington, D.C., and 
Cincinnati, Ohio, are connected by a triangle of T1 circuits. 
Additionally, the NESC in Bay City, Michigan, is connected to RTP with 
a T3 circuit. The EPA's 10 regional offices are connected by 56-Kbps 
circuits to both RTP and Cincinnati. All fifty state agencies, as well as 
Puerto Rico, are connected by analog circuits to the regional offices. 
Internet connectivity is supported at the T3 level through a 
connection at Bay City. At the workstation level, the agency supports 
approximately 19,000 token-ring and 2,500 Ethernet LAN-connected 
stations. Currently, IBM, VAX, and Cray registration consists of 
12,586 users. Virtually all EPA users have the potential for Internet 
email access through the agency's internal email system, although all 
employees are not connected to the internal system. The EPA also 
maintains full Internet connectivity to selected workstations 
throughout the agency.<p>

<em>Access EPA</em>. Published annually since 1991, <em>Access 
EPA</em> is a comprehensive directory and locator that provides 
descriptive and access information on more than 300 of EPA's major 
information resources, including data bases, clearinghouses, hotlines, 
records, models, and documents. Additional information is also 
available through the contacts listed. Originally designed to enhance 
public access to environmental information, this resource will 
become a key component of the agency's electronic information 
dissemination effort, especially once it links up with the proposed 
Government Information Locator Service currently under 
development.<p>

Printed copies are available in main public and branch libraries and 
in state environmental libraries. Copies may also be ordered through 
the Government Printing Office or the National Technical Information 
Service. A brief quick-reference version, <em>Access Express</em>, is 
available at EPA's Public Information Center. A full-text online 
version of <em>Access EPA</em> is currently accessible through both 
the EPA Online Library System (OLS) and the Internet.<p>

<em>Online Library System</em>. The EPA OLS is a bibliographic data 
base that references the information resources maintained by the 
EPA Library Network. It contains bibliographic citations from books, 
EPA and other Federal agency technical reports, conference 
proceedings, indexes, audiovisual materials, maps, journals, and a 
variety of other documents held in the collections of EPA 
Headquarters and regional and laboratory libraries. The OLS also 
provides summaries of selected titles. Information contained in the 
following data bases is also listed in the OLS: the National Catalog, the 
Hazardous Waste Superfund Collection Database, the Clean Lakes 
Database, the Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics Chemical 
Collection Database, and Regional Files from certain EPA regional 
libraries.<p>

<em>Toxic Release Inventory</em>.  The Toxic Release Inventory is a 
public data base of information on releases of more than 300 toxic 
chemicals into the environment. The data are self-reported by 
industry.<p>

<em>Guide to Selected Environmental Statistics</em>.  The guide is a 
directory to selected U.S. statistical programs that collect frequently 
sought after, national-level, time series environmental statistics, 
compiled and distributed on a regular basis. Each entry describes a 
separate statistical program, giving program purpose, data coverage, 
collection methods, geographic coverage, agency contacts, pertinent 
publications, and data base access options. It is available in both 
hard-copy and electronic versions, with expanded search features 
and maps in the electronic version.<p>

Statistical coverage in the guide includes data related to the state of 
the environment, pressures on the environment, human health and 
welfare issues, and societal responses to environmental problems. 
This information was provided by multiple agencies and 
departments, including EPA.<p>

<em><a href=http://wwwgateway.ciesin.org>Gateway</a></em>.  Gateway is a Microsoft Windows-based GUI 
using client-server technology that provides users with a simplified 
means of accessing and analyzing EPA's integrated data resources. It 
allows users to access, through pull-down menus and user-developed 
reports, agency data resources stored in Envirofacts; to spatially 
analyze and display that information through a full-function 
ARC/INFO GIS capability; to employ user-developed analytical tools 
and models for data analysis; to access worldwide information over 
the Internet using WAIS and Gopher technology; and to pass the 
information to desktop tools such as spreadsheets and word 
processors.<p>

<em>Envirofacts</em>.  Envirofacts is an integrated, relational data 
base of subsets of several of EPA's national environmental data 
bases. It is the relational data base queried by the Gateway user 
interface. Envirofacts currently contains information from EPA's 
Facility Index System, Permit Compliance System, Toxic Release 
Inventory System, and the Superfund information system. In the 
near future, it is scheduled to include the new Water Quality Storage 
and Retrieval System water monitoring data base, and work is 
proceeding on incorporating both the Aerometric Information 
Reporting System and the Resource Conservation and Recovery 
Information System data bases. Additional programmatic and 
monitoring data bases will be included in the future. The Envirofacts 
data base architecture and structure is currently supported by 
Version 7.0 of the ORACLE Relational Data Base Management System 
(RDBMS).<p>

<em>Information Systems Inventory</em>. The Information Systems 
Inventory (ISI) is the definitive source of summary information 
about approximately 500 of EPA's current information systems, 
including some models and data bases. The ISI was developed to 
enhance the agency's ability to track major information systems and 
to share information across media and program boundaries. Entries 
under each system in the inventory include system name and 
acronym, system level, responsible organization, contact person, 
legislative authority, data base descriptors, access information, 
hardware and software, system abstract, and key words. The ISI 
provides searching capabilities and pointer information so that 
people interested in EPA information can readily determine what 
EPA systems may be relevant to their interests, and whom to call to 
get further information.<p>

The ISI is available in hard copy and automated forms in the EPA 
headquarters and regional libraries, and through the NTIS. Future 
plans are to incorporate the ISI into an expanded version of Access 
EPA.<p>

<em>EMAP Information Management system</em>.  The EMAP 
Information Management (IM) is the vehicle with which the total 
EMAP program manages data and information. The EMAP IM will 
provide the infrastructure for turning raw scientific measurements 
into useful information products that will serve to guide actions to 
improve the environment. The EMAP IM is also designed to provide 
a diverse user community easy access to data and processed 
information through a series of tools that access data and information 
over a distributed national network.<p>

The EMAP IM architecture consists of seven conceptual layers: 
canonical data, virtual repository, security, communication access, 
tool set, interprocess communications, and user interface. 
Implementation will progress through proof of concept, technology 
transfer, and enterprise implementation processes. The goal is to 
develop by 1997 an environmental information highway allowing 
analysis of EMAP data across heterogeneous networks of personal 
and scientific computers and among an interagency federation of 
users.<p>

<em>CIESIN catalog</em>.  As part of its efforts to increase public 
access to environmental data, the EPA has provided assistance to the 
CIESIN to enable it to develop a prototype catalog of environmental 
information. The CIESIN will develop directory and inventory 
portions of an environmental catalog, using selected EPA data bases. 
These will be maintained on a CIESIN server that is interoperable 
with the other components of the GCDIS and publicly available over 
the Internet. Additionally, the CIESIN is developing a prototype Great 
Lakes Regional Information System, compatible with the Great Lakes 
Information Network and the GCDIS, that will be accessible by the 
environmental community over the Internet. The Great Lakes 
prototype is intended to be the paradigm for other efforts to develop 
environmental information systems for large geographic regions such 
as the Chesapeake Bay, the Gulf of Mexico, the U.S.-Mexican Border, 
and Eastern Europe. The purpose of these efforts, taken together, is 
to increase the public availability of environmental data and to 
facilitate human dimensions and Earth science data integration for 
improved decision making at the local to global level.<p>

<strong>EPA GCDIS Components Added by April 1, 1995</strong><p>

Initially, activity will be focused on developing the Envirofacts data 
base and constructing the necessary tools and metadata to facilitate 
access to a prototype information system on the RTP server. It is 
expected that the CIESIN directory prototype will be sufficiently 
developed to permit implementation on the RTP server, either as a 
copy or as a reflector to the CIESIN facility. It is also expected that 
the Great Lakes and EMAP prototypes will have created access points 
through the server as well. An online user feedback system will be 
developed to help improve access and develop content.<p>

<strong>EPA GCDIS Components Added by April 1, 1996</strong><p>

The Envirofacts data base will be expanded to include additional EPA 
program data with content related to the requirements of the 
USGCRP. It is expected that the prototypes developed during 1995 
will be refined based on the previous year's user feedback. 
Additional geographic data bases may be added.

<strong>The Ultimate NASA Vision</strong><p>

NASA's major contributions to the GCDIS are the components of the 
GCMD and the EOSDIS. The EOSDIS will be a single, distributed system 
that will serve the Earth science community by archiving and 
distributing data in support of Earth science research programs. The 
EOSDIS will provide easy and reliable access to Earth science (e.g., 
climate, oceanography, land science, hydrology, biogeochemical 
dynamics) data products from a variety of sources, including the 
following:<p>

<ul><li>NASA's series of EOS satellites - a major comprehensive global 
observing system providing a minimum of 15 years of continuous 
Earth observations starting with the first launch in 1998.<p>

<li>Current and future Earth Probe NASA missions, such as the 
Tropical Rain Measurement Mission (TRMM), the Ocean Topography 
Experiment (TOPEX/Poseidon), the Upper Atmosphere Research 
Satellite (UARS), the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS), the 
Sea-Viewing Wide-Field of View Sensor (SeaWiFS), and the NASA 
Scatterometer (NSCAT) on Japan's Advanced EOS.<p>

<li>International missions in which NASA participates, such as the 
European Remote-Sensing Satellites (ERS-1 and ERS-2), Japan's Earth 
Resources Satellite (JERS-1), and Radarsat.<p>

<li>Field campaigns, such as the Boreal Ecosystem-Atmosphere 
Study (BOREAS), the Oregon Transect Ecosystem Research (OTTER), 
and the First International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project 
(ISLSCP) Field Experiment (FIFE).<p>

<li>Existing space-based operations, such as NOAA's AVHRR, TOVS, 
and GOES, identified as critical to global change research by 
Pathfinder projects and reprocessed using community consensus 
algorithms as recommend by designated Science Working Groups.<p>

<li>Existing data sets, other data essential for the interpretation of 
measurements, and other activities sponsored by NASA's Mission to 
Planet Earth program.</ul><p>

In order to protect the significant public investment in data, the 
EOSDIS has assigned the responsibility for making the data 
permanently available in an easily usable form to the DAACs and the 
SEDAC. Along with the SEDAC and the GCMD, the DAACs serve as the 
primary user interface to the EOSDIS.<p>

In general, there is no period of exclusive access for EOS data. 
However, some of the data centers hold data sets for which there are 
specific stipulations that preclude open distribution. Data will be 
available to scientific users at the marginal cost of filling their 
requests, and scientific users will be required to make available their 
research results and any derived data products. Results of significant 
interest will become part of the EOSDIS data holdings and be 
distributed under the EOS data policy.<p>

<strong>Current NASA Capabilities</strong><p>

The EOSDIS is building on existing discipline-specific Earth science 
data centers and data systems. The preexisting data systems form 
the starting point for the EOSDIS. The data systems and data set 
initiatives that make up today's EOSDIS employ existing electronic 
networks for data transfer, interactive sessions, and mail. These 
services are provided through the NASA Science Internet (NSI). This 
network supports several protocols and is interoperable with the 
Internet. Currently, the NSI consists of a backbone based on T1 
technology (1.5 Mbps) connecting 27 regional networks and more 
than 100 tail circuits to research sites, reaching approximately 2,500 
end users.<p>

<strong>NASA GCDIS Capabilities Available April 1, 1994</strong><p>

NASA provides access to Earth science data through several 
discipline-specific data centers and data systems, most of which can 
automatically be accessed from the GCMD. These centers and systems 
provide various levels of service for data processing, distribution, 
and archiving. The numerous disciplines supported include climate, 
oceanography, land science, hydrology, biogeochemical dynamics, sea 
ice, geophysics, atmospheric dynamics, radiation budget, and human 
dimensions.<p>

Researchers may access most of the systems through the Internet 
and dial-up lines, or visit hard-copy browse facilities. Data are 
delivered electronically or on standard media, such as 9-track 
magnetic tape, 8-mm cartridges, or CD-ROMs. System capabilities 
allow users to search, locate, select, and order products. Searches 
usually can be limited by geographic area, time, or geophysical 
parameter. Electronic access is generally free to research users, but a 
fee may be charged to cover the marginal costs of filling the 
requests.<p>

<strong>NASA GCDIS Components Available April 1, 1994</strong><p>

Although NASA's major contributions to the GCDIS are the GCMD and 
the EOSDIS, the building blocks available for April 1, 1994, include 
several other data centers and data systems. These centers and 
systems are operationally supporting the Earth science research 
community with various levels of service. Most of these services will 
be transferred to the EOSDIS data centers as resources allow, 
although because of funding limitations, a full transition is not 
envisioned within the next several years. These systems will 
probably continue to be separately funded to support the research 
community, and can continue to support the GCDIS at the current 
access levels.<p>

In addition to the GCMD and the EOSDIS Data Centers described 
earlier, the following building blocks are available:<p>

<ul><li>The National Space Science Data Center's (NSSDC) Online Data 
and Information System Services (NODIS) provides information about 
past, present, and future space-flight missions and about the 
investigations flown or scheduled to fly on those missions, detailed 
information about those data sets primarily archived at NSSDC, and 
electronic access to a few Earth science data sets, such as TOMS 
data,<p>

<li>The Crustal Dynamics Data Information System (CDDIS) 
maintains information about, stores, and distributes data products 
acquired to further the advancement of scientific understanding of 
Earth dynamics, tectonophysics, and earthquake mechanisms, 
including the results of science support groups analyzing these data 
sets,<p>

<li>The Scientific and Technical Information Program's Center for 
Aerospace Information provides online access to bibliographical data 
bases and documents.</ul><p>

<em>Content</em>.  Some of the most frequently requested holdings 
of each of the data centers and systems contributing to GCDIS on 
April 1, 1994, are listed in the <a href=nasahold.html>table</a>.  
These include several Pathfinder Data Sets. (See <em>Science Data 
Plan for the EOS Data and Information System Covering EOSDIS 
Version 0 and Beyond</em> for additional details.)<p>

<em>Services (access mechanisms)</em>.  Most of the data systems 
can be automatically accessed from the GCMD, which has automated 
connections to approximately 30 global-change-relevant information 
systems. Most of the systems, however, require that the user obtain 
an account before obtaining data. Most of these search and order 
services can be accessed through the Internet and dial-up 
connections. Most browse capabilities at this time are limited to hard 
copy. Some data are available through online services, although most 
ordered data will be sent on standard media. In 1994, the network 
backbone will be upgraded to T3-technology (45 Mbps). Contact the 
user support personnel for the individual systems or data centers as 
listed in the following <a href=daactacts.html>table</a>.<p>

<em>Interoperation</em>.  In this time frame, an integrated 
implementation of the functions for data searching and ordering 
across most of the EOSDIS DAACs will be available to a restricted set 
(about 15) of science advisors.<p>

<strong>NASA GCDIS Components Available April 1, 1995</strong><p>

In July 1994, the initial version of EOSDIS will be released - 
Version 0 (V0). This version is a working prototype with some 
operational elements, and supports the research of scientific users 
with currently available data and new data from other missions 
before the availability of EOS data. It interconnects the existing 
services of the various EOSDIS DAACs and the SEDAC through 
electronic networks, interoperable catalogs, and common data 
distribution procedures to provide better access. With V0, users will 
have a unified Earth sciences view. Version 0 provides an operating 
infrastructure to test and refine the evolutionary methodology 
essential to EOSDIS success.<p>

<em>Content increases</em>.  More than 250 NASA data sets and 
approximately 100 related products will be available with the 
release of EOSDIS V0, including the several Pathfinder products and 
data products from new missions such as SeaWiFS, Radarsat, and 
ERS-2. (Note that the distribution of SeaWiFS data will be restricted 
for 5 years after observation.) See <em>Science Data Plan for the EOS 
Data and Information System Covering EOSDIS Version 0 and 
Beyond</em> for additional details.<p>

<em>Service improvements (access mechanisms)</em>.  An 
Information Management System will support data and information 
search and order across DAACs, SEDAC, and selected non-NASA 
Affiliated Data Centers. A user will be able to log into any DAAC and 
find out about the data holdings at other sites. The user will be able 
to submit a request to order the data from a single site, yet have 
multiple DAACs fill the order.<p>

Version 0 will employ graphics to provide a simple, effective means 
of obtaining information about the data sets. Researchers will be able 
to search for data by geographic area and time period, as well as by 
such characteristics as data source or geophysical parameters. In 
addition, users may browse through samples of the data displayed on 
their computer screens. <p>

<em>Interoperation</em>.  The most important accomplishment of V0 
is that it will link the EOSDIS Data Centers together and provide 
interoperability among them to give users an Earth science view 
across the DAACs for searching and ordering data. As a prototype, it 
will not have all the capabilities, fault tolerance, or reliability of later 
versions; however, it will support use by the scientific community in 
day-to-day research activities.<p>

<strong>NASA GCDIS Components Available April 1, 1996</strong><p>

EOSDIS Version 1 (V1) will be implemented in steps during 1995-
1997. It will be designed and developed while V0 is operating, thus 
benefiting from V0 user feedback.<p>

<em>Content increases</em>.  ADEOS NSCAT data will be available for 
distribution from the JPL DAAC. Other data sets will be available 
from the DAACs based on input from their respective user working 
groups. In addition, preparations will be made for processing Clouds 
and Earth's Radiant Energy System and Lightning Imaging Sensor 
data from TRMM (launched in 1997), archiving and distributing 
TRMM data, and information management for Landsat-7 (launched in 
1998) data.<p>

<em>Service improvements (access mechanisms)</em>.  Version 1 
will be physically distributed, but the system will appear completely 
integrated to users and will provide the complete set of capabilities 
needed for EOS science and mission operations. Version V1 will be 
interoperable with version V0.<p>

<em>Interoperation</em>.  The capabilities of version V1 will 
progressively replace (after a period of parallel operations) the V0 
system to provide a smooth transition to enhances services.<p>

The level of NASA's contribution to GCDIS is indicated in the 
following table. This table indicates when EOSDIS will have access 
capabilities analogous to those described for the GCDIS. Although 
NASA will provide archive functionality through the EOSDIS as noted 
in the table, NASA has concluded agreements with NOAA and the 
USGS for long-term archiving of NASA Earth science data.<p>

Capabilities currently and for 1994-1995 are being developed within 
EOSDIS Version 0 (available July 1994). Capabilities in 1996-2000 
will be provided by the EOSDIS Versions 1 and 2, built around the 
EOSDIS Core System (catalog functions available 1996, complete in 
1997) and DAAC-unique extensions.

<h2><a name=NSF>National Science Foundation</a></h2>

<strong>Summary</strong><p>

The NSF sponsors a large and diverse research community that both 
uses and produces global change data and information. Although the 
NSF has no formal responsibilities for archiving and distributing data 
and information, it supports a major facility for meteorological, 
oceanographic, and climatology data sets at NCAR. By and large, 
however, NSF-supported scientists rely on other Federal agencies for 
much of their data and information needs and, when appropriate, for 
archiving and disseminating the research products they produce.<p>

The NSF expects its supported investigators to share with other 
researchers, at no more than incremental cost and within a 
reasonable time, the data, samples, physical collections, and other 
supporting materials created or gathered in the course of the 
research project. Presently, the enforcement of this requirement 
varies considerably across the agency. For example, social and 
behavioral data sets are deposited in an archive for distribution 
within a year after the completion of a grant. Other discipline 
divisions at the NSF have no formal policies. The NSF will implement, 
in collaboration with other GCDIS agencies, a process by which 
important global change data sets produced with NSF support will be 
archived, managed, and disseminated for broad community use. 
Deciding which products are appropriate for this treatment and how 
the activity will be funded will involve a multilateral process among 
the research principal investigators, the sponsoring agency program 
manger, and the appropriate data center and its sponsoring agency. 
A general rule of thumb for funding responsibility is that the agency 
program manager should support those activities that are required 
for the research project itself, and the data center should support 
those that are required to serve the broader community needs.<p>

<strong>NSF GCDIS Capabilities Available on April 1, 1994</strong><p>

<em>The National Center for Atmospheric Research</em>.  The NCAR 
Data Support Section (DSS) maintains an archive of more than 400 
data sets. Collectively, this archive is designed to support the wide 
variety of atmospheric and oceanic research at NCAR and within the 
university community. The complete archive is available to 
approximately 400 NCAR and 650 university personnel who use the 
NCAR computing facilities. Access to the data sets is also extended 
U.S. Government agencies, the private research sector, and research 
groups worldwide by distribution on various media and across 
networks.<p>

The archive is roughly divided into the categories of atmospheric 
analyses and observations, oceanic analyses and observations, model 
output, satellite data, and supporting geophysical data sets. The NCAR 
archive is best known for data sets in the atmospheric and oceanic 
categories. Groups at NCAR develop some data sets, but a majority 
are contributed from outside NCAR. Often, the contributed data sets 
require considerable processing and enhancement to make them 
useful for large and small computing tasks. Furthermore, the DSS is 
responsible for preserving the archive, providing access, and 
redistributing the data sets when needed.<p>

The efficient mass storage system and the connected computing 
systems provide the DSS with the capability to routinely manipulate 
large amounts of data. This data facility contributes important data 
support for research projects at NCAR and throughout the research 
community. For example, NCAR prepares data for Global Atmospheric 
Reanalysis, the Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set is 
produced in cooperation with NOAA, and output from climate models 
is collected and distributed worldwide for assessment studies. 
Continued work on these and many other large data manipulation 
efforts will be a primary focus for the DSS in years to come.<p>

Access to information about data sets and data itself is available 
through published documents, the DSS support staff, and information 
systems connected to the Internet. Since 1992, persons with Internet 
connectivity have been able to access and browse an online data 
information system at NCAR. This system (using ftp and a simple 
directory structure), while very successful, has been enhanced to also 
support World Wide Web information searches through the National 
Center for Supercomputing Applications Mosaic interface. Mosaic 
supports several common GUIs for browsing hypertext and simple 
text files. During 1993 users connected to the system about 2,800 
times each month, obtaining about 7,000 files each month. From the 
files copied, about 2,200 are directly related to specific information 
and documentation about data sets within the archive. The 
combination of the simple ftp and GUI systems for viewing 
information about NCAR's data holdings will continue to be 
developed in the future.<p>

Not only does NCAR provide data support and distribution on a per 
request basis, but it has also begun a project to produce CD-ROMs for 
mass distribution. The data to be placed on the CD-ROMs will first be 
selected from the atmospheric analyses and observations categories. 
One CD-ROM was completed last year, several are in the planning 
phase for completion this year, and others will follow in later years. 
Presently, NCAR has several data sets that need to be distributed, but 
are too large for CD-ROMs or the existing network communications. 
NCAR intends to distribute these data on existing and new low-cost 
media as they are developed.<p>

The NCAR archives are diverse in type and sometimes large in 
volume; so far, the data support focus has been on data content, data 
information, and easy user data access. NCAR will remain committed 
to these principles.<p>

Access to data and information about data at NCAR will increase as 
the aforementioned projects progress. More data will be available on 
CD-ROMs, and growth of the Internet-accessible information system 
will continue to take advantage of the most practical and publicly 
available information distribution tools. Many of the NCAR data sets 
are presently described in the GCMD. The NCAR will continue to 
provide information to the directory, as well as support automatic 
connection to the NCAR data information system. Basic descriptions 
of all data sets are electronically available now. This information 
resource will be strengthened as the descriptions are enhanced and 
more inventories and browse data are made available. This system 
will meet the level four contribution criteria for GCDIS directory, 
guide, and inventory functionality.<p>

<em>The Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social 
Research</em>.  The NSF does not directly administer an archive of 
data relevant to the human dimensions of global change. However, 
the NSF has contributed to the support of the primary such archive 
in the United States - the Inter-University Consortium for Political 
and Social Research (ICPSR), based at the University of Michigan. The 
ICPSR was established in 1962, and is funded primarily from fees 
paid by more than 370 member academic institutions in more than 
two dozen countries. Most social and behavioral science data sets 
collected on the basis of NSF grants are deposited in the ICPSR within 
a year after the completion of the grant. <p>

The bulk of data sets archived in the ICPSR consists of survey data 
on individual attitudes and behavior collected by scholars. The 
archive also contains U.S. census data and surveys on population, 
health, labor, income, and other conditions collected by Government 
agencies, international organizations, and other research institutions. 
The ICPSR has been working with the CIESIN to identify those data 
sets in the archive that would be of interest to global change 
researchers in order to make those available through the GCDIS. 
Negotiations with the CIESIN, with providers of data, and with the 
ICPSR member institutions have to be completed before it will be 
clear what the extent and exact form of ICPSR participation in the 
GCDIS will take. However, it is anticipated that by mid-1994 a 
substantial portion of the data archived at the ICPSR relevant to 
global change research will be available through the GCDIS.<p>

Modes of access to the ICPSR have been in transition for the last 
several years. Traditionally, users could scan a list of holdings and 
order data sets on magnetic tape accompanied by hard-copy 
codebooks. In recent years, the ICPSR has made an increasing 
number of data sets available in alternative formats - on disk, CD-
ROM, or by ftp transmission. Initially, the available format of the 
data the ICPSR prepares for access through the GCDIS will depend on 
the current state of the particular data set in the general ICPSR 
archive. The ICPSR is working with both the CIESIN and the National 
Center for Supercomputer Applications (NCSA) to develop a high 
level of online access to ICPSR data sets through the MOSAIC 
interface being developed by NCSA. By the end of 1994, the ICPSR 
plans to have one large survey available as an experiment within 
this environment. Completion of the transition to this level of access 
for other data sets in the ICPSR archive will require a number of 
years and substantial funding.<p>

<strong>NSF GCDIS Data Available by 1995-96</strong><p>

<em>National Center for Atmospheric Research</em>.  As the 
transmission capacity of networks increases, larger amounts of data 
will be directly transferred to and from NCAR. Accompanying the 
growth of network capability will be the development of network 
tools that efficiently search for data, browse data, and examine and 
display information files. The resident NCAR data information system 
will remain flexible and capable of adapting to the new network 
features and, in doing so, will meet the higher levels of 
interoperability and connectivity required for the GCDIS.<p>

Since NCAR has long been a data provider to the university 
community and worldwide, it presently offers level-3 and -2 GCDIS 
data order and distribution functionality, respectively. As more 
specific GCDIS guidelines are defined, NCAR will make procedural 
adjustments to accommodate these standards as considered 
appropriate.<p>

<em>The Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social 
Research</em>.  For 1995-96, work can be expected to continue both 
on making an increasing number of the relevant ICPSR data sets 
available through the GCDIS and on upgrading the access levels to 
those data sets that are already available.<p>

<em>The Long-Term Ecological Research Program</em>.  Centralized 
and local (i.e., project level) data management activities of NSF's LTER 
currently meet or exceed the GCDIS minimum requirements. 
Although the LTER is not formally a USGCRP-supported activity, it 
does serve as a good example of the direction and intent of the NSF 
with regard to broad accessibility of major ecological data sets. At 
this time, openly accessible LTER data sets include mostly physical 
environmental data, but there are plans for broader incorporation of 
primary biological and ecological data as well.

<h2><a name=USDA>U.S. Department of Agriculture</a></h2>

<strong>Summary</strong><p>

The USDA plays an important dual role in global change research and 
other programs related to the environment and natural resources. 
USDA agencies support agriculture, forestry, and ranching programs 
that ensure a continued and healthy food supply for the Nation and 
our trading partners throughout the world. At the same time, the 
USDA has a vital interest in and has responsibilities for the 
protection of the land to preserve it for future generations.<p>

In carrying out its various missions, the USDA conducts research to 
better sustain agriculture and forestry in the United States and to 
provide technical assistance in managing private and public lands. 
Agriculture, forest, and grazing management are affected by 
weather, climate, and other environmental variables. USDA's global 
change research program focuses on understanding how global 
change factors affect U.S. and international forest, pastoral, and 
agricultural ecosystems, and how these ecosystems affect the 
environmental variables that contribute to global change.<p>

USDA agencies maintain various centers of data and information that 
have been developed to support the mission programs of each 
agency. These programs include the areas of ecological systems and 
dynamics, biochemical dynamics, climate and hydrological systems, 
and human interactions with land use. The USDA is in a unique 
position of having substantial long-term data and information 
relevant to global change and terrestrial ecosystems. The vast 
majority of USDA data and information of significant value to global 
change research were collected to support other agricultural 
programs, however, and do not carry an easily identified global 
change label. An intensive effort will be required to capture and 
incorporate these data and information into the global change 
research program.<p>

At present, the USDA has no plans to develop a centralized data 
center to maintain or archive global change data and information. 
The emphasis will be on providing standards for collecting and 
managing data - while leaving data with the collecting agencies - and 
on coordination to promote effective access to these valuable 
information resources. The goal is to maintain distributed data that 
will appear fully integrated to the user.<p>

<strong>USDA GCDIS Components Available by April 1, 
1994</strong><p>

The incorporation of USDA data and information holdings into the 
GCDIS will evolve during the coming years. Resources must be 
allocated to identify and describe priority data holdings and perform 
any modifications to these holdings to enhance the total knowledge 
base upon which policymakers and others must make critical 
decisions regarding land use, agriculture, and forestry issues. 
The National Agricultural Library (NAL) has played a major role in 
identifying, cataloging, and providing access to worldwide published 
information related to global change issues. The NAL provides a 
continuing and expanding focal point for identifying and finding 
desired data and information.<p>

The Current Research Information System is available through the 
Internet and commercial information distribution systems. This 
system provides information on the status of research projects 
funded by the Cooperative State Research Service of the USDA. The 
USDA has initiated several new projects to support the need to make 
global-change-related data and information readily available to its 
various user communities. A key first step is the collection of 
metadata describing the data sets and other information products 
held at various locations throughout the country. This inventory 
includes special information required to define spatial data and 
models and the particular data sets required for operation of the 
models. Data bases inventoried are being categorized as weather data 
(e.g., temperature, precipitation), atmospheric data (trace gases, 
deposition), soils data, forest data, plant and vegetation data, animal 
data, pest data, hydrologic data, economic data, and more.<p>

A second follow-on project is the implementation of an automated 
locator and directory system to house the inventory metadata. This 
system will be interoperable with the GCMD and other servers, such 
as the WAIS servers installed at other Federal locations. This locator 
is not expected to be operational before April 1994.<p>

The USDA has installed a department-wide Internet node for access 
by all of its agencies to Internet resources. This will supplement or 
replace several agency Internet connections now in place and will 
provide outside access to the USDA global change locator and 
directory.<p>

A project is underway to identify and bring attention to important 
data sets and information that are at risk of being lost, either 
because of the poor quality of the storage media or the loss of 
knowledge of the data due to lack of appropriate documentation or 
the unavailability of the principal investigator who understood the 
data. This is a long-term effort, which is expected to result in the 
development of new policies and a changed culture to prevent this 
type of loss from seriously degrading future archiving efforts.<p>

Snow, precipitation, air temperature, other climate parameters, and 
soil moisture and temperature are collected by the Soil Conservation 
Service (SCS) and automated under a global change pilot project. This 
Snow Telemetry System is enhanced through manual surveys to 
provide water supply forecasting capability. These data sets are 
easily accessible to the public through the SCS Centralized Forecasting 
System maintained at the Climate Data Access Facility at Portland, 
Oregon. This historical data set, largely of the western United States, 
is updated annually.<p>

The USDA maintains several other important centers of data that 
currently are not readily accessible to the public. These include 
several maintained by the SCS. The National Cartography and 
Geographic Information Systems Center in Fort Worth, Texas, 
contains cartographic data bases, maps, selected digitized hydrologic 
units, soils geographic data, and orthophotography. The Iowa State 
University maintains the soils tabular data as well as the National 
Resources Inventory, which includes soil characteristics, land cover 
and use, erosion, land treatment needs, vegetative condition, and 
potential for cropland conversion. The plants data base is maintained 
at Fort Collins, Colorado, and various other national data sets are 
maintained at Washington, D.C.<p>

Access to these data sets by researchers or others is only by request. 
Significant efforts are planned to improve access, but major 
resources to make this possible will be required.<p>

Aerial photography maps are available through the USDA ASCS 
Aerial Photography Field Office in Salt Lake City. These photographs 
are used for conservation practices, locating field boundaries, tax 
assessment, urban development, pollution studies, and watershed 
studies. Maps of all National Forests and National Grasslands are 
available on paper from the USDA Forest Service in Salt Lake City.
The USDA is coordinating an interagency effort to define and develop 
a thesaurus for global change research data and information. The 
pilot system uses text imaging and retrieval software that provides 
word meanings and relationships derived from dictionaries and 
thesauruses. The pilot system will allow easy access and record 
accuracy to global change data and information through the Internet 
using the Z39.50 standard for information search and retrieval.<p>

<strong>USDA GCDIS Components Added by April 1, 1995.</strong><p>

The inventory and locator effort will continue as more data sets 
become available. The locator will be accessible through networks to 
any member of the public. The contents will be enhanced and the 
capabilities for better understanding of the specific data sets will be 
improved. Knowledge of the data is only the beginning step, 
however. Many of these data sets will need to be relocated or 
formatted to allow easy online access. This will be an evolving 
process, and progress will be based on priorities and available 
resources.<p>

Data standards relating to such aspects as collection techniques, 
automation approach, and element definitions and naming 
conventions represent a critical parallel effort to those described. 
Several projects are in their initial stages and are progressing more 
slowly than desired because of limited resources. Some are being 
done in conjunction with other organizations such as the FGDC, and 
many involve State and local government cooperative projects.<p>

Specific data holdings to be made available and access mechanisms to 
be used cannot be defined at this time.<p>

<h2>U.S. Country Studies Program</h2><hr>

<center><dl><dt><strong>ANNOUNCEMENT 
<dt>AND CALL FOR PAPERS<p>

<dt>Eastern European Regional Workshop on Greenhouse Gas Emission 
Inventories</strong><p>

<dt>May 8-11, 1995
<dt>Thermal Hotel
<dt>Budapest, Hungary</dl></center><p>

The Eastern European Regional Workshop on Greenhouse Gas 
Emission Inventories is sponsored by the U.S. Country Studies 
Program (USCSP) and hosted by the Hungarian Ministry for 
Environment and Regional Policy and the Hungarian Electrotechnical 
Association Systemexpert Consulting Ltd.  It is one of a series of 
workshops organized by the USCSP to support countries in the 
development of greenhouse gas emission inventories, as required by 
the Framework Convention on Climate Change.  The workshops 
provide an international forum for the exchange of information 
among representatives of countries undertaking climate change 
country studies, researchers and experts on greenhouse gas 
emissions, and policy makers.<p>

The Eastern European Workshop, to be held in Hungary on May 8-11, 
1995, will focus on greenhouse gas emission inventories for Central 
and Eastern European countries and the Newly Independent 
Countries of the former Soviet Union.  Participants will have an 
opportunity to present results of their inventory work and to discuss 
issues related to greenhouse gas estimation methodologies.  
Presentations on both methodological issues and results of national 
assessments will be organized into five sectors: fossil fuel combustion 
for energy; energy production, transmission, and distribution; 
industrial processes, wastes, and solvents; agriculture; and forestry 
and land-use change.  Additional presentations by countries outside 
of the region, which have already completed their emission 
inventories, are included on the agenda and will serve as points of 
comparison.  Special workshop sessions will be devoted to such topics 
as reconciling national data systems with international data systems, 
coordinating CORINAIR and IPCC/OECD reporting conventions, and 
regional and interregional cooperation.  Several working groups will 
be set up to develop practical recommendations on major issues 
discussed at the workshop.

<h3>Conference Publications:</h3>

Papers presented at the workshop and summaries of working group 
sessions will be professionally published in a Workshop Proceedings.  
The proceedings will be hardbound and widely circulated to the 
international climate change community.  All papers will be subject 
to peer review at the workshop before inclusion in the Proceedings.  
Experts interested in submitting a paper should send an abstract to 
Alexei Sankovski by April 7.

<h3>Workshop Goals</h3>

<ul><li>Promote the exchange of information on participants' experience in 
preparing inventories and provide a forum for constructive 
discussion of available methodologies among country researchers and 
international experts.<p>

<li>Further the development of consensus on methods for improving the 
quality of input data and emission estimates.<p>

<li>Identify and discuss possible options for cooperation and 
coordination among countries and institutions involved in climate 
change studies in Eastern Europe.</ul><p>

The African Regional Workshop on Greenhouse Gas Emission 
Inventories and Emission Mitigation Options is cosponsored by the 
U.S. Country Studies Program (USCSP) and the United Nations 
Environment Program (UNEP).  It is one of a series of workshops 
organized by USCSP to support countries in the development of 
greenhouse gas emission inventories and the evaluation of measures 
for responding to climate change, as required by the Framework 
Convention on Climate Change.  The workshops will provide an 
international forum for the exchange of information among 
representatives of countries undertaking climate change country 
studies, researchers and experts on greenhouse gas emissions and 
mitigation measures, and policy makers.  Participants will share and 
discuss the results of their work on national inventory preparation 
and mitigation assessment, and will have the opportunity to receive 
further guidance on these topics.<p>

This workshop, to be held in South Africa on May 29 to June 2, 1995, 
will focus on the development of emission inventories for the 
forestry, land-use change, and agriculture sectors in Africa.  There 
will also be presentations and discussions on options for reducing net 
emissions of greenhouse gases in these sectors.  These inventory and 
mitigation sessions will address both methodological issues and the 
results of national assessments.  Technical presentations will discuss 
data collection and emission factor determination for the relevant 
sectors: forestry and land-use change; vegetation burning; and 
livestock digestion and manure management.  Working group 
sessions will be held in order to facilitate discussion of methods and 
their application.  In addition, there will be sessions addressing 
regional cooperation and donor programs.<p>

<h3>Conference Publications</h3>

Papers presented at the workshop and summaries of working group 
sessions will be published in a Workshop Proceedings.  The 
Proceedings will be hardbound and widely circulated to the 
international climate change community.  All papers will be subject 
to peer review at the workshop before inclusion in the Proceedings.  
Experts interested in submitting a paper should send an abstract to 
Barbara Braatz by April 7.

<h3>Workshop Goals</h3>

<ul><li>Promote the exchange of information on participants' 
experience in preparing inventories and assessing mitigation options, 
and provide a forum for constructive discussion of available 
methodologies.

<li>Further the development of consensus among country researchers 
and international experts on emission estimation and mitigation 
assessment methods suitable for African countries.

<li>Clearly identify priority needs for support from potential donors 
in testing and using the methodologies.

<li>Identify and discuss possible options for mitigating emissions of 
greenhouse gases from non-energy sources in Africa.

<li>Promote cooperation and coordination among participants and 
institutions involved in climate change studies in Africa.</ul>
