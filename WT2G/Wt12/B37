<title>CSP Interim Report - Foreward</title></head>
<body>

<h2><p align=center>FOREWORD</h2>

This report contains papers from fourteen countries and a Central 
American organization representing seven countries in a regional 
study. The participating countries have all signed the <a 
href=http://www.unep.ch/iucc/conv-e.html>United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)</a>.<p>

The Convention's commitments for all Parties include to develop, 
periodically update, publish and make available to the Conference of 
the Parties, national inventories of anthropogenic emissions by 
sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases (GHG), using 
comparable methodologies. The Convention also commits parties to 
formulate, and implement national programs containing measures to 
mitigate climate change and to help developing countries particularly 
vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change.<p>

The papers in this report describe these countries' efforts to address 
their commitments by preparing inventories of GHG emissions, 
evaluating mitigation options, and assessing climate change 
vulnerability and adaptation strategies. These assessments have 
been conducted within the framework of the U.S. Country Studies 
Program and the Global Environmental Fund/United Nations 
Environmental Programme (GEF/UNEP) Case Studies.<p>

The Convention commits all developed country Parties to take all 
practicable steps to promote, facilitate and finance the transfer of, or 
access to, environmentally sound technologies and know-how to 
developing country Parties, and to provide new and additional 
financial resources needed by developing countries in complying 
with their obligations.<p>

We believe that the U.S. Country Study Program is helping the 
participating countries in complying with the commitments of the 
UNFCCC. Even though the established time for developing countries to 
fulfill their commitments is within three years from the entry of 
force of the Convention, the current studies give countries a chance 
to validate initial data and conduct additional research on national or 
regional emission factors and on mitigation and adaptation measures 
to submit an improved communication by the deadline. The training 
of experts at technical workshops and through continuous technical 
assistance has helped to improve the understanding of the scientific 
base of climate change issues and to strengthen endogenous 
capacity.<p>

The U.S. Country Studies Program and similar programs supported by 
other donors have proven to be of paramount importance in helping 
the participating countries to outline their national plans to mitigate 
or reduce GHG emissions and also to develop measures to adapt to 
the impacts of climate change. Preparation of these national plans 
must be accompanied by education of the people and dissemination 
of country study results as the only effective way to solve the 
important problem of climate change.<p>

<title>CSP Interim Report - Executive Summary</title></head>
<body>

<h2><p align=center>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h2>

This report documents significant achievements made by 21 of the 
55 countries that are conducting climate change country studies with 
support from the U.S. Country Studies Program. Some of the work 
reported by these countries was also supported by other donors. The 
papers from these countries discuss methods and results for 
inventories of sources and sinks of greenhouse gases, assessments of 
climate change vulnerability and adaptive responses, and evaluations 
of mitigation options to reduce net emissions of greenhouse gases. In 
several cases, the papers discuss the preparation of national 
communications and public education and outreach activities. The 
following countries contributed papers for this report:<p>
<pre>
Bolivia	Malawi
China	Mexico
Czech Republic	Mongolia
Egypt	Peru
Estonia	Uruguay
Ethiopia	Venezuela
Kazakhstan	Zimbabwe</pre>
Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and 
Panama are working together on a Central American regional 
study.<p>

Key findings and conclusions related to climate change policy, 
science, and capacity building include:

<h3><p align=center>POLICY</h3>
<ul>
<li>Many developing countries and countries with economies in 
transition have made significant progress with their studies. These 
studies are helping countries address their commitments under the 
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) 
and increasing support for the UNFCCC.<p> 

<li>Programs to support climate change country studies by various 
bilateral and multilateral donors are helping to fulfill the UNFCCC's 
mandate for the provision of financial and technical assistance from 
developed country parties to developing country parties. By 1996, 
the U.S. Country Studies Program will have helped 55 countries 
complete country studies that address their obligations under the 
UNFCCC.<p>

<li>In many countries, the results of their studies are laying the 
foundation for the development of national action plans and national 
communications required under the UNFCCC. Developing countries 
and countries with economies in transition are considering a wide 
range of mitigation and adaptation measures for inclusion in their 
national plans.</ul>
 
<h3><p align=center>SCIENCE</h3>
<ul>
<li>The country studies completed by developing countries and 
countries with economies in transition are making important 
contributions to the state of scientific knowledge and global 
understanding of climate change issues.<p>

<li>The experiences of the countries conducting country studies 
have contributed to the development of commonly accepted, 
transparent methodologies. Countries have tested the IPCC Draft 
Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (IPCC, 1994) and 
are helping to identify possible improvements to these guidelines. In 
addition, the studies are helping to develop common methods and 
guidelines for vulnerability and adaptation assessments and 
mitigation assessments. For instance, the countries participating in 
the U.S. Country Study Program are applying common vulnerability 
and adaptation and mitigation assessment methods and have helped 
prepare methodological handbooks for the program. These guidelines 
are in turn helping to lay the foundation for handbooks in 
preparation by the IPCC.<p>

<li>For many developing countries and countries with economies in 
transition, climate change could have dramatic impacts on their 
economies and natural systems, with the potential in some cases for 
rapid deterioration of the livelihood of citizens and irreversible 
damage to ecosystems. Coastal, agricultural, water, and forest 
resources, as well as biodiversity, are among the most vulnerable 
systems. The risks of such damage can be reduced through the 
adoption of anticipatory adaptation measures that are flexible and 
will help deal both with current climate variability and the potential 
impacts of climate change.<p>

<li>In many developing countries and countries with economies in 
transition, measures are available for reducing net emissions of 
greenhouse gases at little or no cost. Some countries have already 
made significant progress in implementing such measures and 
reducing their projected net emissions. For instance, the Czech 
Republic has already implemented a series of legislative and 
normative measures to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions.  In 
some cases, financial, technical, and institutional barriers must be 
overcome before such mitigation measures can be effectively 
implemented.</ul>

<h3><p align=center>HUMAN AND INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY 
BUILDING</h3>
<ul>
<li>Building and maintaining human and institutional capacity to 
address climate change issues is an essential ingredient for successful 
completion of country studies and strengthening support for the 
UNFCCC. Effective studies by developing countries and countries with 
economies in transition have established strong counterpart 
relationships between large teams of national and international 
experts. Building from these working relationships, effective 
technical cooperation and technology transfer is achieved through 
"hands-on" training activities, transfer of assessment tools, 
workshops for countries to share experiences, and ongoing technical 
cooperation during the lifetime of the study. In the case of the U.S. 
Country Studies Program, large teams of researchers in each country 
are receiving training and technical support for the application of up 
to 30 different analytical tools and methodologies.<p>

<li>Effective capacity building also requires countries to involve a 
variety of governmental and non-governmental institutions in the 
implementation of the study. The studies discussed in this report are 
implemented by teams of officials and analysts from a variety of 
governmental and non-governmental institutions operating under 
the direction of inter-governmental steering committees. These 
steering committees have responsibility for the formulation and 
implementation of climate change policies.<p>

<li>Educating the public and governmental officials about climate 
change issues is critical to developing and maintaining support for 
climate change issues. Such educational and outreach activities 
should be designed to be ongoing processes that are integrated with 
other current outreach activities.

<title>CSP Interim Report - Introduction</title></head>
<body>

<h2><p align=center>INTRODUCTION</h2>

The papers presented in this report describe interim results and 
future activities of climate change country studies supported by the 
U.S. Government. In a few cases work supported by other donors is 
also reported here. The report contains papers prepared by fourteen 
countries and a Central American organization representing seven 
countries in a regional study. The information presented here covers 
preliminary work carried out by the countries and has not 
necessarily been endorsed either by the respective Governments or 
the U.S. Government.<p>

The Framework Convention on Climate Change, which has been 
signed by more than 150 governments worldwide, calls on parties to 
the Convention to inventory national sources and sinks of greenhouse 
gases (GHG) and to develop plans for responding to climate change. 
To assist developing countries and countries with economies in 
transition to meet this obligation, the U.S. Government has committed 
$30 million to support climate change country studies. Technical and 
financial support to countries is provided through the U.S. Country 
Studies Program.<p>

The U.S. Country Studies Program has sponsored two rounds of 
studies. In October 1993, studies with 26 countries were initiated 
and in October 1994, studies with an additional 29 countries began. 
Most of the studies have a two year duration. The countries 
submitting papers in time for inclusion in this interim report include 
countries that are participating in both rounds of the Program.<p>

The goals of the U.S. Country Studies Program are to:<p>

<ul>
<li>Enhance the capabilities of countries and/or regions to 
inventory their net emissions of greenhouse gases, assess their 
vulnerabilities to climate change, and evaluate the options available 
to them to mitigate and adapt to climate change;<p>

<li>Support countries' efforts to establish a process for developing 
and implementing national policies and measures to deal with 
climate change over time; and<p>

<li>Develop data and information that can be used at the national, 
regional, and global levels; assess current and future trends in net 
anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases; and further national 
and international discussions of climate change issues.</ul><p>

Most of the studies that are being supported under this program 
include three primary elements:<p>

<ul>
<li>An inventory of sources and sinks of greenhouse gases;<p>

<li>An assessment of vulnerabilities to the impacts of climate 
change and an evaluation of options to adapt to these potential 
impacts; and<p>

<li>An evaluation of options to mitigate net emissions of 
greenhouse gases.  Some studies also include public education and 
outreach activities and plans for developing national measures and 
strategies.</ul><p>

The Program has established extensive technical cooperation and 
technology transfer between country researchers and international 
experts. Technical support that is provided to the countries includes 
the provision of guidance materials and analytical tools, sponsorship 
of training workshops, site visits and ongoing guidance from 
technical experts, and assistance in interpreting and presenting 
results. The Program works in close cooperation with other countries 
and international organizations in the design and implementation of 
technical and financial support activities.<p>

At the request of the participating countries, special attention is 
being given to the preparation of synthesis documents where 
countries can report their methodologies and results. Such activities 
are considered vital to the success of this cooperative effort. This 
report is the first of many synthesis publications that the Program 
will issue.

<h1>Bolivia: A Methodology for Emissions Inventory and 
Vulnerability and Adaptation Assessment</h1>
</head>
<body>


<h3>Bolivia Country Study Project Team</h3>

SUMMARY: The present work represents Bolivia's first effort under 
its country study that is being carried out with the assistance of the 
U.S. Country Studies Program. Its main objectives are to establish an 
inventory of greenhouse gases (GHG) produced in the energy and 
nonenergy sectors (i.e., agriculture, biomass burning, deforestation, 
waste waters, and sanitary landfills). The study also evaluates the 
vulnerability and adaptability of the most significant national sectors 
exposed to climate change, and, finally, establishes the most 
appropriate means of mitigation (i.e., emission reduction) for Bolivia.

<p>This document presents an introduction to the inventory task that 
will be developed in Bolivia, as well as the methodologies established 
for carrying out an inventory of GHG and a vulnerability and 
adaptation analysis. Preliminary results on the inventory of 
emissions are also presented.
<p>
<p>
<H2 align=center>INTRODUCTION</H2>

The GHG inventory includes gases with direct greenhouse effects 
(CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O) as well as indirect 
effects (NO<sub>X</sub>, CO, NMVOC). The estimation of emissions 
was carried out according to the <em>Guidelines for National 
Greenhouse Gas Inventories </em>(IPCC 1994) and constitutes a first 
approximation that will be refined and brought to a conclusion 
during the period 1995-1996 as the Country Study is carried out.

<p>The vulnerability and adaptation (V&A) analysis presents the 
objectives agreed upon, the methodologies to be utilized, a 
description of the basic scenarios to be considered, and the 
simulation models to be applied.

<p>The Ministry of Sustainable Development and the Environment 
was created by means of Supreme Decree in 1993 with the objective 
of strengthening environmental management in Bolivia.

<p>The Framework Convention on Climate Change was ratified by the 
Government of Bolivia in July 1994 in accordance with the position it 
had adopted at the Earth Summit held in Rio de Janeiro in June 1992.

<p>In August 1994, the Ministry of Sustainable Development, acting 
through the National Bureau of Natural Resources and the 
Environment, signed a Technical Assistance agreement with the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), acting through the U.S. 
Country Studies Program, to carry out an "Inventory of GHG 
Emissions and their Impact on Ecosystems" study with the following 
objectives:

<ul><li>Inventory of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions of anthropogenic 
origin

<li>Estimation of the vulnerability of susceptible sectors

<li>Evaluation of technical options for adaptation

<li>Evaluation of methodologies and options of mitigation techniques

<li>Identification of actions and strategies and definition of activities 
including options for the implementation of policies and 
measures</ul>

<p>The organizational structure of the project will have three basic 
levels: decisionmaking under the Ministry of Sustainable 
Development and the Environment; operational control, through the 
Coordination of the Climate Change Program; and support, with 
instances of coordination among State, academic, and private sector 
institutions.

<h3>Principal Characteristics of Bolivia</h3>

Bolivia is situated in the mid-west of the South American continent, 
between parallels 9&#176 38' and 22&#176 53' South Latitude and 
between meridians 57&#176 25' and 69&#176 38' West Longitude. 
It is bordered by Brazil, Peru, Chile, Argentina and Paraguay. It has 
no access to the sea. The country is divided into <em>Altiplano 
</em>(high plateau), valleys, and lowland plains. The altitude varies 
from 4,000 m above sea level in the high plains to 400 m in the 
lowlands, with valleys varying in altitude from 1,000 to 2,000 m

<p>The Andes mountains reach 6,000 to 7,000 m above sea level. 
Such great ranges in altitude involve a variety of climates. The 
lowland plains have a tropical climate, the valleys a moderate 
subtropical climate, and the <em>Altiplano </em>has a moderately 
cold climate with the higher peaks covered by eternal snow.

<p>Bolivia has a rich biodiversity. The existence of a large number of 
species may be cited: 250 classes of reptiles, 190 amphibious species, 
more than 200 species of fish, and some 20,000 species of plants.

<p>Bolivia has an area of 1.09 million sq. km., inhabited by a 
population of 6.4 million (according to the 1992 census), with a low 
population density of 5.8 persons/km<sup>2</sup>.

<H2 align=center>METHODS</H2>

<h3>Inventory Greenhouse Gas Emissions</h3>
<strong><em>Introduction</em></strong><br>

Since the 1980s, agricultural activity in Bolivia has had significant 
increases due to the expansion and intensification of crop 
productivity.

<p>Utilization of energy for domestic purposes, transportation, and 
industry, is a significant source of greenhouse gases. Also, urban 
wastes, with inadequate systems for the final disposal of waste and 
inadequate sanitation infrastructure, contribute to the generation of 
greenhouse gases from human wastes.

<p>Forests cover 51.4 percent of the 1,098,000 sq. km. of Bolivian 
territory. Humid tropical and subtropical forests account for 
approximately 37 percent. Temperate and xerophytic woodlands 
cover 14.4 percent. In recent years tropical and subtropical forests 
have been subjected to a greater incidence of deforestation in a 
process that varies in intensity in the different regions (human 
intervention, clear cutting, livestock raising and colonization). The 
Bolivian Amazon region, furthermore, contains an area of 162,000 sq. 
km. of pasture land that are burned over during the dry season for 
various reasons.

<p><strong><em>Objectives</em></strong><br>

The study has established the following objectives for the emission 
inventory:
<ul><li>Implement an inventory of greenhouse gas emissions of 
anthropogenic origin for the various human activities related to 
agriculture and livestock raising, industry, energy and human 
wastes.

<li>To quantify greenhouse gas emissions originating in deforestation 
and biomass burning.

<li>Determine the appropriateness of the different methodologies and 
indices generated for the inventory of greenhouse gases for the 
various sectors.

<li>Establish estimates of greenhouse gas emissions by sector.</ul>

<p><strong><em>Methodologies</em></strong><br>

For the estimation of greenhouse gases from the burning of forests 
and pasture land, a selection will be made of coefficients of emissions 
in accordance with the methodologies available, estimating the types 
of gases that are generated by deforestation and the burning of 
pasture land under the conditions in Bolivia. The methodologies 
proposed by the IPCC will be utilized in their entirety, with some 
factors of emission being adjusted to allow for the effects of altitude 
and pressure. For agriculture and livestock, CH<sub>4</sub> emissions 
will be estimated for the fermentation of animal excrement and the 
decomposition process in flooded areas, and production of 
CO<sub>2</sub> will be estimated due to biomass burning. Estimates 
will be made for the overall emissions of CH<sub>4</sub>, 
CO<sub>2</sub>, and N<sub>2</sub>O due to different energy uses, 
industrial activities, and such urban activities as sanitary landfills 
and anaerobic sewage treatment facilities.

<p><strong><em>Preliminary Greenhouse Gases Emissions 
Results</em></strong><br>

A preliminary evaluation of the greenhouse gases inventory was 
attempted, using the limited information available at the present 
moment for the energy and agriculture sectors. Information is not 
yet available on changes in land use, forestry, solvents, and the 
utilization of other products, such as wastes (solid residues, waste 
waters, incineration). Such inventory activities will be carried out in 
the near future.

<p>
<a href= "gifs/BolTable1.gif">Table 1</a> presents a preliminary 
inventory. The purpose of this preliminary inventory is to indicate 
the contribution of the various activities with respect to the 
greenhouse effect.

<p>The inventory includes gases with direct effects (CO<sub>2</sub>, 
CH<sub>4</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O) as well as indirect effects 
(NO<sub>X,</sub> CO, NMVOC). The calculation of emissions was 
carried out using emission factors from the IPCC guidelines and 
documents of national activities. Possible future evolution of 
emissions is indicated by +/0/- (increase/stable/decrease). Fuels 
originating in the biomass sector are not included in the national 
CO<sub>2</sub> balance. <a href= "gifs/BolFig1.gif">Figures 1</a>, <a 
href= "gifs/BolFig2.gif">2</a>, <a href= "gifs/BolFig3.gif">3</a>, <a 
href= "gifs/BolFig4.gif">4</a>, and <a href= "gifs/BolFig5.gif">5(5a and 
5b)</a> show emissions by sector and by type of gas.

<p><strong><em>Discussion</em></strong><br>

From the partial and preliminary inventory presented, the following 
observations can be made:

<ul><li>The principal sources of greenhouse gases are changes in land 
use and the utilization of energy. Changes in land use are principally 
related to the expansion of areas for agricultural activities. Emissions 
in the energy sector are related to the combustion of products 
originating in petroleum and natural gas during both extraction and 
consumption. Natural gas resulting from the extraction of petroleum 
is the principal source of GHG emissions.

<li>Livestock production is another important source of greenhouse 
gases as a result of the enteric fermentation of herbivores.

<li>Of GHGs with an indirect effect, combustion appears to be the 
main source of NO<sub>X</sub> and CO. The contribution of the 
different activities to NO<sub>X</sub> and CO emissions is comparable 
to their contributions to CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. The principal 
sources of nonmethane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) are 
combustion, petroleum and natural gas distribution, and the use of 
solvents.</ul>

<h3>Emission Inventory and Mitigation Considerations</h3>

It is possible that population increases and economic growth will 
increase GHG emissions in some sectors of the national production. 
The fact that Bolivia is a country in transition within the region must 
be taken into account. As a supplier of energy, Bolivia will export 
natural gas, and probably electricity, to neighboring countries. The 
national energy strategy for rural areas is to expand demand, which 
at the present time is low, in comparison to urban demand.

<p>It is not possible to attempt to establish possible measures to 
reduce emissions. Such measures will be developed only after the 
inventory has been carried out in detail. Possible measures in the 
energy sector are the reduction of natural gas losses in petroleum 
production activities, and high efficiency in energy consumption.

<p>A considerable quantity of natural gas is produced as a by-
product of the production of petroleum and is ventilated or burned 
off. This represents approximately 30 percent of natural gas 
production. That amount could be reinjected into the wells or added 
to the natural gas pipeline. Projected requirements are based on a 
considerable demand.

<p>The major portion of wood used as domestic fuel is the firewood 
used for cooking purposes. High efficiency ovens could be promoted. 
Energy efficiency could be developed in various industries with high 
energy consumption levels, such as electrical energy plants, 
petroleum processing, foundries, and tile factories.

<p>With respect to the burning of forests in agriculture, several 
measures could be considered as long as they are in accordance with 
the country's conditions and possibilities, such as the reduction of the 
necessity to burn biomass, and control of the burning activities.

<p>The need for burning may be reduced by lowering the loss of 
fertility by optimizing the use of fertilizers, for example, or by 
encouraging farmers to grow alternative crops. In most cases, forest 
burning is not necessary. Appropriate legal measures with regard to 
controlling the burning would limit the areas affected.

<h3>Analysis of the Vulnerability and Adaptability 
of Ecosystems to Climate Change</h3>

<strong><em>Introduction</em></strong><br>

Bolivia is a country of contrasts not only in topography and 
climate but also at the ecological level.

<p>Precipitation in Bolivia is closely related to the atmospheric 
circulation of the trade winds, which originate in the Inter-Tropical 
Zone of Convergence (ITZC).

<p>The distribution of temperatures in Bolivia is the result of 
differences in latitude and altitude. The annual average temperature 
varies from 10&#176 C on the <em>Altiplano </em>to 18&#176 C in 
the valleys and 25&#176 C 
in the lowland plains.

<p>Temperatures may vary greatly, however, from day to day. That 
occurs more frequently in the lowland plains as an effect of the polar 
air (<em>surazo</em>) entering Bolivia from the south Pacific. 
Temperatures in Bolivia are also modified by positive or negative 
temperature anomalies in the east Pacific, the El Ni&#241 o Southern 
Oscillation (ENSO), or Anti-Ni&#241 o phenomena.

<p>Recurring dry spells, floods and devastating out-of-season frost 
during the past five years, aggravated by the natural conditions 
described above, have brought into question the degree of 
vulnerability to global changes due to the effect of climate change.

<p>In the event of climate change, the areas of Bolivia that would 
suffer the greatest impact would be those now dedicated to 
agricultural production, since the country supplies its domestic 
market by means of its internal production (products that originate 
in the Altiplano, as well as soya, corn, rice, and sugar cane in the 
regions of valleys and the lowland plains). Forested areas serving as 
important reservoirs of flora and fauna could also be affected. 
Finally, it is quite possible that water resources would be impacted, 
generating irrigation and supply problems in different parts of the 
country, particularly in those areas subject to serious water 
shortages.

<p><strong><em>Objectives</em></strong><br>

<ul><li>To characterize the vulnerability of the agricultural, forest, 
and water resource sectors

<li>To establish the most appropriate scenarios for the country under 
both climate and nonclimate conditions

<li>To establish the extent of vulnerability in each sector, as well as 
policies of adaptation most suited to each.</ul>

<p><strong><em>Activities</em></strong><br>

<strong>Compilation and Evaluation of Studies.</strong> Basic 
information required for the execution of each of the respective 
modules will be compiled and harmonized with the data required by 
the General Circulation Models (GCMs) and impact assessment models 
for each sector. The models and methodologies will be adapted to the 
Bolivian conditions.

<p><strong>Validation and Application of Models.</strong> Each sector 
will utilize the results of the GCM model or models (i.e., CCCM, GFDL, 
GISS, UKMO) best suited to Bolivia.

<p>For each sector, the models will be validated and then run with 
the climate scenario. The results obtained will be analyzed and the 
regions of vulnerability to climate change identified.

<p>The socioeconomic scenario will be analyzed in parallel, 
establishing the expected conditions for the year 2070. With these 
results, options of adaptation for each sector will be indicated so that 
a general analysis of vulnerability and adaptation policies may be 
implemented.

<p><strong>Consultative Workshops.</strong> Workshops will be 
conducted to present the methodology and to discuss results and 
options for adaptation.

<p><strong>International Events.</strong> Bolivian technicians will 
participate in seminars organized in the U.S. or other countries with 
regard to the vulnerability and adaptation of ecosystems to climate 
variations in the fields of agriculture, water resources, forests, and 
livestock raising. 

<p><strong><em>Development of Scenarios </em></strong><br>

Two scenarios will be developed: The Climate Change Scenario and 
the Socio-Economic Scenario.

<p>The Climate Change Scenario will be developed using two or three 
GCM models (CCCM, GFDL, GISS, UKMO), the results of which will be 
compared with historic records. Once the GCMs best adapted to 
Bolivia have been chosen, they will serve as a basis for work in each 
of the sectors to analyze the results of the predictions of their 
respective models.

<p>For the Socio-Economic analysis, future population, Gross National 
Product (GNP), per capita income, and productivity figures must be 
established for at least the next 50 years.

<p>Statistical projections shall be made by institutions responsible for 
providing such indicators.

<p><strong><em>Analysis of the Conduction of Biophysical 
and Economic Impact Studies by Sector</em></strong><br>

As mentioned above, analysis of biophysical impacts shall be 
divided into three sectors:  agriculture, forests, and water resources.

<p><strong><em>Analysis of the Impact on Agricultural 
Crops</em></strong><br>

<strong>Identification of Key Topics in the Sector.</strong> Bolivia 
has three significant ecological levels or regions that determine the 
production of crops of economic importance.

<p>In the highest region, on the <em>Altiplano</em> and along the 
periphery of the Cordillera of the Andes, the traditional crops of 
greatest economic importance are potatoes and barley, which 
serve as the basic food of the inhabitants and the livestock of the 
region. This ecological level is characterized by its adverse climate; 
soils with low levels of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium; and a 
lack of irrigation systems that would allow increased yields of crops, 
the majority of which are dry-farmed.

<p>The valley region, in which the greatest production of corn is 
concentrated, has soils that are more fertile and a climate that is 
more stable. However, there is a lack of water resources, reason 
enough for the region to be considered in the V&A study.

<p>The major production of rice and soya in Bolivia is concentrated in 
the tropical ecosystem. In spite of the climate being appropriate for a 
diversity of crops, however, its soils are undergoing an accelerated 
process of desertification because the crop production systems 
utilized are extractive in nature, and the soil is recycled over very 
extended periods of time.

<p>For the reasons mentioned above, an analysis of the vulnerability 
and adaptability of the crops of economic relevance in the various 
ecological levels of Bolivia is of vital importance to face the climate 
changes that may occur in each of the regions.

<p><strong>Selection of the Methodology.</strong> The analytical 
methodology that will be utilized for the evaluation of climate impact 
on the crops will be based on the DSSAT3 program, which compares 
those strategies that are suitable to measure changes both in climate 
and in agricultural production.

<p>Statistical data will be obtained from the various agencies related 
to the agricultural meteorology and climatology of the country, such 
as Secretaria Nacional de Agricultura y Ganader&#237 a, Food and 
Agricultural Organization, Instituto Bolivieno de Technolog&#237 a 
Agropecuar&#237 a, Camara Agropecuar&#237 a del Oriente, etc.

<p><strong><em>Analysis of the Impact of Pasturing and Livestock 
Raising</em></strong><br>

<strong>Identification of Key Topics in the Sector.</strong> 
Potential areas for livestock production and possible changes in land 
use for the qualification of pastures and economic impacts will be 
analyzed.

<p><strong>Selection of the Methodology.</strong> The methodology to 
be used for the assessment is based on the selection of the two or 
three GCMs that most closely approximate conditions in the country.

<p>A program will be implemented to identify potential areas for 
livestock production and the country's natural pastures that are 
subject to change and may be vulnerable.

<p>Regional climate information (precipitation, temperature, solar 
radiation, wind) and livestock production data (weights, nutrition 
level, etc.) reflecting the initial conditions in the country will be used 
to carry out the analysis, which will take into account the economic 
importance of the regions and their impact on the national scene.

<p>Later, a simulation will be implemented utilizing the model SPUR2 
(simulation for production and utilization of meadows and pasture 
land for ranching) to establish possible vulnerable sectors.

<p>Finally, options and policies of adaptation will be established.

<p><strong><em>Analysis of the Impact on Forests</em></strong><br>

<strong>Identify Key Topics in the Sector.</strong> The topics of 
greatest interest to the country in relation to climate change will be 
those inherent in the various forest/agricultural ecological levels or 
zones mentioned above.

<p>This subtask will be focused on the economic and biophysical 
impacts of climate change on the forests. The same structure utilized 
for agricultural crops may be used here.

<p>The specific objective of the V&A study is to appraise productive 
forests in such a manner so to allow the identification of changes in 
certain parameters that may influence the species of the above-
mentioned various ecological levels or zones.

<p><strong>Selection of the Methodology.</strong> The analysis will be 
based on the HOLDRIDGE and GAP models, taking into account 
temperature, precipitation, and solar radiation values. Data on 
temperature and precipitation covering a thirty-year period will be 
completed. Values for temperature and precipitation provided by the 
most adequate GCM will be added. Later, utilizing the CLIM program, 
a data base will be created to calculate the annual precipitation and 
biotemperature. The HOLDRIDGE model and the corresponding 
comparison will be utilized to determine the areas of overall impact. 
The GAP model will be utilized to determine the critical areas and 
simulation for analysis of the impact and adaptation options. Finally, 
an evaluation of the economic impacts will be conducted.

<p><strong><em>Analysis of Impacts on Water 
Resources</em></strong><br>

<strong>Identify Key Topics in the Sector.</strong> The incidence 
of climate change on water resources in the economic regions most 
important to the country will be analyzed.

<p>Prediction models will be used to analyze possible impacts on 
water resources (increases or decreases in runoffs in principal 
basins) that could increase dry spells or floods in agricultural and 
grasslands, as well as increase or decrease water supplies in the 
reservoirs that supply water to the various cities.

<p>The principal objective is to establish the vulnerability of those 
water resources, not only to climate change but also to population 
growth, that are exposed not only by climate change but also by 
population growth which impacts on future demands. Another 
objective is to establish the options of adaptation best suited to the 
country.

<p>Water resources have a very important economic incidence in 
Bolivia, not only from the point of view of production but from the 
point of view of the population's health as well. At the present time, 
many medium-sized cities are completing the process of obtaining 
access to a supply of fresh water and many agricultural and livestock 
raising areas are starting to introduce modern irrigation systems to 
improve their production processes.

<p><strong>Selection of Methodology.</strong> On the basis of the 
results obtained from the GCMs as to changes in matters of 
precipitation and temperature, those same results will be introduced 
into some of the models studied and previously validated (WATBAL 
or CLIRUN). 

<p>The WATBAL model will allow for the utilization of various 
models of Potential Evaporation/Transpiration (PET) in function of 
the kind of information available. 

<p><strong><em>Conduction of the Analysis of Adaptation 
Policies</em></strong><br>

<strong>Integration of Sector Results.</strong> An integrated 
analysis of all the sectors will be conducted for an overall evaluation 
of the effects of climate change in Bolivia. The results of this model 
will allow for the integration of impacts in economic terms across 
sectors. 

<p>This analysis will also identify possible adaptation options that 
may apply to two or more interrelated sectors.

<p><strong>Identification of Policies of Adaptation to be 
Considered.</strong> Adaptation policies that anticipate climate 
change and recommend preventive measures in the more vulnerable 
sectors will be evaluated. The analysis will establish and 
demonstrate the importance of applying such policies and the 
urgency to implement them in the near future. Such policies must be 
based on recommendations that may originate in regional and 
national workshops, specialized seminars, and reviews of the 
achievements by other countries.

<H2 align=center>CONCLUSIONS</H2>

Bolivia has begun its process of inventorying greenhouse gases by 
attempting to address the most important sources of emissions at the 
present time. All the recommendations set forth by the IPCC with 
regard to methodologies and procedures will be taken into account. 
Some adjustments in emission factors will have to be made. 
Preliminary results are just estimates. They should not be considered 
as references due to the fact that many GHG emission sectors still 
need to be analyzed.

<p>As to vulnerability and adaptation, the preparation of the work 
plan has begun. The analysis of three important sectors &#139  
agriculture, 
forests, and water resources &#139  will be conducted, since they are 
of 
vital importance to the economy and the quality of life. The 
methodology called for in the present document will attempt to 
convene a series of suggestions with respect to adaptation policies 
that should be considered by the national executive authorities.

<h1>Central America: Vulnerability Assessment to Climate Change for 
the Water, Coastal,
and Agricultural Resources</h1>
</head>
<body>


<h3>Central America Country Studies Project Team</h3>

SUMMARY: Based on the most recent scientific knowledge from 
global assessments on climate change and the necessity for 
decreasing the regional uncertainties that still exist on the issue, 
studies for estimating the vulnerability of water, agriculture, and 
coastal resources to a change in climate are being conducted in 
Central America. Seven countries (Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, 
Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama) participate in the 
initiative coordinated by the Regional Committee in Hydraulic 
Resources (CRRH) and the Central America Commission on 
Environment and Development (CCAD). The Government of the 
United States of America through its Country Studies Program (U.S. 
CSP) is supporting the effort. Several methodological discussions and 
consultations have been held between scientists from Central 
America and the U.S. CSP. 

<p>The project was initiated in January 1994 and after finalizing 
organizational matters and training for the 29 studies included 
within the region, several teams of specialists are now working on 
the assessment. Due to the fact that seven countries are involved in 
the project and that the schedule of activities varies for each area 
of study, it is still premature to make comparisons other than on 
methods and activities. Baseline scenarios are being developed for 
the region. They cover socioeconomic, environmental, and 
climatological aspects of the region. Each country has discussed and 
selected priority areas and actions to serve as the focus of the 
study, through "National Development Plan" criteria.

<p>For the water resources sector estimations of climate change 
impacts on demand and supply of water are being completed. A 
video mapping analysis of the Pacific coastline of Central America 
and for the Caribbean coastline of Honduras and Belize has been 
completed to identify the vulnerability of coastal resources. For the 
agricultural sector, all basic data have been gathered to complete the 
model simulations of climate change impacts for subsistence crops.

<H2 align=center>INTRODUCTION</H2>

Scientific estimations indicate that changes in the global temperature 
may have an effect on the intensity and frequency of tropical 
cyclones affecting Central America. Changes in the Intertropical 
Convergence Zone, and in the speed and seasonality of the trade 
winds may also be expected. A modification in these systems would 
change the actual climate regime of Central America. According to 
the scientific assessment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change (IPCC) (Houghton, et al., 1990), a change in the actual climate 
conditions, may have an effect on important economic activities, such 
as: forestry, biodiversity, water resources, agriculture, human health, 
and coastal and marine ecosystems.

<p>Even though the growing importance that new activities like 
tourism have had recently, agriculture is still a major component in 
the economy of the Central American countries. Agriculture is 
important for the region not only for economic income purposes 
(cash crops) but also from the perspective of subsistence and food 
security. The high dependence of the Central American economies on 
agricultural products and the corresponding relationship between 
this sector and the climate, increases the sensitivity of this sector to a 
potential change in climate.

<p>In most of the Central American countries the production of 
energy depends, on a high percentage, of its hydroelectric capacity. 
Changes in the circulation patterns that might affect the seasonality 
and the amount of rainfall would present a major threat to the 
energy production sector. Recent experiences with the El Ni&#241 o 
Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon are evidence of this 
vulnerability.

<p>Central America, located in the middle of the American Continent 
is natural divide between two oceans, therefore, it contains one of 
the richest and more diverse coastal and marine systems of the 
world. These systems include coral reefs, mangroves, and one of the 
largest continuous beaches in the world.

<p>Potential problems associated with the sea level rise and the 
increasing development of tourism and commercial infrastructure 
along the coast, place the countries' economies in a vulnerable 
condition.

<p>Forest and wildlife are critical assets for Central America. They 
are important not only for activities like ecotourism, but also as a 
natural laboratory for finding new medicines and place for the 
species to live in this human saturated world.

<p>From a global perspective, the tropical forests of Central America 
play a large role as a sink of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. 
A high percentage of these forests are under some kind of protective 
law.

<p>New initiatives from governments are addressing all of these 
valuable resources within a general sustainable development 
framework. Given the importance that natural resources have for 
Central America and the high dependence that exist between the 
resources, climate, and economic growth, a regional study is being 
undertaken for assessing the vulnerability of water, agriculture, and 
coastal resources to a potential change in climate. 

<h2 align=center>METHODS</h2>
<p>The methodology used for the assessment of the vulnerability of 
the water, coastal, and agricultural resources to a change in climate 
for Central America can be divided into four components:

1992; United Nations, 1989,1990) are being used.
<p><strong><em>Environmental</strong></em><br>
Environmental scenarios are being prepared with projections to the 
year 2075 considering the following factors: land-use change 
(including deforestation and urban development), tenure, erosion 
and use of pesticides.

<p><strong><em>Climate</strong></em><br>
The subgroup for climate scenarios is developing the scenarios using

<h2 align=center>DISCUSSION</h2>

<h3>Baseline Scenarios</h3>

Socioeconomic and environmental scenarios are being developed for 
the Central American region and in certain cases individually for 
each participating country depending on the availability and quality 
of the information that is available.

<p>Final results from this component are expected in April 1995.

<h3>Climate Scenarios</h3>
Agricultural information will be handled independently for each 
participating country.

<p>A Central American reference database for climate change studies 
is under development. Climatological and hydrological data for the 
region is being input into the system. At this moment, 80 percent of 
the data entry process has been completed. Data includes daily 
precipitation, daily maximum and minimum temperature, daily solar 
radiation and/or sunshine hours, monthly river flow and runoff. The 
information covers the period 1951&#139 1994, and for some areas 
earlier records have been obtained, some of them starting in 1886. A 
total of 60 weather stations were selected for Central America. They 
are representative of large climatological zones and of the main 
synoptic patterns that produces the actual regional weather and 
climate. 

<p>In the case of hydrological and agronomic information, the data 
represent specific basins and zones were the studies are taking place 
<a href="centrameTab1andTab3.html">(Tables 1 and 3)</a>.

<p>All the information entered in the data base has been subject to a 
quality control process. Two main approaches are being used for the 
development of climate scenarios for the vulnerability studies: one is 
a selection of those model results that best represent the Central 
American region climate. The other approach is more subjective since 
it incorporates the expert judgement. On the basis of the model 
results that best represent the region, climatologists and 
meteorologists from the region will incorporate their knowledge of 
the synoptic systems and their corresponding mesoscale impacts. 
This latter approach will allow for a better utilization by the 
scientists who are in charge of assessing the vulnerability in specific 
zones of Central America.

<p>The generation of climate scenarios is expected to be completed 
by April 1995.

<h3>Water Resources</h3>

Each of the seven countries participating in the study has identified 
the main basins to be studied <a href="centrameTab1.html">(Table 
1)</a>. They were selected based on their national plans for 
development, and taking into account their actual and potential 
relevance for water supply and hydroelectricity. In some cases 
irrigation uses were also considered. At this moment each country is 
working on the analysis of the supply by applying the CLIRUN 3 
model. The results from this phase of the study will be discussed in a 
workshop that will take place in Panama City on April 5&#139 7, 
1995.

<h3>Coastal Resources</h3>

For the estimation of the vulnerability of the coastal resources, 
priority zones have been established <a 
href="centrameTab2.html">(Table 2)</a> and the basic information 
has been collected and analyzed in order to classify and characterize 
the coastline of Central America. A video tape shot from two 
altitudes (average 50 and 250 m) has been prepared for the Pacific 
coastline of Central America and for priority areas of the Caribbean 
coastline.

<p>At this point, coastline profiles are being prepared and ground 
truthing is being completed. It is estimated that 80 percent of the 
task has been completed. 

<h3>Agricultural Resources</h3>
The more sensitive crops selected for the study were maize, beans, 
and rice as food security crops, and banana and coffee as cash crops. 
The zones of study are presented in <a 
href="centrameTab3.html">Table 3</a>.

<p>At this point each national team is gathering the information and 
preparing the simulations with the DSSAT3 model.

<p>SUMMARY: China, as the most populous country, plays important 
roles in the actions to address global climate change. Given the 
prospects for continued rapid economic growth into the next century, 
it is essential that China be included in any international strategy to 
mitigate global climate change. The Chinese Government has made 
great efforts to formulate and implement research in this field. Along 
with economic development and the poverty alleviation, GHG 
emissions, particularity CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, will increase 
unavoidably. The challenges China face are both to minimize the GHG 
increase without unduly impeding social and economic development, 
and to minimize the risks arising from climate change. In the past 
few years, some bilateral or multilateral cooperation has been 
carried out. Prior research efforts have been devoted to the 
assessment of GHG mitigation technology options, and the analysis of 
impacts of and adaptation to climate change-mainly focused on 
agriculture, water resources, forests and coastal resources. As a 
result, a large body of data, models and experience has been 
accumulated.  However, these researches are mainly focused on 
macro study at either the state or sector level. Preliminary 
results show that a high potential of GHG reduction exists in China, 
and some regions with higher vulnerability in several sectors have 
been identified.  It is necessary to conduct further and broader 
studies to formulate China's national response to global climate 
change.


<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>INTRODUCTION</H2>

China is one of more than 150 countries which signed the Framework 
Convention on Climate Change at the United Nations Conference on 
Environment and Development (UNCED) held in Rio de Janeiro in June 
1992. As an indication of its commitment to implement the provision 
of the convention, China has initiated the process of formulating a 
National Response Strategy for Global Climate Change. In the past 
few years, ADB/SSTC and GEF/NEPA projects have been 
implemented, making the first stride to identify options in a wide 
range of sectors in China. On the basis of previous studies, a new 
project, China Country Study, that is under the U.S. Country Studies 
Program has been initiated. The project will improve the Chinese 
scientific and institutional capacity to carry out studies addressing 
global climate change and to formulate China's national response 
strategies. The China Country Study will allow for indepth study of 
mitigation options and vulnerabilities and adaptation options and 
improve confidence in information reliability.

<H2 align=center>MITIGATION ASSESSMENT</H2>

<p><strong>Results of Previous Studies</strong><br>
Since the energy system in China is the most significant 
contributor to GHG emissions, special efforts have been made to 
analyze mitigation options for energy-intensive sectors, while 
research on the assessment of GHG mitigation options in the land-
use sectors and other nonenergy sectors has been comparatively 
much more limited.

<p>In the ADB/SSTC and GEF/NEPA projects, the major efforts were 
put on the assessment of mitigation technology at the sectoral 
level and macroeconomic analysis of defined scenarios. In order to 
study the interrelationship between economic development and GHG 
mitigation, different kinds of models were developed and used. 
Major results from both studies concluded that with future 
increases in population, economic development, and urbanization in 
China, as well as a growing demand for materials and services, 
there will be strong pressure for increased energy consumption and 
an inevitable rise in greenhouse gas emissions. 

<p>For China, the technical options for reducing emissions of 
greenhouse gases in the energy sector fall into two broad 
categories: 1) increasing the efficiency of energy utilization and 
reducing energy losses in the end-use sectors and energy production 
and conversion sectors, and 2) promoting the substitution of lower 
emitting fuels (e.g., natural gas) and essentially GHG-free energy 
sources (e.g., hydropower or nuclear energy) for coal.

<p>Improvement in the direct, technical efficiency of energy use 
is clearly the top priority for specific action to mitigate GHG 
emissions in China over the short and medium term. Further 
improvements in the technical efficiency of energy use can have a 
major impact on China's GHG emissions over the next twenty-five 
years. Improvements in energy efficiency also are among the most 
cost-effective means to reduce GHG emissions, since there are many 
investments where energy cost savings more than offset total costs. 
Expanded investment is required to reduce energy use per physical 
unit of output, both through renovation of existing facilities and 
through adoption of more efficient processes and equipment in new 
facilities. Actions to conserve coal are most important because of 
coal's dominance in the energy mix and the high carbon dioxide 
emissions associated with its combustion. Industry will continue to 
be the sector with the greatest potential for energy-efficiency 
savings. Improving the efficiency of use of certain energy-intensive 
raw materials, such as steel, requires addressing many of the same 
problems in implementation as direct technical energy efficiency.

<p>China also has built a sound institutional network for promoting 
energy conservation and has developed a wide range of programs, 
some with marked success. Improvements in energy conservation 
will require the further development of market-based incentives. 
Implementation of a national initiative to develop higher efficiency 
small- and medium-scale coal-fired industrial boilers, through 
adoption of advanced technology, is among the top priorities for 
reducing GHG emissions over the near term. Additional support is 
also needed to encourage the adoption of other types of high-
efficiency equipment, such as high-efficiency electric motors, 
variable-speed motors, and associated high-efficiency industrial 
electrical equipment, more efficient air-conditioning equipment and 
refrigerators, efficient lighting devices, and steam traps associated 
with industrial piping networks. Improving the efficiency of electric 
motors and associated industrial equipment is most important, since 
such equipment accounts for almost half of China's total electricity 
use.

<p>Expanded use of less carbon-intensive alternatives to 
coal is a second important objective for the energy sector in 
China's GHG reduction strategy. To contribute significantly to 
China's energy economy over the medium and long term, however, 
greater support for the development of low- or non-carbon 
energy technologies is urgently needed today. Consistent with 
China's development and environment protection goals, more efforts 
should be made to accelerate the technological development of 
alternative energy sources, particularly renewable energy 
technologies. Efforts should focus on research and development, and 
technology demonstration and dissemination activities aimed at 
reducing the cost of alternative energy supply and improving its 
cost-effectiveness when compared with the use of coal. Primary 
emphasis should be given to technologies that are most likely to 
contribute significantly to China's long-term energy supply, 
such as harnessing nuclear power, wind farms based on large-scale 
generators, advances in solar photovoltaic and thermal-electric 
technologies, large-scale biomass energy utilization schemes, and 
new methods for extracting natural gas under difficult geological 
conditions.

<h3>China Country Study Activities</h3>
On the basis of previous studies mainly focused on macro analyses 
at either state or sector level, a two-year cooperation 
project&#139  the China Country Study, sponsored by the U.S. 
Government and implemented by the State Science and Technology 
Commission (SSTC)&#173 was initiated on November 1, 1994. This 
project differs greatly from the previous studies since it is aimed 
at:<br>
<ol>
<li> Establishing a China-specific methodology guideline 
in collaboration with appropriate U.S. developments and 
institutions, which will be used for the compilation of the GHG 
inventory, assessment of vulnerability, and analysis of 
adaptation and mitigation technologies as well as the 
socioeconomic evaluation of scenarios and response policies.
<li> Carrying out case-studies for selected regions and 
chosen technologies following the methodology guideline, aimed at 
developing demonstration projects for further research in China.
<li> Undertaking national assessments based on research 
outputs, case-studies, and prior research.
<li> Providing support for national policy dialogues on GHG 
emission mitigation options.</ol>
The study contains four major assessment elements designed to 
cover the following topics:
<ol><li> Identification of GHG sources and sinks and compilation 
of an inventory of major GHGs.
<li> Assess the impacts of climate change and studies of 
adaptive response policies.
<li> Identify and integrate technological options for GHG 
mitigation and their socioeconomic and environmental implications 
analysis.
<li> Socioeconomic evaluation of China's response policies to 
climate change including integrated option assessment for future 
GHG emissions.</ol>

In this project, assessment of GHG mitigation options will focus on 
the individual technologies from ten technology categories 
identified by previous studies as priorities for mitigating GHG 
emissions in China, including power generation, industry boilers, 
electric motors, renewable energy and other categories. Particular 
attention will be given to the nonenergy sectors, including rice 
paddy and forest systems.

<p>The major work related to the mitigation option assessment 
includes: collate existing information on current technology 
options in China in relation to GHG emission; develop a mitigation 
options indicator (ranking) system for technical, economic, and 
environmental factors suitable to China; evaluate and select 
technologies adapted to China's specific conditions for mitigating 
GHG emissions; identify obstacles and transmit policy suggestions 
for implementation of high-priority technologies to government 
agencies; and establish a technology characterization inventory for 
reducing GHG emission in China. The project will conduct 
preliminary micro-scale socioeconomic analyses for highly ranked 
technologies, evaluate and rank existing or emerging domestic and 
exogenous technologies in terms of technical feasibility, economic 
characteristics, environmental impact, technical maturity, 
absorption capacity, and resource constraints. Simulation models 
and analytical tools will be employed.

<p>The INET model has been modified since it was used in the ADB 
study. An input-output (I/O) matrix is being added to its dynamic 
technology choice framework. The model requires testing and the 
inclusion of additional technological and economic data. The 
country study will incorporate the new data into the model. 
Technological data will come from the technology mitigation options 
working group. Scientists at MIT that contributed to the development 
of the I/O&#139 INET model will participate in the new 
modifications for the model.

<p>In addition, the Chinese country study team will be trained on 
the Pacific Northwest Laboratory (PNL) Second-Generation Model 
that is under development. Both models will be reviewed as widely 
as possible among Chinese experts. The suitability of these and 
other models to the research targets, merits, and shortcomings 
concerning modeling conception, theory, and method, as well as the 
availability of the required data, will be reviewed and evaluated, 
in order to determine the modelling method by which the Chinese 
conditions could be best addressed so as to satisfy the research 
objectives.

<p>Quantitative analysis on the interactive effect of future 
technological options and macroeconomic development will be 
carried 
out based on the I/O&#139 INET and PNL models. The analysis will 
include the system evaluation of the potential GHG technical 
mitigation options, their effects on investments and costs and the 
macroeconomy. The SGM model will also be used as a reference tool 
for scenario generation and microeconomic policy assessment. As 
China is under the rapid reform where a market economy will 
become the framework of economic development in the future, the 
SGM model, which is a general equilibrium model, will help to 
analyze the possible impact of response policy within the context of 
international trade and technology transfer. Meanwhile, as SGM is a 
simulation model, it will help to generate economic development 
scenarios as well as emission scenarios, and to identify the 
Business as Usual (BAU) scenario.

<p>Currently, China is at an initial stage in the socioeconomic 
assessment of climate change issues. Since this field covers a 
broad range of methodologies and issues, there is a need for a 
literature search, an evaluation of methodologies appropriate to 
the Chinese context, and the development of guidelines for the 
country study working groups and Chinese socioeconomic 
professionals at the national and regional level. A draft "Guidance on 
Socioeconomic Assessment Methodology in China" will be prepared 
by the project, the guidelines will address the theory and 
methodology for socioeconomic assessment and data 
collection, identify the diverse range of factors in an assessment 
including level of development, prices, technology mixture, etc., 
that differ from region to region and sector to sector.

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>VULNERABILITY AND ADAPTATION</H2>

<h3>Results of Previous Studies</h3>

<p><strong><em>Impact</strong></em><br>
China is a developing country with the largest population in the 
world, in which only 7 percent arable land has to feed 22 percent 
population of the world's total. The climate in China is of various 
types and affects economic development. Geographically situated at 
the middle latitude regions, China has a large, well developed, and 
densely populated coastal area, and has long been plagued by water 
shortage and uneven water distribution. Therefore the country is 
quite vulnerable to the impact of climate change.

<p><strong>Agriculture and Forestry.</strong> The dynamics of 
moisture availability is the key factor affecting the agriculture 
and forest sectors. Based on some GCM (Global Circulation Model) 
results, if the temperature rises, the middle latitude regions may 
have less rainfall and more evapotranspiration, while low latitude 
regions might get more moisture in China. The substantial change in 
temperature and precipitation would make climate more unstable 
and could possibly result in instability of agriculture and 
agricultural product supply; readjustment of farming practices that 
would affect the yields; acute water shortage in north areas that 
would lead to desertification, degradation and soil erosion, and 
agricultural ecosystem deterioration; reduction in the areas 
appropriate for timber production and modest reduction in forest 
coverage; and increasing financial demands for agriculture and 
forest development to adapt to climate change.

<p><strong>Water Resources.</strong> The impact of global climate 
change on the alteration of wet and dry seasons, and flood and 
drought occurrences is quite apparent. The simulation-produced 
data show that a rise in global temperature would increase the 
summer monsoon thus exacerbating the likelihood of flood or 
drought disasters. The possible climate variation will increase the 
frequency of floods and water logging in rain-intensive 
southern areas, and aggravate the drought in the semiarid and semi-
rainy northern areas, thus disrupting the normal water allocation. 
The consequent difficulties in water management would produce an 
adverse impact on social and economic development.

<p><strong>Sea-level Rise.</strong> China's coastal line is 
as long as 18,000 km. The threatened rise of sea level might 
submerge the land where the economy grows rapidly with a dense 
population. The data observed on a long-term basis indicate 
that the sea level of China is rising at a rate of 1.4 mm per year.

<p><strong> <em>Adaptation Strategies</strong></em><br>

<strong>Agriculture.</strong> Since crop-yields are highly 
dependent upon the hydrological cycle (i.e., precipitation and 
potential evapotranspiration) and solar radiation, agriculture is 
likely to be one of the production sectors most affected in the 
case of climate change. The territories of China that are sensitive 
to the impact of climate change can be divided into six areas as 
follows: areas along the Great Wall; Huang-Huai Plain; North area 
of the Huai River, including eastern Shangong; Central and southern 
areas of the Yuman Plateau; Middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze 
River basin; and Loess plateau.

<p>The above areas are only identified as more sensitive to 
climate change. The actual degree of vulnerability depends upon 
social, economic, and technological factors. The analysis 
illustrates that the areas where agriculture is most vulnerable to 
the impacts of climate change are the eastern and southern parts of 
China.

<p>The possible adaptation strategy will include three 
categories:
<ul><li>More Intensive Management as a Countermeasure
<ul><li>Stabilize the sown acreage for grain crop and set up 
a system of zoning which will protect grain field, so as to 
maintain a response capacity for climate change
<li>Strengthen the effective capacity of farm irrigation
<li>Improve the land with low crop yield and enhance the 
productivity
<li>Popularize a more optimal fertilizer mix and adopt 
the technique of varying subsoil application according to actual 
change in soil condition
<li>Utilize drought-resistant superior species, etc.</ul>
<li>Farming Structure Readjustment<br>
The Program for food development of the Chinese Government 
stipulates that China will transform its traditional dual farming 
into a tripartite one entailing the coordinated development of 
grain crops, feed crops and cash crops, with the production of 
feed crops becoming relatively independent.
<li>Technology for Agriculture Adaptability
<ul><li>Strengthen certain farming techniques to increase the 
adaptability
<li>Develop dryland farming techniques
<li>Promote the feed cropping technique</ul>
</ul>

<p><strong>Forestry.</strong> China has about 128.6 Mha of forest 
lands, representing 13.92 percent of the total land, which has been 
the major sink of CO<sub>2</sub> and regulator of climate. Forest 
coverage preservation and expansion through a reforestation drive 
and deforestation prohibition is quite essential to mitigate GHGs 
and respond to climate change. Relative to the size of its 
population, China has limited forest resources. On a per capita 
basis, the forested area which is 0.11 ha and the stock volume 
which is 8 cubic m amount to approximately one-sixth and one-ninth 
of the world average, 
respectively. The vulnerable 
forested areas are mainly located at N. Lat. 33-40, including 
Shandong, Henan, Shaxi, Shaanxi, Gansu and Qinghai provinces.

<ul>The adaptation strategy for forestry will basically include:
<Li>Large Tree-Planting Plan to Increase Forest Coverage China has 
assigned great 
importance to reforestation by 
instituting a basic program of planting the tree and greening the 
nation, and now the efforts are mainly focusing on:
<ul><li>The Three-North (-east, north-central 
and northwest parts of China) windbreak system with the 
involvement of 12 provinces and reforestation areas of 35 Mha
<li>The shelter forest system along the upper and middle 
reaches of Yangtze River with the involvement of 9 provinces and 
reforestation areas of 20 Mha
<li>The shelter forest system in coastal areas with the 
involvement of 11 provinces and reforestation areas of 3.55 Mha
<li>The shelter forest system in Taibang Mountain regions 
with the involvement of 4 provinces and reforestation areas of 
3.96 Mha
<Li>The farm shelter forest system in plain areas with an 
acreage of 19 Mha
<li>Anti-desertification drive with an acreage of 6.66 
Mha</ul>
<li> Enhancing Management, Improving Forest Quality, and Increasing 
Disaster-resistance and Adaptability Disaster-resistant species will 
be selected and the 
forest mix is 
expected to be restructured. Other changes include intensifying 
management, preserving biodiversity, and stabilizing forest 
ecosystems.
<li>Intensifying the Legislation and Perfecting Infrastructure 
Facilities for Forest Preservation</ul>

<p><strong>Water Resources.</strong> In China, water resources are 
mainly recharged from precipitation. The bulk of rainfall (about 71 
percent) is formed by the condensation of vapor from outside of 
China while 29 percent originates from the land surface within the 
country. The vapor from outside is transferred by the southwestern, 
southern, and southeastern monsoons from the Bay of Bengal, the 
South China Sea, the East China Sea, the Yellow Sea, the Bohai Sea, 
and the Sea of Japan. Rainfall in China is vulnerable to the 
monsoon climate in Asia, which is subject to global climate change 
and thus, in turn, makes China more affected by severe drought and 
chronic water shortage.

<uL>The possible response strategy for water resources will 
include:
<li>Move water resource from water-sufficient areas to water-short 
areas, for example, the 
ongoing South Water 
Transferring to North Program
<li>Improve water management in terms of both quality and quantity 
to protect water sources and preserve the environment
<li>Conserve water and reduce the water consumption quotas for 
industry and agriculture 
<li>Desalinate sea water, and dispose and recycle sewage to 
increase water supply</ul>

<p><strong>Sea-Level Rise.</strong> Over the recent years, a 
statistical analysis of data monitored from 48 coastal tide 
observatories in China shows an increase in mean sea level of 1.4 
mm per year, which has produced a significant impact on China's 
coastal zones. The possible countermeasures would be:
<ul>
<li>Upgrade the monitoring and forecast of sea level rise
<li>Survey and draw up topographic maps at a very detailed level
<li>Construct tidal prevention infrastructure
<li>Control and prevent land subsidence</ul>

<p><h3>Methodology for China Country Study</h3>
<ol>
<li>Using the GFDL, UKMO and NCAR GCM scenarios, a high 
resolution regional climate model (RCM) is being developed for 
China. It will provide predictions of regional climate change at 
a smaller grid scale. It is expected to be suitable for China's 
conditions. It will be used along with the GCM scenarios.
<li>The climate scenarios will be used to assess the 
vulnerability to climate change of six key sectors. The 
Agricultural sector includes crop and grasslands. DSSAT 3.0 and 
SPUR 2.0 will be used, respectively, to simulate the changes of 
wheat and maize production in the eastern part of China and the 
changes of cattle beef production in Inner Mongolia. A Chinese 
weather generator will give several climate variabilities under 
the GCMs, so the results should be more reasonable.
<li>The Forestry sector will use the Holdridge Life Zone 
Classification Model and the Forest GAP Models to simulate the 
changes in productivity and distribution of mature forest in 
Northeastern China and Yunnan Province. In addition some 
comparison methods will be used in different forest areas.
<li>The Water Resources sector will use a runoff model 
similar to the WATBAL and CLIRUN models to simulate and assess 
water demand and supply in Hailuan River Basin and Huaihe River 
Basin.
<li>In the Coastal Resources sector, no single model can be 
used to determine the impacts of global changes. The IPCC 
approach, including the seven-step methodology will be used to 
assess the impact of sea-level rise on the coastal areas of the 
Pearl River Delta.
<li>The Air Quality sector will use EKMA and OZIPM models to 
assess the changes of SO<sub>2</sub> and TSP for two main cities 
and a province.
<li>Each of the sectors above will develop adaptation 
strategies, respectively. Some sectors should consider the 
results of socioeconomic analysis.</ol>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>SCIENTIFIC UNCERTAINTIES</h2>
At present, analyses and projections regarding global climate 
change contain scientific uncertainties that still need to be 
resolved. It is therefore necessary that broad international 
cooperations should be carried out to address these uncertainties. 
In developing the national response strategy for global climate 
change, the results that are most credible and consistent with 
China's specific conditions should be taken into full 
consideration. Where possible, this study should define the range 
of uncertainties and have policy makers know what is known, 
unknown, uncertain, and controversial.

Republic</strong><br>

<p>SUMMARY: This document gives basic information about the Czech 
Country Study as of February 28, 1995.  This report describes the 
results of the greenhouse gas inventory for 1990, and also includes 
an analysis of the potential effects of climate change on agriculture, 
forestry, water resources, and human health, as well as an overview 
of measures that have been carried out and are planned to reduce 
the emission of greenhouse gases in the Czech Republic.

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>INTRODUCTION</H2>

<p>The Czech Country Study has been sponsored by the United States 
Government and the Czech Ministry of the Environment.  It is being 
conducted by the National Climate Program of the Czech Republic 
(NKP), an association of several governmental, academic, and 
nongovernmental institutions (the Czech Hydrometeorological 
Institute, Charles University in Prague, Masaryk University in Brno, 
the Academy of Sciences, the Energy Efficiency Center (SEVEn, an 
NGO), and others.  NKP was created as the Czech Republic's response 
to the World Climate Program of the World Meteorological 
Organization (WMO) and was established on January 1, 1991. The 
association publishes a series of studies on different topics dealing 
with the climate and protection of the global atmosphere.  NKP's 
secretariat is located at the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute in 
Prague.

<p>The Czech Republic's Country Study started on October 1, 1993 
and is scheduled to end on September 30, 1995.  It consists of five 
elements:
<ul><li>An inventory of the sources and sinks of greenhouse gases.
<li>An assessment of the Czech Republic's vulnerability to climate 
change and possible adaptation responses.
<li>Development of policy alternatives for mitigating the production 
of greenhouse gases.
<li>Provide a basis for action plan and coordination of the project.
<li>Dissemination of project results and other outreach activities.</ul>
Elements 1 and 2 are almost complete.  Elements 3, 4, and 5 are in 
progress.

<p>The National Climate Program's work on the Czech Republic's 
Country Study served as background material for the Czech 
Republic's First Communication.  This document reported on the 
national process to comply with commitments made under the 
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) 
and was submitted to the Convention's Interim Secretariat in October 
1994.  In this summary we present the main findings of relevant 
study elements.

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>INVENTORY OF SOURCES AND SINKS
OF GREENHOUSE GASES</H2>

For several years the <a href= "IRendnotes1.html">REZZO 
Inventory<sub>1</sub></a> has been conducted in the Czech Republic.  
Work has continued on applying the <a href= 
"IRendnotes2.html">CORINAIR System<sub>2</sub></a>, and on the 
recommendation of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
(IPCC), the IPCC/OECD Methodology has been used. While the gases 
addressed in all these methodologies are almost the same (REZZO 
does not monitor CO<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, and individual 
methane), the breakdown of sources and the default emissions 
coefficients differ considerably.

<p>This inventory has been compiled using the IPCC methodology 
(categorization of sources and certain emissions factors with proven 
coefficients specifically for local conditions were unavailable), 
combined with data from other methods (CORINAIR and REZZO), and 
some data acquired specifically for this report.  The following 
classification of sources was used:
<ul><li>Energy sector (combustion and fugitive processes)
<li>Industrial processes
<li>Agriculture
<li>Managed forests
<li>Waste</ul>
The MINERGG Program was not used for the emissions calculations 
themselves, because it does not allow for a fine enough categorization 
of sources, especially in the energy sector. For inventory calculations, 
a standard spreadsheet program was used.

<p>Total emissions are summarized in <a href="czechTab1.html">Table 
1</a>. The estimation of the contribution to the greenhouse effect 
was made using the total potential for global warming (GWP).  The 
largest share, almost 78 percent, comes from CO<sub>2</sub>.

<h3>Carbon Dioxide</h3>

The largest source of this most important greenhouse gas is the 
energy sector, which accounts for 97 percent.  The second largest 
source is cement production at 2.5 percent.  The only sink (forests) 
seems to be almost negligible in the total balance (sink of 2.3 million 
tons, i.e. about 1.2 percent).  The current estimate of emissions of 
167 million tons is 3 percent higher than the results of the previous 
inventory published a few years ago.  The difference is negligible 
given that the uncertainty of emissions is estimated at 5-15 percent.  
It is also minor in comparison with an almost 5-percent difference 
between estimates following the CORINAIR and IPCC methods. 

<h3>Methane</h3>

The most significant source is the energy sector, with a dominant 
share of emissions resulting from coal mining (51 percent of total 
emitted methane).  Two other important sources with  nearly 
equivalent levels of emissions (about 20 percent) are agriculture and 
waste management. Total emissions of 941 million tons are less than 
half of the preliminary estimate.  The differences are mainly due to 
changes in the estimate of emissions from the distribution and 
processing of natural gas and crude oil.

<h3>Nitrogen Oxides and Carbon Monoxide</h3>
Emissions of these gases are less significant.  The major source is the 
energy sector because of the large amount of burned fuels.
<p>Chlorofluorocarbons represent the second most significant group 
of gases (after CO<sub>2</sub>).  Their significant share (14.3 
percent) in 1990, however, has markedly declined since that time as 
a result of measures evoked by the Montreal Protocol.

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>POLICY ALTERNATIVES FOR MITIGATING<br>
<ALIGN=CENTER>THE PRODUCTION OF GREENHOUSE GASES</H2>

<h3>Basic Characteristics of the Czech Republic's Economic 
Structure</h3>
Primary mitigation efforts are focused on reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions.  Many possibilities exist, due to the very high level of 
energy consumption in the current Czech economy, a legacy from the 
past.  The former Czech economy supported the consumption of 
energy and other natural resources and stressed the primary role of 
mining (mainly brown coal, lignite, etc.), heavy and chemical 
industry, and other energy-intensive economic activities.

<p>The current economy is in a state of transition from a planned to a 
market economy.  A logical consequence of that is a decline in Gross 
Domestic Product (GDP) in recent years and restructuring of the 
economy with some signs of revival.  The share of industry in the 
total economy has fallen from 56.7 percent to 49.6 percent.  The 
share of the service sector has grown from 27.4 percent to 35.5 
percent.  Total energy consumption has been decreasing since 1989, 
but the consumption of one fuel (gas) has risen.

<h3>Measures to Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions</h3>
<strong><em>Legislative and Normative Measures 
Implemented</strong></em><br>

The law on atmospheric protection was passed on 1991 and has been 
gradually amended (the last amendment was on 1994).  
Accompanying regulations set strict criteria for reducing all basic 
pollutants.  Converting fuels also reduces CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.  
The results of legislative measures are a reduction of emissions in 
large electric powerplants (by retiring sources that are neither 
economically nor technically feasible and modernizing existing 
plants) and in heating plants (modernizing operations).  The scenario 
assumes an emissions reduction of 13.3 million tons by the year 
2000 from 1990 levels (an 8 percent reduction).

<p>Energy savings can be achieved in the residential sector by 
reducing the maximum values of the heat seepage coefficient.  
According to the Ministry of the Environment of the Czech Republic 
and the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Czech Republic (1994), 
this method allows for savings of 30-50 percent of the energy 
designated for heating.  This figure corresponds to a reduction of 
CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by another 0.5&#139 1 percent.
<p>A vital condition for limiting the emissions of greenhouse gases 
from energy processes is the consumer's efficient use of energy.  A 
decree was passed that sets the responsibility to ensure the metering 
of heat and hot water at the output point of the source, at the entry 
point to every building and on every appliance, or rather for every 
consumer of hot water.

<p>Cogeneration of heat and electricity considerably increases the 
total efficiency of electric powerplants.  Currently, it is mandatory to 
purchase electricity from these cogeneration plants.

<p><strong><em>Financially Supported Measures Already 
Implemented</strong></em><br>
The existing tax system involves, for example, reduced value-added 
tax (5 percent) for equipment that produces alternative energy 
sources.  Biopetroleum and bio-gas fuels are exempt from 
consumption taxes.  Equipment for the production of alternative 
energies is exempt from income tax for five years from the start of 
operation.  Structures and property serving solely for the production 
of these energies are exempt from property tax. Automobiles 
meeting emissions limits or with electric motors are exempt from the 
road tax.

<p>Heat conservation programs in residential buildings, conversion to 
more environmentally benign space and water heating systems, and 
energy-efficient lighting are financially supported.

<p>Within the framework of subsidy policies, the Ministry of 
Agriculture helps forest owners to plant forests when it limits 
agricultural production and other planting efforts.  The Agrarian and 
Forestry Guarantee Fund gives guarantees and pays some of the 
interest payments on bank loans, as long as the applicant's income is 
predominantly from agricultural and forestry original production.

<p><strong><em>Legislative and Normative Measures Prepared
and Under Consideration</strong></em><br>
The government of the Czech Republic is preparing a new industrial 
policy that will increase the speed of changes in sectoral structure.  It 
will also increase the speed with which technology is replaced.  This 
policy will focus on the long term and especially on small support 
programs.  Legislative changes will also be included.  The law on 
energy management would affect the policy on energy utilities as 
well as provide a legal foundation for efficiency programs.  As part of 
the national energy policy, energy subsidies will gradually be 
eliminated, with the exception of the subsidy of household heat.

<p>Normative energy labeling for consumer goods is being prepared.  
A natural part of this system is the introduction of standards (a ban, 
or rather the imposition of a high tax or fine) that will limit the 
appearance of inefficient appliances on the market.

<p><strong><em>Financially Supported Measures in Preparation 
</strong></em><br>
The Ministry of the Environment has prepared a program to support 
conversion of heating systems.  The program primarily involves the 
conversion of fuels for small and midsized heating sources.  In the 
transportation sector, a range of programs is being prepared to 
optimize traffic on selected street sections, limit transportation in 
cities, and gradually implement mandatory catalyzers, etc.  Program 
support, both financial and normative, is being prepared for 
recycling and the use of biogas from dump sites.

<p>An energy audit is the first step in a comprehensive energy 
efficiency project.  Many companies in the Czech Republic are already 
performing these audits.  Subsidy support should enable even those 
with limited financial resources to afford comprehensive efficiency 
measures.

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>ASSESSMENT OF THE CZECH REPUBLIC'S 
VULNERABILITY TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND POSSIBLE ADAPTATION 
RESPONSES</H2>

<h3>Regional Scenarios</h3>

The climatological baseline was defined as the period 1961&#139 
1990. Data included daily and monthly mean temperatures, 
precipitation, and solar radiation.

<p>Equilibrium versions of GCMs (GISS, GFDL, CCCM, and a GFDL 
transient) was used for monthly average data for 1 x CO<sub>2</sub>, 
and 2 x CO<sub>2</sub>.  A climate data base was provided by the 
U.S. Country Studies Program.

<p>Before the climate change scenarios were developed, the validity 
of the GCM outputs in this region was evaluated.  This evaluation was 
conducted from two standpoints: GCM-simulated temperature and 
precipitation patterns were compared with current climate data 
throughout Europe; and simulated annual patterns of temperature, 
precipitation, and solar radiation were compared with both the 
climate data and average annual patterns assessed for a number of 
stations.  The results are summarized in the report prepared by 
Kalvova and Nemesova (1994).  The GISS and CCCM models were 
considered most suitable for constructing the GCM-based scenarios. 
There are two variants of the Czech Republic scenarios: GISS-based 
and CCCM-based.  The GISS variant is given as an example in <a 
href="czechTab2.html">Table 2</a>.  The values of the variables in 
the GCM-based scenarios are understandably questionable.  This was 
the reason for studying the sensitivity of the impact results to 
arbitrarily chosen changes in temperature and precipitation.  For this 
purpose, an incremental scenario was suggested.

<h3>Hydrology and Water Resources</h3>

Four watersheds were selected (sizes range from 100 to 5100 sq 
km), and the state of two water supply reservoirs was examined.  
The following hydrological variables were used: mean annual runoff, 
seasonal runoff changes, minimum monthly flows, groundwater and 
soil water storage. Water management was taken into account.  Three 
water balance models were used in the sensitivity study: BILAN, 
CLIRUN and SACRAMENTO.  One hundred and twenty eight 
simulations were performed, using inputs provided by the 
incremental scenario.  The simulation outputs differ significantly.  
The annual runoff, however, proved to be sensitive to seasonal 
distribution of precipitation changes when compared to the 
influences of temperature changes.

<p>The main findings are as follows:
<ul><li>The extent of runoff reduction differs according to the 
scenarios and models used. However, most of the results achieved by 
different simulation approaches show a similar decreasing runoff 
tendency related to gradual warming.  At a warming of 2&#176 C 
and unchanged precipitation, the original value of runoff would 
decrease by about 10&#139 25 percent and at a 4&#176 C warming, 
by 25&#139 30 percent, depending on the hydrological character of 
the watershed.  In the case of the least favorable scenario (i.e., 
concurrent temperature increase and total precipitation decrease of 5 
percent), the reductions would reach 30&#139 50 percent of the 
original value <a href="czechTab3.html">(see Table 3)</a>.  In times of 
drought, the reductions for runoff minima can be expected to be 
even greater.
<li>Given the already mentioned relatively low reliability of GCMs for 
estimates of precipitation changes, this study gave priority to 
incremental scenarios for strategic considerations.  Although it is a 
simplified approach, the use of these scenarios provided useful 
information about the sensitivity of hydrological conditions in water 
bodies to the effects of climate change.  According to the results, it is 
possible to conclude that these effects will be more evident in water 
bodies with smaller precipitation totals, while water resources with 
large precipitation totals show relatively less sensitivity.  Under 
these conditions, considerable changes in water level would result in 
medium water flows.  These observations enable at least a rough 
categorization of individual watersheds in the Czech Republic.  The 
effect of climate change is much more evident in the water 
management of reservoirs, the source of the drinking water supply, 
than in individual hydrological processes.</ul>

<h3>Agriculture</h3>

The estimate of the possible impacts on agricultural production in the 
Czech Republic was based on the regional scenario of climate change 
to the year 2030.  In that year there should be an increase in the 
average air temperature of about 2&#176 C and a decrease in 
precipitation not exceeding 8 percent of current totals.  Additional 
variants of the scenario were also used, however, allowing for 
different variations of air temperature and precipitation change.

<p>The expected increase in the concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> will 
have a direct impact on agricultural production.  By the use of 
models, this influence was verified for selected grassy plants and 
winter wheat.  At a doubled concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> and 
unchanged current climate conditions, usable agricultural production 
of the aboveground parts of grassy plants would increase by about 
29&#139 42 percent.  For winter wheat this figure would be 
10&#139 37 percent.  These calculations were made according to the 
DSSAT 3 Model.  A considerable increase in the production of 
biomass should be accompanied by the allocation of a large share of 
dry matter into roots.  Given the slower rate of decomposition for 
plant biomass, it can be expected that the soil will be permanently 
enriched with organic material and that the humus content will 
increase.

<p>In addition to the direct effect of CO<sub>2</sub> increase, plant 
production will be markedly influenced by a change in climate 
conditions themselves.  The expected warming will appear as an 
increase in effective temperatures.  This should contribute to the 
expansion of the warmest areas in the Czech Republic.  Up to the year 
2030, periods without frost can be expected to extend by 20&#139 
30 days.  This means that in many areas the start of the vegetation 
period will move up to the beginning of March and the end of the 
period will be delayed to the end of October.  The current vegetation 
growth period in most of the country is from April to September.  
The ripening or harvest time could be moved up by at least 10&#139 
14 days.  Yet on the other hand, planting vegetation earlier in the 
spring can increase the danger of the plants being harmed by spring 
frost.  The expected temperature increase should thus create 
sufficient temperature conditions for growing thermophilic plants.  
Yet there is also a serious danger of temperature stress by more 
frequent extreme high temperatures.  Without a more marked 
increase in precipitation during the expected growth of 
evapotranspiration, extensive areas of the Czech Republic  will be 
more threatened by drought.  This could reduce the amount of 
harvest in the most productive areas.

<p>The expected climate change will bring considerable changes in 
the conditions for the development and effects of agricultural pests 
and diseases.  Temperature increases with approximately the same 
level of precipitation generally mean improved conditions for their 
development.  This change will also appear in the conditions of the 
soil, which has been damaged by unsuitable management during 
socialism.  This mainly concerns damage of the physical state of the 
subsoil, reduced water-retention ability of the soil, and its microbial 
activity.  Letting fields become overgrown with weeds that are 
persistent is also a great danger.  Many of these weeds are more 
resistant to drought than  agricultural plants are.

<h3>Forestry</h3>

In the Czech Republic, the expected increases in temperature and 
changes in the totals and distribution of precipitation would have a 
significant effect on the composition of forest ecosystems, on the 
expansion of the tree-covered area, and on the increase in the 
number of trees.  The overall temperature increase would move the 
top tree border in the mountains and lead to a greater number of 
thermophilic trees, especially in lower areas.  It would also mean 
that trees that are naturally found primarily in cooler mountain 
areas, such as the Norway Spruce, would begin to disappear from this 
area.  It is anticipated that with an overall temperature increase of 
1&#139 2&#176 C in the Czech Republic, the composition of forest 
growth would be closer to the composition in more southern areas, 
where the current climate is similar to that expected in the Czech 
Republic.  Temperature is not the decisive factor in expanding tree-
covered area and increasing the number of trees.  Of primary 
importance are precipitation totals and their occurrence during the 
year.

<p>The studies conducted are based on the analysis of the current 
state of forests in the Czech Republic (National Climate Program of 
the Czech Republic, 1995).  This analysis addresses the vulnerability 
of forests, biotic stressors, and the non-wood production functions of 
forests.  Studies for two small-area pilot regions were also conducted.

<h3>Human Health</h3>

An analysis of the relationship between circulatory diseases and 
climate characteristics shows that the effect of climate change on 
human health in the conditions of the Czech Republic will not be very 
significant.

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>CONCLUSIONS</H2>

Results of the Czech Country Study to date include the inventory of 
greenhouse gas emissions in the Czech Republic, an evaluation of 
measures to reduce these emissions, and an analysis of the 
vulnerability of managed water bodies,  managed forests, and 
agriculture to climate change <a href="czechTab4.html">(see Table 
4)</a>. The results of the inventory were used in the First National 
Communication (Ministry of the Environment of the Czech Republic 
and Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Czech Republic, 1994).  
The vulnerability analysis is ready for submission to the appropriate 
ministries.

<p>The results to date have been judged to be stimulating and 
valuable.

<p>SUMMARY: Egypt has been actively involved within United 
Nations forums in the deliberations leading to the Framework 
Convention on Climate Change, which it signed in Rio in 1992. Egypt 
was one of ten countries that took the lead in implementing item 1.a 
in Article 4 concerning the development of a national inventory of 
anthropogenic emissions, as well as a preliminary assessment of 
mitigating measures as called for by item 1.b. This was undertaken 
within UNEP's project on the cost of abatement of GHG with financial 
and technical support from the Technical Research Centre of Finland 
(VTT). The study has shown that a reduction of more than 40 percent 
of the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in the year 2020 could be achieved 
at negative incremental costs. Egypt is now conducting a country 
study with U.S. support that will prepare a "Framework for a national 
action plan."

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>INTRODUCTION</H2>
In 1993 Egypt concluded a cooperative agreement with the USA 
within the framework of the U.S. Country Studies Program to 
investigate further the implications of the climate change issue for 
Egypt. The first phase of the study aims at preparing a "framework 
for a national action plan" to address the issues of climate change 
appropriate to Egypt.

<p>There are several important reasons for Egypt to be involved in 
such studies. Climate change could have an extremely dramatic effect 
on the flow of the Nile, causing the displacement of millions of people 
in the Nile delta due to changes in food production and sea level rise.  
A significant rise in the average annual temperature could also have 
adverse consequences on the living conditions and health of millions 
of people in the country.

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>EMISSIONS INVENTORY AND MITIGATION</H2>

<h3>Methods</h3>
Within the framework of UNEPs project on the Methodologies of 
Determining the Costs of Abatement of GHG emissions, a case study 
on Egypt was undertaken by the Egyptian Environmental Affairs 
Agency (EEAA) in cooperation with the Technical Research Centre of 
Finland (VTT) and the involvement of an expert team from different 
Egyptian organizations.

<p>First, a comprehensive inventory for the year 1990 was prepared 
of all the GHG emissions mainly, but not exclusively, from energy 
activities. The results are summarized in <a href= 
"gifs/EgyptTab1.gif"> Table 1</a>.  As the table shows, electricity 
generation, industry and transport sectors are the major producers of 
CO<sub>2</sub>, emitting a total of over 66 Mt annually.  Rice paddies 
are, on the other hand, the main source of CH4. They are responsible 
for over 80 percent of methane production in Egypt.  Finally, 
Nitrogen-based fertilizers and road transport are the main sources of 
nitrous oxide. 

<p>The different GHGs have different global warming potentials 
(GWPs). The corresponding distribution of GWPs of emissions for 
each sector is given in <a href= "gifs/EgyptFig1.gif">Figure 1</a>.

<p>The next and most important step was to establish, to the best of 
our present knowledge, a realistic scenario for the energy demand 
associated with the different economic sectors and that of the whole 
country. For supply options to satisfy these demands using available 
sources up to the year 2020. The energy consumption of the 
different sectors in the base scenario is shown in <a href= 
"gifs/EgyptFig2.gif">Figure 2</a>. It should be noted that power 
production is treated here as a separate sector. When power 
generation, the largest energy consumer sector, is distributed among 
the other economic sectors, industry gets the predominant share, 
followed by the residential and commercial sectors. The primary 
energy supply by source is shown in <a href= 
"gifs/EgyptFig3.gif">Figure 3</a>. 

<p>The corresponding GWPs of the GHG emissions are shown in <a 
href= "gifs/EgyptFig4.gif">Figure 4</a>. The figure shows that 
the largest source of CO<sub>2</sub> is heavy industry, although its 
share of energy consumption is much less than that of the electricity 
production sector.

<h3>Abatement Scenarios</h3>
Two abatement scenarios were considered: the first (A1) was to 
decrease the GHG emissions in the year 2020 to 25 percent, and the 
second (A2) to 50 percent of their values in the year 1990. In each of 
the economic sectors, a number of measures and/or technologies 
were considered for decreasing the GHG emissions. These 
technologies were based on one or more of the following techniques:

<ul><li>Energy conservation
<li>Fuel substitution	
<Li.>Use of renewables
<li>Material replacement
<li>Increasing GHG sinks</ul>

<p>A great deal of concentration was focused on energy conservation, 
particularly in the industry, power production, and transport sectors, 
as its potential and cost-effectiveness in these sectors were rather 
high. Fuel substitution was primarily limited to replacing coal and 
petroleum products by natural gas as far as natural gas reserves 
permit. Other measures included the use of renewable energy, which 
was applied mainly in the power production, household, and 
agriculture sectors. Material replacement was considered to decrease 
the dependency on present energy-intensive construction materials. 
The replacement of Nitrogen-based fertilizers by fertilizers from 
sludge/compost, and options to increase GHG sinks through tree and 
crop plantation were applied in the agricultural sector. A list of all 
the measures considered in both abatement scenarios is given in <a 
href= "gifs/EgyptTab2.gif">Table 2</a>.

<p>After adjusting a base scenario for economic and energy growth of 
Egypt for the business-as-usual alternative using results of several 
optimization processes undertaken earlier in Egypt, both the bottom-
up or engineering models and the top-down or macroeconomic 
models were used. In the bottom-up approach several 
measures/technologies were considered in each of the economic 
sectors to decrease CO<sub>2</sub> emissions with respect to the base 
scenario. The cost curves of the different measures and technologies 
for the abatement of CO<sub>2</sub> are shown in <a href= 
"gifs/EgyptFig5.gif">Figure 5</a> and <a href= 
"gifs/EgyptTab2.gif">Table 2,</a> in which measures are arranged 
according to their costs. A considerable number of measures are cost-
effective and have what are called "negative incremental costs." 
There might be hidden costs that are difficult to estimate at this 
stage, but the cost effectiveness of these actions is positive.

<p>In the top-down approach the effects of energy conservation 
measures on the economy of the country (GDP, welfare, and 
investment) were studied using a macroeconomic model, with a 
horizon up to the year 2020. These measures were found to have a 
positive impact on the economy.

<h3>Conclusion</h3><br>
Assuming that the base scenario selected was a fairly good forecast 
of the business-as-usual scenario for Egypt, it was found that Egypt 
has considerable potential for energy conservation measures that 
should start at once, in view of their cost-effectiveness, as verified in 
the bottom-up approach, and their positive impact on the economy of 
the country, confirmed in the top-down approach.

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>VULNERABILITY AND ADAPTATION</h2>
<p><h3>Methods</h3>
Within the Egyptian Climate Change Country Study, three economic 
sectors of particular importance to Egypt were identified for the 
assessment of their vulnerability to climate change and the options 
available to adapt to the possible consequences of climate change. 
These sectors were:
<ul><li>Water resources
<li>Agricultural resources
<li>Coastal zones and resources
In the first phase of the study, a comprehensive literature review 
was undertaken to assess the gaps in information and uncertainties 
relating to the various sectors. In the following section, the findings 
for the three chosen sectors are presented.</ul>

<h2>Results</h2>

<p><em><strong>Water Resources</strong></em><br>
Water supply in Egypt comes from three main sources: 
<ul><li>Surface water: The Nile River and seasonal flash floods
<li>Precipitation
<li>Ground water: in locations in the western and eastern desert, the 
Sinai peninsula and Nile valley and delta</ul>
<p>The future climate changes for the Mediterranean region in 
general have been investigated 
(Wigley 1993). The results predicted a warming of about 3.5&#176 C 
spreading uniformly over the seasons, with most of the 
Mediterranean basin showing an increase in precipitation in winter. 
The projected change in precipitation between now and 2050 is +1 
mm/day. As for the Nile basin, we cannot yet predict with confidence 
the nature of future climatic changes. However, there are indications 
that such changes will be significant and possibly severe. Recent and 
predicted future precipitation changes over the Nile basin (Hulme 
1989), and monitoring of the upper White Nile catchment, upper Blue 
Nile catchment, and Middle Nile Basin from 1880&#139 1989 show 
declines in total precipitation. Global circulation models (GCM) for 
1861&#139 1988 show an overall warming of 0.5&#176 C for this 
period. Various GCM models have been applied to study the potential 
climate change impacts on the Nile Basin, as can be seen in <a href= 
"gifs/EgyptTab3.gif">Table 3</a>(Saleh et al. 1994).

<p>A large gap still exists in our knowledge and information on the 
vulnerability of this crucial sector for Egypt. Recommended actions 
include enhancement of knowledge on climatological models, 
monitoring and forecasting, and implementing water management 
schemes to ensure water saving and conservation.

<p><strong><em>Agricultural Resources</strong></em><br>
In the first phase of the study, some of the effects of climate change 
on cropping patterns and distribution in Egypt were identified. Plant 
production is characterized in Egypt by two main features: 
diversification and intensification. In this way the agricultural year 
(Nov-Oct) includes monoculture (orchards or sugarcane), double 
cropping (winter - summer season crops), and triple cropping (winter 
- early summer - autumn crops). The outcome of all these patterns 
forms an intensification index of more than 2.0. With the expected 
changes in global climate, drastic changes in the whole system of 
cropping are likely to occur. Consequently, the focus will be on more 
adaptive types of crops and/or modifications in the microclimates to 
cope with the expected changes. New dates for planting crops of 
different species or cultivars need to be investigated.  Advanced 
dates for planting summer crops and delayed dates for planting 
winter crops should also be tested.  Crop plants differ in their 
response to changes in CO<sub>2</sub> and temperature. Increases in 
CO<sub>2</sub> concentration increase the rate of plant growth. C3 
plants respond positively to increased CO<sub>2</sub>, while C4 
plants, although more efficient in utilizing current CO<sub>2</sub> 
levels, are less responsive to increased CO<sub>2</sub> 
concentrations. The most important C3 plants are wheat, rice, and 
soybean, while C4 plants include maize, sorghum, sugarcane, and 
millet. Computerized crop models (e.g., DSSAT, IBSNAT and ICASA) 
have indicated that, at the national level, differences in areas 
devoted to the above crops are likely to occur due to climate change. 
Growing more small grains (wheat and barley) is advisable rather 
than more coarse grains (maize and sorghum). Rice areas could be 
increased, but the problem of water shortage will be a limiting factor. 

<p>So far, there is very little information on the impacts of climate 
change on pests and their control, on livestock or on marine 
resources. This is a serious gap that calls for an extensive national 
effort.

<p><strong><em>Coastal Zones and Resources</strong></em><br>
Climate change is expected to have serious impacts over coastal 
regions all over the world. In particular, many investigators have 
warned against impacts on low-lying deltaic coasts, especially 
those in Egypt and Bengal.

<p>The shoreline of Egypt extends for about 3000 km and could be 
divided into four distinct sectors:

<dl><dt>a.	The coasts of the western desert (west of the city of 
Alexandria)
<dt>b.	The Nile River delta and vicinity between the cities of 
Alexandria and Port-Said, including the coasts of the cities of Rosetta 
and Damietta</dt>
<dt>c. 	The coastal zone of the Sinai Peninsula
<dt>d. 	The coastal zone of the Red Sea</dl>
<p>These coastal zones constitute a particularly important region 
from the economic, industrial, social and cultural points of view. In 
addition to increased tourism activities, a tremendous move towards 
building new industrial complexes is in progress at this time. 
However, the coastal zone suffers from a number of serious 
problems, including population growth, land subsidence, erosion, 
water logging, salt water intrusion, soil salination, ecosystem 
pollution and degradation, and lack of appropriate institutional 
management coordination. Realizing the importance of this zone, 
the Egyptian government has already taken steps towards reducing 
the impact of these problems.

<p>Problems of the impact of sea level rise (SLR), due to climate 
change, on the Egyptian delta and adjacent areas have been taken 
particularly seriously. Several studies have been carried out to assess 
the vulnerability of this region (e.g., Broadus et al. 1986, 1993; 
Sestini 1987, 1992; El-Raey et al. 1990, 1992, 1994; CRI and Delft 
1993; Stanley et al. 1988, 1990, 1993). As a result, areas of high 
vulnerability in the Nile delta and possible socioeconomic impacts 
have been generally defined.  These areas include Alexandria and 
Behaira governorate, Port Said and Damietta governorates, and 
Suez governorates. In addition, several other smaller areas, such as 
those near Matruh and north of Lake Bardaweel, have also been 
identified.

<p>A pilot quantitative assessment was carried out over Alexandria 
governorate (El-Raey et al. 1994). The main objective was to explore 
possibilities of use of remote sensing and GIS techniques to obtain a 
quantitative assessment of the vulnerability of each environmental 
sector to the impacts of SLR. Satellite images of the governorate were 
used to obtain information on land use in the coastal area and were 
supplemented by available ground survey data. A geographic 
information system (IDRISI software) was built and checked with 
information based on available ground data. A scenario of SLR of 0.5 
m, 1.0 m, and 2.0 m was assumed. Analysis of the GIS data for the 
three scenarios indicates the capability of the technique to map 
vulnerable areas and to quantitatively assess vulnerable sectors in 
each area.

<p><a href= "gifs/EgyptTab4.gif">Table 4</a> presents gross 
percentage loss for each scenario of SLR. It illustrates that the 
agricultural sector is the most severely impacted sector (a loss of 
over 90 percent), followed by the industrial sector (loss of 65 
percent) and the tourism sector (loss of 55 percent) due to a SLR of 
0.5 m, if no protection action is taken. Estimation of the 
socioeconomic impact due to loss of land and jobs is possible using 
employment statistics relevant to each sector. Results of the impact 
on population and loss of employment are shown in <a href= 
"gifs/EgyptTab5.gif">Table 5</a>. It is estimated that a SLR of 0.5m in 
the governorate of Alexandria alone would cause a displacement of 
almost 1.5 million people and a loss of about 200,000 jobs by the 
middle of the next century if no action were taken.

<p>The most important limitation of these results is the lack of recent 
land-use data and recent reliable topographic and socioeconomic 
data. However, upgrading the topographic data using GPS 
(Geopositioning Satellites) and the land use data using high spatial 
resolution imaging satellites, and building geographic information 
systems on a more advanced ARC/INFO environment are now well-
mastered techniques.  It is therefore recommended that a program 
be carried out, using the already available quantitative methodology, 
to update and upgrade the Alexandria vulnerability study. In 
addition, it is necessary to carry out a detailed vulnerability 
assessment for two other highly vulnerable areas (Port-Said-
Damietta and Suez) as well as a number of other small vulnerable 
areas along the Egyptian coasts.

<p>SUMMARY: To mitigate the influence of greenhouse gases (GHG) 
and climate change on the unique boreal landscape in Estonia, a 
better understanding is needed of 
Estonian GHG emissions. Such data are especially valuable now, when 
privatization 
and ongoing process of restructuring of socioeconomic system creates 
a good 
possibility for decreasing GHG emissions. During the time when 
Estonia belonged to 
the previous U.S.S.R., the emissions and environment data had, as a 
rule, only 
restricted use. Therefore the present study, supported by U.S. 
Country Studies 
Program, is the first attempt to compile an inventory of GHG 
emissions in Estonia.
<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>INTRODUCTION</H2>
<p>Estonia is situated in northwestern part of the flat East European 
plain, remaining 
entirely within 
the drainage area of the Baltic Sea. The coastline length is 3,794 km. 
The total area of 
Estonia is 
45,215 km<sup>2</sup>, of which 4,132 km&#178 (9.2 percent) is 
made up of more 
than 
1,500 islands and islets. Estonia is characterized by a flat topography. 
The average 
elevation is 50 m, 
with the highest point being 318 m above sea level. Of the total 
population of 1,575,000 
persons 
(1990 census), 71.4 percent live in urban areas. The population 
density is 35 
persons/km&#178 . Fifty-one percent of the population live in the 
five largest 
cities (Tallinn 
484,400, Tartu 115,400, Narva 82,300, Kohtla&#139 J&#228 rve 
76,800 and P&#228 rnu 
54,200). 
<p>Estonia belongs to Atlantic continental region of the temperate 
zone, which is 
characterized 
by rather warm summers and comparatively mild winters. Since the 
annual amount of 
precipitation 
exceeds evaporation by a factor of two, the climate is excessively 
damp. The amount of 
solar 
radiation varies widely during the year. 
Although not very large in area, Estonia is relatively rich in natural 
resources, both 
mineral and 
biological, which have been and will be the basis of the Estonian 
economy. The production 
and 
processing of mineral resources give a considerable share of the 
gross national product 
but cause 
serious environmental problems. One of the most important ones is 
connected with the 
excavation of 
oil shale and use for energy production, which is accompanied by 
emission of GHG and fly 
ash, 
decline of ground water table, degradation of the quality of the fields 
and forests, as 
well as direct 
reduction of useful land due to the subsidence of soil and the 
deposition of waste 
(Punning, 1994). 
<p>The most important branch of industry in Estonia is energy. The 
total power yield of 
the 
Estonia and Baltic Thermal Power Plant is about 3,000 MW. 
Approximately 75 percent of the 
pollutants (CO<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub>x</sub>, fly-ash) 
are emitted by the 
Baltic and Estonian TPP, which ranks among the ten biggest sources 
of air pollution in 
Europe. 
<p>The biggest sources of GHG in Estonia are energy and industry. In 
1990 the Estonian 
energy 
system consumed a total at 452,000 TJ of fuel per year. Estonia 
satisfies most of its 
energy demand 
by using fossil fuels. In 1990 oil shale constituted approximately 52 
percent of the 
energy balance; 
heavy and light oil, 31 percent; natural gas, 11 percent; coal, 2.7 
percent; and peat, 
wood, and wood 
waste, 3.3 percent. During oil shale combustion, CO<sub>2</sub> is 
formed not only as a 
burning 
product of organic carbon, but also as a decomposition product of the 
carbonate fraction. 
In the years 
1990&#139 93, electricity production has decreased considerably 
due to economical 
depression in 
Estonia, 
Latvia, Lithuania, and Russia. This caused a decrease in oil shale 
consumption for 
electricity 
generation from 22.4 million tons in 1990 to 15 million tons in 1993. 
At the same time 
emissions 
from transportation increased accordingly with the increasing 
number of vehicles. 
<p>The territory of arable land is 1,130,000 hectares, with the total 
cultivated area is 
1,110,000 
hectares. Main GHG sources in the agriculture sector in Estonia are 
animal husbandry and 
use of 
fertilizers. 
<p>The forest land area makes up 47.7 percent of the Estonian 
territory. During the past 
half-
century the area of forest stands has more than doubled, and the 
growing stock on it has 
increased 
2.4 times <a href="gifs/EstoniaTab1.gif">(Table 1)</a>. Estonian 
forests belong to the zone of 
mixed and coniferous forests 
with 
relatively favorable growth conditions. Predominant tree species are 
Norway spruce, Scotch 
pine, 
and birch. 
<p>The peatland area is approximately 10,000 km<sup>2</sup>, 
corresponding to 22 percent 
of 
the territory (partly coinciding with forest areas); total peat reserves 
are approximately 
2.7 billion 
metric ton. At present 1.4 million ton of peat (mainly milled peat) is 
extracted annually 
(Estonia, 
1994). During the last decades, Estonian peatlands have been 
significantly influenced by 
amelioration activities.
<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>METHODS</H2>
<p>An inventory of GHG emissions and removals by sinks has been 
performed accordingly to 
the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) preliminary 
methodology. In each sector 
having 
importance in the GHG inventory in Estonia (energy, industry, 
transport, forestry, 
agriculture, 
wetlands), step-by-step assembly, documentation, and transmittal of 
the national inventory 
of GHG 
was provided for the baseline year 1990. The data were entered on 
the IPCC worksheets and 
then, if 
necessary, the data were checked and corrected. Due to the 
importance of wetlands in 
Estonia and 
lack of methodical approaches in IPCC Guidelines (1994), a special 
methodology was worked 
out 
for inventory of GHG in this sector. The reliability of the data in 
different sectors 
varies largely. 
While reliable data about the conversion of domestic fossil fuel 
resources like oil shale 
are available, 
data on other sources (imported fossil fuels, private fellings of 
fuelwood) are less 
reliable (Statistical 
Yearbook, 1991&#139 94).
<P><h3>Energy</h3>
Some problems arose in the use of the IPCC emission coefficients, 
since a factor does not 
exist for 
Estonian's specific fuels (e.g., oil shale). The amount of carbon in the 
fuel varies 
significantly by fuel 
type. The dry matter of Estonian oil shale is considered to consist of 
three parts: 
organic, sandy-clay, 
and carbonate. During oil shale combustion, CO<sub>2</sub> is formed 
not only as a 
combustion 
product of organic carbon, but also as a decomposition product of the 
carbonate part. And 
therefore 
the total quantity of carbon dioxide increases up to 25 percent in flue 
gases of oil 
shale. Carbon 
emission factors (CEF) used for calculation of CO<sub>2</sub> 
emissions from energy 
sources are 
given in <a href="gifs/EstoniaTab2.gif">Table 2</a>.
<p><h3>Forestry</h3>
Data from 1990, 1991, and 1992 years were used for estimating of 
carbon fluxes from 
Estonian 
forestry. Current emissions of carbon from biomass left to decay 
were estimated with the 
data over 
the previous decade (1980&#139 90). Current releases of carbon 
from soils due to 
conversions 
were 
estimated over the previous 25 years (1965#139 90). 
<p>The methodology applied in the present inventory does not differ 
from that recommended 
in 
the IPCC Guidelines. The assumptions and default data 
(recommended by IPCC Guidelines, 
1994) 
have been used when national data or assumption were not 
available.
<p>It should be stressed that statistical data on the Estonian forests is 
satisfactory for 
calculating 
GHG emissions with the simplified IPCC methods. 
<p>Finally the fundamental bases for the methodology rests upon two 
linked themes:
<dl><dt>1.	The flux of CO<sub>2</sub> to or from the atmosphere are 
assumed to be equal 
to 
changes in carbon stocks in existing biomass and soils
<dt>2.	Changes in carbon stocks can be estimated at first by 
establishing rates of 
change in land use 
and then applying simple assumptions about the biological response 
to a given land 
use</dl>
<p><strong>Agriculture</strong><br>
The main GHG sources in agriculture for Estonia are animal 
husbandry and use of 
fertilizers. 
According to the IPCC methodology, more attention was paid to 
CH<SUB>4</SUB> and 
N<sub>2</sub>O emissions. Data concerning soil properties and 
location was collected. 
Emissions 
from burning straw and other plant residues were not calculated in 
the present inventory 
as the 
statistical data were not available.
<p><h3>Peatlands</h3>
Our data indicate (Ilomets, 1994) that the peat accumulation in 
different peatland 
types is rather 
uniform and varies between 1.5 and 1.9 t ha<sup>-1</sup> y-
<sup>1</sup> . Here the 
accounts are 
based on the mean value of 1.7 t ha<sup>-1</sup> y<sup>-1</sup>. In 
lakes the accumulation 
of 
organic sediments varies in large scale: from 1 to 100 mg cm<sup>-
2</sup> y<sup>-1</sup>. 
The 
mean value was taken as 10 mg cm<sup>-2</sup> y<sup>-1 </sup>or 1 
t ha<sup>-1</sup> 
y<sub>-
1</sup>. If considered with a 54-percent carbon content in the dry 
matter both in peat and 
lake 
sediments then the mean accumulation of carbon in the virgin 
peatlands is about 0.9 t 
ha<sup>-
1</sup> y<sup>-1</sup> and in lakes ca 0.54 t ha<sup>-1 
</sup>y<sup>-1</sup> . 
<p>As a result of the drainage of virgin peatlands the accumulation of 
organic matter 
ceases and 
mineralization of the organic matter begins. For several decades, the 
breakdown of peat 
deposit and 
peat losses on fenlands ameliorated for agricultural purposes is 
monitored in Estonia. It 
is shown that 
the mineralization of organic matter is about 15 to 20 tons per 
hectare per year during 
the first 
decade after the establishment of an amelioration system (Tomberg, 
1992). Later it is 
stabilized and 
depending on the type of exploitation (crop field, grassland, pasture) 
the mineralization 
is between 5 
and 15 tons per hectare per year. The mean level is 8 tons per 
hectare per year. As shown 
in several 
studies, the rate of mineralization of the peat in bogs and swamps is 
probably on the same 
level as in 
fenlands (Tomberg, 1992). 
<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</H2>
<p><h3>Energy, Industry, Transport</h3>
Estonia satisfies most of its energy demand by using fossil fuels. The 
major part of 
primary energy 
in Estonia is converted to electricity and heat or refined to the peat 
briquettes and oil 
shale oil. In the 
energy sector the biggest part of CO<sub>2</sub> comes from oil 
shale. Total 
CO<sub>2</sub> 
emissions from fossil fuel consumption were 37,170 Gg in 1990. 
CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 
sources are given in <a href="gifs/EstoniaTab3.gif">Table 3</a>.
<p>Biomass fuel is used in form of fuelwood and wood waste. For 
1990 CO<sub>2</sub> 
emissions from biomass consumption were 847 Gg. Fuelwood burned 
one year but regrown the 
next 
year only recycles carbon. As a result, carbon dioxide emissions from 
biomass have been 
estimated 
separately from fossil fuel-based emissions and are not included in 
national totals.
<p>Approximately 68 percent of Estonian energy is produced through 
the combustion of oil 
shale. 
The remaining 32 percent comes from heavy fuel oil, natural gas or 
other energy sources 
such as 
coal, light fuel oil, or LPG. The energy conversion sector accounts 77 
percent of Estonian 
emissions 
from fossil fuel consumption, making it the largest source of 
CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. 
Oil shale 
across all sectors of the economy was responsible for about 76 
percent of total Estonian 
energy-
related CO<sub>2</sub> emissions with heavy oil accounting for 14 
percent; natural gas, 6 
percent; 
and other sources, 4 percent.
<p>The main production processes that emit CO<sub>2</sub> in 
Estonia include cement 
production, lime production, limestone consumption. Total 
CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from 
these 
sources were approximately 627 Gg in 1990, accounting for 1.7 
percent of total emissions 
of carbon 
dioxide. Cement and lime production are main industrial processes of 
carbon dioxide 
emissions.
<p>Emissions from mobile sources are estimated by major 
transportation activity (passenger 
cars, 
buses, lorries, special vehicles, motorcycles, tractors, small 
excavators, diesel 
locomotives, air 
transport), where several major fuel types, including gasoline, diesel 
fuel, jet kerosene, 
natural gas 
liquids, other kerosene and LPG are considered. Road transportation 
accounts for the 
majority of 
mobile source fuel consumption, and the majority of mobile source 
emissions. <a 
href="gifs/EstoniaTab4.gif">Table 4</a> 
summarizes 
emissions from mobile sources. Total emissions from mobile sources 
in 1990 were 279 Gg of 
CO, 
53 Gg of NO<sub>x</sub> , 3.4 Gg of CH<SUB>4</SUB>, and 37 Gg of 
NMVOC. The number of 
vehicles is increasing very quickly in Estonia. Among them more 
used old cars and lorries 
are 
imported from abroad. Therefore emissions from mobile sources 
show a continual tendency to 
increase.
<p>Methane will be emitted as a result of energy production, 
transmission, storage, and 
distribution activities, as well as from municipal landfills, covering 
large territories 
in Estonia <a href="gifs/EstoniaTab5.gif">(Table 
5)</a>. Methane production typically begins one or two years after 
waste placement in 
landfill 
and may 
last a long time (more than 50 years). Methane may be recovered for 
use as an energy 
source. The 
availability of data on sources and sinks of GHG is best in the energy 
sector and not so 
good for 
wastes and solvents.
<p><h3>Forestry</h3>
As the accumulation of CO<sub>2</sub> by trees in the boreal zone 
exceeds emissions by 
respiration and decay, the GHG budget of natural forests is positive. 
Forests, which cover 
almost 
half of Estonian territory, are an important terrestrial sink for 
CO<sub>2</sub>. Beside 
trees, the 
soils and vegetative cover in forest also provide a potential sink for 
carbon emissions. 
Changes in 
land use and forest management activities can disturb the natural 
balance of 
CO<sub>2</sub> and 
other GHGs emissions .
<p>During the last half-century the area of forest stands has more 
than doubled (in 
1935&#139 20.2 
percent; in 1993&#139 47.7 percent) and will be increasing for the 
nearest future in 
Estonia 
(Karoles et al., 
1994). As a results of biological process (e.g., growth, mortality) and 
human activity 
(e.g., 
harvesting, thinning, etc.) the carbon balance in forest ecosystem has 
been changed, 
already if 
compared with the situation in the past and will be changed in the 
future due to 
alterations in 
Estonian forestry .
<p>Despite the small territory of Estonia, the forests growing here are 
rather diverse. 
The great 
variability brought about by natural conditions (soil, relief, and 
climatic ) is increased 
by the fact that 
the majority of the forests of Estonia have been affected by man's 
activities in varying 
degrees and 
ways (cutting, drainage, fires, etc.). The carbon content in forest soils 
varies from 44 
to 192 tons per 
hectare. 
<p>The total carbon flux in the Estonian forests presented in 
estimates for 1990 (&#177  2 
years) 
is based on a total accounting of biomass carbon stored in 
aboveground biomass of trees, 
soil carbon, 
as well as carbon in product pools. The annual carbon flux from 
Estonian forest is 
estimated to have 
been a net sequestration of carbon from the atmosphere to the 
biosphere. The total removal 
of carbon 
from atmosphere to forests was estimated to be 3,094.6 Gg, including 
2,476.6 Gg removed by 
trees 
and 617.9 Gg by soils <a href="gifs/EstoniaTab6.gif">(Table 6)</a>.
<p>Commercial harvest and management of various kinds make up a 
large majority of total 
forests biomass losses. Depending on the level of management, the 
annual rate of removals 
and 
emissions may be changed. Carbon annual emission rates from 
Estonian forests are estimated 
to be 
926.3 Gg. The harvested timber and fuelwood effectively result in 
immediate carbon 
emissions of 
769.6 Gg. Additional carbon flux from forests have been estimated 
for the onsite burning 
of 
branches, barks, and other wood wastes at 9.5 Gg. By forest 
conversion some of the biomass 
remains 
on the ground (stumps) where it decays slowly and 9.2 Gg carbon is 
released to the 
atmosphere due 
to the decay. A rather high amount of carbon is released to the 
atmosphere from the forest 
soil. This 
indicates that less carbon is actually emitted to the atmosphere from 
the Estonian 
productive forests 
than accumulated during the inventory period. Due to the carbon 
removal processes the net 
annual 
accumulation estimate is 2,168.3 Gg/yr.
<p>The estimation of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from forestry and 
land-use change requires 
the 
consideration of events over a long period of time. When forests are 
cleared or 
agricultural lands 
abandoned, the biological responses result in "commitments" of 
fluxes of carbon to or from 
the 
atmosphere for many years after the land use change.
<p>The basic calculations focus primarily on forest conversation 
processes and abandonment 
of 
managed lands. The calculations of CO<SUB>2</SUB> removals or 
emissions of forests have 
taken 
into account alterations of areas and aboveground biomass changes 
due to management of 
forests. 
Annual removal of CO<SUB>2</SUB> from atmosphere by Estonian 
forests is estimated during 
the 
inventory year to be 11,346.8 Gg. This figure includes 7,438.3 Gg 
CO<SUB>2</SUB> due to 
the 
accumulation by the total growth increment of managed forests and 
3,908.5 Gg 
CO<SUB>2</SUB> 
due to the accumulation by abandonment of managed lands over 
previous 20 years (Table 6).
<p>In the processes of forest management some amount of remains 
may be removed from the 
conversion site and used as fuelwood or for other purposes. By-
products and wood waste 
from forest 
industries are partly used as raw material for fuel. This activity 
contributes 30 percent 
of the total 
burning releases of 2,822.0 Gg of CO<SUB>2</SUB> annually. A portion 
may be burned on site 
or 
converted to slash and decayed to carbon dioxide step by step. The 
annual rate of soil 
CO<SUB>2</SUB> emission from forest conversions was estimated at 
508.7 Gg 
CO<SUB>2</SUB>. Total CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions from the forest 
ecosystem is 3,399.4 Gg 
CO<SUB>2</SUB>. Taking into account emissions and removals of 
CO<SUB>2</SUB> in forest 
ecosystems the net CO<SUB>2</SUB> uptake by forest ecosystems in 
Estonia is estimated at 
7,947.3 Gg per year.
<p>Forest management activities may also result in fluxes of other 
greenhouse and 
radiatively 
important gases present in the atmosphere. Open burning associated 
with forest clearing or 
other 
land-use change may cause emissions of non-CO<SUB>2</SUB> trace 
gases to the atmosphere. 
Our data show that methane (CH<SUB>4</SUB>), carbon monoxide 
(CO), nitrous oxide 
(N<sub>2</sub>O) and oxides of nitrogen (NO<sub>x</sub>, i.e. NO and 
NO<sub>2</sub>) have 
been emitted in case 
of 
open burning associated with forest conversion in Estonia. However, 
the share of these 
gases from 
forestry is not considerable.
<p><h3>Peatlands</h3>
During the last decades Estonian peatlands have been influenced by 
the agricultural and 
forestry 
activities. The role of the peat industry is considered to be somewhat 
lower. According to 
official 
data, drainage for agricultural purposes removes 120,000 ha and for 
forestry purposes 
180,000 ha 
while industry needs 38,000 ha of peatlands per year. Most 
drastically affected are fens, 
swamps, 
and floodplains of which about 10 percent are still in a virgin state. 
Calculations 
demonstrate that 
changes in the hydrological regime cause increases in the emissions 
of CO<SUB>2</SUB> and

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>CONCLUSIONS</H2>
<p>Preliminary results for the GHG budget in Estonia in 1990 are 
given in <a 
href="gifs/EstoniaTab8.gif">Table 8</a>. In the 
industry 
sector the emissions of GHG decreased from 1990 to 1994 by about 
1/3. In the energy sector 
the 
emissions will decrease when oil shale using Thermal Power Plants 
will be modernized and 
the 
efficiency of the boilers and flue gas cleaning equipment will be 
increased (Moetus, 1993; 
State 
Energy Dept., 1992; Statistical Office, 1993; Taehtinen, 1992). The 
emissions from 
transport are 
stabilizing as a trend of increasing use of newer cars is occurring. The 
taxes on old cars 
are higher 
and the average salary is continuously increasing.
<p>The CO<SUB>2</SUB> budget in boreal zone trees is positive since 
more carbon is 
accumulated than emitted during the respiration and decay. Forest 
management and 
industrial use of 
forest might lead to critical changes in the GHG budget.
<p>In agriculture the emissions are decreasing since the use of 
fertilizers has 
considerably 
decreased when compared to 1990.
<p>For peatlands the peatland loss has been reduced, but new 
problems arise in connection 
with 
land privatization. Some projects have been started to solve these 
problems and design 
laws and 
taxes to protect peatlands.

<h1>Ethiopia:  Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sources</h1>
</head>
<body>

<h3>Asress Wolde Giorgis</h3>
<strong>Ethiopian Energy Authority</strong><br>

<p>SUMMARY: This paper deals with greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) 
inventoried from different emission sources in Ethiopia. This 
inventory of greenhouse gas emissions is phase I of the Ethiopian 
Climate Change Country Study Project which is partially financed by 
the United States Government.<br>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>INTRODUCTION</H2>
<p>Although, it was planned to undertake a GHG emissions inventory 
for all sources recommended by IPCC, only emissions from the 
following sources are considered:  

<ul><li>Energy consumption, either traditional or modern
<li>Bagasse, stationary combustion
<li>Agricultural practices: livestock, burning of agricultural residues, 
and savanna
<li>Natural forests (special attention given to emission from onsite 
burning)
<li>Waste emissions from landfills, municipal, and industrial liquid 
waste
<li>Industrial processes (for instance, emissions from cement 
factories)</ul>

<p>The inventory was limited to these sources because statistics for 
the above sources were available. Further, these sources are believed 
to be the most significant based on Ethiopia's economic level of 
development. Five gases (CO<SUB>2</SUB>, CO, CH<sub>4</sub>, 
N<sub>2</sub>O, and NO<sub>x</sub>) were inventoried for the 
abovementioned emission source categories.

<p>The Ethiopian Energy Authority has a plan to undertake GHG 
emission inventories for anthropogenic activities (especially from the 
energy sector) through the year 1999. Therefore, it is hoped that in 
due course more information will be collected, in order to quantify 
the emission of gases which are not mentioned here (e.g., NMVOCs) 
and to quantify emissions from all sources recommended by the 
IPCC.<br>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>INVENTORY METHODS</H2>
<p>The inventory of the greenhouse gases has been conducted in 
accordance with international guidelines, in order to facilitate 
comparison with similar works undertaken in other countries. IPCC 
default values provided in the greenhouse gas reference manual 
have been utilized whenever local statistics where unavailable. 
Methodologies utilized to quantify the GHG emission from each 
source category are briefly stated below.<br>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>EMISSIONS FROM THE ENERGY SECTOR</H2>
<p><h3>CO<SUB>2</SUB> Emissions from Fossil Fuels</h3>
Except for liquid fossil fuels, solid fossil fuels like coking coal, steam 
coal, lignite, subbituminous coal, and peat (primary solid fossil fuels) 
and coke (secondary solid fossil fuel) are not used for energy supply 
in Ethiopia. Therefore, only CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions from liquid 
fossil fuels have been quantified.Prior to the calculation of carbon 
emissions from each fossil fuel type, fuels used as raw materials for 
nonenergy use were identified. According to the observations of fuel 
characteristics and utilization methods in Ethiopia, bitumen and 
lubricants are the only important fuels used as raw materials for 
nonenergy use. Bitumen is used as asphalt for road construction and 
as lubricants for locomotive parts. Therefore, except for the 
abovementioned two fuels, all other fuel types are not considered to 
store carbon since they are used for energy production. The 
CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions from each liquid fossil fuel is calculated 
based on the following relationship (see list of symbols at the end of 
this paper:<br>

<p>APC<sub>p</sub> x EF<sub>p</sub>=CF<sub>p</sub><br>
APC<sub>s</sub> x EF<sub>s</sub> = CF<sub>s</sub><br>
EFQ<sub>s<sub> x EF<sub>s</sub> x %CS<sub>s</sub> = 
CS<sub>s</sub><br>
CF<sub>s</sub> - CS<sub>s</sub> = NCE<sub>s</sub><br>

<p>Actual CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions from primary fuel:  
CO<sub>p</sub> = 
CF<sub>p</sub> x &#37 FCO<sub>p</sub> x 44/12<br>
Actual CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions from secondary fuel: 
CO<sub>s</sub> = 
NCE<sub>s</sub> x &#37 FCO<sub>s</sub> x 44/12<br>

<p>Total CO<SUB>2s+p</SUB> = CO<SUB>2p</SUB> + &#133 <sub>r</sub> 
CO<SUB>2s</SUB><br>

<p><h3>GHG Emissions from Traditional Fuels</h3>
The main traditional biomass fuels burned for energy in Ethiopia are 
wood, agricultural residues, charcoal, and dung. The CH<sub>4</sub>, 
CO, N<sub>2</sub>O, NO<sub>x</sub> emission calculation 
methodologies utilized for the above fuels (including charcoal 
production) are presented below:<br>

<p>(CH<sub>4</sub> - C)<sub>cdaf</sub> x 16/12 = CH<sub>4</sub><br>
(CO - C)<sub>cdaf</sub> x 28/12 = CO<br>
[FC<sub>cdaf</sub> x FFO<sub>cdaf</sub> x CFF<sub>cdaf</sub>] x (N-C 
x N<sub>2</sub>O -N)<sub>cdaf</sub> x 44/28 = N<sub>2</sub>O<br>
(N-C x NO<sub>x</sub>-N)<sub>cdaf</sub> x 30/14 = 
NO<sub>x</sub><br>

<h3>GHG Emissions From Bagasse</h3>
Sugar cane residue is a byproduct of sugar production in large agro-
industries. Therefore, it is logical to treat bagasse as an industrially 
made residue compared to other agri-residues. The emissions from 
bagasse have been calculated using the following formula:<br>

<p>Emissions (Gg) = &#133 (EF<sub>abc</sub> x 
Activity<sub>abc</sub>)<br>

<H2 align=center>GHG EMISSIONS FROM THE AGRICULTURAL 
SECTOR</h2>

<p><h3>Methane Emissions from Enteric Fermentation and Animal 
Manure</h3>
<strong><em>Methane Emissions from Enteric 
Fermentation</strong></em><br>
Herbivorous animals produce CH<sub>4</sub> during the digestion 
process by which carbohydrates are broken down by microorganisms 
into simple molecules for absorption into the blood stream. The 
quantity of CH<sub>4</sub> produced during this process has been 
calculated as follows:

<P>[CH<sub>4</sub>]i,y = (EFi x POPi,y)/(106Kg/Gg)<br>
ACH4 = &#133 (CH4)i,y<br>
Enteric fermentation emission factors utilized are dairy cattle = 36; 
nondairy cattle = 32; sheep = 5; goat = 5; horse = 18; mules and asses 
= 10.

<p><em><strong>Determination of Emission Factors and Methane 
Emissions from Manure Management</strong></em><br>
The amount of manure produced from ruminant and non-ruminant 
animals and the portion of the manure that decomposes 
anaerobically is the primary determinant of the amount of 
CH<sub>4</sub> produced.

<p>Manure management systems in Ethiopia may differ from other 
countries. Animal manure, especially cattle manure, is collected and 
is made into dung cakes. After drying it is used as a fuel. An attempt 
has been made to modify the emission factors for cattle because the 
management of manure from cattle in Ethiopia is unique. The 
following calculation has been carried out to determine the factors.

<dl>1.	Daily Manure produced:
	<dt><dd>a) Dairy cattle		A = 2.01 (Kg/h/d dry)
	<dt><dd>b) Nondairy cattle	B = 2.27 (Kg/h/d dry)</dl>

<dl>2.	Yearly manure produced (Kr) from:
	<dt><dd>Dairy cattle		X = A x  DCy x 365 days
	<dt><dd>Nondairy cattle	Y = B x NDCy x 365 days</dl>
<dl><dt><dd>Total Manure produced: X + Y</dl>

<p>The Ethiopian Energy Authority has been collecting data on the 
amount of dung utilized for energy for a number of years. Therefore, 
the fraction of manure handled in a dung form to that of manure 
produced is as shown below.

Note: MS percent is manure management usage. The average ratio of 
dung to 
manure produced from cattle is 22 percent. This ratio has been used 
to
derive/modify management emission factors.<hr>

<p>In order to modify the manure management emission factor, the 
manure management system methane conversion factors, the 
maximum CH<sub>4</sub> producing capacity, the daily VS excreted 
(from IPCC manual) and the manure management usage (MS percent 
to 22 percent) calculated above have been inserted in the manure 
management emission factor equation shown below.

0.67Kg/M<sup>3</sup> x &#133<sub>jk</sub>MCF<sub>jk</sub> x

The result of the calculation shows the following emission factors for 
different climate regions:

</pre>
<p>Based on the above emission factors and percentage distribution 
of 
animals according to climate, the average manure management 
emission factor has
been calculated as follows:

<p>AEFi = EFi (A %C + B %T + C %W)<br>

<p>Animal distribution and manure management emission factors 
calculated are
presented in the following table:

</pre>
<hr>
<p>Therefore, the CH<sub>4</sub> emission from manure 
management has been determined by applying:<br>

<p>(MMCH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>i,y</sub> = (AEF<sub>i</sub> x 
POP<sub>i,y</sub>)/10<sup>6</sup>Kg/Gg<br>
<p>(AMCH<sub>4</sub> = &#133 
(MMCH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>i,y</sub><br>

<p>The total annual emission from livestock has been determined by 
applying:
<p>CH<sub>4</sub> (Gg) = &#133 (ACH<sub>4</sub> + 
AMCH<sub>4</sub>)<br>

<p><h3>Non-CO<SUB>2</SUB> Trace Gas Emissions From Field Burning 
of Agricultural Residues</h3>

Crop residue burning is a significant net source of CH<sub>4</sub>, CO, 
NO<sub>x</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O. Burning of crop residues in 
fields is not considered to be a net source of CO<SUB>2</SUB>, because 
the carbon released to the atmosphere from the crop residues 
burning at the end of harvest is usually absorbed during the next 
growing season. Total agri-residues produced annually in Ethiopia 
can be mathematically represented as follows:<br>

<p>TOTAL = AF + EU + CO + BF + DE<br>

<p>The Ethiopian Energy Authority has been recording the amount of 
residues used in energy consumption for a number of years. 
Therefore, what is unknown here is the amount burned in fields and 
left to decay. The amount burned could be determined by calculating 
the difference between the total agri-residue produced, the amount 
used for various purposes, and the decayed part in the field as 
follows.<br>

<p>BF = TOTAL - (EU + CO + DE)<br>

<p>However, since the decayed amount is not known and the decay 
process may not be completed within one year, it is not easy to 
obtain the amount of residues burned in fields from the above 
relationship. Therefore, the following IPCC recommended relationship 
has been utilized to determine the emission of the non-
CO<SUB>2</SUB> gases from the residues burned onsite.

<p>Total Carbon Released = AP x R/C RATIO x ADMC x
	FABF x CE x CF<br>
<p>Therefore, CH<sub>4</sub> Emissions = Total carbon release x
	Emission ratio of CH<sub>4</sub> x16/12<br>
<p>CO Emissions = Total carbon released x Emission ratio 
	of CO x 28/12<br>
<p>N<sub>2</sub>O Emissions = Total carbon released x N/C x 
N<sub>2</sub>O 
	Emission ratio x 44/28<br>
<p>NO<sub>x</sub> Emissions = Total carbon released x N/C x 
NO<sub>x</sub> Emission Ratio x 30/14</dl><br>
<h2 align=center>EMISSIONS FROM FOREST COMBUSTION</h2>

Fire is a natural component of all forest ecosystems, including those 
which occur in Ethiopia. The IPCC/OECD methodology was employed 
to estimate fire emissions from forests. The equations used in these 
estimates are referenced in the IPCC/OECD methods manual.
<p>Given this background and based on available local data and 
assumptions, 
it is estimated that 
about 23 percent of the total natural forest biomass (Fr) is burned 
onsite 
annually. The carbon 
released from natural forests is initially determined as follows in 
order 
to calculate the GHG 
emission quantities.

<p>ANFC x NCB x f x CE x CFAGB = Carbon released<br>

<p>Therefore, the gases emitted are determined from:<br>
CO<SUB>2</SUB> Emissions = Carbon released x 44/12<br>
CO Emissions = Carbon released x emission ratio x 28/12<br>
CH<sub>4</sub> Emissions = Carbon released x emission ratio x 
16/12<br>
N<sub>2</sub>O Emissions = Carbon released x (N/C ratio) x Emission 
ratio x 44/28<br>
NO<sub>x</sub> Emissions = Carbon released x (N/C ratio) x Emission 
Ratio x 30/14<br>
<h2 align=center>METHANE EMISSIONS FROM WASTE</h2>
<p><h3>Methane Emissions From Municipal Solid Waste 
(Landfills)</h3>
Except in Addis Ababa there is not any record of solid waste 
collected from 
Ethiopian cities and 
towns. The solid waste of Addis Ababa is disposed of by the 
municipality 
office at Repi. The present 
solid waste collection efficiency of the city office is 60 percent, in 
other words, the municipality of 
the city office has the capacity to collect about 60 percent of the solid 
waste produced in the city. 
The remaining 40 percent is collected and burned by individuals 
around 
their respective residences.
<p>Therefore, methane emissions from the waste collected by the 
municipality office is considered 
important, because it is well developed landfill. The quantity of net 
methane emission from Addis 
Adaba is therefore obtained by carrying out the following formula:

<dl><dt>CH<sub>4</sub> emissions = MSW<sub>RE</sub> x FDOC x FAD 
x (GgC - 
CH<sub>4</sub>/Ggc - biogas) x 16/12 - MR<sub>y</sub></dl>

Since the other towns' solid waste production is not usually recorded. 
The 
quantity of solid waste is 
initially calculated based on the population, waste generation rate, 
and 
fraction landfilled. Therefore, 
the equation used to determine the methane emission from other 
Ethiopian 
landfills is:

<p>CH<sub>4</sub> emissions = POP<sub>y</sub> x  WGR x FL x FDOC x 
FAD x
(GgC - CH<sub>4</sub>/GgC - biogas) x 16/12 - 
MR<sub>y</sub></dl><br>

<P><h3>Methane Emissions from Municipal Liquid Waste</h3>
In this submodule, only methane emissions from Addis Ababa have 
been 
calculated as there are 
statistics on the parameters useful to determine CH<sub>4</sub> 
emission from this 
source. About 70 percent of 
the inhabitants of Addis Ababa population have toilets in their 
houses and 
the rest (30 percent) have 
no toilets. Therefore, they defecate anywhere. Fifty-eight percent, 11 
percent, and 1 percent of the 
population of Addis Ababa uses pit latrines, septic tanks, and 
sewerage 
lines, respectively. In 
general, the total fraction of the city waste water treated 
anaerobically 
is (0.11 + 0.01) 0.12 percent. 
Therefore, the annual CH<sub>4</sub> emissions is calculated 
applying the following 
formula:

<p>CH<sub>4</sub> emissions = (POP<sub>y</sub> x 
BOD<sub>5</sub>/capita-day x
365 days x EF x Fr) - MR<sub>y</sub><br>
<p><h3>Methane Emissions from Industrial Waste Water</h3>
Methane emissions from industrial waste water treatment are 
dependent on 
waste water outflow 
from industry. In Ethiopia, there are many small and large scale 
industries 
which produce waste 
water containing concentrations of organic material likely to produce 
significant quantities of CH<sub>4</sub> 
emission. The methane emission from all Ethiopian industries waste 
water 
has been computed 
applying the following formula:

<p>CH<sub>4</sub> emissions = &#133 {(WWO)<sub>i,y</sub> x 
((BOD<sub>5</sub>)<sub>i,y</sub> x (EF)<sub>i,y</sub> x 
(FWWTA)<sub>i,y</sub>)} - 
MR<sub>y</sub><br>
<h2 align=center>CO<SUB>2</SUB> EMISSIONS FROM CEMENT 
FACTORIES</h2>
<p>Cement production is the most notable example of an industrial 
transformation process that releases 
a significant amount of CO<SUB>2</SUB>. CO<SUB>2</SUB> released 
from cement 
factories is 
produced during the production of clinker, an intermediate product 
from 
which cement is produced. 
The basic formula used to compute CO<SUB>2</SUB> emission is:

<p>CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions = Physical unit of production (t) x
Emission Factor (tCO<SUB>2</SUB>/t product)<br>
<h2 align=center>INVENTORY RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</h2>
Input statistical data used to calculate GHG emissions from 
consumption of 
fossil fuels, traditional 
fuels, bagasse and animal population, amount of agri-residues and 
Addis 
Ababa landfills were 
collected between the first of July (Ethiopian fiscal year) and the end 
of 
June for each year. 
Therefore, GHG emissions released annually from the above sources 
are 
reported for those years 
where sufficient data were available for calculating emissions.
<p>Inventory output from the abovementioned sources show that in 
all the years 
reported the major 
emissions were carbon monoxide from traditional fuels, carbon 
dioxide from 
fossil fuels, methane 
emissions from livestock enteric fermentation, carbon monoxide from 
agri-residues, and 
methane 
from traditional fuels. Although very low in quantity compared to 
the 
abovementioned emissions, 
significant quantities of emissions like oxides of nitrogen emitted 
from 
traditional fuels, methane 
emissions from manure, carbon dioxide from bagasse, methane 
emissions from 
agri-residues, nitrous 
oxide from agri-residues, and traditional fuels have been released 
from 
1987-88 to 1992-93.
<p>Information used to calculate emissions from onsite burning of 
natural 
forests, savanna burning, 
municipal solid and liquid waste, industrial waste water, and cement 
factory has been collected 
between January and December of the mentioned years.
Inventory output from the above sources shows that carbon dioxide 
from 
onsite burning of natural 
forests, carbon monoxide from savanna burning, methane from 
municipal 
liquid waste of Addis 
Ababa, carbon monoxide from natural forests, and carbon dioxide 
from cement 
factories, 
respectively, were the gases with the highest emissions in the years 
mentioned.<br>

<p>SUMMARY: This report provides the overall approach and some 
results of the work 
of the "Kazakhstan Climate Change Study" project in three main 
areas: inventory of 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and sinks, mitigation assessment, 
and vulnerability 
assessment. In the first area, the information on greenhouse gas 
sources and some 
sinks, estimates of emissions and removals for Republic of 
Kazakhstan for 1990, as 
well as a brief description of the methodology used to evaluate these 
estimates and 
the associated uncertainties are given. An estimation of future 
CO<SUB>2</SUB> 
emissions from 1990 through 2000 is also presented. For the 
mitigation assessment, 
the principal methods and approaches for evaluating mitigation 
options for six sectors 
and some possible results in the energy sector are provided. The 
vulnerability 
assessment is addressing the following sectors: agriculture, forestry, 
and water 
resources. The methodology for this assessment, which includes both 
empirical-statistical 
and simulation approaches, is described. Also, this article discusses 
some 
preliminary results and uncertainties of the vulnerability assessment 
on the basis of 
GCM-based climate change scenarios associated with increasing 
CO<SUB>2</SUB> 
concentrations in the atmosphere.<br>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>INTRODUCTION</H2>
<p>Unfavorable consequences of climate change in connection with 
anthropogenic increase of 
the 
concentrations of CO<SUB>2</SUB> and other greenhouse gases in the 
atmosphere generate 
concern throughout the world and in Kazakhstan, too. The Republic of 
Kazakhstan is one of 
the 150 
countries that signed the United Nations Framework Convention on 
Climate Change (UNFCCC). 
The Kazakhstan Government supports international cooperation on 
climate change issues. 
<p>The Republic of Kazakhstan covers 2,717,000 sq km with a 
population of over 17 million. 
The Republic consists of 19 regions, 220 districts, and over 80 cities 
and towns.
<p>The Republic consumes about 10 million tons of coal, and its coal 
reserves are 
estimated at 39 
billion tons. Oil production amounts to 26.6 million tons with the 
reserves estimated at 
about 2,357 
million tons. There are also deposits of natural gas. The production of 
electric power 
exceeds 90 
billion kWh including over 82 billion kWh produced by thermal 
stations. Per capita 
electric power 
consumption is 6,100 kWh annually. 
<p>The sowing areas of Kazakhstan exceed 35 million hectares 
including about three million 
hectares of irrigated land. The gross yield of grain is 25 to 30 million 
tons per year. 
Part of the grain 
is exported. The leading branch of animal husbandry is sheep 
breeding based on desert and 
semidesert pastures which occupy vast expanses. The number of 
cattle livestock is 9 
million. Pigs, 
camels, and horses are also bred.
<p>Forests in Kazakhstan occupy a small area, only 3.6 percent of the 
total territory 
(9,648,000 
ha). Out of these, 1,800,000 ha are covered with coniferous forests, 
and the rest with 
leaf-bearing 
woods and shrubs. The largest portion, 4.7 million ha, is covered with 
saksaul.
<p>The U.S.-Kazakhstan Project, "Kazakhstan Climate Change Study," 
was initiated on 
October 
1, 1993. The main objectives of this project are to carry out the 
following: 
<ul>
<li>An inventory of sources and sinks of greenhouse gases
<li>An analysis of mitigation options to reduce emissions or enhance 
sinks
<li>An assessment of vulnerabilities of agriculture, water resources 
and forestry to the 
impacts of 
climate change and an evaluation of the options to adapt to these 
potential impacts</ul>
Two committees have been organized for the fulfillment of these 
activities. These are the 
governmental and working committees. The representatives of nine 
Ministries and 
Departments of 
Kazakhstan take part in the implementation of the project. The 
Laboratory of Climate 
Change Study 
was established in the Kazakh Scientific Research 
Hydrometeorological Institute (KazNIGMI) 
to 
coordinate the work on the project.<br>
<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>METHODS</H2>
<h3><p>Inventory of GHG Emission and Sinks</h3>
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), together 
with other international 
scientific 
organizations (United Nations Environmental Program, Organization 
for Economic Cooperation 
and 
Development, Global Environment Facility, International Energy 
Agency, etc.), has prepared 
the 
methodology that was used for this work (IPCC Draft Guidelines for 
National Greenhouse Gas 
Inventories, 1994). These guidelines provide for comparison and 
estimation of the 
authenticity of 
work obtained in different countries. 
<p>Information about yearly fuel consumption of all fuels for 1990 is 
the basis for the 
calculation 
of GHG (greenhouse gases) emission from HPSs (heat power station) 
and large boiler-houses. 
Also, 
the year 1990 conforms to the IPCC recommendation. This 
information was obtained from the 
documents of the State Statistical Accounts. The yearly fuel 
consumption is recorded in 
tons for 
every HPS and for their sources of supply (e.g., deposit, oil refineries, 
etc.). Knowing 
the percentage 
content of carbon dioxide in every fuel, we can determine the 
quantity of carbon dioxide 
burned by 
simple multiplication of this percent by the volume of consumed fuel. 
<p>However, the methodology of IPCC can be difficult to apply. This is 
possibly connected 
with 
the fact that some countries do not have as good an initial data base 
as Kazakhstan does. 
For 
comparison of our results with data of other countries and to use the 
IPCC software, we 
made our 
calculations with IPCC methods. 
<p><h3>Mitigation Analysis</h3>
The aim of Kazakhstan's mitigation analysis is to develop 
recommendations about options to 
decrease GHG emissions and increase CO<SUB>2</SUB> absorptions by 
vegetation. All the 
possibilities of GHG emission decrease in the branches of Kazakhstan 
economy were 
evaluated 
taking into account both their benefits and costs. The scope of these 
branches includes 
energy, 
industrial, transportation, residential and commercial, agriculture, 
and forestry sectors. 
The 
evaluation of the total potential for decrease of GHG emissions in 
Kazakhstan will be 
based on two 
scenarios relating to "pessimistic" and "optimistic" hypotheses of 
development of the 
Kazakhstan 
economy for period through the year 2020.
<p>The methodology will consist of the calculations of the likely 
decrease of GHG 
emissions 
with fuel switching, the introduction of the new technologies, the 
increased use of 
renewable energy 
sources, more active use of CH<SUB>4</SUB>, and other options. The 
official state 
statistical data 
will be used. If these data are not available, the methods of balance 
accounts will apply. 
The latter 
are based on data which were obtained by the Scientific Research 
Institutes of Kazakhstan 
as well as 
on calculation of specific coefficients contained in the IPCC 
methodology.
<p>The creation of scenarios of economic development will take into 
account the predicted 
assessments of the Departments of Trade Ministry, Kazakhstan 
Ministry of Economics (former 
State 
Planning Committee of Kazakhstan) and Kazakhstan Institute of 
Economics of Academy of 
Science. 
To carry out the mitigation analysis in the energy sector the ENPEP 
model&#139  developed 
by 
Argonne National Laboratory&#139 will be used.
<p><h3>Vulnerability Assessment</h3>
The climate change vulnerability assessment in Kazakhstan is 
addressing the following 
sectors: 
crops, potatoes, grasslands, sheep-breeding, water resources, and 
forestry. These sectors 
have been 
chosen as being of the widest interest to our country and as having 
the most 
susceptibility to climate 
change.
<p>The first step in the vulnerability assessment was the 
development of future climate 
change 
scenarios. Scenarios of the main climate change for Kazakhstan to 
asses both long-term 
(doubling 
CO<SUB>2</SUB> in 2050&#139 2075) and short-term (2010, 2030) 
impacts were prepared. The 
climate change under a doubling of CO<SUB>2</SUB> was obtained on 
the basis of General 
Circulation Models (GCM) outputs. We used outputs of three GCMs: 
the model of Canadian 
Meteorological Center (CCCM) (Boer et al., 1991), the model of 
Geophysical Fluid Dynamics 
Laboratory (GFDL) (Manage and Wetherald, 1987), and a transitional 
version of the same 
model 
(GFDL-Transient).
<p>The near-term climate scenarios were obtained using the 
Probabilistic Forecast Model 
(PFM) 
(Gruza and Rankova, 1991) we adapted to Kazakhstan (Pilifosova, 
1991) for the year 2010 
and the 
results of GFDL&#139T for 2030. Moreover, to evaluate future 
climate changes for 
comparison, a 
baseline climate scenario was used. This scenario represents the 
current climate for the 
base period 
1951&#139 1980 without a warming trend in the baseline. 
<p>The assessment of vulnerability in some sectors was based on 
models developed in 
Kazakhstan. Thus, for the estimation of yield of agricultural crops and 
grasslands we used 
a 
nonstationary dynamic model that had been developed by KazNIGMI 
several years ago (Lebed 
and 
Belenkova, 1991). A similar model was employed for estimating the 
yield of potatoes 
(Glumova, 
1988). An assessment of the vulnerability of sheep-breeding was 
carried out on the basis 
of an 
unfavorable weather conditions criterion for sheep productivity 
(Gulinova, 1988). A 
mathematical 
runoff model was applied in the water resources sector (Golubtsov et 
al., 1989).
<p>In general, the main principle for application of these models to 
the vulnerability 
assessment 
was defined as follows. Different climate variables (air temperature, 
insolation, 
humidity, rainfall, 
etc.) were used as model input parameters. The simulation first was 
run under the current 
climate 
conditions in accordance with a baseline climate scenario. Then input 
climate parameters 
were 
changed according to the regional climate change scenarios and used 
in another simulation. 
The 
difference between these simulation outputs represented the 
changes in the yield of 
agricultural 
crops, grasslands, livestock (sheep), water resources, and forests, 
which occurred due to 
climate 
change impacts.
<p>Obviously, in a number of cases the application of these models 
required the transition 
of 
climate parameters from one space-time averaging scale into 
another. For example, monthly 
means 
of air temperature and precipitation were obtained from the GCMs. 
But models of the yield 
of 
agricultural crops require the 10-day mean data. After the data 
adaptation and fitting of 
model 
parameters, analysis of the model sensitivity to different changes 
(e.g. incremental 
scenarios) of 
input climate parameters was conducted. For example, the estimation 
of vulnerability of 
crops and 
sheep when air temperature is increased by 0.5&#176 C through 
4.0&#176 C was conducted. 
Input 
data included observed climatic data from numerous reference 
books, data on crops 
productivity of 
The State Committee on Statistics and some experimental data from 
agricultural fields.
<p>In addition to models developed in Kazakhstan, we used the 
DSSAT (Decision Support 
System for Agrotechnology Transfer) model. DSSAT integrates the 
models which generally 
describe 
the development, growth and yield of crops on homogenous area of 
soil exposed to certain 
weather 
conditions. This system was useful for running and validating the 
models, for conducting 
sensitivity 
analysis, and for evaluating the variability and risks of different 
management strategies 
for a range of 
locations specified by soil and weather data. The CERES-Wheat model 
(Ritchie, Otter, 1985) 
from 
DSSAT developed by IBSNAT (International Benchmark Sites 
Agrotechnology Transfer) was used 
for spring and winter wheat productivity vulnerability assessment in 
Kazakhstan, which was 
based 
on the GFDL and CCCM scenarios.
<p>The Holdridge Model was used for the assessment of vulnerability 
of forestry. We 
prepared 
the distribution of Holdridge life zones (Holdridge, 1967) under the 
current climate 
conditions as 
well as the maps of these zones for four climate change scenarios on 
the basis of GCM 
outputs for a 
doubling of CO<SUB>2</SUB> levels in the atmosphere: GISS (Hansen 
et al., 1983), UKMO 
(Wilson and Mitchell, 1987), OSU (Shlesinger and Zhao, 1989), and 
GFDL. These GCM outputs 
were built into the Holdridge model.
<p>The Holdridge model relates the current spatial distribution of 
vegetation to features 
of the 
climate system. The Holdridge classification is suitable for examining 
the broad-scale 
patterns of 
vegetation as they relate to climate and how changes in climate 
patterns may influence the 
suitability 
of a region to support different vegetation/forest types. However, 
this approach does not 
address 
vegetation processes per se and as such cannot be used to predict the 
temporal dynamics of 
species 
composition and stand productivity, features that are important in 
evaluating the 
potential impacts of 
environmental change on forest resources and conservation. In order 
to make up the maps of 
the 
territorial distribution of forest we chose the additional scheme, 
which connected the 
forests 
distribution with a precipitation and evapotranspiration (PET) model.
<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>RESULTS</H2>
<P><h3Inventory of GHG Emission and Sinks</h3>
The GHG emission inventory for the Kazakhstan territory for 1990 
was completed following 
the 
IPCC methodology. The largest stationary sources include HPSs and 
district boiler houses, 
23 
enterprises of the ferrous and nonferrous metal industry, 11 
enterprises of the oil and 
gas industry, 8 
enterprises of the chemical industry, 5 of the largest machine-
building plants, and 10 
cement and 
asbestos plants (all together 105 enterprises). The emissions from 
other fuel consuming 
enterprises 
(i.e., food and light industries, municipal economy, agriculture and 
cattle-breeding) were 
also taken 
into account. The nonstationary sources such as 
internal-combustion engines on automobiles, locomotives, air-crafts 
and river-boats, on 
agricultural 
and constructional engineering were defined as separate sources.
<p>The results of calculations of annual CO<SUB>2</SUB>, 
CH<SUB>4</SUB>, CO, 
N<sub>2</sub>O, NO<sub>x</sub> and nonmethane volatile compounds 
emissions are divided 
into 13 groups:  
<ul>
<li>Heat power station and big boiler houses
<li>Fuel extraction, processing and transportation
<li>Ferrous and nonferrous metal industry
<li>Chemical industry
<li>Building materials production
<li>Mechanical engineering and electrotechnics
<li>Food and light industry
<li>Cattle-breeding
<li>Agriculture
<li.Nonstationary sourcesinternal-combustion engines
<Li>Residential boiler-houses and stoves
<li>Landfills and wastewater treatment
<li>Solvents production</ul>
Estimates of emissions of nitrous oxide, carbon monoxide and 
nonmethane volatile compounds 
were 
obtained from the records at the State Statistical Accounts. Emissions 
of carbon dioxide, 
methane, 
and nitrous oxide have been determined by balance calculations 
taking into account real 
fuel 
consumption, quantity of cattle, rice area, and other data. The 
emission factors 
recommended by 
IPCC and regional institutes were used in the calculations. Values of 
specific GHG 
emissions of 
internal combustion engines were obtained from the Kazakh 
Scientific Research Institute of 
Motor 
Transport.
<p>As a result, both the summary emissions of all six GHGs for 1990 
and the contribution 
of 
separate sources (or branches of industry) were defined. The 
calculation results are 
presented in <a href="gifs/KazakhstanTab1.gif">Table 1</a>. The 
results are expressed in 
gigagrams (Gg) in accordance with the IPCC. More 
than 90 
percent of all GHG emissions is, as expected, from CO<SUB>2</SUB> 
(198,729 Gg or nearly 
200 
million ton/yr). Thus the per capita CO<SUB>2</SUB> emission is over 
11 tons/yr.
<p>CO<SUB>2</SUB> absorption from the atmosphere by forests of 
Kazakhstan was estimated. 
The calculations have shown that forests absorb up to 1,530 Gg/yr or 
less than 2.55 of the 
total 
emissions.
<p>The largest sources of CO<SUB>2</SUB> emission are heat power 
stations and district 
boiler-houses (48.5 percent), residential boiler-houses and stoves 
(17.2 percent), 
internal combustion 
engines (ICE) (12.9 percent), and enterprises of ferrous and 
nonferrous metallurgy (5.2 
percent). The 
largest sources of NO<sub>x</sub> emission are ICEs (53.7 percent) 
and heat power stations 
(36.4 
percent). The largest sources of CH<SUB>4</SUB> emission are from 
solid waste open dumps 
and 
wastewater treatment (49.5 percent) and from agriculture (27 
percent). The largest sources 
of CO 
emissions are ICEs (67.8 percent), metallurgy (18.3 percent), 
residential boiler-houses 
and stoves 
(3.2 percent). Data are presented in percentages of the total 
emissions of the respective 
gas.
<p>In accordance with the IPCC guidelines, the estimation of the 
initial data reliability 
(uncertainty) was made. The most reliable are the data on heat 
power stations, which give 
49,5 
percent of the total emission of CO<SUB>2</SUB>, 39 percent of the 
total emission of 
NO<sub>x</sub>, and 19 percent of the total emission of CO. The data 
were obtained by the 
analyses of CO and NO<sub>x</sub> contained in waste gases, and 
CO<SUB>2</SUB> was 
obtained by the balance calculations. The probabilistic errors here do 
not exceed 5 
percent. In other 
branches of industry the power registration data are not highly 
accurate so that possible 
errors are 
within the limits of 20 percent. The most unreliable calculation 
results are those 
connected with ICE 
(13 percent of CO<SUB>2</SUB> emission, 53.7 percent of 
NO<sub>x</sub> emission and 67 
percent of CO emission).
As for the estimation of the authenticity of the data, the comparison 
of our indices with 
the data 
reported by the State Statistical Committee showed that variations on 
separate gases were 
within the 
limits of 5&#1139 20 percent. For example, the total NO<sub>x</sub> 
emission from 
stationary 
sources in 1990 was 330 Gg in the State Statistical Committee data 
but it was 314.7 Gg in 
our 
calculations. The emission indices for residential boiler-houses and 
stoves are the most 
unreliable, 
but these emissions are not high.
<p>In <a href="gifs/KazakhstanTab2.gif>Table 2</a> the predicted data 
of CO<SUB>2</SUB> 
emission 
for the period from 1991 to 
2000 taking into account expert assessments and fuel consumption of 
main branches of 
economy are 
shown. These data show that the total CO<SUB>2</SUB> emission 
volume for the decade from 
Kazakhstan territory will be 1,582,000 Gg. At the same time 
CO<SUB>2</SUB> absorption by 
forests is estimated at 40,000 Gg. Thus, the difference (without 
consideration of 
CO<SUB>2</SUB> absorption by other reservoirs) will be 1,542,000 Gg.
<p><h3Mitigation</hr>
The results of an evaluation of options to mitigate net emissions of 
greenhouse gases in 
the energy 
sector by the reconstruction and modernization of old HPSs, and the 
use of steam-gas 
cycles is 
presented. The decrease of specific fuel consumption from 350 g 
c.f./kWh (grammies 
conventional 
fuel/kWh)(on Rankine cycle) to 190 or 160 g c.f./kWh is achieved 
with electric power 
output by 
central heating. In addition the specific CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions 
decrease by 480 g 
c.f./kWh. 
When additional electric power is produced by central heating cycle 
the decrease of 
CO<SUB>2</SUB> emission is estimated to be 25,872 Gg for 1996-
2020. 
<p>The Aktubinsk HPS building that will use a steam-gas cycle and 
produce 954 NW of power 
and 6 billion kWh annual electric power production will be 
completed in 2000. Similar 
powerplants 
with less capacity are expected to be put into operation in Uralsk and 
Atyrau (in 2000-
2005). The 
problem of replacing traditional steam turbine engines with gas 
turbines in Uralsk 
HPS&#139 1, 
Atyrau HPS, Shimkent HPS&#139 1, HPS&#139 2, Jambyl HPS&#139 
3, Jambyl state district 
electric power station (SDEPS) is being studied. When energy is 
produced by steam-gas HPSs 
the 
CO<SUB>2</SUB> emission will decrease by 11,988 Gg. The total 
decrease of 
CO<SUB>2</SUB> emission from energy sources is estimated at 37,860 
Gg. 
<p>Concerning the use of renewable sources, the most promising 
project is the development 
of a 
wind-electrical station "Jungarskie vorota" with 300 megawatts 
power and 900 billion kWh 
annual 
power production. In addition the wind-electric engines in the Chilick 
corridor, Kurday 
passage, 
Jengiz-To, Derjavinka, and Mugojary are projected to be put into 
operation. Also wind-
electric 
engines with small capacity are planned for remote locations for 
water pumping, heating 
and 
electricity generation. The decrease of CO<SUB>2</SUB> emission 
associated with renewable 
energy options will be 4,627.2 Gg for 1996&#139 2020.
<P><h3>Vulnerability Assessment</h3>
As a result of the above described approaches, "optimistic" (GFDL) 
and "pessimistic" 
(CCCM) 
scenarios under 2 x CO<SUB>2</SUB> conditions, were defined. GFDL-
Transient outputs give 
an 
"intermediate" scenario. According to the GFDL model, a minimum 
increase of temperature is 
expected in summer, when most of territory will be 4&#139 5&#176 
C warmer. The maximum 
(about 8&#176 C) is expected to be in the winter. The mean annual 
temperature increase is 
about 
5&#176 C. According to CCCM, the mean annual temperature increase 
is 7&#176 C and the 
maximum is of 12&#176 C in the spring. In most cases, the relative 
changes of 
precipitation will be 
in the range of 0.8&#139 1.2 or 80&#139 120 percent (i.e., within 
the normal limits).
<p>Our calculations based on the observed data in Kazakhstan show 
that the rise of annual 
average air temperature is 1&#176 C/100 years and this is 
approximately twice as much as 
the mean 
global rise of temperature. The analysis of prediction curves of 
temperature and 
precipitation with 
the use of the PFM model has allowed us to conclude that the rise of 
CO<SUB>2</SUB> 
concentration in the atmosphere will cause an average rise of 
aridness (the increase of 
temperature 
and decrease of precipitation) all over the region. The highest rise of 
temperature will 
be 6&#176 C 
in comparison with the mean temperature for 1951&#139 80. It is 
expected to occur in the 
cooler 
half of the year in the North of Kazakhstan. For the rest of the 
territory of the 
Republic, an increase 
in the temperature of 1&#139 3&#176 C in the summer and 3&#139 
4&#176 C in the winter is 
expected by 2010. 
<p>There is a significant probability that the increase of 
CO<SUB>2</SUB> concentration 
may 
cause some increase in atmospheric precipitation in the south and 
southwest, and an 
increase of 
aridness in the west and in the northeast Kazakhstan in the winter. 
In the summer a 
decrease of 
precipitation of 20&#139 50 percent is expected for all of 
Kazakhstan, except for the 
western 
regions.
<p><h3>Crops</h3>
To estimate the possible impacts of climate change on wheat 
production in the main wheat 
producing regions of Kazakhstan, the DSSAT model was used. The 
DSSAT model combines the 
CERES-wheat crop growth model under GFDL and CCCM scenarios. The 
GFDL scenario shows 
the spring and winter wheat yield increasing in Western and Central 
Kazakhstan by 
approximately 
10 percent and 5 percent, respectively. However, in Northern 
Kazakhstan the yield 
decreases 
approximately by 12 percent. According to the CCCM scenario, the 
spring wheat yield would 
decrease by 35 percent and the winter yield would not decrease 
significantly. Note that 
the yields 
changes under the baseline scenario are about 2&#139 4 percent.
<p>The results of the preliminary analysis on the basis of our models 
of crops 
vulnerability made 
for Western Kazakhstan show that the increase of air temperature 
for the period of shoot 
ripening of 
spring wheat causes significant deterioration of the thermal regime 
by 20&#139 50 percent 
relative 
to optimal conditions. In this case the forecast crops yield is expected 
not to be above 
0.22&#139 0.44 ton/ha. In comparison the spring wheat yield was 
0,82 ton/ha in 1991.
<p><h3>Grasslands</h3>
For the region located north of the Aral Sea the possible increase of 
air temperature in 
the vegetative 
season of 2&#176 C is accompanied by some increase in grassland 
productivity (6&#139 20 
percent). These increased temperatures may allow for a change in 
precipitation in the cool 
season of 
30&#176 40 mm resulting in changes in feed productivity ranging 
from -18 to + 12 percent. 
A 
considerable decrease of productivity up to 40&#139 50 percent 
from existing level is 
estimated 
with temperature increases of 2 to 3&#176 C. The possible climate 
changes due to a 
CO<SUB>2</SUB> doubling scenario (e.g., GFDL model) may cause a 
2&#139 3 times decrease in 
feed productivity on Priaralie grasslands in the summer-autumn 
period with some increase 
in its 
reserves in the spring.
<p><h3>Potato</h3>
The preliminary results on potato productivity were obtained for 
five North Kazakhstan 
regions. The 
calculations of dynamics of dry potato biomass during the vegetation 
season show the 
potential for 
considerable decrease of water storage in soil level. A 5mm decline 
in water levels would 
decrease 
productivity by 5&#139 8 percent and a decrease of water storage of 
20 mm causes 
productivity 
losses of 20&#139 26 percent.
Increasing the air temperature by 0.5&#176 C decreases potato 
productivity by 2&#139 3 
percent. 
An increase of air temperature by 2&#176 C causes a productivity 
decline by 6&#139 10 
percent.
<p><h3>Sheep-breeding</h3>
In estimating vulnerability of sheep-breeding the data from 
observations of sheep pasture 
conditions 
for 1959&#139 1990 and biometeorological parameters defined 
earlier by other researchers 
were 
used. If the number of days in a ten day period with stable hot 
weather (SHW) equal 6 or 
more, a 
decrease of sheep weight is observed. Such unfavorable hot periods 
which repeat one after 
another 
and form a whole period with SHW are being currently observed in 
the South and East-South 
of 
Kazakhstan. An increase of air temperature of 1&#176 C in May and 
June causes an increase 
of the 
average SHW duration of 3 to 6 days. The SHW duration increases 
slightly less (by 2 to 4 
days) with 
rising air temperature in August and September. If temperatures in 
both periods increase 
at the same 
time by 2&#176 C, the average duration of SHW periods will increase 
by almost two weeks. 
Changes in atmospheric precipitation in the summer months do not 
significantly change the 
duration 
of the SHW period.
<p><h3Water Resources<//h3>
The preliminary results of the probable influence of climate change 
on the basis of the 
three GCM 
scenarios on water resources of managed river basins in Kazakhstan 
were obtained. Water 
resources 
runoff in the highlands of Kazakhstan increased by 6&#139 12 
percent in year 2030 under 
the 
CFDL&#139 T scenario. However, the water resources runoff is 
reduced by 20&#139 30 percent 
under 2xCO<SUB>2</SUB> conditions occurring later in the century 
according to the CCCM and 
GFDL scenarios, respectively.
<p><strong>Forestry</strong><br>
Having analyzed the discrepancies obtained by the Holdridge (PET) 
model we have calculated 
the 
forest and forest-steppe zones in correspondence with the 2  
CO<SUB>2</SUB> climate 
conditions predicted by 4 models (GISS, UKMO, GFDL, OSU). The most 
pessimistic results 
were 
obtained using the UKMO model. According to this model only the 
northern part of the 
Republic 
(the stripe with the width of 70&#139 150 km located along the 
Northern boundary) remains 
a forest- 
steppe zone. The area suitable for forest growth according to UKMO 
model is expected to be 
15 
percent of that for current climate.

<p>According to 2xCO<SUB>2</SUB> OSU scenario, the forest area 
remains in its present-day 
boundaries. The area of forest-steppe zone according to the IET 
model is decreased along 
the 
Southern and Western boundary (50&#139 70 km). 
The most optimistic scenario of the forestry is obtained according to 
the climate change 
scenario 
based on the GISS model. It is the only one of four models which 
predicts the increase of 
suitable 
areas for the growth of the forests due to a probable climate 
warming. The boundary of 
steppe-
forest-steppe is moved by 120&#139 180 km towards the south and 
the west. According to 
this scenario 
the areas suitable for forests growth are increased 1.6&#139 1.8 
times.
<p>The impacts of the scenarios of GFDL and the OSU scenarios are 
midway between the 
impacts of 
the GISS and the UKMO scenarios.

<H3 align=center>DISCUSSION</h3>
Conducting our work on the Kazakhstan Climate Change Study 
Project, we came across a 
number of 
uncertainties and problems. One of them is related to the assessment 
of future GHG 
emission in our 
country <a href="gifs/KazakhstanTab2.gif">(Table)</a>. At the present 
time it is difficult to predict reliably the volume of GHG emissions for 
the period from 1991 to 2000. The state authorities in Kazakhstan 
have changed after the USSR was split up, specifically authorities 
such as the State Planning Committee have been dismantled.  For 60 
years from 1927, the planning and development of the national 
economy (in which the share of the private sector was minimal) was 
led by the government of the USSR in accordance with confirmed 
five- or seven-year plans. There are no such plans at the 
Departments and the role of private sector productive forces 
increases while that of state-owned sector decreases. As a result of 
that, it is impossible to receive any information from government 
offices. That is why we had to rely on expert evaluations.

<p>The central problem with the mitigation analysis is the cost 
assessment of the mitigation options in view of the economical 
declines, especially production declines and inflation. It is a 
difficult challenge to predict the development of these processes 
now.
<P>There are two principal sources of uncertainties in the 
vulnerability assessment. The first is associated with uncertainty of 
the climate change scenarios particularly at a regional 
level. It is 
known that increased greenhouse gas emissions will likely raise 
global temperatures and 
precipitation; however, no reliable suggestions can be made about 
their regional effect.
<P>The second source of uncertainties arises from the imperfection of 
the models used in 
assessment of local conditions. The use of the DSSAT model demands 
input parameters which do not correspond to our data. For example, 
information about tillage, chemical composition of fertilization are 
not available. We often are limited in availability of current 
meteorological information for the input parameters of models. In 
this case we have to use the Weather Generators, which do not take 
into account the local climatic diversity of our regions. The DSSAT 
model is also oriented for local fields, while we need to obtain 
estimates for the whole Kazakhstan region. 
<p>Similar problems are connected with the use of the Holdridge 
model. In mountain regions the vertical zonality is formed, which is 
simulated poorly where the resolution of the database set (0.5*0.5 
degrees) is small. Furthermore, such territories contain areas 
(especially hollows and canyons) which exist due to additional water-
flow from the surrounding slopes. The result is that if the 
evapotranspiration exceeds the precipitation, the vegetation is still 
formed. Although this forest vegetation is of fragmentary character, 
the total area of these territories may be considerable. Neither the 
Holdridge model nor the PET model consider these specific conditions 
which cause errors in vegetation classification.

<P>Both models fail to predict the pine forests propagation due to the 
fact that the 
ordinary 
pine is a 
drought-resistant species under the current conditions of Kazakhstan. 
It forms forests 
when the 
deficit of precipitation is 250mm or more. The ordinary pine grows 
under such conditions 
only on 
the sands with good aeration, developing powerful root systems, 
which can reach soil 
waters. The 
soil types are not considered in these models.
<P>Therefore we tried to use the models worked out in KazNIGMI for 
the vulnerability 
assessment in 
agriculture and water resources sectors. But of course, the models we 
used have their own 
advantages and disadvantages. Advantages of these models are their 
good fitting for 
geographic, 
climate, and other peculiarities of the region of Kazakhstan and the 
use of observed data 
as inputs of 
model. The major disadvantage is that they first were made for near-
term projections 
(month, season, 
timeframe) and then were modified for this vulnerability 
assessment. So we have to 
transform data 
from one time-scale averaging to another. This introduced additional 
uncertainties.

<h2 align=center>CONCLUSIONS</h2>
The main conclusions of this work are as follows:
<ul>
<p><li>As a result of the inventory of GHG emission and sinks the 
summary emission of all six 
GHGs for 
1990 and the contribution of separate sources (or branches of 
industry) were defined. More 
than 
90 percent of all GHG emissions by mass are from CO<SUB>2</SUB>, 
198,729 Gg or nearly 
200 million ton/yr. Thus, more than 11 tons of CO<SUB>2</SUB> are 
emitted on a per capita 
basis in Kazakhstan every year. CO<SUB>2</SUB> absorption from the 
atmosphere by the 
forests of Kazakhstan was estimated to be up to 1,530 Gg or less than 
2.5 percent of total 
emissions. The most authentic data are the data for heat power 
stations, which give 49,5 
percent of 
the total emissions of CO<SUB>2</SUB>, 39 percent of the total 
emission of NO<sub>x</sub>, 
and 19 
percent of the total emission of CO. The data were obtained by the 
analyses of CO and 
NO<sub>x</sub> 
contained in waste gases, and the CO<SUB>2</SUB> estimates were 
obtained by balance 
calculations. The probabilistic error here don't exceed 5 percent.
<p><li>The assessment of possible decreases of CO<SUB>2</SUB> emission 
in the energy sector 
by the 
reconstruction and modernization of the old HPSs and putting into 
operation steam-gas 
cycles as 
well as replacing HPS by renewable resources was carried out. 
Additional electric power 
production by central heating cycles is liable to decrease 
CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions by 
25,872 Gg. Energy production in steam gas HPSs is liable to decrease 
CO<SUB>2</SUB> 
emissions by 11,988 Gg. The total possible decrease of 
CO<SUB>2</SUB> emission from 
energy sources is 37,860 Gg for 1996&#139 2020. The utilization of 
the wind energy is apt 
to 
decrease 
CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions by 4,627.2 Gg for 1996&#139 2020.
<p><li>Based on the observed data, the rise of mean annual temperature 
in Kazakhstan for the 
period of 
1891&#139 1990 of 1oC is approximately twice the mean global 
increase. According to the 
GCM 
scenarios (GFDL, CCCM, GFDL-T), the mean annual temperature in 
Kazakhstan will increase by 
5.0-6.9&#176 C by the time a doubling of CO<SUB>2</SUB> is 
observed. By 2010 there is 
expected 
to be an increase of 2-3&#176 C (CDFM scenario). Corresponding 
changes in precipitation 
are less 
significant.
<p><li>The preliminary vulnerability assessments based on the DSSAT 
model for 
2xCO<SUB>2</SUB> 
conditions show that the spring and winter wheat yields would 
decrease by 12 percent in 
Northern 
Kazakhstan. But the crops model of KazNIGMI gives spring wheat 
yields twice below those of 
1991 if the warming is 2-3&#176 C compared with current climate.
The grasslands of Central Kazakhstan would decrease by 2-3 times 
under 2xCO<SUB>2</SUB> 
conditions. Potato productivity is decreased by 6-10 percent if the 
warming will be 2&#176 
C.
<p><li>In the South and Southeast parts of the country, the potential 
climate change will 
cause the 
decrease of sheep weight and the expansion of areas where the heat-
resistant Strakhan 
sheep graze 
will move to the North. Zooclimatic conditions in the semiarid zone of 
South Pribalkhashie 
will 
be like the present conditions of South Kazakhstan where the 
Strakhan sheep are being 
maintained.
<p><li>As for water resources, the vulnerability assessment has been 
completed only for 
mountain basins. 
In these regions Kazakhstan's water resources will not vary 
significantly if climate is 
changed 
according to the GFDL Transient scenario for doubling of 
CO<SUB>2</SUB> concentrations. 
The intermediate CO<SUB>2</SUB> concentration levels associated 
with 2030 result in an 
increase of water resources runoff of about 6-12 percent. In the case 
of the CCCM and GFDL 
scenarios for a CO<SUB>2</SUB> doubling, it is anticipated that the 
water resource runoff 
will 
decrease by 20-30 percent.
<p><li>For forests, the most pessimistic scenario is obtained with the use 
of UKMO model. 
In accordance 
with this scenario the extremely northern part of the Republic (the 
zone with a width of 
70-150 
km along the north boundary) remains within the forest-steppe zone. 
The forest boundaries 
are not 
changed if the climate will be as the OSU model gives. The most 
optimistic prediction for 
forestry 
is based on the GISS model. It is the only scenario of the four 
variants which does not 
simulate a 
restriction of the territory suitable for the forest growth.
Thus the preliminary estimation of the vulnerability of Kazakhstan's 
resources have shown 
that the 
expected rise in the temperature of Kazakhstan's climate following 
the increase of GHG 
concentration in atmosphere will lead to unfortunate results in many 
regions, although 
several of 
the results are contradictory. Some of the reasons for this were noted 
earlier. In this 
article, only 
the first part of our vulnerability and adaptation assessment is being 
presented. Our 
preliminary 
results need to be refined. An assessment of the economic 
consequences and a series of 
recommendations for adaptation measures for the agricultural, 
water, and forestry sectors 
to be 
presented to the policymakers, will be prepared.</ul><br>

<strong>Department of National Parks and Wildlife</strong><br>

<p>SUMMARY: Malawi is one of the countries that have ratified the 
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). 
Under this Convention, parties to the Convention must communicate 
to the Conference of the Parties (COP) their national inventories of 
anthropogenic emissions of all greenhouse gases by sources and sinks 
using comparative methodologies. With financial assistance from the 
United States Country Studies Program (U.S.CSP) to address climate 
change, Malawi intends to develop a baseline for greenhouse gas data 
suitable for scientific understanding of the relationship between gas 
emissions and climate change. Additionally, Malawi will assess the 
vulnerability of important sectors (water, agriculture, and wildlife) to 
climate 
change impacts and recommend adaptation and mitigation measures. 
This report describes the 
four study elements 
of the country studies, i.e., specific objectives and methodologies that 
will be employed. 
Since this study has just 
been initiated, no results are reported but a description of the use 
into which the 
expected results will be put is 
given. 
<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>INTRODUCTION</H2>
<p><h3>Background</h3>
There is a growing awareness that the increase in the amount of 
greenhouse gases (GHGs) 
being released into the 
atmosphere will have adverse effects on the global weather systems. 
The warming is not 
expected to be globally uniform 
but could differ significantly between geographical regions and vary 
between seasons 
(Ottichilo <em>et al.</em>, 1991). According 
to the U.S. Country Studies Program Guidance Document (1994), the 
key natural resource 
sectors that might be 
susceptible to changes in climate include agricultural crops, livestock, 
forests, water 
resources, coastal resources, 
fisheries, and wildlife. African countries are more vulnerable than 
industrialized 
countries to the effects of climatic 
change for two reasons (Ominde and Juma, 1991). First, the current 
economic and ecological 
crises have weakened the 
capacity of many countries to adjust to drastic economic and 
ecological changes. Second, 
most of the people depend on 
agriculture for their subsistence, and agriculture depends a great 
deal on climatic 
patterns.

<p>According to Ominde and Juma (1991), global warming would 
induce changes in 
precipitation and wind patterns, 
changes in the frequency and intensity of storms, ecosystem stress 
and species loss, 
reduced availability of fresh water, 
and a rising global mean sea level. Although the actual impacts may 
not be easily 
predicted, changes in weather patterns 
may either lead to the prevalence of severe drought conditions or 
extreme flood events in 
Malawi. The existence of 
prolonged drought periods will seriously affect agricultural 
production on which Malawi 
heavily depends for the 
sustenance of her economy. Water for domestic consumption will also 
become scarce as 
experienced during the 1991&#139 92 
drought; the capacity to generate hydroelectric power will decline 
and lake transport 
services will also be seriously 
affected. On the other hand, very wet conditions will cause heavy 
floods with subsequent 
loss of life and property. 

<p>Malawi signed the United Nations Framework Convention on 
Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Rio 
de Janeiro in 
June 1992, and ratified the Convention in March 1994. Realizing 
further the importance of 
the environment, Malawi 
launched its National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP) in November 
1994.

<p>Under the UNFCCC, parties to the Convention must communicate to 
the Conference of the 
Parties (COP) their 
national inventories of anthropogenic emissions of all greenhouse 
gases by sources and 
sinks using comparative 
methodologies (Art.12.1(a)). 

<p>There has never been an inventory of GHGs in Malawi before. The 
potential impact of 
rising temperatures and 
changes in rainfall pattern is also unknown. Data are lacking on this 
subject therefore it 
was felt necessary to identify 
sources and sinks of GHGs and assess the vulnerability of various 
sectors to climate 
change impacts.

<p><h3>Study Objectives</h3>
The general objective of the study is to carry out an inventory of 
greenhouse gases 
emissions in Malawi and assess the 
impacts of climate change on the major socioeconomic sectors of 
Malawi. This study 
considered the following sectors 
(hereafter called study elements) important for vulnerability 
assessment: Water Resources, 
Wildlife, and Agriculture. 
There are several reasons for selecting these sectors as can be seen 
in the succeeding 
paragraphs.

<p><strong><em>Emissions Inventory</strong></em><br>
Malawi is largely an agricultural country, and it grows mostly 
tobacco, sugar, and maize, 
besides other crops. Livestock 
production is also an important industry that is growing. In addition 
there is noticeable 
industrial growth in major cities 
of Malawi. All these activities generate greenhouse gases.

<p>Another source of GHGs is domestic woodfuel use. Malawi's energy 
source is mainly (95 
percent) from woodfuel 
while only 3 percent is hydroelectric power generation. The 
implication is that several 
hectares of forests are cleared 
every year to meet the daily energy needs. This results in an 
accelerated removal of sinks 
of GHGs, leaving the gases to 
concentrate in the atmosphere. Bush fires that occur annually in 
forests, national parks, 
and wildlife reserves are yet 
another source of GHGs. 

<p>In Malawi, GHGs also come from the biological process of 
decomposition, and emissions 
from motor vehicles. It 
has been documented that if wood is not stored properly, i.e., left to 
rot, it generates 
GHGs (e.g., CO and CH<sub>4</sub>). Of late 
there has been an increase in traffic volume, particularly in the 
urban areas of Malawi 
although the quantities of traffic 
emissions are unknown.

<p>Malawi, like any other nation, realizes that her development 
activities are part of the 
worldwide concern over the 
increases of GHGs. However, information about the actual sources and 
quantities of the 
emissions is lacking, hence the 
inclusion of this element in the study. The country study will 
therefore develop a 
national inventory based on the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) methodology and 
create a data base that 
will enable both scientists 
and administrators to understand and appreciate the importance of 
the problem. The 
specific objectives of this inventory 
are to: 
<ul><li>Develop baseline data suitable for scientific understanding of 
GHGs emissions and 
their relationship to climate 
change 
<li>Enhance Malawi's ability to monitor and report national 
inventories of GHGs emissions 
and sinks
<li>Promote the exchange of information related to climate change at 
national level to 
develop policy options and 
technology choices suitable to mitigate GHGs sources and 
emissions</ul>
<p><strong><em>Water Resources</strong></em><br>
The necessity to study the impacts of climate change on both the 
quantity and quality of 
water resources cannot be 
overemphasized. Although Malawi may be considered generally rich 
in water resources, the 
distribution is not even. 
Therefore there is a pressing need to adopt sound and sustainable 
management practices of 
water resources to avert the 
threat posed by changes in climate. The specific objectives of this 
study element 
therefore are to assess the impacts of 
climate change on:
<ul><li>The hydrology and water systems of Malawi with emphasis on 
watersheds, catchment 
areas and major wetlands 
(lakes, rivers, marshes)
<li>The management of surface and groundwater resources</ul>
Vegetation affects the hydrological cycle of a region by influencing 
the processes of 
evapotranspiration and surface 
runoff. Ninety percent of Malawi's population is located in rural areas 
where among other 
things they depend on forests 
for fuel, household poles, fodder in the dry season, furniture, and 
other wood-based 
activities. Farming activities have 
further resulted into encroachment of these protected areas. 
According to Mkanda (1991), 
encroachment accounts for 
about 1 percent of land under national parks and wildlife reserves in 
Malawi. The net 
result is an estimated 1.6 percent 
annual permanent deforestation. It is necessary, therefore, to 
evaluate the potential 
impact of climate change on forest 
ecosystems with particular emphasis on identifying plant species and 
communities that are 
sensitive to, or at risk from, 
climate change. This study element intends to provide baseline data 
for assessing changes 
in species composition, 
vegetation structure, and cover.

<p><strong><em>Wildlife</strong></em><br>
National Parks have universal values (McNeely, 1992). They 
maintain essential ecological 
processes that depend on 
natural ecosystems, and preserve species diversity and the genetic 
variation within them. 
National parks also maintain 
productive capacities of ecosystems; preserve historic and cultural 
features important to 
the traditional lifestyles and 
well-being of local peoples; safeguard habitats critical for the 
sustainable use of 
species; secure landscapes and wildlife 
that enrich human experience through their beauty; provide 
opportunities for community 
development, scientific 
research, education, training, recreation, and tourism; and serve as 
sources of national 
pride and human inspiration. 
Additionally, national parks are close to pristine environments, so 
they are considered as 
indicators of environmental 
quality. Therefore any impact of climate change may not only be 
easily noticeable in 
national parks but it would also 
seriously reduce the values of these areas. It is therefore important 
to study these areas 
to institute adaptation measures 
from a point of knowledge. So the specific objectives of this study 
element are to:
<ul><li>Provide baseline information on the vulnerability of national 
parks and wildlife 
to impacts of climate change 
<li>Recommend strategies to adapt impacts of climate change</ul>
<p><strong><em>Agriculture</strong></em><br>
Agriculture is the backbone of Malawi's economy providing for over 
50 percent of the GNP. 
Malawi has not yet 
sustained food self-sufficiency; to the contrary, an underdeveloped 
subsistence livestock 
sector, and declining crop yield 
levels threaten the livelihood of the present population of eight 
million people and the 
availability of natural resources to 
future generations.

<p>Crop and livestock production depend on rainfall as the sole 
source of water supply. 
Less than 5 percent of arable 
land is under irrigation, although Malawi is endowed with over 21 
percent of its area as 
rivers, lakes, and marshes. In the 
last three decades, the country has experienced variability and 
unpredictability of 
seasonal rainfall. There have been three 
significant droughts (in 1978&#139 79, 1981&#139 82, and the 
worst one in the 1991&#139 92 
season), 
frequent and increasingly long dry 
spells, and erratic onset and cessation of rainfall. Tremendous 
variability means 
recurrent drought with increasing 
frequency as one moves to lower rainfall zones. Even with fair or 
excellent rainfall in 
those zones, no one would know 
when to expect which kind of season. Thus, the risk of failure of the 
more desired food 
crops and pasturage is high and 
unavoidable owing to the inability to predict.

<p>It is envisaged that the anticipated global climate change will alter 
temperature and 
rainfall levels in some areas. 
These changes, with increased fluctuations, are expected to cause 
many shifts in food 
production. Most crops are 
sensitive to changes in climate conditions, including alterations in 
temperature, 
moisture, and carbon dioxide levels. 
Furthermore, major climate changes influence populations of 
beneficial organisms and pests 
and alter their effective 
roles in agricultural ecosystems. 

<p>Finally, in the last two decades, the shift towards production of 
cash crops, 
particularly tobacco, at the expense of 
subsistence food crops has pushed crop and animal production to 
marginal (rainfall) lands. 
Further, the rampant growing 
of the major staple cereal (maize), even in areas marginal for its 
production has 
exacerbated the food production problem 
and environmental and soil erosion problems. With the growing 
human population in Malawi, 
and general resource 
limitations in land, water, and energy, sound ecological technologies 
for resource use in 
agriculture are being sought and 
this study is a rational initiative. The specific objectives of this study 
element 
therefore are to: 
<ul><li>Assess the past climate (temperature and rainfall) and its 
impact on crop and 
livestock production with emphasis 
on maize yields, feed resources, and pest attack as indicators of 
climate variation 
<li>Estimate the potential impact of climate change on crop 
management
<li>Identify and evaluate potential alterations in agricultural 
practices that would 
lessen any adverse consequences of 
climate change</ul>
The Malawi Country Study has not initiated field studies yet as it just 
received funding. 
Without results from field 
studies, this report will merely describe the approach that Malawi 
will use to accomplish 
this crucial study. It is worth 
mentioning at this point that very limited literature on approved 
methodologies was 
available at the time of formulating 
this project. Consequently, the proposed methodologies were 
developed based on the team's 
experience and expertise. 
Malawi hopes that various experts on this subject will review the 
proposed methodologies 
critically and provide their 
valuable guidance.<br> 
<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF MALAWI</H2>
<h3>Location and Topography</h3>
Malawi lies in the southern half of Africa between latitude 9&#176  
22&#39  and 17&#176  
7&#39 S, and 
between longitudes 32&#176 40&#39 and 35&#176 55&#39 
E. The total area is 118,483 sq km of which 94,275 sq km is land and 
24,208 sq km is 
water. Malawi is a landlocked 
country and it borders with Tanzania, Mozambique, and Zambia 
starting north going 
clockwise.

<p>Geographically, Lake Malawi which is Africa's third largest and 
the world's eleventh, 
dominates the country. It 
measures about 550 km long by 15&#139 80 km wide, and occupies 
a deep Rift Valley trough 
that 
cuts through the country 
along a north-south line. The lake surface elevation is about 474 m, 
and the deepest point 
is 230 m below sea level.
<p>Lake Malawi and the Shire River are part of the Great African Rift 
Valley. On either 
side of the rift abrupt escarpments rise to the highlands that flank it. 
To the west the 
highlands include the Nyika 
(highest elevation 2,607 m), Viphya 
(2,058 m), and Dedza (2,198 m) plateaus. To the east they include the 
Shire highlands 
(1,774 m), Zomba plateau (2,087 
m), and the Mangochi and Namizimu hills (1,796 m). The eastern 
highlands continue 
northwards into Mozambique, and 
Tanzania. Behind the rift edge highlands the land descends gently to 
the Central African 
Plateau at elevations around 
1,000 m. Examples of this are the Lilongwe and Kasungu plains. The 
country's lowest 
elevation of about 37 m is on the 
Rift Valley floor at the extreme south, while Mulanje Mountain, an 
ancient volcanic plug 
standing on the plateau to the 
south east, is at 3,050 m&#139 the highest point in Central Africa.
<h3>Climate</h3>
Malawi's climate is greatly influenced by the lake and elevation. In 
essence there are 
three seasons: cool and dry, from 
May to August; warm and dry, from September to November; and 
warm and wet, from December 
to April. The annual 
rainfall ranges from about 600 to 3,000 mm, being generally greatest 
at higher elevations, 
and least in the Lower Shire 
Valley, and the Chitipa plain (Clarke, 1983). Temperatures approach, 
and may surpass, 
40&#176  
C in the Rift Valley during 
October and November, while frost may be experienced on high 
ground during the cooler 
months. 
<h3>Soils and Vegetation</h3>
There are four main soil groups (Moyo <em>et al</em>., 1993). The 
latosols are red to 
yellow, 
leached acid soils in which water 
movement within the profile is predominantly downwards. They 
occupy freely-drained sites, 
mainly on the gently-sloping plains but also in some steeply 
dissected hills. The 
calcimorphic soils are grey 
to greyish brown with a weak acid 
to weak alkaline reaction in which water movement is upward 
during at least part of the 
year. They occur on nearly-level 
depositional plains with imperfect drainage. The hydromorphic soils 
are black, grey or 
mottled and waterlogged for all or 
part of the year. The fourth group comprises lithosols that are 
shallow or stony soils and 
regosols that are immature soils 
developed from sand.
<p>Malawi's has 19 biotic communities mappable at a scale of 
1:1,000,000 (Shaxson, 1977). 
The vegetation is typical 
savanna woodland with <em>Brachystegia</em> as the dominant 
species. Malawi's national 
parks, 
wildlife reserves, and forest 
reserves cover approximately 21 percent of the land surface area. 
The national parks and 
wildlife reserves represent 
thirteen of the nineteen biotic communities. The aim of setting aside 
these areas is to 
preserve selected examples of 
Malawi's biotic communities and conserve watersheds/catchment 
areas (Clarke, 1983). The 
different vegetation 
communities are a habitat to diverse wildlife; about 181 species of 
mammals, over 100 
reptiles, 56 amphibians, and 620 
species of birds (Ansell, 1989; Sweeney, 1966; Stewart, 1967; Benson 
and Benson, 1977).
<h3>Population and Economy</h3>
Malawi has a population of about ten million with a growth rate of 
approximately 3 percent 
(Malawi Government, 1987). 
The resultant density of about 85/sq km makes Malawi one of the 
most densely populated 
countries in the sub-Saharan 
Africa.
<p>About 90 percent of Malawi's population is rural and dependent 
on agriculture. 
Agriculture employs almost 85 
percent of the labor force and accounts for about 43 percent of the 
Gross Domestic Product 
(GDP) and nearly 90 percent 
of the export earnings. The income per capita GNP is estimated at US 
$230.00 (Myers, 
1994).
<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>METHODOLOGIES</H2>
<p><strong>Greenhouse Gases Inventory</strong><br>
The IPCC methodology will be applied to the following modules: 
Energy, Industrial 
processes, Solvent Use, Agriculture, 
Land-Use, and Wastes. These modules will cover a wide range of 
activities. 
<p>To begin with, the energy module will consider all the GHGs that 
are emitted from fuel 
combustion and fugitive 
fuel. Specifically, the following calculations will be made: GHG 
emissions from stationery 
sources (boilers and kilns), 
emissions from mobile sources, CO<SUB>2</SUB> from traditional 
biomass burning, and 
CH<sub>4</sub> 
from coal mining and 
handling. As to industrial processes, the main emphasis will be on 
CO<SUB>2</SUB> 
emanating form factories, e.g., 
cement manufacturing. The third module will concentrate on solvents 
that produce 
NO<sub>2</sub>, 
CO<SUB>2</SUB>, and 
volatile organic compounds, such as non-methane organic compounds 
from paint, thinners, 
and related material from 
printing activities and dry cleaning. On the other hand, emissions 
from agriculture will 
be inventoried to measure 
quantities of CH<sub>4</sub> in enteric fermentation and manure, 
flooded rice fields, 
N<sub>2</sub>O from soils, 
and CH<sub>4</sub>, CO, N<sub>2</sub>O from 
burning of agricultural residues. Lastly, the waste management 
module will give much 
consideration to the emissions of 
methane from landfills and waste water from municipals and 
industries. 

<h3>Water Resources</h3>
Although Malawi may be considered to be generally rich in water 
resources, the 
distribution is not even. Hence there is a 
pressing need to adopt sound and sustainable management of water 
resources to avert 
threats of depletion and 
degradation posed by climate change. The study will be divided into 
three components that 
may run concurrently as: 
<ul><li>Development of baseline and climate change scenarios using 
data from 1951 to 1980 
with GCMs
<li>Collection of data on surface water resources (i.e., streams, lakes, 
rivers, marshes), 
stream flows and runoffs, surface 
water quality, and supplementary data
<li>Compilation of data on water balance using models for rates of 
stream flow, runoff, 
and water quality</ul>

<h3>Wildlife</h3>
This study will evaluate the ecological integrity of wildlife and their 
habitats in two 
national parks under two climate 
scenarios. Sensitivity tests of the habitat under different 
temperature and rainfall 
regimes will be tested to come up with 
possible scenarios of climate change impacts on wildlife habitats. 
Finally, the study will 
correlate habitat and animal 
population data with climate data to assess potential impacts of 
climate change on the 
protected areas and their large 
mammal species. 
<p><strong><em>Study Site Selection</strong></em><br>
Two national parks, i.e., Nyika and Lengwe, will be used as study 
sites. Nyika mostly lies 
on a plateau at a high 
elevation with low temperatures and high rainfall. In contrast, 
Lengwe National Park lies 
in the Lower Shire Valley 
(Southern Malawi) at an altitude of between 30 and 100 m above sea 
level approximately. 
The mean annual temperature 
is the highest and the rainfall is the lowest and most unreliable (600-
700 mm) in Malawi 
(Shire Valley Agricultural 
Development Program, 1975). 

<p>In choosing these two sites, the study with cover two extreme 
climate conditions of 
Malawi. The availability of 
reasonable quantities of data from the two areas has also influenced 
site selection.

<p><strong><em>Baseline Climate Data</strong></em><br>
To help identify how changes in baseline conditions affect sensitivity 
of wildlife to 
climate change, precipitation and 
temperature data for the period 1961-90 for each site will be 
obtained from the 
Meteorological Department. The data 
will be entered into the habitat suitability index model. 

<p><strong><em>Climate Change Scenarios</strong></em><br>
GCM outputs for 1 x CO<SUB>2</SUB> conditions for the Malawi region 
will be obtained from 
the U.S. National 
Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). A comparison of the 
regional 1 x CO<SUB>2</SUB> 
output with the 
observed climate data will be made and the three GCMs that best 
reflect current climate 
will be selected. Using the 
selected GCMs, the study will create climate scenarios for the sites 
under 2 x 
CO<SUB>2</SUB> conditions. The 
resulting precipitation and temperature outputs will be used in the 
wildlife habitat 
suitability index analysis and the water 
and forestry elements of the Malawi Country Study. Desanker (in 
press) also presents 
useful precipitation and 
temperature data for selected sites in Malawi under CO<SUB>2</SUB> 
doubling.
<p><strong><em>Habitat Suitability Analysis</strong></em><br>
The Habitat Suitability Index model developed by the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service will 
be used for each site to 
calculate habitat suitability indices for two ecologically and 
economically important 
species. Nyala (<em>Tragelaphus angasi</em> 
G) and Roan (<em>Hippotragus equinus</em>) antelopes will be 
chosen in the study. Nyala is 
the 
keystone species in Lengwe 
National Park which is the northernmost limit in Africa. On the other 
hand, the roan 
antelope which is listed on 
Appendix II of CITES (Convention in International Trade in 
Endangered Species of Flora and 
Fauna) is one of the most 
abundant ungulate in Nyika National Park.

<p>First, the study will use the MIOMBO model developed by 
Desanker & Prentice (1994) to 
evaluate how the 
vegetation shifts in Malawi will occur under the generated climate 
scenarios. Using the 
HSI model for each climate, we 
will input the following habitat variables: water availability, 
prescribed burning regime, 
intensity of human influence, 
browse/grass availability, preference values of browse/graze species, 
importance values of 
preferred browse species, and 
vegetation cover. When using these variables, the study will assume 
that the other 
parameters are constant, e.g., soil 
nutrient, soil moisture, floristic richness, and intraspecific 
competition.

<p>A sensitivity analysis will be conducted by exploring the effects of 
precipitation 
variability. The model will be run 
under different scenarios where just one variable at a time is varied. 
For example, in one 
set of runs, we would hold all 
variables but watering availability constant, and in one run try 
watering availability in 
a poor rain year. In another run the 
model will try a moderately poor rain year, then an average rain 
year, a moderately good 
rain year, and a final run in a 
very good rain year. In a second set of runs, we would assume the 
effects of variation in 
rainfall on a different variable, 
and hold water availability and the rest of the variables constant.
<p><strong><em>Animal Population Vulnerability 
Assessment</strong></em><br>
Animal population data will be collected for each species. Existing 
data on animal numbers 
and distribution will be 
consolidated and updated using aerial and ground census techniques. 
To exclude human 
influence (poaching of the key 
species for example) as a possible cause of any impact that the study 
might detect, the 
study will analyze the law 
enforcement effort data in these areas and assess its influence on 
animal species 
abundance and distribution. 

<p>Millsap et al. (1990) used biological vulnerability and state of 
knowledge to provide a 
logical ranking of all 
vertebrate taxa in Florida. In this study, however, we will only 
employ the biological 
variables which measure 
characteristics of population status or life history because the action 
variables become 
useful when ranking different 
species to set conservation priorities for each of them in an area. 
Those variables are as 
follows: population size, trend, 
range size, distribution trend, population concentration, reproductive 
potential for 
recovery, and ecological 
specialization. 

<p>A Population Viability Analysis (PVA) model developed by the 
Captive Breeding 
Specialist Group of the World 
Conservation Union will be used to evaluate the health of the nyala 
and roan populations 
under both the baseline and 
climate change scenarios. This analysis will help eliminate incorrect 
interpretation of 
genetic effects as climate change 
impacts.

<p><strong><em>Relationship Between Habitat and Animal 
Populations</strong></em><br>
The study will attempt to make correlations of the habitat and 
animal population data with 
meteorological data on 
ecologically and economically important large mammal species. The 
study will relate the 
animal population status data 
with the HSI analysis results generated from the precipitation and 
temperature data under 
the baseline and carbon dioxide 
doubling scenarios. This will help assess potential impacts of climate 
change on these two 
species. Any potential impact 
identified by the study will subsequently lead to selection of 
appropriate adaptation 
measures which are the ultimate 
outputs of the study.

<h3>Agriculture</h3>
The study will define the geographical boundaries of the major 
production regions of the 
country, and estimate the 
current production of major crops in those regions using observed 
crop data. It will also 
provide observed climate data 
for representative stations for the baseline period (1961-90), or for 
as many years of 
daily data as are available, and 
specify the soil, crop, and management inputs necessary to run crop 
models at the selected 
stations. Additionally, the 
study will use observed data of incidence, type, and magnitude of 
pest attack of major 
crops for as many years of 
seasonal data as available.

<p>An analysis of time series of monthly and seasonal rainfall and 
temperature values 
(baseline climate data) will be 
made by running a simulation model (maize) to evaluate potential 
adaptive strategies using 
CERES-Maize Model and 
General Circulation Models (GCM) outputs. Observed climate and crop 
data, will be modified 
to determine climate 
change scenarios (determine and compare ten-year and long-term 
variability of historical 
and GCM output elements). 
Strategies for adapting to different climate change scenarios with or 
without the direct 
effects of CO<SUB>2</SUB> 
and other parameters will be recommended.<br>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>RESULTS</H2>
No results can be reported yet as the study has just begun. Therefore 
this report can only 
describe the use to which the 
results will be put. All study elements have similar uses of results 
although some study 
elements were designed with 
specific benefits/uses in mind. The common benefits/uses are: 
<ul><li>Contribution to chapters on GHGs inventories and vulnerability 
assessment
<li>Capacity building, expertise development, and appropriate 
technology transfer
<li>Documented evidence on the sources and sinks of GHGs, and the 
socioeconomic dimension 
and public 
understanding of climatic change impacts on the water resources, 
forest resources, 
wildlife resources, and agricultural 
productivity
<li>Baseline data on national inventories of GHGs and impact of 
climate change on 
wildlife, water, forests, society, and 
agro-climatic suitability classification of both crop plants and 
livestock products. These 
data bases will be updated to 
evaluate trends of climate change impacts on all the sectors and the 
updates will be 
submitted to the Conference of 
Parties of the Climate Convention
<li>Support for national policy and technological options regarding 
GHGs emission 
levels.</ul>
The benefits and uses that are specific to study elements include 
acquisition of climate 
change models (water); scientific 
publications in local and international journals (wildlife), and 
information dissemination 
through reports at local and 
international conferences, publications, and national workshops 
(agriculture).<br>
<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>DISCUSSION</H2>
This study would have included other important subjects such as 
mitigation and adaptation. 
However, limited funding 
has necessitated that only inventories of GHGs and vulnerability 
assessments be conducted.
 
<p>To accomplish the Country Study effectively, different institutions 
(governmental, the 
University of Malawi, and 
Non-Governmental Organizations) with the necessary capabilities 
have pooled their human 
resources together for 
efficient coordination of the set procedures. The Department of 
Meteorology together with 
the Ministry of Research and 
Environmental Affairs (MOREA) are the management authorities on 
climate change issues in 
Malawi. Therefore, they 
comprise Malawi's delegation to the Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change and the INC 
(Intergovernmental 
Negotiating Committee) under the UN Framework Convention on 
Climate Change. 

<p>To strengthen the existing infrastructure and ensure applicability 
of the existing 
climate information to the 
planning and management of socioeconomic and environmental 
programs, a National Climate 
Committee was formed 
under the former Department of Research and Environmental Affairs 
(DREA), now called 
MOREA. The same 
committee will develop and strengthen capabilities to forecast 
significant climate 
variations. MOREA is the coordinator 
of the project. They will be responsible for submission of quarterly 
technical and 
financial reports on behalf of the 
various study teams. The National Climate Committee mentioned 
earlier before will be 
responsible for monitoring the 
progress of all the activities of the project.

<P>Although Malawi has local expertise to implement the different 
study elements, she 
realizes that there are some 
shortcomings such as lack of training and experience in this new 
field. Therefore, Malawi 
needs assistance to inventory 
its GHGs since it has no previous experience and expertise. Technical 
assistance in the 
form of training workshops will 
be required for the coordinator, lead and alternate contact persons. 
These will provide a 
hands-on experience on 
coordination, inventory, and vulnerability and adaptation 
assessments. The workshops will 
also be a source of resource 
material on models, reports, and other analytical tools necessary to 
accomplish the 
country study.

<p>Technical assistance will also be required in the form of 
consultants and advisors who 
will pay field visits to those 
study elements that will find on-site assistance necessary. These 
visits will also be 
essential in providing guidance and 
review of progress made in the study. The technical assistance is 
crucial for 
sustainability of the project's activities. With 
the skills acquired during the training workshops and field visits by 
US experts, the 
Malawian counterparts can keep 
assessing future impact of climate change not only in the sectors 
included in this country 
study, but also in any other 
sector when the need arises.

<p>To ensure timely implementation, Malawi has developed a 
framework within which to 
accomplish the study. 
Since Malawi has no experience in the type of study, a maximum 
period of two years is 
envisaged adequate.

<p>Follow-up activities are essential to any study to ensure that there 
is continuity of 
activities. Therefore, Malawi 
envisages that the results of this country study will be incorporated 
in the various 
environmental management plans. The 
infrastructure and skills acquired will be useful in planning and 
management of future 
environmental projects. Some 
results of this study will be published in scientific publications in 
local and 
international journals, and local newspapers 
in both English and local languages to sensitize policymakers, the 
public, etc. Other 
activities will include holding a 
national workshop to discuss results of the country study.<br>

<h1>Mexico: Emissions Inventory, Mitigation Scenarios, and 
Vulnerability and Adaptation</h1>
</head>
<body>

<h3>Mexico Country Studies Project Team</h3><br>

<p>SUMMARY: Mexico's Country Study comprises analyses in three 
major areas: Inventory of Emissions of Greenhouse Gases; Scenarios, 
both physical and of emissions of GHG; and a Study of Vulnerability 
of the Country to Global Climate Change.

<p>The project intends to provide support and information to 
policymakers so that strategies can be redirected to face the effects 
of Climate Change. These analyses are intended to show the possible 
impacts on different productive activities and resources, and the new 
alternatives and challenges that Mexico's development will confront 
with respect to their corresponding emissions of GHG.

<p>In the area of inventories, it was found that Mexico emits about 
85.4 
x 10<sup>6</sup>MTC (metric tons) of carbon due to burning of fossil 
fuels. The methane emissions coming from urban waste disposal sites 
amount to 385.9 x 10<sup>3</sup> MT per year. Methane from 
agriculture and livestock amounts to 35,000 MT and 1.804 x 
10<sup>6</sup> MT respectively, showing a very small contribution 
due 
to rice cultivation. The contribution to the emissions due to land use 
change varies from 49 to 129.3 million tones of CO<SUB>2</SUB> 
depending on the use of a low or high rate of deforestation. The 
estimations for fugitive emissions of methane from the oil industry 
vary 
from 435 x 10<sup>5</sup> MT to 1.07 x 10<sup>6</sup> MT, 
depending again in the use of low and high emissions factors, 
respectively.

<p>In the area of physical scenarios, different GCMs have been used 
to 
produce maps of temperature and precipitation under the 
assumption of 
CO<SUB>2</SUB> doubling. An effort is being made to obtain results 
for regional scenarios using GCMs.
<p>In the area of emission scenarios, several numerical experiments 
have 
been carried out using "bottom up" and "top down" models and 
future 
projections of land use change. Even when structural changes are 
introduced in the energy sector, all the possible and probable 
scenarios 
lead to an increase in the consumption of energy and an increase in 
the 
emissions of GHG. This result is mainly due to a certain inertia in the 
economic structure. The increase in emissions of GHG is due to the 
assumption of continuous growth of the industrial, agricultural, and 
economic activity of the country.<br>
<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>INTRODUCTION</H2>
Mexico has followed a tradition of active participation in 
international forums in 
which topics related to the environment and the climate are 
discussed. For several 
years, it has made efforts to coordinate studies aimed at 
understanding the causes of 
environmental problems, particularly those related to global climatic 
changes and their 
possible societal impact, in order to be better prepared to cope with 
them in the future.

<p>These organizational efforts have contributed to increase Mexico's 
participation 
in international symposiums. However, we have had difficulties, 
especially related to 
financial support. Because of these financial constraints, the U.S. 
Country Studies 
Program was welcomed with enthusiasm, and Mexico presented the 
project titled 
"Country Study: Mexico," which was later approved.

<p>This project represents an ambitious plan whose objective is to 
understand what 
impact climate changes may have on human activities and to provide 
the basis for the 
delineation of national strategies, which must integrate economic 
issues with climate-
environmental policies. 
<p>The project's main objectives are:
<ul><li>To provide the Mexican government with a solid basis for the 
elaboration of 
strategies and policies in response to the impacts of climate changes. 
The 
socioeconomic implications of these changes will be analyzed.
<li>To provide the Mexican government with an ample base for the 
adoption of 
measures related to adaptation and mitigation.
<li>To establish a foundation to be updated to meet the commitments 
under the 
Framework Convention on Climate Change.
<li>To assist the government in the adoption of measures intended to 
restore the 
environment, in the understanding that what is good for the 
environment now, is 
good for the protection of the atmosphere and the climate.
<li>To provide technical support. This facilitates the Mexican 
government 
participation in international forums, such the conferences organized 
by the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the Intergovernmental 
Negotiating 
Committee, and other international organizations such as the 
Interamerican Institute 
on Climate Change.</ul>
The project focuses on three major areas:
<ul><li>The preparation of an inventory of greenhouse gases. This 
work will include 
accounting of sources and sinks. Special attention will be given to 
reforestation as a 
mitigating action.
<li>Development of climate change scenarios at a global, regional, and 
local level, as 
well as scenarios for the emission of greenhouse gases. This area of 
study will also 
include the study of the economic implications of different 
technology and policy 
options.
<li>The enhancement of previous studies of the country's 
vulnerability to climate 
change in certain key areas. The present document describes in a 
general way the 
results obtained for the different areas of the study.</ul>
<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>INVENTORIES</H2>
The amount of CO<SUB>2</SUB> released to the atmosphere via 
consumption of 
fossil fuels by industry and by the energy production process 
depends on the quantity 
of fuel that is consumed and on the actual carbon content of the fuel 
consumed. The 
Rio de Janeiro Framework Convention on Climate Change mandates 
that each country 
must develop national strategies for the reduction of CO<SUB>2</SUB> 
emissions 
and that these strategies must be based on precise knowledge of the 
country's emission 
inventory.

<UL>Data necessary to determine CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions include:
<li>Apparent consumption of fossil fuels by type of fuel
<li>Average coefficient of carbon emission for each fuel, and total 
carbon potentially 
emitted
<li>Carbon sequestered for long periods of time in nonenergetic 
products
<li>Quantity of nonoxidized carbon
<li>Other activities which generate CO<sub>2</sub></ul>

<p>In order to estimate CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions, we used national 
emission 
factors along with the OECD/IPCC methodology, and production and 
consumption 
data from the National Energy Balance for 1990. The estimate of 
carbon emission 
comes from a mass evaluation where: According to the OECD/IPCC 
methodology 
(IPVV, 1995), energy produced by the combustion of firewood and 
bagasse must not 
be included in these estimates. Because of this, the values for 
CO<SUB>2</SUB> 
emissions will have to be subtracted from the final figures.
<p>Based on the National Energy Balances, the energy sector in 
Mexico produces 
93,251,375.4 Metric Tons of Carbon, equivalent to: 341,921,658.7 
Metric Tons of 
Carbon Dioxide. The cement industry accounts for 13,420,290 Metric 
Tons of Carbon 
Dioxide. Total emissions are 96,911,079.4 Metric Tons of Carbon, 
equivalent to 
355,341,448.7 Metric Tons of Carbon Dioxide. Subtracting 
CO<SUB>2</SUB> 
originating from the combustion of firewood and bagasse, we are left 
with a total of 
85,368,695.2 Metric Tons of Carbon and 313,018,540 Metric Tons of 
Carbon 
Dioxide.<br>
<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>METHANE EMISSIONS
IN SANITARY LANDFILLS</H2>
The results are obtained by processing information on the 
characteristics of different 
types of waste by region, in order to determine the quantities of 
methane generated at 
each of these sources. The difference between the regions is small, 
with the exception 
of the Metropolitan Zone of Mexico City (Federal District), which 
exhibits a larger 
difference. This fact enables us, as a first approximation, to divide 
the country into 
two regions: the Federal District and the rest of the country.

<p>The figures for the methane emissions by ton of waste are 
computed for the 
Federal District and for the rest of the country as an average of the 
four remaining 
regions. With these values in hand, we were able to estimate total 
methane emissions 
at 385,900 tons per year.
<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>METHANE EMISSIONS ORIGINATING 
FROM LIVESTOCK'S ENTERIC FERMENTATION
AND WASTE, AND FROM THE CULTIVATION
OF RICE FOR 1990</H2>
In order to estimate methane emissions from livestock waste and 
enteric fermentation 
and from rice cultivation for 1990, we followed the methodology 
proposed by IPCC 
(1993). We based our calculation on information obtained on the 
existence of 
livestock by climatic region and on the corresponding emission 
factors. Due to the 
shortage of information, we set out working hypotheses, such as for a 
given 
percentage of surface area in a particular climate for a particular 
state, there 
corresponds certain number of livestock. Furthermore, bovine cattle 
waste emission 
factors were estimated from a functional relationship between the 
ingested energy for 
each animal and its body mass (both factors were established on the 
basis of a large 
wealth of data for developing countries that the IPCC has published). 
The emission 
factors, both for waste and enteric fermentation, were taken from 
IPCC manuals. As 
for methane emissions from rice cultivation, we based our 
calculations on information 
related to number of hectares cultivated with irrigation and on 
flooding conditions and 
corresponding to cultivation periods.

<h3>Emissions Originating from Change of Soil 
Usage</h3>
The first point to be noted is that some classifications of the types of 
vegetation in 
Mexico had to be modified due to the fact that these do not agree 
with the ones put 
forth in the methodology of the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate 
Change (IPCC, 
1993). We suggest that temperate forests should include the 
following types of 
vegetation: latifoliated, coniferous, coniferous-latifoliated, and 
mesophyll forest. 
Similarly, tropical forests are classified as high, medium, and low. 
Open forests 
encompass natural protected areas and degraded forests including 
managed and 
unmanaged forests. Since there is no information in Mexico on 
undisturbed and 
logged forests, we assume that the protected areas belong to the 
open forest category 
and all the rest to the logged forests category depending upon each 
subtype of 
vegetation.

<p>The forested surface areas in Mexico were categorized by State, 
ecosystem, and 
type of vegetation, based on data from the National Forest Inventory 
of Great Vision 
of 1992, published by the Department of Agriculture and Hydraulic 
Resources.

<p>The real forested area for 1990 was equivalent to 133,740 Kha. On 
the basis of 
this fact, the surface area was delineated by type and subtype of 
vegetation according 
to its management. It should be noted that the forested area that is 
in very damaged 
condition totals 3,548 Kha. These areas are not taken into account 
since they cannot 
be recovered.

<p>In order to estimate emissions from the submodule "felling of 
forests&#139  
CO<SUB>2</SUB> release originating from biomass burning, in situ and 
outside," 
we took into account high and low deforestation rates. In 1990 a 
total of 370,000 ha. 
were deforested, observing a greater cutting for tropical forests than 
for forests and 
arid zones. The present study works with a high rate of 
deforestation, and arrives to a 
total estimate of 767,186 ha. It should also be noted that there are 
other reports in 
which higher deforestation rates are mentioned. Toledo (1989) 
estimates an annual 
deforestation rate of 1,500,000 ha. 

<p>Mexico, however, lacks detailed information on the total biomass 
area for the 
different types of vegetation. Estimates are computed based on 
commercial biomass 
inventories, using expansion factors. If we estimate the biomass area 
by type of forest 
prior to deforestation, the biomass values&#139 after 
deforestation&#139 would be 
the ones put forth by IPCC. After deforestation, the biomass depends 
critically on the 
type of use given to the deforested area. For example, tropical forests 
are more 
affected because of extensive cattle rearing, whereas fires are the 
most important 
cause of deforestation in temperate forests. 

<p>If we use a low deforestation rate, our estimate for carbon release 
equals 13,365 
Gg and 49,005 Gg of CO<SUB>2</SUB>. If we use a high rate, our 
estimate would 
equal 35,260 Gg of Carbon and 129,290 Gg of CO<SUB>2</SUB>. The 
aforementioned results are preliminary since we are currently 
working on generating 
our own data for the portion of burned biomass, for combustion 
efficiency, and for 
carbon content in the burned biomass.
<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>PETROLEUM INDUSTRY EMISSIONS</H2>
In order to estimate emissions from the petroleum industry, we used 
the IPCC 
methodology to calculate fugitive methane emissions from natural 
gas and petroleum 
systems (IPCC, 1993a). "Tier 1" is the first level of detail used for the 
estimation of 
these emissions. We use average emission factors based on 
production. The activity 
levels were obtained from the National Energy Balance for 1990 
(National Energy 
Balance, 1991). Emission factors appear in the reference manuals for 
the different 
regions.

<p>In the case of Mexico, the greatest uncertainty in terms of 
methodology is its 
regional definition. Mexico is classified as an "Other Petroleum 
Exporting Country," 
since it consumes approximately 94 percent of the natural gas 
produced globally. 
After consulting with the technical advisors from the firm ICF, it was 
decided to 
classify Mexico as member of "Rest of the World Region." The 
emission factors can 
be found under this category on Table 1&#139 47 of the Reference 
Manual. The 
methane emission estimates, for high and low emission coefficients, 
are 435 and 
1069Gg, respectively. 

<p>The National Energy Balance reports a total gas production of 
1640PJ and a 
total consumption of 1555PJ, including internal consumption within 
the petroleum 
industry. The difference of 85PJ is equivalent to 1703Gg of natural 
gas. Considering 
that methane represents 50 percent of the weight of the Mexican 
natural gas, the 
aforementioned 85PJ would be equivalent to 851Gg of methane. This 
quantity is 
energy not used and lost in transformations and ventings, and 
represents by itself a 
very small quantity of methane emissions from the petroleum 
industry. The high 
emission estimates are considered as the most representative of the 
"Tier 1" of the 
methodology. According to "Tier 1," the main sources of fugitive 
emissions are 
venting and flaring, originating from petroleum and natural gas 
production, from 
emissions in the processing, transportation and distribution of 
natural gas, and from 
leakages in industrial and powerplants. On the other hand, emissions 
which resulting 
from the transportation, storage, and refining of crude petroleum, 
from maintenance of 
production facilities for oil and gas, and from leakages in the 
commercial and 
industrial sectors, are considered marginal.

<h3>Physical Scenarios</h3>
The only objective way to build future climatic scenarios for the 
study of the impacts 
of Global Climate Change on human activities is by using simulation 
models. The 
General Circulation Models or GCMs are the best in this area. The 
working criteria 
adopted was the use of simulations generated under the assumption 
that carbon 
dioxide is doubled. This event will occur sometime in the future 
depending upon the 
intensity of anthropogenic emissions of gases which have a 
greenhouse effect.

<p>In order to create future scenarios, we used the methodology put 
forward by the 
IPCC and discussed in "U.S. Country Studies Program's Training 
Workshop on 
Vulnerability and Adaptation Assessments" in Washington D.C., in 
February of 1994.

<p>This process consists of adding the temperature increments given 
by the models, 
to the climate conditions of the places or regions to be studied. For 
the central region 
of Mexico, we used the predictions of GFDLR30 and of the Canadian 
Climate Model. 
And, by way of comparison, we have also used the thermodynamic 
climate model 
developed by the Center for Atmospheric Sciences of the University 
of Mexico.
<h3>Results</h3>
For base scenarios, we used average temperatures and precipitation 
data of 23 points, 
scattered in a grid of 2.5 x 2.5&#176 . These data are monthly 
averages taken from a 
record extending over 30 years (1941 to 1970).

<p>For future scenarios, we operated with the GRIDS package 
(Kentery Dotty, 
1994) and, by either interpolation or use of the nearest data point 
provided by the 
GCM, we arrived at estimates of temperature and precipitation 
increments for the 23 
locations. This material was presented in a technical report No. 1 in 
the form of tables, 
maps, and diskettes.

<p>With the intention of validating the models, we proceeded to 
compare its 
simulations for 1 x CO<SUB>2</SUB> with the climate values obtained 
and, in so 
doing, we observed important differences when the comparisons 
were conducted site 
by site. The comparisons were also conducted by taking averages of 
points contained 
in latitude bands. This comparison was more favorable and enabled 
us to affirm that 
for the northern region the results were similar for the three models 
employed. 
Although the magnitudes are different for the central and southern 
regions, the GFDL 
model reproduces better the seasonal changes. It should be noted 
that temperature 
compared to precipitation exhibits greater cohesion&#139 the GFDL 
model predicts 
greater precipitation for an extensive region centered in the middle 
portion of Mexico, 
while CCCM forecasts exactly the opposite. 

<p>Due to the fact that the distance between the grid points of the 
models is several 
hundreds of kilometers (approximately 400 kms), the regional 
characteristics are not 
reproduced. In order to solve this problem, we are in the process of 
studying the 
adjustments needed to obtain simulations at a regional and even 
local level, either by 
nesting regional climate models into GCMs or by regionalizing GCM 
simulations with 
empirical formulations.
<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>BOTTOM UP SCENARIOS</H2>
In a recent study, Sathaye and Ketoff (1991) found that Mexico, in 
1987, was the third 
largest carbon emitter by production and energy use in the 
developing world, after 
India and China. Between 1987 and 1991, the production of primary 
energy grew by 4 
percent while the contribution from fossil fuels remained stable at 
around 92 percent 
(SEMIP, 1992), a fact that suggests that carbon emissions have been 
increasing.

<p>The methodology for "bottom up" or end-use analysis focuses on 
energy 
conservation. This analysis is put forward as an alternative to the 
traditional approach 
which employs Gross Domestic Product, income, and price as 
economic variables 
which explain the demand for energy.

<p>This approach steers the analysis toward the demand for energy 
and not toward 
its aggregate supply. Energy consumption is disaggregated for the 
different sectors, 
and sums different end-uses from each sector. This procedure 
incorporates structural 
demands as explicit elements and allows for the accounting of energy 
needs in relation 
to physical and economic activities.

<p>For the elaboration of future energy consumption scenarios and 
for the 
quantitative analysis of atmospheric emissions, different models 
have been 
developed&#139 most notably, the STAIR model. This model, the 
name of which is 
formed by the five sectors which consume energy: services, 
transportation, 
agricultural, industrial, and residential, is basically an accounting 
framework based on 
the methodology by end uses. It makes possible the study of impacts 
of different 
energy policies on the use of energy as well as in the emissions of 
greenhouse gases 
(Ketoff, Sathaye, 1991).
<h3>Available Data</h3>
Information on energy supply, transformation, and demand for 
Mexico is to be found 
in the energy balances (1965-90) of the Secretary of Mines, Energy 
and Semi-State 
Industry (SEMIP), and in the reports from OLADE (Latin American 
Energy 
Organization). Additional information may be found in the records of 
PEMEX, of the 
Federal Electricity Commission (CFE), and in the publications from the 
National 
Institute for Statistics, Geography and Data Processing (INEGI) on 
economic 
indicators and population census.

<p>Emission factors represent the average behavior of a similar set of 
technologies 
and may fluctuate according to: type of fuel, technology, how old the 
technology in 
question is, and the conditions under which it is operated and 
maintained.
<p><strong><em>Scenarios of Social and Economic 
Development</strong></em><br> 
Three different scenarios were elaborated for the period from 1990 
to 2025. Gross 
Domestic Product was assumed to grow at an average annual rate of 
4 percent, 
population at 1.8 percent. The energy consumption structures 
remaining stable for 
each sector, as well as the emission factors.

<p>In scenario A, a society that wastes its natural resources is 
portrayed, 
corresponding with the current national trend. By the year 2025, a 
per capita annual 
consumption of 350GJ would have been reached, equivalent to the 
consumption of the 
United States in 1982.

<p>In scenario B, a society that aims at conserving its resources is 
depicted, in 
correspondence with the intentions of the current energy policy. By 
the year 2025, a 
per capita annual consumption of 200GJ would have been reached, 
equal to the 
consumption exhibited by Germany in 1982.

<p>In scenario C, a society which has sustainable growth is reached, 
requiring 
changes in the social and industrial structure, as well as giving 
special attention to the 
environment. By the year 2025 a per capita annual consumption of 
100GJ would have 
been reached, slightly lower than that of Japan in 1982.
<h3>Results</h3> 
For the transportation sector, the results obtained show that gasoline 
is the main 
producer of CO<SUB>2</SUB>, followed by diesel, kerosene, fuel oil, 
and LP gas. 
The increase of emissions follows the pattern for fuel consumption. 
Demand for 
gasoline grows exponentially, but demand for diesel throughout the 
last decade stays 
the same, while for other fuels it is almost insignificant. As to the 
industrial sector, 
NO<sub>x</sub> appears as the main contaminant, followed by 
SO<sub>x</sub>, 
particles, HC and CO. The amounts of NO<sub>x</sub>, SO<sub>x</sub> 
and HC 
emitted has increased consistently in the last 25 years, whereas the 
quantity of 
particulates and CO emitted has remained constant, by energy unit 
consumed by 
inhabitant. The fuel consumption pattern associated with this 
emissions evolution 
implies that the demand for petroleum products and natural gas has 
increased, while 
for bagasse and coke it has remained constant.
<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>TOP DOWN SCENARIOS</H2>
<h3>Projects For Energy Demand</h3>
Projections for energy demand for economic sectors and subsectors 
and by fuels are 
being elaborated based on an energy demand model developed in 
Mexico. The results 
obtained to date are preliminary, and we expect that in the following 
months other 
preliminary results may be discussed for the areas of environmental 
impact, 
technology, active measures, and problems encountered for the 
efficient use of 
technology.

<p>The main environmental problems (local and global) originating 
from the 
energy system come from the great dependence on hydrocarbons, 
carbon, and wood 
burning; from the characteristics of refined crude oil, 31 percent of 
which is heavy 
crude, with an average of 3.3 percent sulphur content; from the great 
urban 
agglomerations which are still growing, headed by the metropolitan 
area of Mexico 
City (and whose transportation system is insufficient); from the 
absence of norms for 
the control of emissions from the energy sector, transportation, and 
the industry in 
general; and from the insufficient use of energy.
<h3>Energy Demand Model</h3>
The objective of this model is to simulate primary energy demand 
for Mexico. It is a 
"top-down" model, where the exogenous parameters are economic 
(GDP) and 
demographic (population growth). The economy is subdivided in 
sectors and 
subsectors, in analysis of historical tendencies for individual 
participation in energy 
consumption by source&#139 fuel and electricity&#139 and by 
nature of the 
emission&#139 gas combustion, hydrocarbons, and particles. In this 
way, one may 
project the tendencies for individual sector or subsectors and for 
fuels, and one may 
resort to alternative analyses for estimating the impact of different 
energy policies and 
corresponding environmental problems (prices, conservation, change 
of fuels, etc.)
<h3>Results</h3>
Some of the main results show that there is a certain inertia in the 
economic structure 
and in the demand for energy, even with the adoption of policies that 
aim at 
introducing structural reforms. Under the first scenario, the energy 
sector, together 
with the electrical subsector (CFE), exhibit growth; however, in the 
high growth 
scenario, PEMEX exhibits similar increments. It is very important to 
note that the 
reference scenario works with a GDP growth rate of 5 percent and 
that energy 
intensity is residential.

<p>However, there are substantial changes within subsectors of a 
particular sector. 
In the industrial sector, the participation of basic petrochemicals will 
increase by 50 
percent by the year 2000 and will triple by the year 2010. The 
chemical industry will 
also grow, doubling its participation by the year 2010, just like that 
of fertilizers, 
which, in addition, will quadruple by the year 2020.

<p>The total energy consumption increases by 38 percent over the 
current level by 
the year 2000, by 100 percent by the year 2010, and by 500 percent 
by the year 2024. 
This implies an annual growth of 3.8 percent for the whole period: in 
the short 
term&#139 until year 2000&#139 the growth would equal 4.4 
percent, decreasing 
thereafter. The corresponding quantities for GNP are 31, 85, and 421 
percent, 
respectively. The tendencies shown are on the increase for energy 
intensity. 

<p>The scenario without changes (business-as-usual) works with a 
GDP growth 
rate of 3.5 percent and with constant energy intensity. The results 
show that total 
energy demand will increase from 1,499 x 10<sup>12</sup> Kcal in 
1992 to 3,124 
x10<sup>12</sup> in 2010, which would imply an annual growth rate 
of 4.1 percent. 
The generation of nuclear electricity (CFE)&#139 geothermic and 
hydro&#139 will not 
increase 
as projected (66 percent by the year 2000). So part of the electricity 
assigned to this 
area, will in due course be generated by fossil fuels; environmental 
problems will 
favor the use of natural gas. Nuclear installed capacity will grow to 
1,300MW by next 
year. CFE plans contemplates an increase in generating capacity of 25 
percent in geo 
and thermal power and 38 percent in hydro power by the year 2000. 

<p>In low-growth-rate scenarios, with a GDP growth rate of 2.0 
percent and with 
constant energy intensity, we find the following: total energy 
demand goes from 1,461 
x 10<sup>1</sup>2 Kcal in 1992 to 2,385 x 10<sup>1</sup>2 Kcal in 
2010, a fact that 
implies an annual 
growth rate of 2.8 percent.

<h3>Carbon Absorption and Emissions in Mexico's 
Forests</h3>
The research was conducted by a working group, in coordination 
with the work 
groups for the areas of inventories and vulnerability. We have 
revised the 
methodologies used for scenarios of gas emission from the forested 
sector. Other 
possible scenarios to be developed were identified. The study has 
proceeded with the 
elaboration of a reference scenario and with the preliminary 
preparation of the 
databases.

<p>To the date, we obtained the following results: a bibliographic 
base with more 
than 80 files, sorted alphabetically and by topic (the same which is 
available at the 
Ecological Center of the UNAM); the publication of an article in the 
foremost Country 
Study Workshop; and the improvement of a data base with basic 
biophysical 
parameters for carbon emission and sequestration due to 
deforestation, using the 
model CO-PATH. This data base, includes estimation of gross, net, 
immediate, and 
long-term carbon emissions for the four types of closed forests in the 
country: 
temperate coniferous forests, oak forests, humid, and dry tropical 
forests. We also 
include biophysical and economic parameters for the options of 
carbon absorption for 
the conservation options for protected natural areas, forests, and 
native tropical forests 
management.

<p>The analysis also addresses efficient use of firewood, agroforestry, 
and 
commercial and noncommercial reforestation plantations (including 
bioenergy 
projects). We initiated the elaboration of a data base, for the 
calculation of future 
scenarios for carbon emissions and absorption. The data base 
includes basic 
parameters on forest management and emissions by type of forest 
(taken from the 
previous data bases) and combines them with estimates for the 
evolution of the 
population, of the GDP, forest products demand and other estimate 
factors.

<p>In order to design basic parameters for the reference alternative 
scenarios, we 
consulted with experts responsible for the areas of inventories and 
vulnerability. In the 
specific case of the forested sector, we put forth a reference scenario 
or a scenario of 
tendencies which would incorporate long-term emissions resulting 
from a continuation 
of historical deforestation rates (1980&#139 1990).

<p>Two policy scenarios&#139 moderate and accelerated&#139 will 
also be 
developed. Using 1990 as the base year, the projections will be 
provided for years 
2025 and 2100.

<h1>Mongolia: Preliminary 1990 Greenhouse Gas Inventory</h1>
</head>
<body>

<h3>D. Dagvadorj and M. Munkh-tsetseg</h3>
<strong>Hydrometeorological Research Institute<br>
Ministry for Nature and the Environment, Mongolia</strong><br>

<p>SUMMARY: Mongolia is the 35th country to have ratified the 
United Nation's Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). 
One of the commitments accepted by the country is the submission of 
a national greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory to the world society. At 
the end of 1993, Mongolia joined the U.S. Country Studies Program 
and has begun to compile its national GHG inventory. We have used 
IPCC methods for estimation of this inventory. We prepared initial 
estimates of anthropogenic emissions of GHG in Mongolia for 1990. 
Due to the lack of data necessary for calculations, these estimations 
are not complete and we continue with 
our efforts to make them more precise. Mongolia's national GHG 
inventory comprises 
emissions of gases such as carbon dioxide (CO<SUB>2</SUB>), methane 
(CH<SUB>4</SUB>), nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>), and carbon 
monoxide 
(CO) from five main sectors: Energy, Industry, Agriculture, Land-Use 
Change and 
Forestry, and Waste. It was estimated that in 1990 emissions from 
the 
abovementioned sectors totalled 19,524 Gg carbon dioxide, 330.1 Gg 
methane, 0.9 
Gg nitrogen oxides, and 83.3 Gg carbon monoxide <a 
href="gifs/MongTab1.gif">(Table 1)</a>.<br>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>INTRODUCTION</H2>
In this report, Mongolia presents its atmospheric emissions inventory 
for the first time. 
The initial 
version of the inventory was carried out at the Hydrometeorological 
Research Institute, 
Ministry of 
Nature and Environment, for 1990. We followed the IPCC inventory 
guidelines (IPCC, 1993).
<p>The inventory includes emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, 
nitrogen oxides, and 
carbon 
monoxide. Following the IPCC Guidelines, the inventory reports 
emissions from five 
sectors: 
Energy, Industrial Processes, Agriculture, Land-Use Change and 
Forestry, and Waste. Due to 
the 
historical, geographical, climatic and economic characteristics of the 
country, some 
sources of GHG, 
such as oil and gas systems, savanna and agricultural residues 
burning, rice cultivation, 
and forest 
clearing, do not apply to Mongolia. Emissions from fuel combustion 
for power generation 
and 
conversion of grasslands to arable land are the largest sources of 
carbon dioxide. A 
significant 
amount of methane is emitted by livestock.
<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>METHODS</H2>
We followed the IPCC inventory guidelines. The lack of data 
necessary for calculations was 
the 
main obstacle for us. Basically it was possible to obtain only general 
statistics such as 
fuel 
consumption, cement production, domestic animal population, area of 
cultivated land, etc. 
(Statistical Yearbook, 1992, 1994). Country-specific emission factors 
of gases were not 
developed in 
Mongolia.
<p>Data collection was the most difficult for the Forestry and Waste 
sectors. Where 
necessary, 
we have used default IPCC values given in the Greenhouse Gas 
Inventory Workbook. We would 
like to note that these default data were very helpful in carrying out 
the inventory.
<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>RESULTS</H2>
The 1990 greenhouse gas emissions highlights are presented in <a 
href="gifs/MongTab1.gif">Table 1</a>. These results are 
preliminary and may be changed as more precise data become 
available. The sectoral 
distribution for 
both carbon dioxide and methane emissions is shown on <a 
href="gifs/MongFig1&2.gif">Figures 
1 and 2</a>. Both Figures are derived 
from <a href="gifs/MongTab1.gif">Table 1</a>.
<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>DISCUSSION</H2>
<h3Energy</h3>
The Energy sector is the largest contributor to GHG emissions in 
Mongolia. Activities in 
this sector 
cover coal production (mining and post-mining activities such as 
transportation and 
storage), fuel 
combustion at the thermal power stations, and coal and biomass 
combustion in private 
houses 
(ovens) for heating purposes.
<p>The main type of fossil fuel used in Mongolia is coal. Natural gas 
and oil are not 
produced in 
Mongolia and are not imported. Coal is burned mainly at the power 
stations and in less 
quantities in 
private small dwellings. Oil products (kerosene, gasoline, etc.) are 
imported and used for 
transportation and power stations. Combustion of these fuels is the 
greatest source of 
carbon dioxide 
emitted into the atmosphere.
<p>Biomass in Mongolia is burned in cook-stoves only. Other activities 
like agricultural 
residues 
burning and on-site burning of cleared forest are not applicable in 
Mongolia. Biomass 
burning is the 
only significant source of nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide 
according to our 
calculations. 
Emissions from the transportation sector have not been estimated 
yet. The only significant 
methane 
source for the energy sector is coal mining and post-mining activities. 
However, these 
emissions are 
relatively insignificant compared to methane emissions from 
agriculture.
<h3>Industrial Processes</h3>
Following the IPCC Guidelines, cement production is included into the 
industrial processes 
sector 
(IPCC, 1993). Cement production emission estimates are presented in 
Table 1. Although 
heavy 
industry is not developed sufficiently in Mongolia, mining is the basis 
of the national 
economy. 
Unfortunately, until now, we do not have a methodology to calculate 
emissions from other 
industrial 
processes.
<h3>Agriculture</h3>
Emissions of methane from enteric fermentation and anaerobic 
decomposition of manure of 
domestic animals are the primary GHG emissions from agriculture. 
Other sources of GHG such 
as 
rice cultivation and savanna burning included in the IPCC Guidelines 
are not applicable 
for 
Mongolia. This is due to the geographical location of the country. 
Open burning of 
agricultural 
residues are not a significant source. Since 1990 agricultural residues 
are used 
completely for 
livestock needs. Emissions from livestock account for 91 percent of 
all methane emissions, 
which 
was 330.1 Gg of methane in 1990. The livestock population is 
relatively large (26.3 m 
heads, 
including swine and poultry at the 1990 level) (Statistical Yearbook, 
1992).
<p>Historically, Mongolia is a country of nomads and livestock 
breeding is the traditional 
form of 
lifestyle instead of farms. A very insignificant part of the livestock 
population (farming 
cows, swine, 
and poultry) is raised on farms. Thus, anaerobic decomposition of 
manure is not a large 
source for 
Mongolia, especially due to the dry boreal climate conditions. This is 
a source of 
uncertainty in the 
emission estimates.
<h3>Land-Use Change and Forestry</h3>
The IPCC Guidelines describe four potential sources for this sector: 
forest clearing, 
conversion of 
grasslands into cultivated land, abandonment of managed lands, and 
managed forests. 
Mongolia's 
inventory includes emissions and uptake of GHG from two of these 
sources: conversion of 
grasslands to cultivated land, and managed forests. Forests cover 
about 8&#139 10 percent 
of the 
territory of the country and forest clearing is insignificant. 
<p>The estimates of emissions from managed forests are preliminary 
and will be refined as 
more 
data become available.
<p>The tradition of land cultivation in Mongolia is not very long. 
Mongolia began to 
cultivate 
considerable land area only after 1958. More recently, some 
cultivated land has been 
abandoned. We 
have estimated the area of abandoned lands, but do not have 
relevant information (annual 
rate of 
aboveground biomass uptake and rate of uptake in soils) since 
default values were not 
available. In 
this way, it was not possible to calculate carbon dioxide uptake of 
this sink.
<p>Under the IPCC Guidelines, we have estimated that conversion of 
grasslands to 
cultivated 
land is the second largest emission source of carbon dioxide for 
Mongolia, accounting for 
up to 36.8 
percent of CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions. In our view, this estimate is 
too high due to the use 
of a 
default coefficient of soil carbon content of grasslands for temperate 
regions which is 70 
ton per 
hectare. We estimate that 1,400 kha of grasslands have been 
converted from 1958 to 1990 
(Statistical 
Yearbook, 1994).
<h3>Waste</h3>
Waste management activities generate methane, produced from 
anaerobic bacterial 
decomposition of 
organic matter in landfills, industrial and municipal wastewater. We 
estimated emissions 
from this 
sector as 14.5 Gg of methane, which is 4.4 percent of all methane 
emissions. We used the 
default 
values provided in the IPCC Guidelines.<br>
<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>CONCLUSION</H2>
This article is an overview of the first version of the 1990 National 
Greenhouse Gas 
Inventory of 
Mongolia. Therefore, the results presented here are preliminary and 
will be revised as 
more detailed 
estimations are made. One of the main problems we faced was the 
lack of data on emission 
factors 
and activity levels suitable for Mongolia. We have used IPCC default 
values in many cases. 
However, in some cases default values were not available. This lack 
of data is a 
significant source of 
uncertainty and bias for the emissions estimate. For example, carbon 
dioxide emissions 
from land-
use change and forestry from 1990 may be too high.
<p>These preliminary results show that we need more detailed 
information for all sectors 
to 
produce more reliable results.

<p>SUMMARY: To carry out the greenhouse gas emissions inventory 
in Peru, the emission system was divided into two major sectors: 
Energy and Nonenergy. The basic IPCC methodology was used in 
preparing the inventory. Due to the lack of national emission factors, 
this generally included the use of the IPCC emission factors (default 
values). Some local emission factors were available and used in the 
Nonenergy Sector. Emissions in the Energy Sector were as follows: 
CO<SUB>2</SUB>, from all sources totalled 35,174 Gg (16,246 Gg from 
biomass) 
using the IPCC "top-down" approach; CH<SUB>4</SUB>, from biomass, 
coal 
production, and oil and gas systems totalled 69.59 Gg; NO<sub>x</sub> 
from 
biomass totalled 622.71 Gg; CO from biomass totalled 0.464 Gg; and 
N<SUB>2</SUB>O from biomass totalled 10.94 Gg. Emissions in the 
Nonenergy 
Sector were as follows: CO<SUB>2</SUB>, 58,313 Gg; CH<SUB>4</SUB> 
1,204 
Gg; N<SUB>2</SUB>O, 6.19 Gg; NO<sub>x</sub>, 121.53 Gg; and CO 
10,849 
Gg.<br>
<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>INTRODUCTION</H2>
The quantification of Peru's Greenhouse Gas National Inventory is a 
complex task carried 
out by 
professionals and students of several institutions and universities in 
the country. To 
carry the work 
out in a systematic and methodological manner, work groups were 
formed with the 
participation of 
professional national staff and researchers of the National University 
of Engineering 
(UNI), the 
Peruvian Institute of Nuclear Energy (IPEN), and the National Service 
of Meteorology and 
Hydrology (SENAMHI).<br>
<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>METHODOLOGY</H2>
The National Greenhouse Inventory was carried out in accordance 
with the methodology 
developed 
by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the 
Organization for Economic 
Cooperation and Development (OECD). The guidelines and software 
(MINERG) provided by these 
institutions facilitated the planning and implementation of the 
National Inventory of 
Greenhouse 
Gases for l990.
<UL>Development of the national inventory included the following 
tasks:
<LI>Collecting and validating source data
<LI>Research on technical parameters such as emissions factors, 
carbon storage rates, the 
fraction of 
fuels not oxidized
<li>Application of the tables and worksheets established in the IPCC 
methodology
<LI>Processing and analysis of information
<LI>Use of the IPCC software (MINERG) to check the results obtained
<LI>Preparation of quarterly reports</UL>
<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>RESULTS&#139 ENERGY SECTOR</H2>
Using the methodology mentioned above, Peru's inventory for the 
energy sector is 
summarized in Tables 1&#139 7. 
<p>Results for emissions of CO<SUB>2</SUB> from energy sources for 
specific fuels using 
the 
IPCC (top-down) methodology are given in <a 
href="gifs/PeruTab1.gif">Table 1</a>.
<p>For comparative purposes and to lay the groundwork for future 
identification of 
mitigation 
policies, energy consumption and emissions were also estimated by 
sector. The results of 
the 
CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions from energy sources for specific fuels 
using this "bottom-up" 
approach are given in <a href="gifs/PeruTab2.gif">Table 2</a>.<br>
<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>DISCUSSION</H2>
<h3>Energy Sector</h3>
In order to obtain information on fuel consumption in each economic 
sector, it was 
necessary to 
recalculate the National Energy Balance for 1990, using information 
from qualified 
institutions and 
organizations, and consolidating these data in a main information 
source called Actualized 
Energy 
Balance&#139 1990. Using the Actualized Energy Balance, there is a 
2 percent of difference 
between the calculations of CO<SUB>2</SUB> from energy sources 
obtained in the "top-down" 
and "bottom-up" approach. This difference is due to "adjustments" 
(statistical tools used 
to make 
compatible the data corresponding to different information sources 
such as the National 
Council of 
Energy of the Ministry of Energy and Mines and the enterprise 
Petroleos del Peru S.A.). 
<p>CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions from fossil fuels were estimated to be 
19,300 Gg. However, if 
we consider the CO<SUB>2</SUB> generation by biomass consumption 
in the residential and 
commercial sectors, the emissions will be increased by 14,919 Gg. 
The contribution of 
other GHG's 
were moderate <a href="gifs/PeruTab3-6.gif">(See Table 3&#139 
6)</a>.
<h3>Non-Energy Sector</h3>
Information in this sector was gathered from government agencies 
such as the Ministry of 
Agriculture, Universities, the Statistical National Institute (INEI), the 
Agrarian 
Research Institute 
(INIAA), and others. Research articles, theses, and the bibliography 
of special 
publications (FAO, 
IVITA) were also reviewed. 98.1 percent of CO<SUB>2</SUB> 
emissions are from activities 
associated with land-use change and forestry, especially forest 
clearing. N<SUB>2</SUB>O 
is 
generated in minor amounts (6.19 Gg). 51 percent of this comes from 
fertilizer use, the 
burning of 
agricultural crop wastes, and savanna burning. The other 49 percent 
is generated from the 
burning of 
cleared forests .
<p>NO<sub>x</sub> emissions (121.53 Gg) result from activities 
associated with 
agriculture, 
livestock, and land-use change.  41.2 percent of total NO<sub>x</sub> 
emissions come from 
the 
burning of agricultural crop waste and savanna burning; the other 
58.8 percent is 
generated from the 
burning of cleared forests. The main source of CO emissions is forest 
clearing (59.2 
percent), 
followed by the burning of agricultural wastes and savannas (40.5 
percent), then 
industrial processes, 
with 0.2 percent of CO emissions resulting from lead manufacturing. 
<a 
href="gifs/PeruTab7.gif">Table 7</a> shows GHG 
emissions 
for the nonenergy sector.<br>
<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>CONCLUSIONS</H2>
The main greenhouse gases from energy activities in the country are 
CO<SUB>2</SUB> (19,300 Gg), followed by CO (622.712 Gg) and 
CH<SUB>4</SUB> (82.96 Gg), with minor emissions of nitrogen oxides. 
The transportation sector is the economic sector with the highest 
contribution of CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions from fossil fuel 
combustion, with gasoline as the major source of CO<SUB>2</SUB>. 
Other important sectors are residential, commercial, mining, 
metallurgy, fishing, public services, agriculture, and livestock. Energy 
conversion processes, particularly generating plants, also emit 
considerable quantities of CO<SUB>2</SUB>. The industry sector has 
smaller emissions.

<p>The main greenhouse gases from nonenergy activities in the 
country are CO<SUB>2</SUB> (58,313.94 Gg), followed by CO 
(10,850.32 Gg), CH<SUB>4</SUB> (1,204.91 Gg), NO<sub>x</sub> 
(121.53 Gg), and N<SUB>2</SUB>O (6.19 Gg). The source that 
generates highest CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions is land-use change due 
to the burning of cleared forest and the conversion of pastures to 
agriculture fields. On the other hand, the abandonment of 
cultivated 
lands and managed forests reabsorb CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions and 
reduce the total 
CO<SUB>2</SUB> in the atmosphere.
<p>Agriculture and livestock activities are the main sources of 
methane emissions with 
56.5 
percent of the total emissions. The main activities that contribute to 
high methane 
emissions are breeding of animals, savanna burning, and rice 
cultivation.<br>

<strong>Uruguay Climate Change Country Study Team, Comisi&#243 n 
Nacional sobre el Cambio Global, Montevideo, Uruguay</strong><br>

<p>SUMMARY: This article describes the methods and expected 
results of a research project for assessing Uruguay's vulnerability to 
climate change and adaptation options regarding agriculture and 
coastal resources. The study methodology has four basic steps: 1) 
Data collection and compilation, 2) Development of climate change 
scenarios, 3) Application of simulation model and other methods to 
evaluate physical and socioeconomic impacts, 4) 
Evaluation of adaptation options. The impact assessment for 
the agricultural sector will address the main winter crops 
(wheat and barley) and summer crops (maize and rice), and 
grasslands-livestock production. Crop simulation models and 
soil nutrient dynamics simulation models will be calibrated 
and validated. Models will be run under a series of scenarios 
(baseline, GCMs, analogue and incremental scenarios). 
Adaptive responses will be analyzed using cost-benefit 
analysis techniques. Coastal resources analysis will include 
initial application of a simple model using biophysical and 
socioeconomic data under selected sea-level rise scenarios, 
in order to identify and classify coastal units according to 
sensitivity. More detailed models will be selected and 
validated for studying the most sensitive areas. IPCC 
adaptation options will be evaluated by conducting a cost-
benefit analysis for each coastal unit. Results will be made 
available as inputs for an integrated coastal zone 
management plan. An education and outreach strategy for 
the dissemination of relevant information regarding both 
sectors to support policy and decisionmaking will be 
implemented.<br>
<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>INTRODUCTION</H2>
<h3>Scope of the Assessment</h3>
Previous studies at the international and regional level have proved 
that natural and human-induced climate variations ranging from 
short-
term (i.e., seasonal to interannual variability due to El Ni&#241 o 
Southern Oscillation (ENSO)) to long-term changes (i.e., temperature 
shifts and sea-level rise associated with greenhouse warming) may 
have a significant impact on water resources, on grasslands and 
livestock, on agriculture and forests, on physical aspects of the 
coastal 
zones, and even on human health. The associated occurrence of 
extreme events like floods, droughts, and severe weather conditions, 
as well as the steady change of average climatic conditions and 
morphological variations of the coastline are presently a matter of 
concern. 

<p>Climate change has been identified as one of the priority areas 
for further research within the context of Uruguay's National 
Research 
Program on Global Change (Comisi&#243 n Nacional Sobre el Cambio 
Global, 1995). The present article describes the context and methods 
for conducting a two-year sectoral vulnerability and adaptation 
assessment within the framework of the Uruguay Climate Change 
Country Study, initiated in late 1994 with support of the U.S. Country 
Studies Program. This study is being carried out by the Comisi&#243 
n 
Nacional Sobre el Cambio Global (National Committee for Global 
Change) of Uruguay with participation of the University of the 
Republic, 
several Government agencies, and nongovernmental institutions 
interested on the issue. 

<p>The impact assessment focuses on two sectors of particular 
relevance to the Uruguayan economy: agriculture (including crops as 
well as grasslands and livestock) and coastal resources. The purpose 
of 
the study is to evaluate the impact of climate change on natural 
systems and human activities in these sectors by analyzing their 
sensitivity to selected climate change scenarios and evaluating 
possible 
options for adapting to, and where possible taking advantage of, new 
environmental conditions. The results of this analysis will be used to 
promote public awareness regarding climate change and to formulate 
national strategies.
<h3>Geographic and Socioeconomic 
Situation</h3>
Uruguay is located entirely within the temperate zone of southern 
South America. Due to the country's small area (176.215 sq. km.) and 
absence of high altitudes (maximum of 500 m), its climate is almost 
homogeneous. It has been ranked as mesothermic subhumid 
according 
to K&#246 ppen's classification (K&#246 ppen, 1931). Monthly 
precipitation is uniformly distributed throughout the year, with a 
slight 
increase in the fall. Its spatial distribution shows a decreasing 
gradient 
in a NE-SW transect, with a maximum of total annual values of 1,400 
mm near the Brazilian border in the NE, and a minimum of 900 mm 
in 
the southeastern part of the country (Corsi, 1978).

<p>The country is located on the northern margin of the R&#237 o 
de la Plata, one of the widest estuarine bodies in the world. It is one 
of 
the five countries which make up the R&#237 o de la Plata Basin, a 
vast region undergoing rapid urban and industrial development. The 
Basin encloses an extensive hydrological network. Its regime has 
been 
affected by dams for hydroelectric generation and surface drainage 
of 
lowlands. Future modifications are foreseen as a result of the 
development of a navigation waterway (Hidrov&#237 a) connecting 
the northern countries of the Basin to the R&#237 o de la Plata. 

<p>Further, a large part of Uruguay's coastline lies on the 
Southwestern Atlantic Ocean, next to the confluence of the Brazil and 
Malvinas Currents. This complex system is known to significantly 
affect 
regional atmospheric circulation patterns.
 
<p>Uruguay's population amounts to little more than 3 million. About 
11 percent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) corresponds to 
agricultural production, 25 percent to industries&#139 which are 
mostly devoted to processing of agriculture and livestock 
products&#139 and 64 percent to the commercial and services 
sectors and others. Tourism, which mostly seeks Uruguayan coasts, 
accounts for a significant portion of the latter. 
<h3>Agricultural Sector</h3>
Uruguay's agricultural sector is oriented to beef and wool production 
on natural grasslands (85 percent of the country's territory), dairy 
production, and crop production in an area of about 4 percent of the 
country's territory. The climatic conditions in the region allow for the 
production of subtropical and temperate species, mainly wheat and 
barley as winter crops and maize, rice, sorghum, and sunflower as 
summer crops.

<p>Dominant soils in the country are Mollisols and Vertisols. They are 
characterized by a high variability in their water-holding capacity, 
their 
ability to supply nitrogen through mineralization and their ease for 
tilling. Farm management practices in the crop-growing area include 
rotating grain crops with pastures for livestock raising. Commonly, a 
period of about two to three years of crops is followed by four years 
of 
pastures (typically a mixture of white and red clover, birdsfoot 
trefoil 
and tall fescue). As a result of this system, soil conditions may vary 
depending on factors such as the time since the pasture was plowed, 
the length of the pasture and cropping stages, or the soil tillage 
practices. 

<p>Most of the beef and sheep products, as well as the barley and 
rice grain, are exported. Beef, wool, hides, and cereals account for 
about one-third of total exports. 

<p>Over the century, agricultural research has been devoted to 
improving the production of dry matter of pastures during the 
seasons 
of lower yields, i.e., in the winter due to low temperatures, and in the 
summer due to the lack of soil water. The introduction of species 
with 
high production potential and nutritional value during these seasons 
has increased the forage supply, especially in the dairy production 
area.
<p>
Crops have been improved through better management, including 
planting dates, fertilization, and high-yield varieties adapted to 
Uruguay's conditions. However, the heavy dependence of above 
production on climate variability, particularly rainfall and 
temperature, 
causes a high vulnerability of production systems to potential 
climatic 
changes. 

<p>Little research has been conducted for assessing vulnerability and 
adaptation options for the Uruguayan agricultural sector, namely 
some 
studies on winter crops (Baethgen, 1994; Baethgen and Magrin, 
1995) 
which are serving as a background for this study.
<h3>Coastal Resources</h3>
Although Uruguay has long been known as an agricultural country, 
its 
countryside is underpopulated while 70 percent of the total 
population 
lives in cities along its 670 km of coastline on the R&#237 o de la 
Plata 
and the Atlantic Ocean. The Uruguayan coastline is mostly 
characterized by the presence of long sandy beaches bounded by 
rocky headlands. The coastline supports a tourist industry which 
represents one of the main sources of income for the country. The 
concentration of population in coastal cities, as well as the 
development of summer resort areas, has generated a significant 
investment in infrastructure of various types. Investors from 
neighboring countries as well as from North America and Europe 
have 
played an important role in the development of the coastal area. 

<p>The potential long-term physical variations in the coastal area, 
namely land loss and storm surge variations associated with sea-
level 
rise, and the consequent socioeconomic impacts have so far been 
largely neglected in the implementation of development plans, both 
by 
the public and private sectors. A first assessment of the impacts of 
sea-level rise in Uruguay, which was conducted by Volont&#233  
and 
Nicholls (1994), provides a useful basis for this study. 
<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>METHODS</H2> 
<h3>Vulnerability and Adaptation Analysis for the 
Agricultural Sector</h3>

<p><strong><em>Data Acquisition and 
Compilation</strong></em><br>
Information and data bases for the study are being made available 
by 
various national institutions. Historical daily climate data covering a 
period of about 40 years from several weather stations throughout 
the 
country, as well as current climate data, will be provided by the 
Direcci&#243 n Nacional de Meteorolog&#237 a (National 
Meteorology 
Service). Additional climate information from selected sites will be 
obtained from the Instituto Nacional de Investigaci&#243 n 
Agropecuaria (INIA) (National Agriculture Research Institute). 

<p>Data on temperature, precipitation, and solar radiation will be 
compiled, digitized (when necessary), and verified. Soil maps such as 
a 
1:1,000,000 map for the entire country with profile descriptions for 
dominant and associated soil groups, a 1:200,000 map of main crop-
growing areas, and detailed maps with productivity indices for all 
soil 
types in the country will be used. All maps will be processed in a 
Geographical Information System (GIS) format. 

<p>Information on crops and pasture characteristics (e.g., phenology, 
quality, disease resistance, productivity), on production systems (i.e., 
yields, fertility requirements, and carryover effects), as well as on 
livestock production are available from INIA and the School of 
Agronomy of the University of the Republic. Additional current 
experimental information will be obtained, as it becomes necessary, 
in 
coordination with such institutions. Socioeconomic information will 
be 
obtained from Government agencies, nongovernmental research 
organizations and associations of farmers, as well as from published 
reports. 
<p><strong><em>Geographical Zoning</strong></em><br>
The study area is the entire territory of Uruguay. For the purpose of 
this study, key geographical zones will be selected combining 
information on climate, soils, topography, and production systems. A 
GIS (ARC/INFO Software) will be used for zoning purposes. 
Representative stations within each study unit defined by means of 
the 
GIS will be selected for further analysis. 
<p><strong><em>Development of 
Scenarios</strong></em><br>
Climate scenarios will be developed to estimate potential effects of 
climate change on crops and grasslands-livestock production. 
<ul><p>The following scenarios will be run:
<li>Baseline scenario, using climatological data covering a period of 30 
years (1951-80)
<li>Baseline scenario, with the direct effect of CO<SUB>2</SUB> on 
crops and pasture production corresponding with an increase of the 
atmospheric concentration of CO<SUB>2</SUB> to 440 ppm and 
555 ppm
<li>Climate change scenarios derived from General Circulation Models 
(GCMs) under normal and doubled CO<SUB>2</SUB> concentration 
conditions. The following GCMs will be used:</ul>
<dl><dt><dd> &#139 Goddard Institute of Space Sciences (GISS, Hansen 
et al. 
1983; Hansen et al., 1989)
<dd> &#139 Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL, Manabe 
and 
Wetherald, 1987)
<dd> &#139 United Kingdom Meteorological Office (UKMO, Wilson and 
Mitchell, 1987)
<dd> &#139 Other National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) 
models 
(Community Climate Model "CCM2")</dl>

Temperature changes for the first three GCMs listed (4.0&#45 
5.2&#176 C) are at or near 
the upper end of the range (1.5&#45 4.5&#176 C) 
projected for doubled CO<SUB>2</SUB> warming by the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 1990a, 1992a). 
The 
GISS and GFDL scenarios are near the mean temperature change 
(3.8&#176 C) of recent doubled CO<SUB>2</SUB> experiments 
documented for atmospheric GCMs with a seasonal cycle and a mixed 
layer ocean (IPCC, 1992a). 
<li>Transient climate scenarios based on GCMs for the 2010s, 2030s, 
and 2050s.
<li>Incremental scenarios, with a combination of changing 
temperatures by 0, +2, +4&#176 C, and changing precipitation by 0, 
+20 percent, and -20 percent over the current values, each with and 
without doubled CO<SUB>2</SUB> concentration.</dl>
Analogue scenarios, with special attention given to the identification 
of 
weather anomalies from historical records and extreme events 
(droughts and floods), such as those associated with the occurrence of 
the different phases of ENSO, will be analyzed.

<p>The GCMs present many uncertainties regarding predictions, and 
their ability to simulate current climate varies from region to region 
(Rosenzweig et al., 1993). On the other hand, different GCMs predict 
climate changes that are in some cases contradictory. For instance, 
previous studies (Baethgen, 1994) of Uruguay show similar trends in 
the average mean temperature for the GISS, GFDL and UKMO models, 
with an increase in the monthly average of about 5&#176 C. 
However, 
they show contrasting trends in precipitation, since the GISS and 
UKMO 
models predict a general increase in total precipitation, while the 
GFDL 
model predicts a slight decrease. In spite of such uncertainties, GCMs 
are so far the most advanced tools to predict potential future climatic 
consequences of increasing radiatively active trace gases in the 
atmosphere. The GCMs, combined with a local baseline scenario, and 
incremental and analogue scenarios, are expected to provide an 
overview of the potential future climatic conditions which could 
serve 
as a basis for the impact assessment regarding Uruguayan resources. 
<P>Comprehensive economic development scenarios for the country 
are not available so far. For the purpose of this study, general trends 
based on historical socioeconomic data as well as estimated patterns 
of development with regard to the agricultural sector will be 
considered 
for the impact assessment. 
<p><strong><em>Calibration and Validation of 
Models</strong></em><br>
The IBSNAT-ICASA (IBSNAT, 1989) crop models will be calibrated 
with 
experimental data from trials carried out by INIA and the School of 
Agronomy, and validated for the study area. Large datasets are 
available in Uruguay to calibrate and validate phenological and 
production genetic coefficients for simulation models. A few 
experiments will be established to obtain other required information. 
Background experience regarding validation and regional adaptation 
of 
CERES models for winter crops will be considered (Baethgen, 1994; 
Baethgen and Magrin, 1995)

<p>A longtime step soil nutrient dynamics simulation model, namely 
CENTURY (Parton et al., 1988), will be calibrated and validated for 
assessing climate change impacts on grassland ecosystems, while a 
short-time step model such as SPUR2 (Hanson et al., 1992) will be 
used to assess impacts on grassland-livestock production. 
<p><strong><em>Impact Analysis</strong></em><br>
Once the models are adequately validated, they will be used under 
the 
different climate scenarios for estimating potential effects of climate 
change on the:
<ul><li>Expected growth of the country's major agricultural crops 
(wheat, barley, rice and maize) assessed through grain yield 
components, total biomass, duration of growing period, grain quality
<li>Expected pasture yields of the natural grasslands areas
<li>Consequent effects on livestock production (dairy, beef, and 
wool)</ul><br>
<p><strong><em>Adaptation 
Assessment</strong></em><br> 
Adaptive measures will be evaluated with the application of 
simulation 
models to assess the options of reducing the impacts of climate 
change or taking advantage of any positive new conditions that may 
arise. Cost-benefit analysis of these measures will also be conducted. 
The present study will attempt to propose a comprehensive set of 
adaptive measures for crops and grassland/livestock production 
under 
the different scenarios, on the basis of their cost-benefit implications. 
These options will be provided as tools for decisionmaking at the 
governmental, farmer, and consumer levels. 

<p>A series of potential adaptive responses for the agricultural 
sector based on international and local experience have been 
analyzed 
<em>a priori</em> for the purpose of this study. Adaptive measures 
for crops production could include genetic improvement and changes 
in 
management practices and land use. 

<p>Regarding genetic improvement, for instance, it is estimated that 
an increase in global temperature could negatively affect rice 
blooming, 
and consequently yields. The development or selection of new 
varieties 
of rice more resistant to high temperature at the blooming stage 
could 
be attempted to reduce such impact. Selection of genotypes with 
lower requirements of vernalization could be considered as an 
adaptation measure to global warming in relation to wheat and 
barley.

<p>Further, genetic improvement could account for the negative 
effects on crops of an increase in climate variability, namely in 
precipitation. For that purpose, cultivars with higher resistance to 
environmental variations could be developed. The existence of 
significant experience in agricultural research in Uruguay, mainly at 
INIA 
and the School of Agronomy, would facilitate future research aimed 
at 
the selection of crop varieties more resistant to climate change or the 
testing of cultivars from other regions for use under local conditions. 

<p>Regarding crop management practices, previous analysis carried 
out for Uruguayan winter crops (Baethgen, 1994, Baethgen and 
Magrin, 1995) have proposed the reduction of the impacts of 
predicted unfavorable conditions by improving fertilization in 
combination with modified planting dates. Further, the use of soils 
with 
a better water balance&#139 associated with appropriate texture 
and 
depth&#139 could account for deficiencies in soil water content due 
to changes in precipitation patterns or higher evapotranspiration. 
Thus, 
the area of Tacuaremb&#243 /Rivera located at the northeast part of 
the country could be more suitable for summer crops than the ones 
presently used in the western and southern regions of the country, 
since their sandy soils present higher water availability.

<p>Irrigation of crops such as maize could account for lack of water 
during droughts if an increase in the variability of precipitation 
patterns 
occurs. Planting dates could also be changed according to new 
climatic 
conditions, in order to allow for the development of new cultivars. 
Further, fertilization could be improved in accordance with the new 
adapted crops cycles, although this measure by itself might not have 
a 
significant effect. 

<p>With relation to adaptation options for Uruguay, natural 
grasslands, changes in grazing cycles, delayed grazing, or rotating 
grazing could be considered. Seed sodding on natural pastures could 
reduce negative climate change impacts on grasslands, thus 
representing an appropriate method for mitigating the effects of the 
lack of water and excessive temperature on pasture dry matter 
yields. 
The development of combined pasture and forestry production 
systems could be better adjusted to conditions of climatic variability, 
particularly in soils which are sensitive to rainfall deficiencies.
<h2>Vulnerability and Adaptation Analysis of Coastal 
Resources</h2>
<p><strong><em>Data Acquisition and 
Compilation</strong></em><br>
There exists in Uruguay a considerable amount of information for the 
analysis of the impact on coastal resources, either available at 
national 
institutions or collected for specific studies, which can be used for the 
present assessment. However, much of the data need to be digitized 
and quality controlled. 

<p>Historical daily data on coastal water temperature, salinity, and 
tides along the coasts of the R&#237 o de la Plata and the Atlantic 
Ocean are available from the Servicio de Oceanograf&#237 a, 
Hidrograf&#237 a y Meteorolog&#237 a de la Armada (SOHMA) 
(Navy's Oceanography, Hydrography and Meteorology Service). 
Further 
data on physical and chemical water conditions in the R&#237 o de la 
Plata was collected during a pollution study in the area (CARP-
SOHMA-
SIHN, 1989). Sediment distribution data for the same area have been 
compiled in a Sediment Atlas (SOHMA, 1993). However, 
oceanographic 
and sediment information for the oceanic area is more sparse. Long-
term historical climate data is available both from the SOHMA and 
the 
National Meteorology Service.
General physical data, including coastal topography, bathymetry, 
sediment types, and wave data, have been collected during a 
Government study on beaches conservation (MTOP-PNUD-UNESCO, 
1979). Additional wave information will be generated through 
models 
due to the lack of sufficient field data with the assistance of the 
Instituto de Mec&#225 nica de los Flu&#237 dos e Ingenier&#237 a 
Ambiental (IMFIA) of the School of Engineering.

<p>Long-term tide gauge data collected at ports is available from 
the National Hydrography Office. 

<p>A series of coastline maps as well as historical and current aerial 
photographic records available at the Geographic Military Service 
and 
the National Office of Environment, videotapes obtained for previous 
studies (Volont&#233  and Nicholls, 1994) as well as satellite 
imagery 
will also be analyzed.

<p>Besides the existing data, a one-year coastal monitoring program 
will be set up to estimate the behavior of different stretches of 
coastline when subject to storms. Data such as beach profiles, 
observed wave heights, and sand grain size will be collected.

<p>In addition to biophysical data, general qualitative and 
quantitative information on economic activities and other social and 
economic indices will be obtained from Government agencies, 
published 
reports and articles, as well as from experts and local people's 
judgment. 
<p><strong><em>Selection of Scenarios</strong></em><br>
Among the potential impacts of climate change in coastal areas, two 
main aspects will be considered for the present study: an increase in 
sea-level rise and a modification of wave characteristics.

<p>Significant effort has been devoted at the international level to 
develop sea-level rise scenarios. The most likely estimate of sea-
level 
rise by the year 2100 according to the IPCC will be tested. The sea-
level rise scenarios will include the current rate (0.2 m by 2100) 
scenario (Douglas, 1991) and the accelerated rates (0.5 and 1.0 m) 
scenarios (Wigley and Raper, 1992).

<p>With regard to potential modification of wave characteristics, no 
conclusive studies are so far available. Sensitivity analyses will be 
performed in order to estimate potential changes associated with 
increasing and decreasing storm energy and with shifts in direction 
of 
deep water waves. 

<p>Climate change scenarios will be combined with socioeconomic 
considerations to achieve a comprehensive assessment of potential 
changes. Since economic development scenarios for the country are 
not available, general trends based on historic socioeconomic data, as 
well as estimated patterns of development for the coastal area, will 
be 
considered for the impact assessment. 
<p><strong><em>Preliminary Coastal Assessment and 
Zoning</strong></em><br>
The study area includes the entire Uruguayan coastal zone on the 
R&#237 o 
de la Plata and the Atlantic Ocean. For the purpose of this study, the 
term coastal zone refers to the area with mutual influence of sea and 
land. Specific boundaries to such area will be defined as appropriate 
during the study. 

<p>The first stage of the study will consist of a screening of the 
entire coastal area to assess its overall vulnerability to climate 
change 
and identify those zones potentially more sensitive to sea-level rise. 
This preliminary assessment will be based primarily on the analysis 
of 
available information and experts judgment. 

<P>The predicted physical conditions&#139 namely modification of 
beach profiles&#139 under the selected scenarios will be 
determined. 
Erosion assessment methods, such as Bruun's Rule (Bruun, 1962, 
1983) will be applied to the Uruguayan coast. Since inundation is not 
an important process in the area, assessment of inundation impacts 
will 
not be considered in this study. The selection and validation for the 
area of other simple models to further assess the effects of storms on 
the new equilibrium profiles will be carried out. A general analysis 
will 
be further conducted for the social and economic implications of the 
morphological changes, namely cost of land loss, effects on coastal 
structures, and effects on coastal activities.

<p>Zoning will be carried out by means of a GIS with the results of 
the preliminary screening. Homogeneous coastal units will be defined 
and classified according to their sensitivity. Sensitivity indexes will 
combine both physical and socioeconomic considerations. The most 
sensitive coastal units will be selected for further analysis. 
<p><strong><em>Biophysical Impact Analysis in Selected 
Coastal Units</strong></em><br>
A second stage of biophysical impact analysis in the selected coastal 
units will be carried out under the sea-level rise scenarios, in order 
to 
further assess potential morphological changes in the area, namely 
land 
loss. General procedures for the indepth analysis will be similar as 
for 
the preliminary assessment. At this second stage, a more detailed 
model will be selected and validated for the study area to estimate 
the 
effects of sea level rise on the beach profile. For the purpose of this 
analysis, the wave information will be transformed from deep water 
to 
the near-shore zone more precisely&#139 e.g. in the bottom 
topography&#139 for each coastal unit.
During the baseline impact analysis it will be assumed that no 
adaptation policy is implemented. Therefore, it can be said that the 
sheer effects of sea-level rise will be determined at this stage. Once 
the effects on the beach profiles are determined, a map of the 
predicted shoreline will be prepared. Geological information will be 
overimposed to the erosion pattern to validate the assumption about 
granular material erosion. An additional study of the general effects 
of 
sea-level rise and the consequent shift of the shore profile on the 
coastal biota will be carried out. Special attention will be paid to 
benthic fauna and to the typical flora adapted to the coastal 
environment.
<p><strong><em>Socioeconomic 
Analysis</strong></em><br>
A qualitative and quantitative assessment of the social and economic 
consequences of potential changes in coastal configuration under the 
climate change scenarios, namely the values of present and future 
economic activities and resources that might be lost, will be carried 
out. On each coastal unit likely to be affected by sea-level rise, 
information on land ownership (public or private) will be sought and 
value of land, coastal infrastructure (e.g., ports, seawalls and 
breakwaters, roads), beachfront houses, tourists resorts, buildings, 
and 
commercial establishments will be estimated. Impacts of climate 
change on the coastal activities (e.g., tourism) and associated social 
indexes such as the level of employment will be further assessed. On 
the basis of the biophysical and socioeconomic information obtained, 
a 
preliminary assessment of the overall vulnerability to climate change 
of 
the study zones will be sought in order to analyze the response 
options 
that would be required for each zone under the predicted scenarios.
<p><strong><em>Adaptation Analysis</strong></em><br>
The three basic adaptation options identified by the IPCC (IPCC, 
1990b), namely <strong>retreat, accommodate,</strong> and 
<strong>protect, </strong>will be analyzed. Each category will be 
developed to identify specific alternatives for Uruguay. For each 
coastal unit the options will be compared by estimating their costs 
and 
benefits. In the case of options requiring maintenance, the annual 
cost 
will be calculated. A cost-benefit analysis will be performed using 
the 
information of the investment costs and the yearly maintenance 
costs.

<p>For each coastal unit the possible adaptation options will be 
ranked according to the results of the cost-benefit analysis, taking 
into 
account social, economic, and environmental considerations. No 
adaptation option will be selected, but advantages and disadvantages 
will be pointed out in order to provide a tool for decisionmakers. 
Further, the study will attempt to provide its results in such a 
fashion 
that they could be easily incorporated into the process of the 
formulation of an Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) Plan 
for 
Uruguay. 
 <H2 ALIGN=CENTER>EDUCATION AND OUTREACH</H2>
The information produced or compiled during the study will serve as 
a 
basis for the development of a national information system on 
climate 
change, especially regarding vulnerability and adaptation. The 
information will be made available to all potential users through 
electronic media and reports. 

<p>The different target sectors that have been identified for the 
preparation of an education and outreach plan are the political 
sector, 
the Government, the business and industrial sectors, the educators, 
and the general public. An overall survey of the degree of awareness 
and knowledge of these sectors regarding climate change and its 
impacts, as well as their interest in obtaining information on the 
subject and applying it to decisionmaking processes, will be 
conducted 
at an early stage of the education and outreach activities. Such a 
survey will be performed by means of interviews and meetings. 

<p>Further, general dissemination of information is to be achieved 
through workshops, seminars, and conferences; through deliverables 
(publications, reports, brochures), and through the local press. The 
basis for the formulation of a long-term education and outreach 
strategy on climate change will be outlined jointly with Uruguayan 
institutions with expertise in the educational and social 
communication 
fields.

<p>SUMMARY: This paper presents a summary of the "Preliminary 
Inventory on Sources and Sinks of Greenhouse Gases in Venezuela," 
whose final version will be submitted to the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), as an official 
document of the Venezuelan Government. This inventory is one of 
the components of the National Study to Address Climate Change. The 
gases included in this inventory are carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous 
oxide, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, and nonmethane volatile 
organic compounds.  Chlorofluorocarbons are excluded as they are 
controlled by the Montreal Protocol.  <a 
href="gifs/VenTab1.gif">Table 1</a> provides a summary of 
greenhouse gas 
emissions by 
source category. The energy sector is the most important 
anthropogenic 
source in the country. Emissions mainly come from the use of energy 
as 
fuel, land-use change, and from fugitive emissions generated by oil 
and 
gas production. Carbon dioxide is the most important gas, its 
emissions 
originate primarily from fuel combustion and forest clearing.<a 
href= "gifs/VenTab2.gif">[Table 2]</a> Methane 
has also an important contribution to national emissions of 
greenhouse 
gases, and it originates primarily from oil and gas production and 
agricultural activities. This national inventory represents a valuable 
tool 
to predict future greenhouse gas emissions under various economic 
development scenarios and to identify the best mitigation strategies 
that 
the country could implement to reduce its emission levels.
<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>INTRODUCTION</H2>
Atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases have been 
increasing as a result of a 
wide range of human activities and have become particularly 
noticeable after the 
1950s. This increase is believed to alter the redistribution of energy 
in the atmosphere 
and, consequently, affect climate by altering some related natural 
phenomenon, such 
as the mean global temperature, and changes in frequency and 
distribution of 
precipitation, circulation and weather patterns, and hydrological 
cycle, among others.

<P>The possibility of a global climate change, as a result of 
anthropogenic 
emissions of greenhouse gases, has become a major concern within 
the international 
scientific community in the last few years. Such concern was the 
basis for the creation 
of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and for the 
process of 
international negotiations that led to the approval of the United 
Framework 
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The Government of 
Venezuela also 
signed the Convention which was ratified by the National Congress on 
December 
1994.

<p>As the Convention requires all parties to develop and publish 
national 
inventories of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions as well as 
national plans to 
reduce or control emissions, the Ministry of Environment and 
Renewable Natural 
Resources and the Ministry of Energy and Mines developed the 
Country Study to 
Address Climate Change. The study was initiated in October 1993, 
with the financial 
and technical assistance of the Government of the United States, 
through the U.S. 
Country Study Program (USCSP), and the Global Environmental 
Facility (GEF), 
through the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP). 

<p>A team of experts from several Venezuelan ministries and 
institutions are in 
charge of conducting this study, with the following objectives:
<ul><li>Develop a national inventory of anthropogenic emissions by 
sources and 
removals by sinks of all greenhouse gases in accordance with IPCC 
guidelines.
<li>Predict future greenhouse gas emissions under various economic 
development 
scenarios. 
<li>Identify, analyze, and rank abatement strategies through the 
formulation of a 
national plan to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions in the country 
and enhance 
reservoirs and sinks.
<li>Assess the potential impacts generated by sea level rise on 
Margarita Island and 
Venezuelan coastal zones and outline the possible adaptation 
responses.
<li>Assess the potential impacts and adaptation strategies on 
Venezuelan forests due 
to climate change.</ul>
A study of this kind is very important for a developing country like 
Venezuela, whose 
current national plans include programs of industrial development, 
increased public 
services, and expansion of petroleum industry activities. All of these 
national 
development programs will likely increase greenhouse gas emissions, 
unless programs 
of conservation, efficient use of energy, and methane gas control are 
implemented 
simultaneously. These development plans have also affected forest 
areas extensively 
as the establishment of a wide range of economic activities have 
been traditionally 
linked to land clearing.

<p>The final project reports are intended to be released as official 
documents of the 
Government of Venezuela as a first step to implementing the 
guidelines set forth in 
the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.
<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>METHODS</H2>
The estimation of emissions from all sources was based on the 
methodology provided 
by the IPCC Draft Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
(IPCC/OECD, 
1994). Some default values provided by the methodology for specific 
variables and 
emission factors were used in the inventory as local data were not 
always available. In 
many cases, the required data were specifically generated for the 
inventory through 
literature search, site visits, or interviews with experts. In a few 
cases, specific 
studies 
were performed in order to produce or validate some of the data. 

<p>The results of this inventory are also presented in accordance 
with the IPCC 
guidelines, following the reporting instruction tables. Besides the 
analysis and 
estimates of 1990 greenhouse gas emissions and sinks, the document 
to be submitted 
to UNFCCC provides a global picture of the main anthropogenic 
activities responsible 
for these emissions in the country and a description of particular 
situations that could 
introduce additional elements in the inventory process. It also 
provides specific 
discussions on methodologies, data used, and information sources for 
each category. 

<p>The international standards set for the inventory process, based 
on a common 
methodology, seek to ensure that all mechanisms and approaches 
adopted by the 
countries to evaluate their greenhouse gas emissions are consistent 
and transparent and 
that their results can be compared on a systematic manner.
<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</H2>
The following section summarizes the emission estimates and 
presents a brief 
discussion on the relative importance of each source category within 
the national 
inventory of greenhouse gas emissions. 
<h3>Carbon Dioxide</h3>
Carbon dioxide contributes to nearly one third of the natural 
greenhouse effect. A 
continuous increase of its concentration in the atmosphere, produced 
by anthropogenic 
activities, has been observed from the beginning of the industrial 
period. At a global 
level, since then, the concentration of carbon dioxide has increased 
by more than 25 
percent, mainly due to the use of fossil fuel. Venezuela generated 
190,813 Gg of 
carbon dioxide in 1990. The main sources are energy-combustion 
and land-use change 
<a href="gifs/VenFig1.gif">(Figure 1)</a>.
<p><strong><em>Energy Sector</strong></em><br>
The use of fossil fuels constitutes the main anthropogenic source of 
greenhouse gases. 
Within this, carbon dioxide is the most important contributor; 
emissions of this gas 
occur during the combustion process, when the carbon contained in 
the fuel is 
combined with oxygen. The quantity of carbon in fossil fuels varies 
significantly by 
fuel type. Coal contains the greatest amount of carbon per unit of 
energy, while crude 
oil and natural gas contain 25 percent and 50 percent less than coal, 
respectively.

<p>In Venezuela, the energy sector emitted 107,334 Gg of carbon 
dioxide in 1990, 
which represented 56 percent of national emissions of this gas. 
Energy combustion 
generated 105,976 Gg (98.7 percent of the energy sector), while gas 
flaring in the oil 
and gas systems produced the remainder 1,358 Gg (1.3 percent of 
the sector).

<p>Carbon dioxide emissions from combustion are mainly caused by 
the use of oil 
and natural gas. The former generated 53,313 Gg, while emissions 
from natural gas 
were estimated to be 50,742 Gg, which represented 50 percent and 
48 percent of these 
emissions, respectively. Coal represented only 2 percent of these 
emissions since coal 
consumption in the country is very low. Regarding emission 
estimates of carbon 
dioxide by sectors, as shown in <a href="gifs/VenFig2.gif">Figure 
2</a>, the emissions 
come 
mainly from the 
transportation sector (36 percent) and the operations of the energy 
industry (38 
percent).
<p><strong>Stationary Sources.</strong>  In 1990, stationary sources 
emitted 51,560 Gg of carbon dioxide, mainly from the use of oil (31 
percent) and 
natural gas (67 percent). The greatest amount of emissions within 
the stationary 
sources corresponds to the energy industry, which generated 30,516 
Gg. The sources 
of emissions in this industry are related primarily to electricity 
generation (19,519 Gg) 
and oil and gas production (10,997 Gg).

<p>The second largest source is the manufacturing industry, which 
generated 
16,775 Gg of CO<SUB>2</SUB>. Most of these emissions come from 
energy used 
for steam generation (41 percent) and direct heat (44 percent). The 
industrial 
categories that produce the greatest quantities of emissions are: basic 
metallic; food, 
beverages and tobacco; chemicals and nonmetallic mineral industries, 
which all 
together generated 86 percent of the emissions from the 
manufacture sector.

<p>The residential sector generated 3,678 Gg of CO<SUB>2</SUB> while 
the 
commercial and service sectors emitted 572 Gg. Regarding the fuel 
types used in this 
sectors, petroleum is the main emitter, followed by natural gas.

<p><strong>Mobile Sources.</strong> The 1990 emissions of carbon 
dioxide from mobile sources were estimated to be 29,205 Gg; 88 
percent corresponds 
to national transportation and the remainder to different types of 
international 
transport. Gasoline vehicles are the most important emitter, with 
21,760 Gg.

<p>Emissions from national transportation are basically generated by 
road 
transportation (93 percent). The emissions released from private 
vehicles are the most 
important within this sector, with 10,593 Gg of carbon dioxide in 
1990, which 
represented 39 percent, followed by the emissions from heavy duty 
trucks, with 27 
percent. Emissions from public transportation are the least 
significant, as they only 
contributed with 14.4 percent. 
<p><strong><em>Land-Use Change and Forest 
Management</strong></em><br>
Human activities that alter the biosphere for food, fuel, and fiber 
production have been 
increasingly contributing to the concentration of greenhouse gases in 
the atmosphere. 
Carbon dioxide is considered to be the most important gas associated 
with land-use 
changes. Three categories are considered in the national inventory: 
forest clearing, 
forest management, and conversion of grasslands to cultivated lands. 
Land-use change 
is largely responsible for greenhouse gas emissions in Venezuela. The 
forest 
conversion process that the country has witnessed during the last 
decades has 
increased significantly as land pressure to establish different 
economic activities has 
determined the fate of large forest areas. Furthermore, land clearing 
for agricultural 
use is the most important activity leading the process of land-use 
change. 

<p><strong>Forest Clearing.</strong> The forest area of the country 
is roughly 58 million hectares, which represents more than 60 
percent of the national 
territory. About 70 percent of the forest land is found in the south of 
the country, 
where the Venezuelan Amazonian Basin is located.

<p>The annual rate of forest clearing in Venezuela has not been 
consistently 
documented. The country was divided into three main geographical 
regions, according 
to specific sources of information on forest-clearing rates: Northwest, 
northeast, and 
south, in order to derive an average deforestation rate. The analysis 
estimated an 
average cleared area of approximately 517.000 hectares per year 
(excluding the 
southern region), which represents a deforestation rate of less than 1 
percent per year. 
This value was used to provide an approximation of greenhouse 
emissions in the 
country due to forest clearing until a more detailed study on 
deforestation rates at a 
national level is performed. An initiative is already being 
coordinated to achieve this 
goal in the near future. 

<p>The amount of carbon dioxide emitted by forest clearing has been 
estimated to 
be 84,792 Gg in 1990, which represents about 44 percent of national 
CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions. Being one of the most important sources 
of carbon 
dioxide and other gases as well as one of the most complex areas, a 
number of issues 
will still need to be refined in order to improve the estimates and 
update the inventory.

<p><strong>Managed Forests.</strong> Carbon dioxide uptake from 
managed forests has been estimated to be 5,380 Gg in 1990, which 
represents an 
offset of about 6 percent and 3 percent of CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions 
from forest 
clearing and all sources, respectively. Although its importance as a 
carbon dioxide 
sink may not seem relevant within the national greenhouse gas 
emission context, the 
potential contribution of forest management to offsetting 
CO<SUB>2</SUB> 
emissions is quite large. The total forest area managed by 
commercial forest product 
industries during the 1970&#139 90 period has reached 215,000 
hectares. On the 
other hand, forest plantations have reached, for the same period, 
about 430.000 
hectares. More than 90 percent of the area corresponds to 
commercial plantations 
while the rest has been established for protection purposes. 

<p><strong>Conversion of Grasslands to Agricultural Lands.</strong>  
Conversion of 
grasslands to cultivated lands is not a significant 
source of carbon dioxide in the country, as agricultural activities 
have been rather 
marginal within the national economic development context. Most of 
the agricultural 
activities in these areas are related to extensive cattle raising, which 
does not involve 
land tilling. However, some important crops have been established on 
open savannas, 
especially during the 1984&#139 89 period, when government 
subsidies resulted in a 
substantial increase of agricultural production. Based on local data 
for soil carbon 
content, the estimated net converted area, and a rate of soil loss 
carbon of 2 percent 
per year, emissions were calculated to be 1,200 Gg of carbon dioxide. 
As the data 
used are not very reliable, the result obtained is highly uncertain 
and should be viewed 
as a general approximation of the magnitude of emissions from this 
source. 
<h3>Methane</h3>
Methane is the second most important gas responsible for global 
warming, accounting 
for about 15 percent of the "radiative forcing" added to the 
atmosphere in the 1980s, at 
a global level. Methane levels are increasing substantially, as its 
concentration have 
more than doubled in the past 300 years and continue to increase by 
about 1 percent 
per year. Although global methane emissions are much smaller than 
global carbon 
dioxide emissions, its overall contribution to global warming is large 
since it is 22 
times more effective at trapping heat in the atmosphere over 100-
year time horizon 
when direct and indirect effects are accounted for.

<p>Methane emissions in Venezuela were estimated to be 3,168 Gg 
for 1990. The 
major anthropogenic sources are: fugitive emissions from production 
and processing 
of oil and natural gas and emissions from agricultural activities <a 
href="gifs/VenFig3.gif">(Figure 3)</a>.
<p><strong><em>Energy Sector</strong></em><br>
The energy sector emitted 1,838 Gg of methane in 1990, which 
represented 58 percent 
of national methane emissions. Fugitive emissions are the most 
important source of 
this gas with 99.3 percent while fuel combustion only generated 0.7 
percent.

<p>Oil and gas systems are the main methane emitters, especially 
during production 
activities, which generated around 83 percent of the total fugitive 
emissions. 
Emissions corresponding to processing, transportation, and 
distribution of natural gas 
represented 17 percent. The contribution of coal mining is very 
small, due to the low 
level of production of this fuel in the country.

<p>The use of fossil fuel in transportation is the most important 
source of emissions 
of the non-CO<SUB>2</SUB> originated by combustion, mainly those 
generated by 
incomplete combustion, such as methane. The mobile sector is the 
second largest 
emitter of methane with 9.8 Gg, representing 81 percent of 
combustion emissions; 
gasoline vehicles produced the biggest amounts, especially private 
vehicles, which 
generated 4.9 Gg.
<p><em><strong>Agriculture</em></strong><br>
Methane is the most important greenhouse gas produced by the 
agricultural sector and 
is responsible for the emission of 951 Gg, which represents 30 
percent on the national 
methane emissions. Management of domestic livestock and animal 
manure contributes 
90 percent of the methane emissions from agricultural activities. Rice 
cultivation and 
savanna burning are a less important source of methane, releasing 7 
percent and 3 
percent of the emissions from agricultural activities, respectively. 
Field burning of 
agricultural residues are a negligible source of methane and other 
greenhouse gases as 
this practice is not common in the country. 
<p><strong>Enteric Fermentation.</strong> Emissions from enteric 
fermentation in domestic animals are estimated to be 826 Gg of 
methane, which 
represents about 26 percent of national methane emissions and 87 
percent of methane 
emissions from agricultural activities. The more detailed approach of 
the IPCC 
methodology, referred to as Tier 2, was applied in order to derive 
methane emissions 
from cattle. Dairy and beef cattle are the major contributors, 
accounting for 97 percent 
of total emissions from enteric fermentation. Methane emissions 
from other domestic 
animals include buffalo, sheep, horses, swine, goats, mules, and asses. 
The approach 
used to calculate the emissions from these noncattle sources was 
based on the Tier 1 
method, and consequently a less detailed analysis was performed. 
Methane emissions 
from these animals have been calculated to be 23.2 Gg, about 3 
percent of methane 
emissions from enteric fermentation in all domestic animals.

<p><strong>Manure Management.</strong> Methane emissions from 
animal 
manure are estimated to be 26.7 Gg, which represents only 3 percent 
of the total 
amount generated by domestic livestock and less than 1 percent of 
national methane 
emissions. Manure in the country is usually not treated or stored in 
anaerobic 
environments. Thus, almost all livestock manure is managed as solid 
on pastures and 
ranges. Of the different animal categories included in this estimate, 
cattle and swine 
manure are the most significant emitters, accounting for 
approximately 55 percent and 
34 percent of total methane emissions from animal manure, 
respectively.

<p><strong>Rice Production.</strong> Rice fields generate about 67 Gg 
of 
methane per year and represent 2 percent of national methane 
emissions. Rice is one 
of the country's major crops and most of its production is 
concentrated in two regions 
with similar climate patterns and cultivation practice. Rice fields are 
commonly 
irrigated or rainfed with a depth of less than one meter of 
floodwater, which is a basic 
condition to generate methane through the anaerobic decomposition 
of organic matter 
in the fields. Although some variations were found in the number of 
days flooded per 
year, this period has an average of nearly 90 days, corresponding to 
a continuously 
flooded regime. Rice is not cultivated under intermittently flooded or 
dry regimes in 
the country. 

<p><strong>Savanna Burning.</strong> More than one-fourth of the 
country (approximately 22 million hectares) is covered by savannas, 
found in most 
geographical regions, but mainly in the Llanos of the central part of 
the country. 
Extensive cattle raising has been traditionally established on savanna 
areas, which 
involves burning during the dry season, as a common agricultural 
practice to eliminate 
weeds and pests and encourage growth of new grass. This periodical 
burning of a 
great portion of savanna areas releases important non-
CO<SUB>2</SUB> trace 
gases. Carbon dioxide, which is also emitted in large quantities, is not 
taken into 
account in the greenhouse gas inventory for this sector because it is 
reabsorbed by the 
vegetation regrowth between the burning cycles. Methane emissions 
from this source 
were estimated to be 31 Gg, which represents only 1 percent of 
methane national 
emissions.

<p>The proportion of the savanna areas burned in Venezuela is 
highly uncertain as 
there are not reliable national statistics that compile, on a regular 
basis, the frequency 
and extent of savanna burning. Consequently, a satellite imagery 
study (Landsat TM, 
1:250.000 scale) was performed on about half of the savanna area of 
the country in 
order to determine this figure. An extrapolation of the study's results 
indicates that 
approximately 3.1 million hectares of savanna are annually burned, 
which represents 
only 13 percent of the country's savanna area. These results are very 
controversial as 
the proportion of savanna burned appears to be very low, especially 
when compared to 
the regional data provided by the IPCC methodology. From this 
source, savannas are 
burned worldwide every 1 to 4 years on average (IPCC/OECD, 1994). 
<p><strong>Burning of Agricultural Residues in the Fields.</strong> 
The contribution of this source to greenhouse gas emissions in the 
country is rather 
negligible as only 0.2 Gg of methane were generated by agricultural 
waste burning. 
Most of the agricultural residues are not burned since they are 
commonly used to feed 
cattle and other animals or plowed back into the field during land 
tilling. The only two 
crops whose residues are indeed burned for different reasons are 
sugar cane and 
cotton. Sugar cane fields are traditionally burned before the harvest 
for both practical 
and safety reasons. Cotton residues are also burned but mainly for 
sanitary reasons in 
order to eliminate any possible pest or weed that may affect the 
health and yield of the 
following crop.
<p><strong><em>Landfills</strong></em><br>
Landfills do not constitute a significant source of methane in the 
country since a great 
fraction of solid wastes is still disposed of in open dumping. Sanitary 
landfilling 
generates 221 Gg of methane, which represents about 7 percent of 
national emissions. 
Twenty landfills were identified, with a wide size range. The smallest 
of these 
receives an average of less than 3,000 Ton of solid wastes per year 
while more than 1 
million Ton per year are placed in the biggest landfill. The latter 
alone, which serves 
the capital's metropolitan area, accounts for more than 40 percent of 
the total 
landfilled waste in the country. 
<p><strong><em>Other Sources</strong></em><br>
Other activities that generate methane in the country are related to 
land-use change 
and wastewater management. Biomass burning that occurs in 
conjunction with forest 
clearing has been included in the national inventory. Emissions from 
this practice 
were estimated to be 158 Gg, which represents nearly 5 percent of 
national methane 
emissions. This estimate will be updated once the deforestation rate 
data are validated. 
Wastewater treatment is a negligible emitter of greenhouse gases as 
only 0.2 Gg of 
methane were generated by this source. 
<h3>Nitrous Oxide</strong><br> 
Nitrous oxide is another important infrared absorbing trace gas that 
contributes to the 
greenhouse effect. According to the World Meteorological 
Organization (WMO) its 
current atmospheric concentration is about 8 percent greater than 
during the 
preindustrial era. Nitrous oxide is approximately 270 times more 
powerful than 
CO<SUB>2</SUB> at trapping heat in the atmosphere over a 100-year 
time horizon. 
The current rate of accumulation of N<sub>2</sub>O in the 
atmosphere is about 0.2 
percent to 0.3 percent per year. 

<P>Although the estimates are relatively uncertain, nitrous oxide 
emissions in 
Venezuela were calculated to be 4.54 Gg for 1990. The most 
important contributor is 
the agricultural sector, especially the use of fertilizer (agricultural 
soil management). 
Nitrous oxide is also produced directly from biomass burning in the 
nonenergy sector 
and combustion of fossil fuels <a href="gifs/VenFig4.gif">(Figure 
4)</a>. Nevertheless, 
the 
mechanisms that cause its 
formation from these sources are not well understood. 
N<sub>2</sub>O production is 
highly temperature-dependent.
<p><strong><em>Energy Sector</strong></em><br>
The Venezuelan energy sector is the least important contributor to 
nitrous oxide 
emissions with 0.64 Gg, representing 14 percent of the national 
emissions in 1990. 
Within this sector, 66 percent comes from mobile sources, especially 
road vehicles (93 
percent); the highest proportion corresponds to heavy-duty trucks. 
Contrary to the 
industrialized countries estimates, where fuel consumption, mainly 
from aged 3-way 
catalytic converters, is an important emitter, in Venezuela this source 
is the least 
relevant since the vehicle fleet has not yet incorporated catalytic 
converter control.

<p>Stationary sources emitted 0.22 Gg of nitrous oxides (34 percent 
of the 
combustion emissions) where 46 percent comes from energy and 
transformation 
industries, 38 percent from manufacture industry, and 18 percent 
from residential and 
commercial sectors.
<P><strong><em>Agricultural Soil Management</strong></em><br>
In 1990, nitrous oxide emission from the use of chemical fertilizers 
were estimated to 
be 2.3 Gg. This is the main source of nitrous oxide in Venezuela, and 
represents 50 
percent of total N<sub>2</sub>O emissions in the country and 
approximately 85 
percent of the agricultural sector's emissions. Organic fertilizers are 
not included in 
this estimate due to the lack of the required data. Although some 
crop residues and 
animal manure are used in certain agricultural fields, this type of 
fertilizer does not 
usually enter the commercial market, and consequently, no reliable 
source of 
information is available to estimate the total amount of organic 
fertilizer and the 
equivalent nitrogen content.
<p><strong><em>Other Sources</strong></em><br>
Other sources of nitrous oxides in the country are related to biomass 
burning as a 
result of land use change and agricultural practices. Both forest 
burning that occurs in 
conjunction with land clearing and savanna burning account for 1.2 
Gg of nitrous 
oxide, which represents about 27 percent of this gas national 
emissions. Agricultural 
waste burning is a negligible source of nitrous oxide. 
<h3>Carbon Monoxide and Nonmethane Volatile Organic 
Compounds</h3>
Carbon monoxide and nonmethane volatile organic compounds 
(NMVOCs) are 
unburned gaseous fuels that are emitted in small quantities due to 
incomplete 
combustion. They contribute to the formation of urban smog and 
hence they have 
been the target of emission control policies in some countries. The 
impact of these 
gases on global climate is indirect. The most important of these 
effects is their role as 
precursors of tropospheric ozone. In this role, they contribute to 
ozone formation and 
alter the atmospheric lifetimes of other greenhouse gases. However, 
many 
uncertainties are associated with quantifying the indirect effects.

<p>Carbon monoxide emissions in Venezuela were estimated to be 
4,101 Gg for 
1990, where agriculture acclivities and land use change contributed 
with 55 percent 
while energy combustion represented 45 percent of national 
emissions <a 
href="gifs/VenFig5.gif">(Figure 5)</a>. All 
nonmethane volatile organic compounds are emitted by the transport 
sector, which 
generated 250 Gg in 1990. 
<p><strong><em>Energy Sector</strong></em><br>
In energy combustion, emissions of these gases are directly 
influenced by usage 
patterns, technology type and size, vintage, maintenance and 
operation of the 
technology, and usage patterns. Emissions can vary by several orders 
of magnitude for 
facilities that are improperly maintained and poorly operated such as 
the case of many 
older units. Carbon monoxide emissions from the Venezuelan energy 
sector were 
basically generated by the transport sector, which produced 98 
percent; the remainder 
2 percent corresponded to stationary sources, especially from the 
manufacture 
industry. It is important to mention that almost all emissions of 
carbon monoxide (98 
percent) and NMVOCs (96 percent) are generated by gasoline 
vehicles.

<p>The need to manage a wide range of variables and the numerous 
conditions that 
could affect the yield of each mobile sources category, especially 
those related to road 
transport, make very difficult any attempt to generalize the emission 
characteristics in 
this area. A similar situation is observed for stationary sources since 
the emission 
factors provided by the IPCC methodology are not sufficiently 
disaggregated. Some 
adjustments were made in order to perform the emission estimates.
<p><strong><em>Savanna Burning</strong></em><br>
Savanna burning represents an important source of carbon monoxide 
in the country. 
This agricultural practice generates 820 Gg or 20 percent of national 
carbon monoxide 
emissions. However, since the proportion of savanna burned 
calculated for the country 
is believed to be underestimated, the emissions from this source 
could increase 
significantly once more reliable data is incorporated in the national 
inventory. If the 
default value of 50 percent burned on average per year is used to 
perform the estimate, 
as provided by the IPCC methodology for the Latin American region, 
carbon 
monoxide emissions from this source would be four times higher 
than the result 
obtained in this preliminary inventory. This issue will need further 
discussions in 
order to provide a more reliable estimate of greenhouse gases from 
savanna burning. 
<p><strong><em>Land-Use Change</strong></em><br>
Forest burning that occurs in conjunction with land clearing is 
responsible for more 
than a third of the national carbon monoxide emissions, as 1,380 Gg 
of the gas were 
emitted from this source in 1990. Contrary to savanna burning, 
emissions from this 
source may be overestimated as a result of the rather high value 
obtained for 
deforestation rate in the country. Although the average cleared area 
used for the 
inventory still does not cover the entire country, discussions with 
several experts have 
pointed out the fact that some methodological limitation of the 
deforestation rate study 
may be responsible for inconsistencies in the results. An initiative is 
already underway 
to clarify this issue in the near future.
<h3>Nitrogen Oxides</h3> 
Nitrogen oxides have been the target of environmental policies for 
their role in 
forming ozone, as well as for their direct acidification effects. 
NO<sub>x</sub> are 
also produced by incomplete combustion. In Venezuela, 
NO<sub>x</sub> emissions 
in 1990 were estimated to be 360 Gg, generated mainly by 
combustion of fossil fuels, 
with 90 percent of national emissions of this gas. The remainder 8 
percent 
corresponded to biomass burning in the nonenergy sector <a 
href="gifs/VenFig6.gif">(Figure 
6)</a>.
<p><strong><em>Energy Sector</strong></em><br>
Similarly to carbon monoxide and NMVOCs, nitrogen oxides are a 
technology-dependent gas. 
Their emissions depend in part on the nitrogen contained in the fuel. 
Electricity generation and industrial fuel combustion activities also 
provide 
combustion conditions conducive to NO<sub>x</sub> formation. Excess 
air and high 
temperatures contributes to high NO<sub>x</sub> emissions. They are 
also produced 
from incomplete combustion.
<p>As mentioned above, the most important NO<sub>x</sub> source is 
the 
combustion of fossil fuels, with 126 Gg from stationary sources and 
199 Gg from 
mobiles. Electricity generation contributed with 55 percent of the 
emissions from the 
stationaries. In mobile sources, 98 percent was produced by road 
transportation where 
the principal source is gasoline heavy-duty vehicles. 
<p><strong><em>Other Sources</strong></em><br>
As in the case of nitrous oxide, biomass burning associated to land-
use change and 
agricultural practices constitutes another source of nitrogen oxides 
emissions. Forest 
burning that occurs in conjunction with land clearing, savanna 
burning, and 
agricultural waste burning account for 25 Gg of nitrogen oxides, 
which represents 
about 8 percent of this gas national emissions. 
<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>CONCLUSIONS</H2>
This preliminary national inventory provides a comprehensive 
picture of Venezuelan 
greenhouse gas emissions and constitutes a powerful tool to evaluate 
and plan the best 
mitigation strategies that the country could develop to reduce and 
control its emission 
levels. Nevertheless, some weaknesses and limitations still represent 
an important 
problem to be addressed in order to improve the reliability of the 
information used as 
well as the methodologies applied in some cases.

<p>Most source categories are likely to present qualitative and 
quantitative 
limitations reflected in the calculation of greenhouse gas emissions. 
However, the 
uncertainties associated with the emission estimates were not 
quantified due to the 
limited available information and the difficulty of identifying the 
level of reliability 
for most of the data used in the inventory. Besides limitations 
associated with the 
methodology, the poor quality of some of the data is probably highly 
responsible for 
the uncertainties of the results. Special efforts should be made in the 
near future to 
solve this crucial issue and produce more accurate national estimates. 
<p>In the case of the energy sector, indepth studies have already 
been initiated for 
the main carbon dioxide emission sources, with the objective of 
validating the data 
and generating more appropriate emission factors. Similarly, as land-
use change 
represents a significant source of carbon dioxide, an effort to 
determine more reliable 
data on deforestation rates is being coordinated by the Ministry of 
Environment and 
Renewable Natural Resources. Methane emission estimates could also 
be improved 
through the implementation of specific projects to generate 
additional and more 
reliable data for the oil and gas industry&#139 the main source of 
methane. A project 
will be formulated shortly to address this issue in conjunction with 
the Venezuelan Oil 
Industry.

<p>SUMMARY: This paper reports the results of the crop vulnerability 
and adaptation element of Zimbabwe's country study. Global Climate 
Models (GCMs) and dynamic crop growth models were used to assess 
the potential effects of climate change on agriculture in Zimbabwe. 
These effects were estimated for maize, since maize is the most 
widely grown crop in Zimbabwe. Its growth is increasingly coming 
under stress due to high temperature and low rainfall conditions. 
Projected climate change causes simulated maize yields to 
decrease dramatically under 
dryland conditions in some regions (in some cases up to 30 percent), 
even under full 
irrigation conditions. The 
reduction in modeled maize yields are primarily attributed to 
temperature increases that 
shorten the crop growth 
period, particularly the grain-filling period. Broadly speaking, the 
duration of crop 
growth becomes shorter, 
thereby causing dramatic negative effects on yields. The simulated 
yield decreases in some 
regions are partially 
offset by the effect of increased CO<sub>2</sub> on plant physiology. 
There are several 
potential adaptation strategies that may 
be used to offset the negative impacts of climate change on maize 
yields. These include 
switching to drought-
tolerant small grains and maize varieties, and appropriate 
management practices. Some 
farmers might suffer 
because of relatively severe local climatic changes, while farmers in 
other areas might 
benefit through improved 
yields and/or higher prices as a result of favorable local climatic 
conditions. Rapid 
geographical shifts in the 
agricultural land base could disrupt rural communities and their 
associated 
infrastructure. More research is called 
for to generate technologies that equip farmers to adapt to the 
effects of climate change.
<P>
<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>INTRODUCTION</H2>
<p>Despite the uncertainties of potential climate change, a scientific 
consensus is 
emerging that increasing 
concentrations of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> could alter global 
temperatures and 
precipitation patterns. Most agricultural impacts 
studies (Rosenzweig et al., 1993; Muchena, 1991; Magadza, 1992) are 
based on the results 
of Global Circulation Models 
(GCMs). These climate models indicate that levels of greenhouse 
gases are likely, among 
other things, to increase global 
average surface temperatures by 1.5 to 4.5 &#176 C over the next 
100 years. Downing (1992) 
used 
a simple index of the 
atmospheric water balance to assess how agricultural land use may 
be affected due to 
changes in water resources. He 
found out the following :
<ul><li> With temperature increase of 2 &#176 C the wet zones of 
Zimbabwe (with a water 
surplus) decrease by a third from 
9 percent to about 2.5 percent.
<li> The drier zones will double in area.
<li> A further increase in temperature to +4 &#176 C reduces the 
summer water-surplus 
zones to 
less than 2 percent of 
Zimbabwe, approximately corresponding to the 1991-92 drought.
<li> In addition to a shrinkage of the agricultural area, crop yields in 
marginal zones 
would become more variable.</ul>
Simulations done by Muchena (1991) indicate that with 
+2 &#176 C of warming, yields currently expected 70 percent of the 
time would be exceeded 
only 
in 40 percent of the years. 
Such studies indicate that smallholder farmers in the marginal 
semiarid regions of 
Zimbabwe are the most vulnerable to 
climate change.

<h3>Objectives of the Study</h3>
The major objective of the study is to assess, using crop simulation 
models, the effect of 
climate change on 
agriculture and adaptation strategies with special reference to maize 
production in 
Zimbabwe. 
<ul>The following specific objectives have been derived :
<li>To provide results of crop simulation models using observed 
baseline data, climate 
change scenarios with or without 
simulations of direct effects of CO<SUB>2</SUB> on crop growth, 
irrigated production, and 
adaptation responses, such as planting 
dates and appropriate maize varieties.
<li>To show the effects of climate change by quantifying crop yield, 
season length, 
growing season precipitation, and 
evapotranspiration.
<li>To identify and evaluate possible measures in agricultural 
practices that would lessen 
any adverse effects of climate 
change.
<li>To project the economic consequences and implications of climate 
change.</ul><br>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>METHODOLOGY</H2>

<h3>Selection of Study Areas</h3>
Four stations, each representing a natural region, were chosen. These 
were Karoi, Gweru, 
Masvingo, and Beitbridge, 
representing Natural Regions II, III, IV, and V respectively.

<h3>Baseline Climate data</h3>
Daily observed climate data (precipitation, solar radiation, maximum 
and minimum air 
temperature) on each of the 
stations were collated by the Department of Meteorology for the 
period 1951 to 1991. The 
data were manipulated 
accordingly and formatted for entry into the crop simulation model.

<h3>Climate Change Scenarios</h3>
Using the GCMs, the observed climate data were modified to create 
climate change scenarios 
for each site. The GCMs 
used were developed by the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory 
(GFDL) and the Canadian 
Climate Centre Model 
(CCCM). The GCMs compute climate variables for different longitude 
and latitude gridboxes 
and according to the 
literature reviewed by the authors, they do not seem to give a 
comprehensive account for 
the variations within the 
gridbox. Daily changes in climate variables from doubled 
CO<SUB>2</SUB> simulations of the 
two GCMs were applied to the 
observed daily climate records to create climate change scenarios for 
each site. Climate 
change scenarios were created 
from GCMs because they produce climate variables that are 
internally consistent and 
because they allow for comparisons 
between or among regions. Because the water supply in Zimbabwe 
depends entirely upon 
climate conditions, any 
decrease in precipitation could be most significant for the irrigation 
water available to 
the crops. Considering the large 
temperature increases anticipated due to climate change and their 
potential effect on 
evapotranspiration, the GCM 
scenarios would imply water shortages, particularly in the sites that 
are currently in low 
rainfall areas.

<h3>Crop Model Inputs and Simulations</h3>
The maize simulation model used was the CERES-Maize model. The 
model simulates crop 
responses to changes in 
climate, management variables, soils, and different levels of 
CO<sub>2</sub> in the 
atmosphere. The software used to run the 
programs was developed by the Decision Support System for Agro-
technology Transfer (DSSAT) 
and includes database 
management, crop models, and application programs (Tsuji et al. 
1990). Potential changes 
in maize physiological 
responses (yields, season length, evapotranspiration, irrigation 
demand in a daily time 
step) were estimated using the 
CERES-Maize model under different climate scenarios. The model 
simulates physiological 
crop responses (water 
balance, phenology, and growth throughout the season) on a daily 
basis to the major 
factors of climate (daily solar 
radiation, maximum and minimum temperature, and precipitation), 
soils and management 
(cultivar, planting date, plant 
population, row spacing, and sowing depth).
<p>Some assumptions were made in applying the crop model and 
they tended to overestimate 
the simulated yields. These are as follows:
<ul><li>Nutrients are nonlimiting
<li>Pests are controlled
<li>There are no problematic soil conditions
<li>here are no catastrophic weather events
<li>Technology and the climate tolerance of cultivars do not change 
under conditions of 
climate change</ul>


<p><strong><em>Cultivar and Management 
Variables</strong></em><br>
A short season maize variety, R201, commonly grown under dryland 
conditions, was selected 
for the study in the four 
sites. R201 is a variety that would perform in both high and low 
rainfall areas. The 
"genetic coefficients" of R201 were 
obtained from the Agricultural Research Trust in Harare.
<p>Maize in Zimbabwe is grown under supplementary irrigation, 
particularly in large-scale 
commercial areas. This 
management activity cannot be simulated with the CERES-Maize 
model. Maize in this study 
was simulated under 
dryland and irrigated conditions to provide a range of possible 
scenarios and analyze the 
production changes. Since it is 
not possible to determine the amounts of irrigation water for each 
region, irrigation was 
simulated under the automatic 
option in order to provide the crop with a hypothetical nonlimiting 
situation. The amount 
of irrigation water used is 
obviously overestimated and consequently, so will be the yields 
obtained. Nevertheless, 
this approach allows comparison 
between relative changes in each site. If arbitrary irrigation amounts 
were applied, the 
uncertainty of the results would be 
larger and there would be inherent errors when comparing results 
from different sites.
<p>For the irrigation simulation, the water demand was calculated 
assuming the following:
<ul><li>100 percent efficiency of the automatic irrigation system
<li>30cm irrigation management depth
<li>Automatic irrigation when the available soil moisture is 50 
percent or less of 
capacity
<li>Soil moisture for each layer is reinitialized to 100 percent capacity 
at the start of 
each growing season
<li>The plant population was kept the same in both dryland and 
irrigated conditions at 4.4 
plants m<sup>-2</sup></ul>

<p><strong><em>Soils</strong></em><br>
Soils in Zimbabwe are predominantly derived from granite and are 
often sandy and light-
textured, with low agricultural 
potential due to low nutrient content, particularly nitrogen and 
phosphorus. Nevertheless, 
there is a significant portion of 
soils in all regions with a heavier clay content that is more suitable 
for crop growth. 
The representative soils are medium 
sandy loams in Karoi and Gweru, and sandy clay loams in Masvingo 
and Beitbridge (as 
described in Nyamapfene 1991).

<p><strong><em>Effects of CO<SUB>2</SUB> on Plant 
Physiology</strong></em><br>
The climate change scenarios have higher levels of CO<SUB>2</SUB> 
than the current 
climate. The CERES-Maize model includes an 
option to simulate the physiological effects of CO<SUB>2</SUB> on 
photosynthesis and 
water-use efficiency that gives higher crop 
yields (Acock and Allen 1985). For all climate scenarios included in 
this study, maize was 
simulated under the normal 
climate conditions and then under conditions of climate change. 
These simulations also 
included the simulated 
physiological effects of CO<SUB>2</SUB> on crop growth and yield.

<p><strong><em>Validation of the Crop Model</strong></em><br>
The CERES-Maize model was validated using local experimental crop 
data. The experimental 
data included aspects like 
cultivar, planting date, growth analysis, fertilizer application, 
harvesting date, and 
final yield components. Experimental 
crop data and climate were used for the 1988-89 season at Harare 
Research Station, and for 
the 1986-87 season at 
Gweru. At Harare Research Station, the observed yield was 9.5 
percent lower than the 
simulated yield, and the observed 
season length was 2.3 percent shorter than the simulated season 
length. In Gweru, the mean 
observed yield was 3 percent 
lower than the simulated yield and the observed season length was 
1.6 percent longer than 
the simulated season length. 
These results do indicate that CERES-Maize model is an adequate tool 
to simulate maize 
growth, particularly to evaluate 
relative changes in crop yield in relation to planting date.
<p>Under the GFDL Model the effect of climate change gives an 
average increase of 8 
percent in precipitation at 
Beitbridge for all planting dates. There is reduction by 10 percent, 
11 percent and 17 percent in available precipitation at Masvingo, 
Gweru and Karoi 
respectively.
<p>It should be further noted that at all sites, the reduction in 
precipitation is highest 
for maize planted early (15 
November) and gets progressively lower towards late planting date 
(15 December). This 
implies that early planted maize 
may not get adequate precipitation under climate change conditions.

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>RESULTS</H2>
<p>The simulation results are presented in <a 
href="gifs/ZimbabweTab1.gif">Tables 1</a> and <a 
href="gifs/ZimbabweTab2.gif">2</a> 
and reveal a number of insights 
as follows:
<ul><li>Maize production at all stations is more consistent under 
normal climate than 
under climate change conditions. 
Climate change introduces greater variability in maize yields, thus 
making maize 
production a more risky agricultural 
activity.
<li>At Masvingo, which represents Natural Region IV, there is a 
strong likelihood that 
climate change will make the 
Region a nonmaize-producing area. If this becomes real, the whole of 
Natural Region IV, 
which represents 
42 percent of communal areas, will not adequately supply its 
population with the staple 
food crop.
<li>Late planted maize at all sites will not give yields that make maize 
production a 
viable activity under climate change 
conditions.
<li>Climate change will give rise to significant yield increases in 
Natural Regions II and 
III, but this will depend on 
proper timing of planting dates to get the maximum benefit.
<li>Even though irrigation will boost maize production in all areas, the 
yields are lower 
under climate change conditions 
than under normal climate.
<li>The length of the crop growing season will be shortened under 
climate change 
conditions. This will limit maize 
production to short-season varieties. 
<li>Precipitation available per growing season will be reduced by 
more than 20 percent due 
to climate change at all sites. 
The greatest reduction in available precipitation is encountered when 
maize is planted 
early rather than late.
<li>The reduction in mean seasonal precipitation under climate 
change conditions implies 
that the water available for 
irrigation purposes would also be affected accordingly. This will 
reduce the effectiveness 
of irrigation as a strategy to 
combat the effects of climate change.
<li>The semiextensive farming zone (Natural Region IV) is the most 
sensitive and most 
severely affected by climate 
change. This has been revealed in the simulated maize yields 
obtained under climate change 
scenarios. The farmers in 
this zone constitute the majority of farmers in communal areas and 
they will be further 
marginalized due to climate 
change.
<li>Increased variations in rainfall, temperature, season length and 
yield would alter the 
mix of appropriate response 
strategies. Even Natural Regions II and III, which do not seem to be 
severely affected by 
climate change, have to take 
advantage of the good seasons by making full use of weather 
information and adopting 
appropriate management 
practices.
<li>More importantly, broad-scale shifts in agricultural capability due 
to climate change 
would affect rural livelihood 
and the national economy. This implies that all vulnerable groups are 
threatened by 
climate change through the ripple 
effects that diminish the resource base and increase the possibility of 
resource conflicts 
and tensions between the 
agricultural and industrial sectors.</ul>
On the whole, the simulated changes in crop yields are driven by two 
factors, i.e., 
changes in climate and CO<SUB>2</SUB> 
enrichment. The interactions of these factors on the baseline crop 
growth are often 
complex. However, yield decreases 
are caused primarily by the increase in temperature, which shortens 
the duration of the 
crop growth stages particularly 
the grain fill period. The season length is greatly reduced under 
these scenarios.
<p>The simulated evapotranspiration decreases in most areas despite 
the large increases in 
temperature and potential 
evaporation. This is due to the shorter growing season, which reduces 
the total amount of 
evapotranspiration, and the 
decreased demand of moisture by the crop, since it is not growing at 
capacity. The amount 
of irrigation water used will 
generally decrease for the same reasons. Another problem is that the 
initial soil water 
conditions are reset each year to 
"full" which is not always very realistic.
<p><em>Results shown in tables {<a href="gifs/VenTab1.gif">1</a> , <a 
href="gifs/VenTab2.gif">2</a>} reveal some significant variations 
in maize yields and length of growing season at different sites due to 
Climate change.</em><br>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>ADAPTATION</H2>
Zimbabwe's agricultural sector currently represents the largest force 
driving the country's economy. Agricultural production processes, 
particularly plant growth, are dependent on climatic conditions. 
This makes agricultural activities extremely vulnerable to climatic 
changes.  Thus, it is essential to study the potential effects of climate 
change on the agricultural sector and to examine ways in which the 
sector can adapt in order to minimize the negative socioeconomic 
impacts of these changes.

<p>There is still considerable uncertainty in our understanding of 
climate change and its effects (Smit 1993). At finer spatial scales, 
such as at the state/national level, uncertainty about climate change 
increases (Smith and Mueller-Vollmer 1993). Given such 
uncertainties, it would seem sensible to take a reactive approach to 
adaptation, that is, the adaptive easures are taken after or as a 
response to climate. The reactive approach may not, however, 
produce satisfactory results and may prove to be too costly. Thus, 
there is a need to examine anticipatory approaches to adaptation. 
The goal of anticipatory measures is to minimize the impact of 
climate change by reducing vulnerability (e.g., sensitivity) to its 
effects or by enabling reactive adaptation to happen more efficiently, 
that is, faster and at lower cost (Smith and Mueller-Vollmer 1993).
<p><dl>For the agricultural sector, adaptations to climate change can 
occur at two levels:
<dt>1.	The farm level
<dt>2.	The national level as reflected in government policy</dl>
Although agriculture is very sensitive to climate, it may be among 
the most flexible of the societal systems sensitive to climate change. 
As a unit exposed to impact, agriculture is thus a moving target, 
continually adjusting itself both to perceived climatic and nonclimatic 
conditions (Parry and Duinker 1990). This paper, thus, looks at the 
measures that may be undertaken both at the farm and national 
levels in order to adapt the Zimbabwean agricultural sector to 
climate change.

<h3>Farm Level Adaptations</h3>
At the farm level, the potential for agricultural adaptation is very 
high. Farm level 
adaptations arise from the farmers' 
perception of changed or changing conditions. Already the farmers 
are operating in an 
environment where climatic 
conditions vary from place to place and from season to season. In the 
past fifteen years 
Zimbabwe has experienced three 
droughts (1982-83, 1987-88, and 1991-92 seasons) of varying 
severity. This has alerted the 
farmers to the need to 
reexamine land use and management practices and farm 
infrastructure.

<h3>Changes in Land Use</h3>

Parry and Duinker (1990) have identified the Southern African 
region as one of the 
regions that appear most 
vulnerable to climate change. In Zimbabwe, climate change is 
therefore likely to increase 
the climatic constraints on 
agricultural production. Marginally productive areas are likely to be 
lost to non-
agricultural use, thus reducing the area 
under agricultural production. For areas where cropping becomes 
nonviable, livestock and 
dairy production can take over 
as the major agricultural activity. Farmers may also switch to 
different crop types or 
change to more drought- and 
disease-tolerant crops. Farmers may introduce irrigation systems in 
areas where high 
temperatures and rates of 
evapotranspiration lead to reduced levels of available moisture. 
Switching from 
monocultures to more diversified 
agricultural production systems will help farmers to cope with 
changing climatic 
conditions. Monocultures are more 
vulnerable to climate change, pests, and diseases. The use of 
livestock breeds adaptable 
to drought and the use of 
supplementary feeds (including tree crop fodder) will give farmers 
greater flexibility in 
adapting to climate change.
<h3>Changes in Management and Infrastructure</h3>
Changes in management practices can offset many of the potentially 
negative impacts of 
climate change (Smith and 
Mueller-Vollmer 1993). The timing of various farming operations 
(e.g., planting dates, 
application of fertilizers, 
pesticides, and weedicides) will become more critical if farmers are 
to reduce their 
vulnerability to the impacts of climate 
change. Besides the timing of the various operations, planting 
densities and application 
rates of agro-chemicals and 
fertilizers will also be of major importance. The use of conservation 
tillage, 
intercropping and crop rotation practices will 
enhance the long-term sustainability of soils and improve the 
resilience of crops to 
changes due to climate change (EPA 
1992). Farmers may also consider the use of greenhouses for the 
production of some of 
their products. 
<p>
Changes in the types of agricultural production and irrigation 
systems will require 
significant changes in farm layout 
and the types of capital equipment employed. In areas where there 
is a need to use 
irrigation systems, there may be need 
for additional water reservoirs or boreholes. Parry and Duinker 
(1990) have noted that 
because of the large costs 
involved in infrastructural changes, only small incremental 
adjustments may occur without 
changes in government 
policy.

<h3>National Level Adaptations</h3>
Agriculture is affected in many ways by a wide range of government 
policies that influence 
input costs, product pricing 
and marketing arrangements. Parry and Duinker (1990) have noted 
that relatively minor 
alterations to these policies can 
have a marked and quite rapid effect on agriculture. Thus, changes in 
government policy as 
a result of climate change or 
anticipated change would have a very significant influence on how 
agriculture ultimately 
responds. Government policies 
pertaining to land and water resources, which represent the basic 
foundation for 
agricultural production, should be more 
explicit in having the implementing agencies give due consideration 
to the possible 
impacts of climate change. Given the 
uncertainties about the magnitude and rate of change (especially at 
finer scales), the 
prospects of government acting 
directly to promote adaptation to anticipated change are rather 
limited. It is, thus, 
imperative that any anticipatory 
measures considered allow the greatest flexibility in order to allow 
these measures to be 
revised as new information 
about the magnitude and direction of climate change becomes 
available. Through its 
policies on infrastructural 
developments, research and development, education and water 
resources management, and 
product pricing, government 
can put both reactive and anticipatory adaptive measures into place. 
Ideally, a policy-
relevant research program could 
help identify appropriate actions as the current state of knowledge 
evolves (OTA 1993). 

<h3>Infrastructural Developments</h3>
The government is currently constructing a number of medium- to 
large-sized dams 
throughout the country. Even though 
this may be a reaction to droughts of the recent past, this can still be 
considered to be 
anticipatory. Increasing the 
capacity and number of such dams at this stage would be less costly 
than at a later stage. 
With the construction of these 
dams, irrigation schemes can also be established. Some irrigation 
schemes are already 
operational in some areas. Rukuni 
(1993), cited in Rukuni (1994), notes that there is growing evidence 
of high rates of 
return to investments in smallholder 
irrigation schemes, and that large areas of shallow ground water 
could be put to intensive 
cultivation if research focused 
on some aspects of environmental protection as well as on 
developing low volume water 
pumps. There is a need for 
government to undertake a major review of land-use planning with 
due consideration given 
to an integrated resources 
management approach. Thus, the current exercise to assess Land 
Tenure Systems suitable for 
Zimbabwe should seriously 
consider the conferring of ownership to land owners together with 
the formal obligations 
on the part of the owner to use 
the land in a sustainable and productive way. Government agencies 
in charge of executing 
the resettlement program can 
also take into consideration the anticipated impacts of climate 
change. Though the 
resettlement programs have been 
primarily targeted at relieving population pressure from the 
communal areas, it is 
important to note that most of these 
areas are marginal and will become more vulnerable with climate 
change. Thus, if the 
resettlement programs are 
executed with due regard to climate change, they can be made more 
efficient and enhance 
the sustainability of 
agricultural production in these marginal areas. As more areas 
become marginal, there will 
be a shift to more intensive 
agricultural production in the more favorable areas. Hence, if such 
areas can be 
identified, supporting infrastructure (e.g., 
transportation and communication networks, and markets) can be 
improved in these areas. 
The setup of such 
infrastructure may not be critical at this stage; however, it can still 
be fully utilized 
and significantly improve agricultural 
production efficiency in these areas. Its most critical significance, 
however, will become 
more apparent as adaptive 
measures become more efficiently implemented and the impacts of 
climate change are 
minimized.

<h3>Research and Development</h3>
Government support for research and development can have 
significant impacts on the 
agricultural sector. Its policy and 
support for research and development in the private sector will also 
be of major 
significance. The availability of 
facilities, level of funding and outlook on private sector initiative will 
greatly 
influence the rate at which crop varieties, 
livestock breeds, agricultural technologies, and management systems 
adaptable to climate 
change can be implemented. 
There is a need for research on crops and livestock that are more 
tolerant to disease and 
drought conditions. Research on 
short-season high-yielding crop varieties and livestock breeds will 
be of paramount 
importance to adaptation. 
Government expectations to increase wheat production from 300,000 
tons in 1990 to about 
487,000 tons in 1995, and to 
a level of national self-sufficiency thereafter (GOZ 1991) are very 
noble. These 
expectations should, however, be 
considered in the context of future climate changes. Thus, in order to 
realize and sustain 
these expectations in an 
environment of changed climate, the government needs to commit 
itself to supporting an 
intensified program of research 
into higher-yielding, drought-hardy, and disease- and pest-tolerant 
wheat varieties. 

<p>Government's aim of promoting increased goat production in 
Natural Regions III, IV and 
V (GOZ 1991) should 
seriously take into consideration the marginality of these regions. 
Goats, by nature, are 
very destructive to the 
environment if not managed properly. With climate change, the 
vulnerability of these 
marginal regions will be increased. 
Thus, government should support research efforts aimed at 
ascertaining how to effectively 
increase and sustain goat 
production in these regions without detrimental effects on the 
environment.
<p>
Other research areas requiring increased government support are 
agro-chemicals and 
fertilizer development, improved 
pastures and tree fodder crops, irrigation systems, low-input 
agriculture, and 
agroforestry systems. The government will 
also need to support research on diseases and pests, both those 
currently afflicting the 
agricultural sector and those that 
may come about due to climate change.
<p>
There will also be need for research in effective storage systems for 
agricultural 
products. The government recognizes 
the utility of improvements to storage, processing, and preservation 
techniques in 
overcoming production shortages 
(GOZ 1991). It, however, has not made a firm commitment to 
undertaking such improvements. 
The government has 
made a commitment for 500,000 to 600,000 tons of grain to be kept 
by the GMB as a 
strategic reserve for use by the 
urban population and in times of drought or similar disasters (GOZ 
1991). From events of 
the recent past, however, it has 
been evident that the rural majority are hardest hit in the event of a 
drought. Thus, the 
government should seriously 
consider supporting research in a more decentralized manner and 
maintaining these 
strategic reserves with increased 
local participation. An enabling environment and government 
support would encourage the 
private sector to invest more 
resources into these areas of research. Private sector participation 
will most certainly 
result in more rapid application of 
research output within the agricultural sector. The government 
should also establish seed 
banks for crop varieties 
adaptable to different climatic conditions.

<p>There is a need to bridge the institutional separation of research 
and extension 
services, as this has tended to 
minimize the responsibility for developing technology that is farmer-
based and problem-
oriented. It is also important that 
government fully utilize information from research and development 
bodies in its 
formulation and/or reformulation of 
policies impacting on the agricultural sector. The government should 
carefully examine the 
inadvertent damage to the 
capacities of research and development institutions as a result of 
budgetary and staff 
cuts under the Economic and 
Structural Adjustment Programme. There is also a need for improved 
incentives to attract 
and retain outstanding 
scientists in these research and development institutions.

<h3>Education and Water Resources Management</h3>
In Zimbabwe, a fairly significant amount of agricultural produce 
comes from the small 
scale and subsistence farmers. 
The greatest challenge to government lies in the sensitization of 
subsistence farmers to 
the impacts of climate change. 
These farmers already operate in the most marginal areas and are 
certainly the most 
vulnerable group. There is need for a 
more intensified approach to making these farmers conscientious 
with regard to the need 
for crop diversification, crop 
switching, conservation tillage, and water conservation. In most 
areas, livestock owned by 
subsistence farmers already 
far exceeds the carrying capacities of the marginal land they occupy. 
This is another area 
that will require a more 
intensive government awareness program. Government can also 
actively encourage crop 
switching and diversification, 
and the use of appropriate fertilizers whenever they assist small-
scale and subsistence 
farmers through the drought 
recovery program. Government should also consider the possibility of 
setting up a high-
level interagency task force to 
develop a coherent national drought policy. Such a task force would 
examine the viability 
of establishing a national 
drought insurance scheme and would spearhead an awareness 
campaign on matters related to 
drought and other impacts 
of climate change.

<p>Eicher (1993) singles out political leadership as one of the most 
underrated 
ingredients of agricultural 
development (cited in Rukuni 1994). There is, thus, a need to 
empower adequately the 
small-scale and subsistence 
farmers so that they have their own political voice and clout. This 
would enable them to 
organize themselves into unions, 
commodity groups, and cooperatives in order for government to get a 
balanced view of the 
rural majority. Hence, with 
an enhanced awareness of their rights and an enabling environment, 
consistent with human 
rights and democratic 
governance, it would be legally and institutionally easier for the 
farmers to form such 
groupings. Such groupings would 
enhance the flow of information to the farmers, thereby making it 
easier to communicate 
research results with respect to 
adaptations to climate change.

<p>There will be a need for government to review current policy on 
water rights. The new 
policy should reflect the 
need to conserve and utilize water resources more efficiently. It 
should reflect the 
increasing need to share equitably a 
diminishing resource. The government can support and offer 
incentives to farmers 
undertaking infrastructural 
developments that will lead to the conservation or increased 
availability of water 
resources. There will also be a need for 
government to explore the possibilities of interbasin water transfers 
in order to enhance 
the sustainability of areas that 
become intensively used for agricultural production or become 
marginal as a result of 
climate change.

<h3>Input Costs and Product Pricing</h3>
The implementation of the Economic Structural Adjustment 
Programme has resulted in major 
reform and 
commercialization, particularly with respect to market and trade 
liberalization. Market 
liberalization, however, should 
not result in the marginalization of the small-scale and subsistence 
farmers. There is, 
therefore, a need for government to 
establish and strengthen existing institutions that are geared toward 
extending credit to 
small-scale and subsistence 
farmers, and facilitate cost-effective marketing of their produce. 
There are many cases of 
successful national public 
agricultural research stories that show that smallholder farmers can 
seize market 
opportunities in a favorable 
macroeconomic environment (Rukuni 1994). However, input costs 
and product pricing can 
function as incentives or 
disincentives in determining which agricultural products to produce. 
Thus, pricing policy 
can be used to steer the 
agricultural sector in a direction more adaptable to climate change. 
Through pricing 
policy, government can actively 
influence crop switching, water conservation measures, and a host of 
other management 
activities, making the 
agricultural sector adaptable to climate change.

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>CONCLUSIONS</H2>

The estimated effects of climate change as evidenced in the 
simulated maize yields is 
indicative of the potential problems 
ahead of us. New and fluctuating weather patterns could have severe 
negative impacts on 
economic activities, 
particularly in the natural resources sector. Zimbabwe, which is 
highly dependent on the 
agricultural production sector, 
could see a rapid deterioration in the livelihood of her citizens as a 
result of climate 
change. Without the appropriate 
policies or adaptive strategies in place, the smallholder farmers will 
find it extremely 
difficult to operate sustainable 
agricultural production systems in an environment with changed 
climatic conditions. The 
potential solutions to 
agricultural sector problems resulting from climate change will 
require increased 
financial resources, a greater 
commitment to research efforts to develop and acquire new 
technologies, and the 
development and application of fairly 
high managerial skills.

<p>If Zimbabwe is to remain the breadbasket of the SADC Region and 
meet the growing 
demands for food locally 
and regionally, the sustainable growth of the agricultural production 
sector should be 
given the highest priority in all 
national development programs. Climate change compounds the need 
to increase the efforts 
to improve the knowledge 
and skills of farmers, remove constraints to farmer adaptability and 
innovation, and 
expand the options available to 
farmers. An expansion of the diversity of crops and farm 
technologies available will 
improve the chances of adapting 
successfully to a future in which existing farming systems are 
threatened by climate 
change. Thus, anticipatory measures 
will enhance the adaptability of farmers by speeding up the rate at 
which farming systems 
can be adapted to climate 
change, and will significantly lower the potentially high costs 
associated with 
adjustment.

<p>Constraints to adjusting to climate change are numerous. The 
considerable uncertainties 
about the magnitude and 
extent of the impacts of climate change make it relatively difficult to 
come up with 
appropriate responses (policy 
formulation and strategy development). Because of these 
uncertainties, any anticipatory 
measures undertaken should be 
of maximum flexibility in order for them to be beneficial to the 
agricultural sector even 
without climate change, and they 
should allow for readjustment as more knowledge about climate 
change is gained. The 
decline in the provision of 
resources to support agricultural research and extension is also 
another problem. More 
research and extension programs 
will enhance our capacities to adapt to climate change.

<p>Climate change is slowly taking place. This change will result in 
impacts whose 
direction, magnitude, timing, and 
path are neither fully understood nor accurately predictable. There 
is, thus, a need for 
sustained scientific research to 
enable the prediction of the impacts of climate change with more 
confidence, especially at 
the regional and national 
levels. Hence, we can begin to develop and implement the most 
appropriate resource 
management strategies and 
technologies to combat the impacts of climate change on the 
agricultural sector.

<strong>BY-LAWS OF THE COMMITTEE ON ENVIRONMENT AND 
NATURAL RESOURCES RESEARCH NATIONAL SCIENCE AND 
TECHNOLOGY COUNCIL</strong><p>

The Committee on Environment and Natural Resources (CENR) has 
been established by action of the National Science and Technology 
Council (NSTC).<p>

The Committee serves as part of the internal deliberative process of 
the NSTC, which provides overall guidance and direction.  The NSTC 
shall serve as a forum for developing consensus and issues raised in 
the committee process.<p>

<h3>Structure</h3>
The Committee  Co-Chairs, and Vice Chairs and the White House Co-
Chair are appointed by the Assistant to the President for Science and 
Technology.  The  Executive Secretary is designated by a Committee 
Co-Chair.  Additional staff and funding assistance, consistent with the 
terms of this charter, are the responsibility of the Committee Co-
Chairs.<p>

The Committee Co-Chairs will convene no fewer than two meetings of 
the Committee a year and will approve agendas in consultation with 
the White House Co-Chair.  Minutes of meetings will be prepared by 
the CENR Executive Secretary and distributed to all CENR members 
and to the Executive Secretary of the NSTC.<p>

The Committee may establish such Subcommittees and Working 
Groups as are necessary to carry out its functions.  The Committee 
Co-chairs and White House Co-Chair will appoint the subcommittee 
chairs and vice-chairs after consultation with the Committee.  Chairs 
of the CENR subcommittees and working groups will arrange 
assistance from their own agencies or from other agencies 
represented on the subcommittees or working groups.  Membership 
on the subcommittees and working groups is not restricted to 
committee membership, but all members must be Federal 
employees. <p>

<h3>Compensation</h3>
All CENR members are Federal employees who are allowed 
reimbursement for travel expenses by their agencies plus per diem 
or subsistence while serving away from their duty stations and in 
accordance with standard government travel regulations.<p>

<h3>Documentation</h3>
Agendas and records of actions of Committee meetings will be  
prepared and disseminated to Committee members and the NSTC 
Executive Secretary by the CENR Executive Secretary.  Records of 
actions will be submitted to CENR members for approval.  Complete 
records of all CENR activities, including those of subcommittees and 
working groups, will be maintained in the office of a Co-Chair.<p>

The CENR will prepare a report for the NSTC not later than 60 days 
after the end of each fiscal year.  The report will contain, as a 
minimum, the Committee's functions; a list of members; a list of 
subcommittees and working groups; a review of all subcommittees 
and working groups that have discharged their responsibilities and 
the identification of the CENR elements that will be brought to 
closure; brief highlights of the previous year; and projections of 
activities for the coming year.<p>

<p align=center><strong>before the</strong><p>

<p align=center>Committee on Science, Space and Technology<br>
U. S. House of Representatives<br><p>

<p align=center><strong>May 4, 1994</strong><p>

Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee:<p>

My name is Robert Watson and I am the Associate Director for 
Environment in the Office of Science and Technology Policy.   I would 
like to introduce my colleague, Dr. James Baker, Under-Secretary for 
Commerce and NOAA Administrator.  We appreciate the opportunity 
to meet with you this morning to discuss  the Administration's views 
on federal environment and natural resources R&D.  We welcome the 
interest of Congress in this very important issue and acknowledge 
the long-standing leadership of the Chairman, Congressman Brown.  
We are here today, to tell you that the Administration is fully 
committed to working with Congress to improve federal environment 
and natural resources R&D programs.  During this testimony, Dr. 
Baker and I will discuss the questions outlined in your letter to us of 
April 19, 1994.<p> 

There has been a dramatic increase in world population and 
industrial activities during the last century, and human activities are 
affecting the environment at all geographical scales from local to 
regional to global.  The range of environmental issues is diverse and 
encompasses local, regional and global issues such as pesticides and 
toxic substances, hazardous and solid waste disposal, water quality 
and quantity, urban and rural air pollution, resource use and 
management, loss of wetlands, soil erosion, degradation of aquatic 
and terrestrial ecological systems, desertification,  deforestation, 
marine pollution, natural disasters, loss of biological diversity, 
stratospheric ozone depletion, and climate change.  These issues are 
interrelated and are no longer the sole concern of the scientific 
community and environmentalists.  Their importance is now well 
recognized by the private sector and  governments around the world.  
Sound national and international environmental policies must be 
based on a solid foundation of scientific, technical, and economic 
understanding of the relevant facts.  This understanding will allow us 
to meet a number of key Administration and Congressional 
priorities:<p>

<ul><li>a cleaner environment, by providing the scientific and 
technical information needed to continue to refine environmental 
and economic policies;</li>
<li>a healthier safer America, by improving our understanding of the 
human health implications of environmental changes and the societal 
vulnerabilities to natural hazards;</li>
<li> stronger economy, through the continued development of cost-
effective pollution prevention technologies, and a reduction of 
market and government inefficiencies that prevent the diffusion of 
technologies and efficient use of legal, economic and environmental 
resources;</li>
<li>national security, by providing the information needed to reduce 
destabilizing environmental degradation and resource depletion that 
leads to conflict, environmental refugees, and further ecological 
damage resulting from war; and
<li>an improved education and training of Americans  through 
environmental education curriculum development and strengthening 
environmental continuing education initiatives, utilizing such 
mechanisms as government-private sector partnerships.</li></ul><p>

Given the increasing complexity, scope and linking of local, regional 
and global environmental issues facing our nation and globe, 
significant changes are needed in the federal environment and 
natural resources R & D system. The classical single agency, single 
scientific discipline approach to problem solving needs to be 
transcended by a coordinated multi-agency interdisciplinary 
approach.  The problems will only be understood by bringing 
together natural and social scientists, economists, engineers and 
policymakers.<p> 

There has been significant criticism of the structure of the federal 
environmental Research and Development (R & D) system, and its 
relationship to environmental policy formulation.  This criticism has 
been articulated in a number of major reports, including:<p> 

<ul><li>the Carnegie Commission on Science, Technology, and 
Government, December 1992:  Environmental Research and 
Development: Strengthening the Federal Infrastructure;</li> 
<li>the National Commission on the Environment, 1993: Choosing a 
Sustainable Future;</li> 
<li>the National Research Council, 1993:  Research to Protect, Restore 
and Manage the Environment;</li>  
<li>the Committee for the National Institute for the Environment, 
1993: A Proposal for a National Institute for the Environment: Need, 
Rationale, and Structure;</li>
<li>the Office of Technology Assessment, October 1993:  Preparing for 
an Uncertain Climate;</li>
 <li>the Environmental Protection Agency, 1992. Safeguarding the 
Future: Credible Science, Credible Decisions; and</li>
<li>the National Research Council, 1993. A Biological Survey for the 
Nation.</li></ul><p>

While the reports identified a number of similar problems they 
proposed very different solutions, ranging from: (i) expanded scope 
of agency programs; (ii) improved coordination and significant 
cultural changes within the existing agency structure;  (iii) a 
reorganization of the current agency structure; and (iv) the creation 
of a new institute: "the  National Institute for the Environment".<p>

The major issues raised by these reports include:<p>

<ul><li>no clear leadership;</li>
<li>inadequate links between research and policy;</li>
<li>no comprehensive national environmental research plan;</li>
<li>no comprehensive think tank for assessing state of knowledge;</li>
<li>no approach to research issues beyond near-term regulatory or 
management needs;</li>
<li>an imbalance between intramural and extramural R&D;</li>
<li>a lack of funding for ecological and social sciences, and for finding 
engineering solutions to environmental problems;</li>
<li>insufficient attention to long-term monitoring, data collection and 
management, and interpretation.</li>
<li>the need for improved education and training of 
people.</li></ul><p>

In general, the Administration believes that these criticisms are 
based in fact and must be addressed.  Consequently, it has already 
enacted a number of major changes to rectify these apparent 
weaknesses in the environmental R & D structure and in the links 
between science and policy.   At present the Administration believes 
that there is no compelling reason for a fundamental restructuring of 
the research agencies or to create any new entities given the changes 
it has already initiated.  These changes need to be given an 
opportunity to work before taking further steps.<p>

The Administration has taken the following steps:<p>

<ul><li>creating the Office of Environmental Policy (OEP);</li>
<li>creating the National Biological Survey (NBS);</li>
<li>signing the Convention on Biological Diversity;</li>
<li>creating the Environment Division in Office of Science and 
Technology Policy (OSTP);</li>
<li>elevating the Federal Coordinating Committee on Science, 
Engineering and Technology (FCCSET),  to the National Science and 
Technology Council (NSTC);</li>
<li>creating the Committee on Environment and Natural Resources 
(CENR) within the NSTC, which builds upon the earlier efforts of the 
FCCSET Committee of Earth and Environmental Sciences;</li>
<li>creating the President's Committee of Advisors for Science and 
Technology (PCAST);</li>
<li>proposing the elevation of the Environmental Protection Agency  
(EPA) to Cabinet status;</li>
<li>strengthening the links between science and policy through the 
CENR;</li>
<li>strengthening the assessment capabilities through the CENR;</li>
<li>enhancing support for environmental R & D, despite limits on 
discretionary spending;</li>
<li>developing an environmental R & D strategy through the 
CENR;</li>
<li>expanding the scope of environmental R & D, through increased 
emphasis on the socio-economic dimensions, impacts assessment, 
adaptation and mitigation, and the development and utilization of 
science-policy tools in the FY 1995 budget.</li></ul><p>

The following section briefly describes Administration actions to 
specifically address the major issues raised by the reports.<p>

<h3>Creating federal leadership for environment and natural 
resources R&D</h3><p>

Through all the steps listed above, the Administration has 
demonstrated its leadership and commitment to a strong, integrated 
and comprehensive federal program of environmental R & D.<p>

In particular, the CENR is leading the effort to coordinate all federal 
environment and natural resource research and development 
activities, and improve the links between the scientific and policy 
components of the executive branch.   A unique aspect of the CENR is 
that subcommittees are organized by key environmental policy 
areas, global change, biodiversity and ecosystem dynamics, resource 
use and management, water resources and coastal and marine 
environments, air quality, toxic substances and solid and hazardous 
waste, and natural disasters.  This subcommittee structure was 
created recognizing that coordinated, interdisciplinary, multi-agency, 
R&D efforts are required to effectively respond to complicated 
environmental problems.<p>

The strength of the CENR, and its subcommittees, is that it has active 
participation from all relevant agencies and offices of the White 
House, including OSTP and OMB during all phases of the budget 
process (<a href=appI.html>Appendix I</a> lists the chairs, co-chairs 
and vice chairs of the 
CENR and its sub-committees).  The CENR is not a top-down decision-
making entity of the White House; if it were, it would fail. The CENR 
will work because there is buy-in at all levels of the agencies from 
program managers and from agency heads.  R&D priorities must, and 
will, explicitly take into account Administration priorities, 
environmental statutes, and international Conventions.  Agency 
agendas that are consistent with the priorities of the interagency 
process are likely to have highest priority in the budget process.  The 
challenge is to increase the total amount of resources available to 
environmental and natural resources R&D and to identify areas of 
lower priority or where unnecessary redundancies exist.  This 
identification is being done by agencies working with the CENR 
subcommittees.<p> 


The structure of the Committee on Environment and Natural 
Resources is shown in Figure 1.  The objectives of the committee 
include:<p>

<ul><li>maintaining, and improving, a strong science base for 
environmental and natural resource issues;</li>
<li>developing a balanced, comprehensive environmental and natural 
resources R&D program that provides the scientific and technical 
basis for national and international policymaking, including the 
global environmental conventions that have either been negotiated 
or are being negotiated (stratospheric ozone depletion, global climate 
change, loss of biological diversity, and desertification);</li>
<li>strengthening research on: (i) the socioeconomic aspects of 
environmental changes; (ii) the impacts  of environmental changes on 
human health, ecological and socio-economic systems; (iii) adaptation 
to environmental changes; and (iv) the mitigation of environmental 
changes;</li>
<li>creating an organization that improves the way that the federal 
government plans and coordinates environmental and natural 
resource R & D activities;</li>
<li>establishing a structure for developing environment and natural 
resources budget inventories;</li>
<li>developing a strategy to strengthen extramural academic R & D 
programs;</li>
<li>promoting the utilization of merit-review and peer evaluation and 
competitive selection in federal R&D projects;</li>
<li>developing the tools needed for policy formulation, e.g., integrated 
models and risk assessments;</li>
<li>creating a body to link science and policy.</li></ul><p>

<h3>Environmental issue subcommittees</h3><p>	

<ul><li>Global Change:  The scope should be comparable to the existing 
USGCRP, i.e., includes climate change (broad definition) and 
stratospheric ozone, but with increased emphasis on socioeconomic 
dimensions, impacts, adaptation, mitigation, and integrated 
assessments.</li><p>

<li>Biological Diversity and Ecosystem Dynamics:  Biodiversity 
(population/community; systematic biology/surveys; habitat 
analysis; and conservation biology); and ecological dynamics 
(physiology and biochemical ecology; genetic processes and 
responses; basic ecosystem processes; and population/community 
response to stress).</li><p>

<li>Resource Use and Depletion:  Management, conservation and 
extraction of renewable (terrestrial and marine ecosystems, including 
grasslands, wetlands, fisheries, and forests), and non-renewable 
resources (oil, gas, minerals, and coal).</li><p>

<li>Toxic Substances and Hazardous and Solid Waste:  Environmental 
toxicants (e.g., pesticides, hazardous waste, solid waste, and oil 
spills).</li><p>

<li>Air Quality:  Ambient air pollutants (oxidants and their  
precursors, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide and 
particulates); acid deposition and its precursors, and indoor 
air.</li><p>

<li>Water Resources and Coastal and Marine Environments:  Water 
quality and quantity, integrated watershed management, and coastal 
and marine systems</li><p>

<li>Natural Disasters:  The scope encompasses weather related 
hazards (storms, hurricanes, typhoons, tornadoes, floods, droughts), 
geological hazards (volcanoes, earthquakes), and 
wildfires.</li></ul><p><p>


<h3>Program content of each issue subcommittee</h3><p>
	
Each subcommittee has established its own working group structure, 
and has developed a balanced, comprehensive R & D program that 
covers the following aspects of the issue:<p>
	
<ul><li>Structure and function of the system.  Observe, understand 
and predict the physical, chemical, geological and biological state of 
the natural system and how human activities are affecting it.</li><p>

<li>Socioeconomic driving forces of environmental change.  Observe, 
understand and predict the social and economic forces that lead to 
anthropogenic changes in the environment.  These would include the 
organization and functioning of human society, population growth 
and migration, consumption patterns, and economic systems as 
forcing functions.</li><p>

<li>Impacts of environmental change.  Observe, understand and 
predict changes to human health, the structure and functioning of 
unmanaged ecological systems, and the productivity and structure of 
managed systems (agriculture, forestry, fisheries, energy systems, 
transportation, etc.) in response to single and multiple socioeconomic 
and environmental stresses.</li><p>

<li>Adaptation to environmental change.  Development of 
methodologies and strategies designed to adjust to the consequences 
of environmental change.</li><p>

<li>Mitigation of environmental change.  Technology development  to 
mitigate environmental change, and research to analyze the barriers 
and opportunities for the diffusion of these technologies into the 
market place, both nationally and internationally.</li><p>

<li>Assessment.  Assess the state of the knowledge by providing a 
mechanism: (i) to perform national assessments, and (ii) for the U.S. 
scientific and technical communities to be involved in the 
international assessments, e.g., ozone depletion, climate change, and 
biological diversity.</li></ul><p>

		
<h3>Strengthening links between research and policy</h3><p>

The Administration recognizes that for the past decade or more the 
link between the scientific and policy formulation agencies has been 
too weak.  Consequently, the Administration has taken some initial 
steps to significantly improve the integration of environmental 
research with policymaking and resource use management 
decisions:<p>

<ul><li>a senior-level interagency committee, co-chaired by members 
from the Office of Science and Technology Policy, the Council of 
Economic Advisors, and the Office of Environmental Policy, has been 
formed to provide an effective  science-technology-economics-policy 
link across all sub-committees of the CENR, through close interaction 
with both technical and policy offices within the White House and the 
agencies;</li>
<li>each subcommittee of the CENR has a senior level policy vice-
chair, ensuring that the policy agencies will play a vital role in 
setting environmental R & D priorities;</li>
<li>each environmental issue subcommittee, with membership from 
both the science and policy branches of agencies, will have an 
assessment function, to include all stakeholders in the evaluation of 
the current state of knowledge for addressing these environmental 
problems;</li>
<li>a data and information working group has been formed within the 
CENR, reporting directly to the executive committee, that will, with 
stakeholder participation (including, academia, industry, 
environmental organizations, Congress, State and local government), 
work to develop a distributed system that ensures rapid access by all 
users to scientific, technical, and economic environmental 
information.</li></ul><p>

The risk assessment subcommittee will examine a range of scientific 
and technical issues in the risk assessment and risk management 
area.  Its work will complement the broader policy- oriented efforts 
of the interagency working group on risk, which is examining issues 
related to the interface of risk analysis and cost-benefit analysis and 
the appropriate use of these tools in setting regulatory priorities.  
The subcommittee will examine such issues as comparability across 
agencies in undertaking risk assessments, ways to better integrate 
socioeconomic considerations into risk analyses, approaches to 
advancing the assessment of ecological and non cancer risks, and 
possible mechanisms to undertake comparative risk analyses.<p>


<h3>Developing a comprehensive national environmental research 
plan</h3><p>

The Administration is committed to formulating an environment and 
natural resources R &D strategy through the CENR. The charge to the 
CENR is to design a balanced environmental R & D program that 
is:<p>

<ul><li>scientifically excellent;</li>
<li>policy relevant, not policy driven;</li>
<li>well coordinated between federal agency programs and private 
sector programs;</li>
<li>meets the near- and long-term needs of the scientific and policy 
communities;</li>
<li>broad enough to catch, and respond, to surprises;</li>
<li>anticipatory, and not just focused on the policy and management 
issues of today.</li></ul><p>

The CENR has been structured with respect to both scope and 
membership so that it can develop and implement, in concert with 
non-federal partners, a comprehensive environment and natural  
resources  R & D strategy.  The CENR has already taken a number of 
steps toward developing this strategy.<p> 

<ul><li>The environmental issue and cross-cutting subcommittees of 
the CENR developed a set of draft strategy documents that presented 
initial views on: (i) an environmental vision; (ii) near-and long-term 
policy questions; (iii) the scientific information needed to answer the 
policy questions; (iv) the scientific goal of each CENR subcommittee; 
(v) the current state of scientific knowledge; (vi) the highest priority 
scientific needs; and (vii) a strategy to develop the required scientific 
knowledge.</li><p>  
<li>The draft strategies were presented to more than 200 non-federal 
scientists from academia, industry, environmental organizations, 
Congress, and State and local government, at a White House 
sponsored scientific forum that was hosted at the National Academy 
of Sciences from March 28-30.  The specific goal of the fora was to 
develop an initial set of priorities for a federal environment and 
natural resources R&D program based on the perspectives of a wide 
range of interests.  Senior members of the Administration, including 
Vice President Gore, Bruce Babbitt, John Gibbons, Carol Browner, Jim 
Baker, and Katie McGinty, addressed the forum participants.</li><p>
<li>The experts reviewed the material presented and identified 
important near-term priorities for funding.  The major conclusions of 
the forum, which are being used to guide the Agencies as they 
develop their FY 1996 budgets, are summarized below and in 
<a href=appII.html>Appendix II</a>.  The key conclusion was that there 
needs to be more 
attention paid to:<p>
<ul><li>scientific basis for integrated ecosystem management;</li>
<li>socio-economic dimensions of environmental change;</li>
<li>the development of science-policy tools, e.g., integrated 
assessments and risk analysis; (iv) -observations, and data and 
information systems; and</li>
<li>environmental technologies. </li></ul></li><p>
<li>The next step is to further refine these "environmental issue" 
strategy papers.  Additional sections will be included, such as a 
description of the roles of the different agencies, a plan for 
implementing the strategy, and a list of performance milestones to 
assess relevance, progress, and cost-effectiveness.  These issue 
strategies will then be integrated into an initial federal environment 
and natural resource R&D strategy by fall 1994.</ul></li><p>


<h3>New approach for assessing state of knowledge</h3>

The Administration is committed to strengthening the manner in 
which the federal government performs assessments, particularly 
integrated assessments, which provide a bridge for a two-way 
dialogue between policymakers and scientists.  The policymakers 
need to articulate the challenges they face in pursuing a particular 
environmental objective, while the scientists must convey to the 
policymaker a sense of the degree of understanding of the 
environmental problem; the physical, biological, and  socioeconomic 
issues that underlie it; and alternative approaches to responding, 
mitigating, or adapting to it.<p>

At present there are adequate mechanisms, under the auspices of the 
World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the United Nations 
Environment Program (UNEP), for performing credible international 
scientific and technical assessments of ozone depletion, climate 
change, and loss of biological diversity.  However, there is a lack of 
adequate flexible mechanism(s) to conduct credible national 
environmental assessments, involving all stakeholders.<p> 

The CENR is currently developing a set of principles that should be 
used, and mechanisms that could be used, to conduct credible 
scientific and technical assessments.  The principles that should be 
applied, independent of the mechanism employed, will likely include 
the involvement of all stakeholders, as appropriate and an 
independent peer-review process.  The mechanism chosen would 
depend upon a number of factors, including the scope and audience 
of the assessment, and the deadline for completion of the assessment.  
The CENR will develop a credible flexible approach for conducting 
environmental assessments.<p>

In addition to legislatively mandated environmental assessments 
conducted by individual agencies, assessments could, and should, be 
conducted by: (a) subcommittees of the CENR; (b) the White House 
science-policy assessment group, co-chaired by OSTP, CEA, and OEP; 
and (c) the National Academy of Sciences/National Academy of 
Engineering and Institute of Medicine, depending upon the scope of 
the assessment under consideration.  The Administration has begun 
work on (a) and (b), and has started a dialogue with the 
NAS/NAE/IOM with respect to option (c).<p>  
	
We believe the combination of these three new mechanisms for 
performing assessments across a wide variety of environmental 
issues will fully utilize the strengths of the academic community and 
the federal agencies, together with other key stakeholders, while 
being responsive to policymakers needs without requiring the 
creation of any new agencies or institutions.  We briefly elaborate on 
each of the three mechanisms below:<p>
	
<strong>(a)</strong>  Subcommittees of the CENR:  Each environmental 
subcommittee of the CENR will have an assessment capability that 
will, as appropriate:<p>
	
<ul><li>provide a mechanism to involve appropriate stakeholders 
(natural and social scientific, technical, economics and policy experts 
from universities, federal and state agencies, industry, and 
environmental organizations) in the preparation and review of 
national assessments, which could include analyses of: (i) whether 
human activities are causing the system to change; (ii) the impacts of 
environmental changes; and (iii) policy response strategies.</li> 
<li>ensure full U.S. participation in the preparation and review of 
international assessments related to some or all aspects  of Global 
Change, e.g., the WMO/UNEP ozone assessments conducted under the 
auspices of the Montreal Protocol, the WMO/UNEP Intergovernmental 
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessments, and the UNEP Global 
Biodiversity Assessment;</li>
<li>ensure the development of policy-relevant assessment tools such 
as integrated assessment models that can include the influence of 
both natural phenomena and human activities on the Earth's 
environment, i.e., (i) natural sciences, i.e., physical, chemical and 
biological forcing and response of the atmosphere, oceans, and land; 
(ii) socio-economic dimensions of environmental changes; (iii) impact 
on human health, ecological systems, and socio-economic sectors; and 
(iv) technical options for adaptation and mitigation; </li></ul><p>

<strong>(b)</strong>  White House Science-Policy-Assessment Group:  
To complement these issue oriented assessment working groups the 
Administration has created a senior-level interagency group, co-
chaired by members from the OSTP, CEA, and OEP.  This science-
policy entity will complement the capabilities of the agencies and 
CENR subcommittees by:<p>

<ul><li>providing a mechanism to communicate the needs of the policy 
community to the research agencies, and to communicate the latest 
scientific and technical understanding to the policy  agencies;</li>
<li>providing a mechanism to conduct assessments that are broader 
in scope than that of a single CENR subcommittee;</li>
<li>providing a mechanism to integrate the state-of-science issue 
specific assessments into a more holistic assessment of the state of 
environment and natural resources; and</li>
<li>developing an internal White House analytical assessment 
capability that transcends the more focused perspectives of 
individual agencies. </li></ul><p>

<strong>(c)</strong>  NAS/NAE/IOM Complex:  The CENR are 
working with the NAS/NAE/IOM to find new ways to enhance their 
traditional role in conducting assessments of the current state of 
knowledge.  In particular, we are exploring new partnerships that 
will enhance the capabilities of the Academy complex to be 
responsive to the needs of the federal government in performing 
environmental assessments.  The Academy process would be highly 
flexible and able to involve all stakeholders, as appropriate, 
(including the assets of the Academy complex, the academic 
community, industry, and environmental organizations) in the 
preparation and review of the assessments.  The Academy would be 
able to conduct short- or long-term assessments that are either 
narrow or broad in scope, and could include reviews of assessments 
performed by agencies or subcommittees of the CENR.<p> 

<h3>Research strategy that goes beyond near-term regulatory and 
management needs</h3><p>

The Administration only partly agrees with this criticism.  While 
many of the  environmental research programs may be too near-
term and policy driven, some of the largest federal R & D programs 
have a long-term perspective, and some have actually been criticized 
for being too long-term and not adequately near-term and policy 
relevant.<p>
	
One example of a federal research program that has combined 
excellence in scientific content, coordination with private sector 
research, and has balanced near-and long-term policy requirements 
is the federal stratospheric ozone program.  The federal research 
program, which was primarily housed in NASA, NOAA and NSF, 
provided most of the scientific information that formed the basis for 
both national and international policy formulation (Vienna 
Convention, and the Montreal Protocol and its amendments).  
However, even this program was not adequately balanced to meet 
the complete needs of the decision makers.  While NASA, NOAA and 
NSF developed a robust program to quantitatively understand the 
impact of human activities on the abundance and distribution of 
ozone, agencies responsible for impacts research did not aggressively 
pursue a program to understand the implications of ozone depletion 
on human health, ecological and economic systems.<p>

Recently, the U.S. Global Change Research Program has been 
increasingly criticized for being too long-term and not adequately 
policy relevant.  This program, which is inherently multi-decadal, 
was originally designed to provide decision makers with the 
scientific information needed to predict the timing, magnitude and 
regional patterns of human-induced climate change.  However, the 
Administration fully recognizes that the program must be 
strengthened in certain areas, i.e., research on: (i) the socioeconomic 
aspects of environmental changes; (ii) the impacts of, and adaptation 
to, environmental changes; (iii) the mitigation of environmental 
changes, and (iv) the development of policy-relevant tools such as 
end-end integrated models.  The President's FY 1995 budget 
submission to Congress reflects this increased scope of activities.<p>

<h3>Approach to redress the imbalance between intramural and 
extramural R&D by utilizing merit review, peer evaluation and 
competitive selection in federal R&D projects</h3><p>

The Administration plans increase the involvement of the academic 
community through merit review, peer-evaluation and the 
competitive selection of federal R&D projects.  In addition, we plan to 
improve the evaluation procedures and quality of federal R&D 
efforts.  The style of external peer-review may, in some instances, 
need to be tailored according to agency mission.<p> 

The Administration believes that the imbalance between extramural 
and intramural R&D programs is a significant weakness of our 
federal environmental R&D system.  "Intramural" refers to those R&D 
programs conducted within a department or agency and its 
laboratories.  Extramural programs are activities supported by the 
federal government through grants, contracts, cooperative  research 
and development agreements, or other mechanisms.  Some agencies 
have relatively large extramural programs.  NASA's Mission to Planet 
Earth program, for example, is all competitively peer-reviewed and 
has a large extramural component.  Other agency programs are 
almost entirely intramural.  EPA's extramural program includes 
university-based research (i.e., through grants and cooperative 
research agreements) and contract research, but the agency has 
limited funding for competitive grants.  This deprives the agency of a 
mechanism to reach many of the best academic scientists and 
engineers in the nation.  The Administration proposes that all federal 
agencies take a careful look at the balance between intramural and 
extramural environmental R&D activities within their agencies with 
the goal of increasing the involvement of the academic community 
by competitively awarding most R & D activities, in a manner similar 
to NSF and NASA.  In addition, there may be instances where the 
quality of the research endeavor may be strengthened by combining 
the intellectual talent residing in the universities with the 
institutional capabilities of the federal laboratories, thus improving 
the overall quality and cost-effectiveness of then Federal research 
program.<p> 

Following procedures put in place by the Committee on Earth and 
Environmental Sciences for the U.S. Global Change Research Program, 
we plan to develop performance standards and foster a process of 
measuring progress, identifying gaps, and assessing the effectiveness 
of agency activities.  In this management arrangement, meaningful 
performance measures for major elements of the CENR strategy will 
be developed and tracked, providing periodic evaluations of both 
individual projects and the strategy as a whole.<p>

<h3>Increased funding for ecological and social sciences, and for 
finding engineering solutions to environmental problems</h3><p>

The Administration recognizes that there has been insufficient 
attention to the ecological sciences, the socioeconomic dimensions of 
environmental problems, and for engineering solutions to 
environmental problems.<p> 

Biological sciences:  The ecological sciences are clearly underfunded 
in comparison to the physical sciences in the study of some 
environmental issues, e.g., climate change and ozone depletion.  In 
1993 the FCCSET Subcommittee for Environmental Biology performed 
an analysis of the federal environmental biology budget and 
reported an annual expenditure of over $900 million, a level 
comparable to that spent on the study of the physical and chemical 
aspects of global change. However, the NRC Corson report noted that 
50% of all ecological experiments are performed on plots of less than 
one meter squared, and only 7% last longer than seven years.  This 
suggests that more long-term, large scale ecological studies need to 
be performed.  Additionally, it is clear that there needs to be an  
increased emphasis on understanding the interactions among 
biodiversity, ecosystem dynamics and management, and 
environmental degradation.   The President's FY 1995 budget for the 
USGCRP, the DOI National Biological Survey, and EPA, through its 
integrated ecological research program, shows that steps are being 
taken to enhance comprehensive ecological research.<p>

Social sciences:  While it is well recognized that environmental 
change has both anthropogenic and natural components, our 
understanding of the human dimensions of environmental change 
will not improve until more resources are committed to studies of 
this kind.  The President's FY 1995 USGCRP budget, within the NSF, 
reflects an increased emphasis for this type of research.<p>

Engineering:  The Administration has already moved aggressively to 
increase the level of funding for research and development for 
environmental technologies in several agencies:  EPA, DOE, Commerce 
(NIST).  In addition, DoD has been charged with increasing its efforts 
on dual-use technologies.  The President's FY 1995 budget for energy 
efficiency and renewable energies reflect an increased emphasis on 
these areas of research, with the total federal budget for 
environmental technologies exceeding $4 billion.<p>

<h3>Increased attention to long-term monitoring, data collection and 
management, and interpretation.<p></h3> 

The Administration agrees that inadequate attention has been paid 
to monitoring and assessing environmental trends and consequences.   
Vast quantities of data on environmental quality are generated, but 
historically there has been insufficient attention to the collection, 
quality assurance, management and interpretation of data.  Thus, 
data is not readily accessible to  investigators within and outside the 
federal government.  In some areas we have instituted major 
programs to organize data; in other areas, data management is 
severely lacking.  For example, through the EOSDIS program, NASA, 
working closely with NOAA and other agencies, is organizing remote 
sensing data.<p>

There is a recognized need for coordinating the monitoring, 
evaluation, and reporting on these trends.  The federal system should 
improve the tracking and regular reporting on major environmental 
trends, from climate change, to water quality, to the exposure of 
individuals to pollutants and the health consequences of exposure.  
In some areas there is already a significant, but not fully adequate, 
amount of effort, e.g., (i) the interagency USGCRP, (ii) EPA has 
recently expanded its activities with respect to environmental 
statistics and in national monitoring of ecological status and trends, 
and (iii) EPA has just initiated a program to obtain statistically valid 
data about the exposure of people to toxic chemicals in the 
environment, and to assess the exposures of more highly exposed 
subpopulations (e.g., for consideration of environmental justice 
issues) or more sensitive populations (e.g., children).<p>

The Administration believes that we can significantly improve our 
collection and dissemination of data and information by developing 
an evolutionary and cooperative international environmental 
monitoring and information system, using civilian and dual-use 
technologies.  This system will support the identification of trends, 
advancement of scientific understanding, and the development of 
prediction systems, but will require the successful implementation of 
an international policy for securing open and stable exchange of 
environmental data and information.  A multi-step strategy is 
proposed:
<ul><li>inventorying, collecting and assessing existing data sets for a 
range of environment and natural resources issues;</li>
<li>increased use of existing "operational" monitoring systems, by 
making minor modifications, thus enhancing the value of ongoing 
observations;</li>
<li>improve existing monitoring systems and data bases to develop 
enhanced observational capabilities;</li>
<li>improved data collection, data sharing, data base management, 
and information systems building upon the evolutionary concepts of 
initiatives such as EOSDIS and the NII, and consistent with the terms 
and conditions of the executive order on a National Spatial Data 
Infrastructure (NSDI) coordinated through the Federal Geographic 
Data Committee (FGDC).</li></ul><p>

The Administration has already embarked on a number of activities 
that will improve our ability to determine environmental trends:  (i) 
the reorganization of DOI to create the National Biological Survey; (ii) 
the implementation of the EPA Environmental Monitoring and 
Assessment Program to assess the status and trends of ecological 
resources and stressors; (iii) the development of a single converged 
meteorological and environmental monitoring polar-orbiting satellite 
system; and (iv) the design of the U.S. component of an integrated 
international ground- and space-based  system for long-term 
systematic observations, including the data management system, of 
the environment and natural resources.<p>

<h3>Improved education and training of people.</h3><p>

The Administration acknowledges the need for improved 
environmental education and training.  Some federal R & D programs, 
e.g., the USGCRP, have established an educational task group to 
ensure coordination of USGCRP agency programs that provide multi-
disciplinary opportunities at all grade levels (from K-12 through 
college and graduate and postgraduate school) and informal 
continuing and public education.   This type of coordinated activity is 
required for other environmental issues.  Recently the 
Administration announced the Global Learning and Observations to 
Benefit the Environment (GLOBE), an international project to 
coordinate the work of children, educators and scientists in 
monitoring the global environment.  One of the high priorities for the 
NSTC Committee for Education and Training will be to assess how to 
improve education and training on environmental issues at all 
levels.<p>

<h3>Summary</h3><p>

We believe that this Administration has made significant progress 
toward to dealing with the issues that this Committee and others 
have legitimately raised.  The Administration has mounted a 
substantial and well-orchestrated effort to conduct environment and 
natural resources R&D, which is both scientifically sound and policy-
relevant.  In establishing the CENR, the Administration has created a 
mechanism to better develop an R&D strategy and coordinate agency 
efforts.  Under the NSTC, the CENR elevates the level of guidance to 
that of agency leaders, while maintaining and enhancing the quality 
of agency R&D manager participation. 

We have already taken a number of significant actions, and will be 
moving rapidly in the coming months to implement the objectives of 
the CENR that have been outlined in our testimony today and are 
summarized below:<p>

<ul><li>provide a higher proportion of federal R&D funds to support 
competitive, peer-reviewed, extra-mural research;</li>
<li>devote more funds to areas such as the social and ecological 
sciences, and environmental technologies;</li>
<li>ensure the development of the science-policy tools required for 
policy formulation, e.g., integrated assessment models;</li>
<li>improve data and information activities; </li>
<li>enable credible comprehensive national or international 
assessments to be performed involving all stakeholders (government, 
industry, and environmental scientists and decisionmakers);</li>
<li>improve education and training on environmental issues at all 
levels.</li></ul><p>

We would like to express our gratitude to this Committee for holding 
this hearing and we value your participation in helping to make our 
coordinated environment and natural resources R&D efforts more 
effective.<p>

<h3>Initial Strategy for Environment and Natural Resources 
R&D</h3><p>


<ul><li>Sound environmental and economic policies require a solid 
scientific and technical foundation</li><p>
	
<li>Environment and natural resources R&D should be policy relevant, 
not policy driven, and must be broad enough to catch, and respond, 
to surprises</li><p>
	
<li>The research should be anticipatory, not just focused on the policy 
and management issues of today</li><p>
	
<li>A systems approach to environmental issues requires the 
complete integration of the social and natural sciences</li></ul><p>
	
	
<strong>1.	Environmental Vision and Overall Strategy</strong><p>

A guiding vision of the Clinton/Gore Administration is to protect the 
environment for present and future generations by employing 
policies and approaches that enable development to proceed in a 
sustainable manner, while preserving  ecological integrity and 
diversity, protecting human health and safety, and enhancing the 
quality and quantity of food,  fiber, energy and water supplies. <p>

The coupling of a sustainable economy with a sustainable 
environment is a central theme of Clinton/Gore policies,  which can 
be expressed through the following principles: (i) long-term economic 
growth that creates good jobs and  protects the environment; (ii) 
world leadership in basic science, mathematics and engineering; (iii) 
continued progress  toward implementation of the goals of U.S. 
environmental statutes; and (iv) sustainable use of ecological 
systems.<p>

Sustainable development, which is the basis of a sustainable 
economy, improves the quality of human life, while at  the same time 
living within the carrying capacity of supporting ecosystems.  This 
requires a new kind of  development, where scientific and technical 
knowledge, coupled with a political will to change, sets society on a 
new  course away from unsustainable resource use, unwise 
technological practices, and continued population growth.  Indeed, 
environmental degradation, depletion of natural resources, and 
associated stresses on societies are likely to be  major national 
security issues of the 21st century forcing changes in policies and 
practices nationally and  internationally.<p>

The agencies of the Committee on Environment and Natural 
Resources will facilitate the realization of this vision of  sustainable 
development by developing a balanced, comprehensive, integrated, 
and coordinated multidisciplinary  environmental and natural 
resources R&D policy-relevant program that provides the  scientific 
and technical  information needed for national and international 
policy formulation and implementation.  This will require  
understanding:
<ul><li>the state of the natural system including its extreme events, 
and its susceptibility to change by human activities;</li>
<li>the socioeconomic dimensions of environmental changes;</li>
<li>the human health consequences of environmental 
degradation;</li>
<li>the vulnerability of ecological systems and the goods and services 
they provide; and</li>
<li>the development of technologies and strategies to mitigate change, 
to adapt to change, and to restore damaged ecological systems, in 
response to human-induced stresses on the system.</li></ul><p>
	
Therefore, there is a need to develop an interdisciplinary 
environmental research strategy that:
<ul><li>coordinates the currently fragmented agency programs;</li>
<li>addresses the various environmental issues in an integrated 
fashion;</li>
<li>is responsive to regulatory time frames and needs, but is also 
anticipatory and supports long-range priority-setting and problem 
solving;</li>
<li>builds broad and credible integrated assessments involving all 
stakeholders;</li>
<li>invests in the future human-resource and technical research 
capabilities;</li>
<li>strengthens extramural academic research programs, within the 
limits of existing legislation;</li>
<li>encourages external peer-review of all R & D programs, where 
guidelines do not already exist;</li>
<li>encourages international cooperation and engagement to leverage 
U.S. resources and provide access to  research sites worldwide; 
and</li>
<li>facilitates innovative technologies and institutional adjustments 
that will allow us to move away from the  control, restoration and 
remediation of pollution, to pollution prevention by embracing the 
tenets of industrial  ecology and efficient use of 
resources.</li></ul><p>
	
This research strategy will result in the most efficient utilization of 
scarce R&D resources, and will provide the  scientific and technical 
information needed to maximize the cost-effectiveness of 
environmental protection,  management and restoration, and set us 
on a course of sustainable development where the societal costs of, 
and need  for, clean-up will be drastically reduced.<p>

The range of environmental issues is diverse and encompasses local, 
regional and global issues such as pesticides and  toxic substances, 
hazardous and solid waste disposal, water quality and quantity, 
urban and rural air pollution,  resource use and management, loss of 
wetlands, soil erosion, degradation of aquatic and terrestrial 
ecological systems,  desertification,   deforestation, marine pollution, 
natural disasters, loss of biological diversity, stratospheric ozone  
depletion, and climate change.<p>

Specifically the Committee on Environment and Natural Resources 
will provide the scientific and technical  information needed to 
support the development and implementation of :<p>

<ul><li>Administration Initiatives and Priorities, including:</li>	
	<ul><li>a cleaner environment, by providing the scientific and 
technical information needed to continue to refine  environmental 
and economic policies;</li>
	<li>healthy safer Americans, by improving our understanding of 
the human health implications of  environmental changes and the 
societal vulnerabilities to natural hazards;</li>
	<li>a strong economy, through the continued development of 
cost-effective pollution prevention  technologies, and a reduction of 
market and government inefficiencies that prevent the diffusion of 
technologies  and efficient use of legal, economic and environmental 
resources;</li>	
	<li>national security, by providing the information needed to 
reduce destabilizing environmental degradation  and resource 
depletion that leads to conflict, environmental refugees, and further 
ecological damage resulting  from war; and</li>
	<li>improved education and training of Americans through 
environmental education curriculum  development and 
strengthening environmental continuing education initiatives, 
utilizing such mechanisms as  government-private sector 
partnerships.</li></ul></li><p>
	
<li>Environmental Statutes including:</li>
	<ul><li>Clean Water Act;</li>
	<li>Safe Drinking Water Act;</li>
	<li>Clean Air Act;</li>
	<li>Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and 
Liability Act;</li>
	<li>Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act;</li>
	<li>Toxic Substances Control Act;</li>
	<li>Coastal Zone Management Act;</li>
	<li>Endangered Species Act;</li>
	<li>Magnuson Fisheries Act;</li>
	<li>Resource Conservation Planning Act;</li>
	<li>Forest Land Management Planning Act;</li>
	<li>Renewable Natural Resources Planning Act;</li>
	<li>Disaster Relief Act;</li>
	<li>Marine Plastics Pollution Research and Control Act;</li>
	<li>Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act;</li>
	<li>Ocean Dumping Ban Act;</li>
	<li>Shore Protection Act;</li>
	<li>National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Act;</li>
	<li>Energy Policy Act;</li>
 	<li>Global Climate Change Protection Act;</li>
	<li>Global Change Research Act;</li>
	<li>Oil Pollution Act;</li>
	<li>National Environmental Policy Act;</li>
 	<li>Weather Service Modernization Act.</li></ul></li><p>
	
<li>Regional and Global Agreements and Conventions, including:</li>
	<ul><li>Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution 
and its associated amendments;</li>
	<li>Vienna Convention to Protect the Ozone Layer and its 
associated Montreal protocol;</li>
	<li>Framework Convention on Climate Change;</li>
	<li>Convention on Biological Diversity;</li>
	<li>International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction;</li>
	<li>London Dumping Convention;</li>
	<li>International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution 
from Ships;</li>
	<li>Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary 
Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal;</li>
	<li>Global Forestry Agreement;</li>
	<li>Agenda 21 (follow-on activities such as the U.N. Council on 
Sustainable Development);</li>
	<li>North American Free Trade Agreement;</li>
	<li>General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade</li></ul></li></ul><p>

The environment and natural resources R&D program will build upon 
three important priorities of the  Administration: (i) world leadership 
in basic science, mathematics and engineering; (ii) the National 
Information  Infrastructure (NII) initiative; and (iii) the Global 
Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment (GLOBE)  
initiative:<p>

	<ul><li>the U.S. scientific community must meet the challenge of 
world leadership in basic science,  mathematics and engineering if 
we are to obtain the scientific and technical information needed to 
realize the  vision of sustainable development.  This will challenge 
the best and brightest scientists in academia, industry,  national 
laboratories and other government institutions in the U.S. and 
worldwide;</li>
	<li>the NII initiative will be an critical tool in filling the 
"information gap", a prerequisite for realizing the  vision of 
sustainable development.  The NII initiative views information as an 
empowerment tool that can  assist our pursuit of sustainable 
development by diffusing useful information to citizens, businesses, 
and  research institutions.  Utilization of the NII will also help us 
achieve greater research efficiencies through the  efficient 
distribution of information;</li>
	<li>the GLOBE initiative will provide a significant opportunity 
for environmental education world-wide at  the school level.  This 
initiative, which will itself build upon the NII, will be embedded 
within a more  comprehensive effort at environmental education for 
K-12, undergraduates, post-graduates, and the workforce.</li></ul><p>


<strong>2.	Overall Environmental Policy Issues and Summary of 
Research Areas Needing Additional Emphasis</strong><p>
 
<u>Policy Issues</u><p>

The over-arching policy question is how to ensure the compatibility 
of long-term economic growth while protecting  the environment and 
quality of life.  For each environmental issue, the policy questions are 
similar:<p>

	<ul><li>What are the natural and anthropogenic drivers of 
environmental change?</li>
	<li>When, where, and by how much and at what rates, will the 
environment change as a result of human activities?</li>
	<li>How will natural and human systems be affected by 
environmental change, including extreme events?</li>
	<li>What are the present and prospective technical options and 
policy responses for mitigation and restoration of, and adaptation to, 
environmental changes?</li>

implementing available options, and what will be the  costs and 
benefits of implementation?</li></ul><p>
	
<u>Research Areas Needing Additional Emphasis</u><p>

This section summarizes critcal research that is currently not being 
conducted or that is funded at insufficient levels.  These areas have 
been derived by synthesizing the research needs from each of the 
individual environmental issues  and cross-cutting issues, which are 
described in more detail in section 3 of this report.<p>

An improved understanding of the environmental issues requires a 
long-term commitment to a balanced research  program of 
systematic observations (monitoring), data and information systems, 
process studies, and predictions.  However, if the federal 
environment and natural resources research program is to provide 
the scientific information  needed by decision-makers for policy 
formulation there are a number of research areas that need to be 
augmented in  the near term.  The areas most in need of 
augmentation are: (i) the scientific basis for integrated ecosystem  
management; (ii) the socio-economic dimensions of environmental 
change; (iii) science policy tools; (iv)  observations, and information 
and data management; and (v) environmental technologies.  
Supporting these high  priority areas will require a combination of: 
(i) additional funding for some strategic areas of environment and 
natural  resource R&D; (ii)  redirection of resources from lower 
priority areas of research; and (iii) redirection of resources by  
eliminating redundancy among different agency programs.<p>

<u>Scientific Basis for Integrated Ecosystem Management:</u><p>

We must develop the knowledge required for an integrated 
ecosystem approach that can evaluate the vulnerability,  better 
manage the use, and restore the function and integrity of ecosystems 
in a changing world, by utilizing a  multidisciplinary approach that 
examines the physical and biotic interactions among  the land, water, 
air and human  activities at sea and landscape levels.  Specifically, 
there is a need for an improved understanding of:  
	<ul><li>the natural and human forces (including changes in land-
use, atmospheric composition, and climate) driving the loss of 
biodiversity  at all levels (genes to ecosystems) and the degradation 
(structure and function) of  ecosystems;</li>
	<li>the value of biodiversity and ecosystems in utilitarian 
(goods and services) and intrinsic terms;</li>
	<li>how to maintain biodiversity and manage ecosystems 
(agriculture, fisheries, forestry, and parks) in a  sustainable way in a 
changing global environment (including consideration of economic 
and social activities and  institutions).</li></ul><p>
	
<u>Specific research in need of additional emphasis:</u><p>

	<ul><li>assessing the vulnerability of food, fiber and renewable 
energy production, water resources, and ecosystems  to simultaneous 
changes in atmospheric composition, aquatic quality and quantity, 
temperature, precipitation, 
nutrient status, and land use, including the responses and 
interactions with humans;</li>
	<li>developing the knowledge and tools required to sustainably 
manage terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems;</li>
	<li>initiating a limited number of pilot studies of research and 
observations to support interdisciplinary, integrated approaches for 
adaptive management and restoration of unhealthy terrestrial and 
aquatic ecosystems.</li></ul><p>
	
<u>Socio-Economic Dimensions of Environmental Change:</u><p>

We must develop an improved scientific understanding of the 
relationship between humans and their environment,  including the 
design of policy instruments and the selection of environmental 
goals.  This information will assist in:
	<ul><li>improving predictions of changes in the 
environment;</li>
	<li>decision making in the face of scientific uncertainty;</li>
	<li>developing policy alternatives that will mitigate 
anthropogenic effects on the environment;</li>
	<li>developing policy alternatives that will facilitate adaptation 
to environmental changes;</li>
	<li>assessing the impacts (on the economy, on the environment, 
on living standards, and on particular groups within our  society) of 
adopting, or failing to adopt, ameliorative policies;</li> 
	<li>enhancing our understanding of individual perceptions of, 
and responses to, environmental risks, and how  meaningful 
participation in addressing those risks can be supported.</li></ul><p>
	
<u>Specific research in need of additional emphasis:</u><p>

	<ul><li>understand the societal drivers of environmental 
changes, including the analyses of the environmental  impacts of 
various patterns and growth of population, economic growth,  and 
international trade;</li>
	<li>to promote policy analysis, including the design, comparison, 
and ex post evaluation of the effectiveness of  policy alternatives to 
prevent, ameliorate, or manage environmental problems;</li>
	<li>to promote the analysis of environmental goals, 
encompassing the concepts of distributive justice,  procedural 
fairness, community participation, and economic well-being; and</li>
	<li>to promote the analysis of the barriers to the diffusion of 
environmentally beneficial technologies.</li></ul><p>
	

<u>Science Policy Tools: to improve the links between the physical, 
biological, social and economic sciences, and  environmental 
policy:</u><p>

There is a need to improve the links among the physical, biological, 
social and economic sciences, and  environmental policy.  Specifically 
there is a need to further develop and utilize tools such as:
	<ul><li>integrated assessments, ensuring, for instance, that 
feedbacks between human behavior and environmental  change are 
appropriately taken into account.  These assessments can be used to 
analyze the value of various  kinds of information, enabling the 
prioritization of policy relevant research;</li>
	<li>risk assessments, with increased emphasis on non-cancer 
human health end-points and ecological endpoints,  as well as 
exposure assessment;</li>
	<li>those needed to value information and facilitate policy 
development under conditions of scientific  uncertainty.</li></ul><p>
	
<u>Specific research in need of additional emphasis:</u><p>

	<ul><li>development of integrated assessments for different 
geographic and temporal scales depending on the  environmental 
problem;</li>
	<li>risk assessment methodologies to a wide range of 
environmental applications including, natural hazards,  toxic 
chemicals, and development of resources on federal lands;</li>
	<li>improved exposure assessments and hazard characterization 
(exposure-dose-relationships), evaluation of the  variability of the 
susceptibility within populations, effects on vulnerable populations, 
and the impact of  cumulative exposures.</li></ul><p>
	
<u>Observations, and Information and Data Management:</u><p> 

We must significantly improve our collection and dissemination of 
data and information by developing an  evolutionary and cooperative 
international environmental monitoring and information system, 
using civilian and  dual-use technologies.  This will support the 
identification of trends, advancement of scientific understanding, and 
the  development of prediction systems, but will require the 
successful implementation of an international policy for  securing 
open and stable exchange of environmental data and information.  A 
multi-step strategy is proposed:
	<ul><li>inventorying, collecting and assessing existing data sets 
for a range of environment and natural resources  issues;</li>
	<li>increased use of existing "operational" monitoring systems, 
by making minor modifications, thus  enhancing the value of ongoing 
observations;</li>
	<li>improve existing monitoring systems and data bases to 
develop enhanced observational capabilities;</li>
	<li>improved data collection, data base management, and 
information systems building upon the evolutionary  concepts of 
initiatives such as EosDiS and the NII, and consistent  with the terms 
and conditions of the  executive order on a National Spatial Data 
Infrastructure (NSDI) coordinated through the Federal Geographic  
Data Committee (FGDC). Initial implementation of this strategy will 
involve pilot projects that address high priority areas that are in 
need of  greater attention.  Priorities will be determined on the likely 
contribution to prediction capabilities and relevance to  policy 
needs.</li></ul><p>

<u>Specific research in need of additional emphasis:</u><p>

	<ul><li>air quality monitoring, particularly of urban and regional 
ozone;</li>
	<li>development of land/ecosystem-use change maps, with 
emphasis on utilizing Landsat data;</li>
	<li>development of natural resource information (ecological and 
related socio-economic) needed for vulnerability  studies and 
integrated ecosystem management; </li>
	<li>determination of the status and trends of biodiversity;</li>
	<li>geologic, geochemical, and geophysical maps at scales 
commensurate with delineation of energy and  mineral 
resources.</li></ul><p>
	
 <u>Environmental Technologies:</u><p>

We must develop environmental technologies that enable sustainable 
development, and accelerate their diffusion into  the marketplace 
through partnerships with industry, state government, academia and 
non-governmental organizations.   The challenge is facilitate the 
evolution from pollution control and waste management to pollution 
prevention and  resource conservation, while continuing an 
aggressive program to clean up and remediate environmental 
hazards.<p> 

<u>Specific research in need of additional emphasis:</u><p>
			
	<ul><li>elimination of hazardous wastes;</li>
	<li>improved environmental technologies information 
infrastructure; and</li>
	<li>developing more environmentally benign:<p>

		<ul><li>manufacturing and industrial maintenance 
processes;</li>
		<li>personal and shared transportation;</li>
		<li>alternative materials; and</li>
		<li>energy.</li></ul></li></ul><p>

<strong>Specific research in need of additional emphasis:</strong><p>

Global change research is designed to observe and document change, 
to improve estimates of human and natural  emissions, to understand 
chemical, physical and biological processes and feedbacks, to predict 
changes using  integrated Earth system models, to determine 
ecosystem vulnerabilities, to support the development of policies  
analysis tools, and to conduct integrated assessments of the 
consequences of and options for dealing with global  change.  FY 96 
priorities build on this base and on the assumption  that the FY 95 
high priorities on terrestrial  ecology, coupled Earth system modeling, 
international field programs, socio-economic dimensions, and the  
development of integrated assessment tools will be implemented and 
continue to receive priority treatment in FY 96.  The three highest 
priority  research areas for the FY 96 budget are:<p>

	<ul><li>Comprehensive Research on System Vulnerabilities:

renewable energy production, water resources, ecosystems and 
socio-economic systems to short-term  climatic fluctuations such as 
the El-Nino Southern Oscillation, and simultaneous changes in 
atmospheric  composition, aquatic quantity and quality, temperature, 
precipitation, nutrient status and land use, including the  responses 
and interactions with humans?</li>
	<li>An Observing/Monitoring and Analysis Capability to Detect 
Global Change:  Develop and commit to a  long-term international 
observation (in-situ and remotely-sensed data), monitoring, and 
prediction program that  detects global change.  Develop plans in FY 
95, and implement an effort in FY 96, to integrate and preserve  
observations that will address such topics as land cover and use, 
impacts of global change on ecological  systems, UV radiation, and 
ocean and climate data sets.</li>
	<li>Improvements in Research Infrastructure:  Investigate new

pollutants and the uncertainties in their magnitude  and causes?</li>
	<li>What options exist for reducing, mitigating and managing  
adverse effects and what are the costs of these  options?</li></ul><p>
	
<strong>Specific research in need of additional emphasis:</strong><p>

Building upon a maintained and continued broad base of research in 
monitoring, process understanding, model  development and 
evaluation, control/prevention approaches, and health and 
environmental effects, immediate and  heightened research should 
be focused on two critical research areas:<p>

	<ul><li>Substantially improve the understanding of the 
formation of ground-level ozone in urban and rural areas,  with two 
special emphases: (i) Better coordinate and specifically augment field 
observations and observing  networks that characterize human-
influenced and natural sources of ozone precursors, formation and 
loss  processes, exposure levels and impacts, in order to improve our 
overall predictive capabilities. (ii) With the  above observations and 
other information, carry out an "end-to-end", integrated state-of-
understanding assessment  of ground-level ozone, its consequences, 
and mitigation options.  Payoffs to policy:  Improved scientific  
assistance with "mid-course" Clean Air Act State Implementation 
Plans (SIPs) and a defensible observation- based evaluation of how 
well regulations are meeting their intended goal.</li>
	<li>Better characterize the impacts of airborne fine particles, 
with an emphasis on identifying the risks and  causality mechanisms 
by which particles adversely affect human health, with particular 
foci on (i) exposure  levels, (ii) size and chemical content, (iii) role of 
exposure to multiple stresses, and (iv) identification of  particularly 
susceptible populations.  Payoffs to policy:  Earlier formation of an 
effective, efficient, and  defensible particulate-matter control 
strategy as required under the Clean Air Act.</li></ul><p>
	
	
<em><strong>E.  Toxic Substances and Hazardous and Solid 
Waste</strong></em><p>

<strong>Environmental Vision</strong><p>

To  prevent, reduce, or eliminate human and ecological exposure to 
environmental toxic materials and their adverse  human health, 
ecological, and social and economic consequences.  Actions will be

assessment including:  models for predicting adverse  public health 
and environmental responses; biological and ecological mechanisms 
of action of toxic materials;  variability of susceptibility within 
populations; biological measures of exposure; effects on vulnerable  
populations; methods for monitoring and assessing exposure; models 
for estimating and predicting exposure and  environmental fate; and 
biological doses of toxic materials.</li>
	<li>Site remediation:  demonstrate and evaluate more cost-
effective innovative technologies for site  characterization and site 
remediation, with an emphasis on ground water cleanup, radioactive 
and mixed wastes,  and other hard-to-treat wastes.</li>
	<li>Pollution prevention:  support development and evaluation 
of pollution prevention technologies and  strategies.  As cleanup 
becomes more effective, transition resources from remediation 
research to the  development of pollution prevention methods and 
cleaner technologies and processes in partnership with  
industry.</li></ul><p>


<em><strong>F.  Water Resources and Coastal and Marine 
Environments</strong></em><p>

<strong>Environmental Vision</strong><p>

To provide reliable supplies of clean water as a resource for 
domestic, agricultural, and industrial use, and ensuring  the integrity 
of aquatic ecological systems and watersheds.<p>

<strong>Relevant Conventions, Congressional Legislation, and Policy 
Objectives</strong><p>

<strong>Specific research in need of additional emphasis:</strong><p>

The highest priority is to support the research and observations 
needed to implement an interdisciplinary approach to  maintaining 
and restoring aquatic ecosystem functions at watershed and regional 
scales.  Integrated studies in a few  geographically targeted areas are 
required that will result in the development of methods and tools 
that can be used  broadly in support of management and regulatory 
activities. More specifically this includes:
	<ul><li>Observing and Prediction Systems:  Development of 
interagency continental and coastal observing and  prediction 
systems.  The products of this effort will be forecasts, models, and 
data most needed by natural  resource managers.</li>
	<li>Process-related studies:  This includes mass balance studies 
which look at the flux, fate and ecological  effects of water and 
dissolved and particulate material from the atmosphere, through the 
watershed, and into  estuaries and the coastal ocean.</li>
	<li>Restoration of Ecosystems:  An interdisciplinary (physical, 
chemical, biological, and social) science  program to guide the 
management and restoration of aquatic ecosystems.  These studies 
will further the  understanding of the cumulative effects of stressors 
on aquatic systems, provide the methods and tools for  restoration 
activity, and evaluate through ex post analyses the outcomes and 
success of such efforts for future  management decisions.</li></ul><p>

and the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.<p>

Make the U.S. more sustainable by active planning and management 
in hazard sensitive economic sectors such as  agriculture, energy, and 
transportation, thus reducing the need for unbudgeted federal 
outlays for disaster relief.<p>

<strong>Policy-Relevant Questions</strong><p>

	<ul><li>What risks do natural hazards represent for the U.S. in 
coming years?  How are global changes,  technological advance, and 
rapid societal change, transforming our vulnerability?  Who should 
bear the costs?   What is the Federal share?  Can the U.S. insurance 
industry survive a major earthquake or hurricane?  If not,  what 
assistance or restructuring is needed? What is the threat of natural 
hazards to the production of food and  fiber, and to ecosystems and 
biodiversity?</li>
	<li>What are the opportunities for mitigation?  What changes 
are needed in land-use and management; building  codes and other 
engineering design and practice; financial and insurance frameworks; 
education and training?</li>
	<li>How can the U.S. foster its technology exports and reduce 
global tensions by helping other nations cope  with natural 
hazards?</li></ul><p>
	
<strong>Specific research in need of additional emphasis:</strong><p>

information through utilization of the National  Information 
Infrastructure Initiative.</li></ul></li></ul><p>
	

<em><strong>H.  Social Sciences and Economics</strong></em><p>

<strong>Vision:</strong><p>

A better scientific understanding of the relationship between 
humans and their environment and the social and  economic 
consequences of the policies and the environmental changes, which is 
essential for predicting more  accurately changes in the environment, 
for developing policies that will mitigate anthropogenic effects on the  
environment and that will facilitate adaptation to environmental 
changes.<p>

<strong>Relevant Conventions, Congressional Legislation, and Policy 
Objectives</strong><p>

The research program supports the Biodiversity Convention, White 
House ecosystem management initiative, the  Framework Convention 
on Climate Change, Comprehensive Environmental Response,

<strong>Policy-Relevant Questions</strong><p>

	<ul><li>How can we measure and value losses in environmental 
assets, such as biodiversity and pristine natural  environments, that 
may be associated with global change, acid rain, toxic substances, or 
resource use and  depletion?</li>
	<li>How can society best plan for, and manage, natural hazards 
in the most cost-effective manner?</li>
	<li>What are the most effective and equitable ways to preserve 
important ecosystems, to sequester carbon, and  to protect wildlife 
migration paths?</li>
	<li>What role can labeling, education, demonstration projects 
and other provision of information play in  reducing energy, 
fertilizer, and chemical use?</li></ul><p>
	
<strong>Specific research in need of additional emphasis:</strong><p>

The research priorities identified are common to the seven 
environmental issues of the CENR.  Underlying the  success of the 
research agenda is enhanced investment in methodological research 
and in the management and  collection of social science data sets.
	<ul><li>Human driving forces and mediating influences, 
including analyses of the impacts of various patterns and  growth of 
population, economic growth, and international trade.  Adaptation 
processes are an important part of  this research area.</li>
	<li>Policies and goals in the design of environmental strategies.  
This area includes the design and comparison  of policies to  prevent, 
ameliorate, or adapt to environmental problems, and the formulation 
(and content) of  environmental goals--goals which consider concerns 
about distributive justice, procedural fairness, community  
participation, and economic well-being. One research priority is a 
better understanding of the determinants of the  creation and 
diffusion of environmentally beneficial technologies.  Another 
priority is the ex post evaluation of  the effectiveness of 
environmental and natural resource policies.</li>
	<li>Links between physical sciences, social and economic 
sciences, and environmental policy.  This area  includes integrated 
assessments ensuring that feedbacks between human behavior and 
physical and natural  systems (e.g. climate change) are taken into 
account; research analyzing the value of various kinds of

<em><strong>I.  Technology and Engineering</strong></em><p>

<strong>Vision</strong><p>

 To foster the development of environmental technologies that 
enable sustainable development, both domestically 
and internationally, and add value simultaneously to both the 
environment and the economy.<p>

<strong>Key Policy Objectives</strong><p>

	<ul><li>effect a policy for well-paced, cost-effective correction of 
past and current environmental degradation, while setting a 
deliberate course for sustainable development. Over time, the 
investment balance between these two technology needs must be 
carefully formulated;</li>
	<li>overcome the regulatory, financial, institutional and market 
barriers that inhibit the commercialization of innovative 
environmental technologies.</li></ul><p>


<strong>Policy-Relevant Questions</strong><p>

	<ul><li>In a Federal strategy, what is the appropriate balance 
among technologies designed for pollution prevention, 
control, remediation, and monitoring.</li></ul><p>

<strong>Specific research in need of additional emphasis:</strong><p>

Accelerate the diffusion of clean energy and environmental 
technologies into the global marketplace through  integrated 
activities and partnerships and risk sharing among industry, 
government, and academia; evaluate and  modify regulatory and 
legal systems that impede innovation; improve mechanisms for 
information dissemination,  increased prototyping, and new 
technology demonstration and performance verification; and 
environmental training,  education, and literacy for the general 
population and skilled workforce.  The challenge is facilitate the 
evolution  from pollution control and waste management to pollution 
prevention and resource conservation, while continuing  an 
aggressive program to clean up and remediate environmental 
hazards.  The priorities for Federal R&D action in  the near term 
emphasize increased investment in:
	<ul><li>the elimination of hazardous wastes;</li>
	<li>an improved environmental technologies information 
infrastructure;</li>
	<li>and developing more environmentally benign:
		<ul><li>manufacturing and industrial maintenance 
processes;</li>
		<li>personal and shared transportation;</li>
		<li>alternative materials;  and</li>
		<li>energy.</li></ul></li></ul><p>
		
		
<em><strong>J.  Risk Assessment</strong></em><p>

<strong>Vision:</strong><p>

To promote the use of risk assessment in the most effective, efficient, 
and fair manner to prevent, reduce, and  manage health and 
environmental hazards.  The goal is to establish an appropriate 
balance between basic research in  the natural, physical, and social 
sciences and applied research on how risk assessment might best be 
used to inform  decision making.  A multi-disciplinary research 
framework is recommended to identify couplings, correlations, and  
feedback mechanisms in response to various stimuli (e.g., natural 
disruptions, chemical contamination) within  biological, ecological, 
physical, and engineered systems.<p>

<strong>Policy-Relevant Questions</strong><p>

Critical policy questions for risk assessment include: what criteria 
should determine whether a risk assessment should  be undertaken?; 
what is the incremental value of obtaining additional information 
through increased research, and in  which  areas?; how should 
various social concerns frame a risk  assessment and define data 
needs?; how might one  weigh and compare different endpoints, time 
frames, and/or populations?; how might uncertainty be weighed into  
policy decisions?; how can one risk be compared to another? and, 
what is the most appropriate role of risk  assessment (i.e., "science") 
in setting policy or management priorities?<p>

<strong>Specific research in need of additional emphasis:</strong><p>

	<ul><li>Endpoints:  identifying and predicting the magnitudes of 
new ecological risks, non cancer human health  effects and 
intermediate endpoints with research on the biological mechanisms 
(both human and ecological). Such  knowledge is crucial for setting 
research and testing priorities, and understanding variations in 
human susceptibilities  to hazards;</li>
	<li>Environmental Fate and Transport:  Concerns regarding 
especially susceptible subpopulations and/or  communities impacted 
by multiple hazards dictate that research should be directed toward 
multiple and/or cumulative  exposures and alternative pathways of 
exposure to hazardous pollutants, particularly for mixtures (both of 
chemicals  and physical stressors).</li>
	<li>Risk Communication:  identifying factors that influence 
individual, group and institutional perceptions and  responses to 
risks;</li>
	<li>Use of Risk Assessment in Decision-Making:   developing 
better and more explicit methods for  characterizing uncertainty and 
defining defaults for where data are lacking; advancing methods and 
strategies to  prioritize risk avoidance and mitigation options; 
developing decision criteria to aid in determining when it is  
appropriate to undertake a risk assessment; the level of precision 
desired; and how risk estimates ought to be used in  decision 
making.</li></ul>

<title>CENR Statement - Appendix III</title>

</head>
<body>

<hr>
<h2>Appendix III</h2><p>

Most of the Committee's questions were implicitly answered within 
the body of the testimony.  However, there are  some aspects of 
question 2 that deserve further explanation.<p>

<strong>Question 2.</strong><p>	

Federal Figures suggest we are spending close to $6 billion on 
environmental R&D. At the  same time, environmental compliance 
costs are estimated by EPA to exceed $150 billion.<p>

Are we investing the right amount of money in environmental R&D 
to develop cost-effective  solutions to the many problems we face?  
Are we adequately investing in monitoring and data  management so 
we can both identify emerging environmental problems and measure 
the  effectiveness of our proposed solutions?<p>

The number of important environmental issues facing our nation and 
the world is daunting, and as the Committee  correctly notes, the 
estimated costs for the U.S. associated with environmental 
compliance costs exceed $150 billion  annually, of which the annual 
federal government share exceeds $10 billion.  The question of 
whether $6 billion of  federal R&D is adequate to develop cost-
effective solutions is difficult to answer at present.  There is no 
question that  additional resources could be usefully spent, however, 
the issue is the relative priority of resources for environment  and 
natural resources R&D compared to other high priorities in these 
difficult times of limited discretionary funding.   The CENR is looking 
carefully at how we are spending our existing funding.  For example, 
we should be sure that  we are spending our resources on the areas 
that will help us to reduce scientific uncertainties and that have the 
best  return on the dollar, such as, in the biological sciences, socio- 
economic research, learning how to make policy  decisions with 
uncertain scientific data, and data and information systems (the 
importance of these areas of research  was discussed in the 
testimony and in Appendix II). <p>

The Administration recognizes the importance on investing in the 
development of environmental technologies that  enable sustainable 
development, and in accelerating their diffusion into the marketplace 
through partnerships with  industry, state government, academia 
and non-governmental organizations.  The challenge is facilitate the 
evolution  from pollution control and waste management to pollution 
prevention and resource conservation, while continuing  an 
aggressive program to clean up and remediate environmental 
hazards.<p>

<h1>Department of Agriculture</h1>
<p align=left>
<h2>Areas Of Global Change Research</h2>
<p align=left>
Ground-based research sponsored by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) focuses on understanding terrestrial systems and the effects of global change (including water balance, atmospheric deposition, vegetative quality, and UV-B radiation) on food and fiber production in agricultural, forest and range ecosystems, and includes research on: interactions between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere; the contributions of agricultural sources of methyl bromide to stratospheric ozone depletion and possible alternatives and substitutes for this fumigant; methane generation and nitrous oxide release; soil properties, including moisture, erosion, organic matter, nutrient fluxes and microbes; relationship of global change to forest and range fires, insects and plant pathogens; agricultural management systems; and ground truthing of satellite measurements. 
<p align=left>
<h2>Related Research</h2>
<p align=left>
In addition to focused USGCRP research, USDA sponsors significant research contributing to the assessment of global change effects on the agricultural food and fiber production systems, and on forests and forest ecosystems of the U.S. and worldwide. Programs include: long-term studies addressing the structure, function and management of forest and grassland ecosystems; research in applied sciences including soils, climate, food and fiber crops, pest management, forests, fish and wildlife, social sciences; implementation of ecosystem management on the national forests and grasslands; and human interactions with the natural resources.
<p align=left>
The USDA plays an important dual role in global change research and other programs related to the environment and natural resources.  USDA agencies support agriculture, forestry, and ranching programs that ensure a continued and healthy food supply for the Nation and our trading partners throughout the world.  At the same time, the USDA has a vital interest in and has responsibilities for the protection of the land to prserve it for  future generations.
<p align=left>
In carrying out its various missions, the USDA conducts research to better sustain agriculture and forestry in the United States and to provide technical assistance in managing private and public lands.  Agriculture, forest, and grazing management are affected by weather, climate, and other environmental variables.  USDA's global change research program focuses on understanding how global change factors affect U.S. and international forest, pastoral, and agricultural ecosystems affect the environmental variables that contribute to global change.
<p align=left>
UDSA agencies maintain various centers of data and information that have been developed to support the mission programs of each agency.  These programs include the areas of ecological systems and dynamics, biochemical dynamics, climate and hydrological systems, and human interactions with land use.  The USDA is in a unique position of having substanital long-term data and information relevant to global change and terrestrial ecosystems.  The vast majority of USDA data and information of significant value to global change research were collected to support other agricultural programs, however, and do not carry an easily identified global change label.  An intensive effort will be required to capture and incorporate this data and inforamtion into the global change research program.

<h1>Department of Commerce/National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</h1> 
<p align=left>
<h2>Areas Of Global Change Research</h2>
<p align=left>
The Department of Commerce's (DOC) National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) maintains a balanced program of observations, analytical studies, climate prediction and information management though ongoing efforts in: operational in situ and satellite observations with an emphasis on oceanic and atmospheric dynamics (including sea level), circulation and chemistry; the development of new measurement techniques; focused research on ocean-atmosphere interactions, the global hydrologic cycle, the role of oceanic circulation and biogeochemical dynamics in climate change, atmospheric trace gas/climate interactions, and the response of marine ecosystems and living resources to climate change and related stresses; improvements in climate modeling, prediction and information management capabilities; global change economics and human dimensions research; and archival, management and dissemination of data and information useful for global change research. 
<p align=left>
NOAA is the primary agency within the DOC for GCDIS participation as both supplier and user of climate and global change data and information products.  Serving as the Nation's steward for the long-term climate data record, NOAA provides GCDIS support through its National Data Centers--the National Climate Data Center, the National Geophysical Data Center, the National Oceanographic Data Center--and their associated Solar, Geophysical, and Environmental World Data Centers.  
<p align=left>
On-line access to operational satellite data is provided by the NOAA Satellite Active Archive (SAA).  The NOAA Environmental Services Data Directory provides users with online access to descriptions of more than 5,000 NOAA data sets.  The NOAA National Information Center provides Internet access for users seeking information about NOAA and its data and information holdings.  The NOAA Library provides GCDIS users with online catalog access to 1.5 million volumes, including 10,000 volumes of historic worldwide meteorological and global change climatological data.
<p align=left>
<h2>Related Research</h2>
<p align=left>
In addition to focused USGCRP research, NOAA contributing programs include: advance short-term forecast and warning services; prediction, observation and process research in implementing seasonal to interannual climate forecasts; prediction and assessment of decadal to centennial environmental change; facilitating the dissemination of global change information; and strengthening facets of environmental technology. Research in the National Institute for Science and Technology (NIST) include programs in atmospheric chemistry, physical properties of chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) alternatives, and engineering system design of systems utilizing CFC alternatives.

<h1>Department of Defense</h1>
<p>
<h2>Areas Of Global Change Research</h2>
<p align=left>
The US Department of Defense (DOD) provides unique capabilities and programs
that concurrently satisfy Defense mission requirements and USGCRP goals,
involving research in high latitude dynamics, regional resolving models,
boundary layer dynamics, and ocean ecological systems.  The DOD routinely
collects environmental data globally in support of DOD operations, and also
conducts mission-related research into environmental processes and conditions
that affect defense operations, tactics, and systems.   While the DOD does not
have a mission requirement to archive data for civil uses, DOD data products are made available to the appropriate US national archives for subsequent use by
the Global Change and Data Information System(GCDIS).
<p align=left>
<h2>Related Research</h2>
<p align=left>
In addition to a modest focused research program, DOD contributory research
addresses issues in the observation, understanding, and prediction of global
change, including: the observation and monitoring of unique middle and upper
atmosphere phenomena; the Heard Island follow-on project monitoring temperature profiles of the world oceans through acoustic topography; fundamental research to understand global change including programs in physical oceanography, ocean
biology, marine meteorology/air-sea interaction and solar influences; and,
several programs in predictive modeling of the ocean-atmosphere system where
primary emphasis is on ocean modeling at various scales, but also includes a
strong program in atmospheric dynamics and global cloud specification/modeling. 
<p align=left>
The Commander, Naval Meteorology and Oceanography Command, supports activities
that provide meteorological, oceanographic, and mapping, charting and geodetic
products for DOD and U.S. Navy operations.  Complete synoptic and aviation
meteorological observations, bathythermograph and Salinity-Temperature-Depth
(STD) casts, bathymetry, and limited biological observations are routinely
recorded.  The Defense Mapping Agency (DMA) is the DOD manager for mapping,
charting, and geodesy (MC&G) data around the world, and adopts or establishes
MC&G standards promoting interoperability within the DOD and with allies.  In
response to DOD requirements, the DMA complies, produces, reproduces, and
distributes maps, charts, and digital MC&G data.  These types of data aid in
determining watershed and shoreline changes, sea level rise, variations in
coastal currents, rates of urbanization, and changes in the extent of vegetated
areas.  Release of DMA data depends on security classification, level of
resolution, and any third-party restrictions that may be in effect.
<p align=left>
The Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC) is the central repository
within DOD for scientific and technical information generated in support of DOD research and development efforts.  The DTIC primarily serves the DOD, other
federal agencies, and their contractors.  The DTIC forwards to the National
Technical Information Service(NTIS) all DOD technical information provided by
DTIC to DOD organizations when cleared for public release.  The NTIS serves the
general public by providing access to these data for DOD and the other federal
research and development agencies.
<p align=left>
Research organizations including the Naval Research Laboratory, NASA, the Jet
Propulsion Laboratory, the NSF, Rand Corporation, the Army Engineering and
Topographic Lab, the Air Force Institute of Technology, and Rice University
provide global change information for DTIC to disseminate.  Information on
global change in DTIC's collection includes analytical reports about research
conducted, as well as data sets, models, projections, research proposals, and
summaries of research efforts.
<p align=left>
The Strategic Environmental Data Active Archive Resource (SEDAAR) is an
environmental analysis, remediation, and education tool developed by the

<h2>Areas Of Global Change Research</h2>
<p align=left>
The US Department of Energy (DOE) research addresses the impact of energy
 production and use on the global Earth system primarily through studies of
climate response, and includes research in climate modeling, carbon sources and sinks, impacts on vegetation and ecosystems, critical data needs for global
change research and for early detection of climatic change, and funding for
education and training of scientists and researchers in global change.  DOE
supports additional research on technologies and strategies to mitigate the
increase in CO2 and other energy-related greenhouse gases, and plays a major
role in implementing the President's Climate Change Action Plan on reducing
 greenhouse gas emissions through changes in energy supply and improvements in
energy efficiency and conservation. 
<p align=left>
The DOE's contribution to the Global Change Data and Information System (GCDIS)
 comprises three focused programs: the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM)
Archive, the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC), and the
 Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison (PCMDI). The ARM
Archive features data from measurements and observations of radiative and 
atmospheric phenomena, as well as the ancillary information and documentation
 that allow scientists to interpret the data.  The CDIAC provides data and other
concerning carbon dioxide, other greenhouse gases, and climate change to the
 research, policy-making, education, and corporate communities, and to the
 public.  The PCMDI archives a broad range of global data sets of gridded
validation of climate models.  The CDIAC and the ARM Archive data and information products are presently provided free of charge in response to mail, telephone, fax, or e-mail request.  
<p align=left>
<h2>Related Research</h2>
<p align=left>
In addition to focused USGCRP research, DOE conducts research related to energy issues, including: studies of chemical processes in the atmosphere related to energy production and use; atmospheric studies of the lower atmospheric boundary layer; solid earth processes related to the formation of energy resources and
possible changes on surface interactions; long-term solar interactions with the Earth; basic research in plant and microbial biology; technologies to improve
 energy conservation and use efficiency and alternative energy technologies to
reduce or replace carbon-based fuels for energy production; and international
 environmental policy studies. 
<p align=left>
The DOE Office of Fossil Energy provides access to information on uses of coal, oil, and natural gas.  The DOE Energy Information Administration provides information on energy resources and reserves and encompasses petroleum, natural gas, coal, nuclear, electric, and various renewable energy resources.

<h2>Areas Of Global Change Research</h2>
<p align=left>
As the major federal land manager and primary federal agency for managing the Nation's natural ecosystems, fish and wildlife, and energy and water resources, the Department of the Interior (DOI) is particularly concerned about the potential short- and long-term effects of climate and other environmental change on these lands and resources.  The DOI's global change research is addressing topics such as hydrologic and geologic processes and resources, land use, land cover, biological habitats, resources, and diversity; past global change recorded in the physical, chemical, and biological record; land surface and solid-Earth processes that relate to environmental change; geography and cartography; polar and arid region processes; ecosystem modeling and dynamics; and resource ethnology.
<p align=left>
DOI programs include studies of past climates from which understanding of current changes can be drawn; interaction and sensitivity of hydrologic and ecological systems with climate at local, landscape and regional levels; arid, polar and coastal regions and systems; volcano-atmosphere interactions; methane hydrates; changing land surface characteristics; ocean heat fluxes; assessments of the impacts of global change and the social, environmental and economic consequences on human activities, water resources, coastal wetlands, biological species, ecological systems, and land management; carbon cycle variation; and archival and distribution of space- and land-based Earth science data. 
<p align=left>
<h2>Related Research</h2>
<p align=left>
In addition to focused USGCRP research, DOI sponsors contributing research programs addressing the collection, maintenance, analysis and interpretation of short- and long-term land, water, biological and other natural resource data and information including: monitoring of hydrologic and geologic processes and resources through dispersed observing networks; research in land use and land cover, including creation of maps and digital data products; and inventorying and monitoring of biological habitats, resources and diversity.   These efforts have always included maintenance of high-quality, long-term data sets, including cartographic, land cover, geologic, hydrologic, ecological, and biological data from both satellite- and aircraft-based remote sensing and terrestrial-based observations.  
<p align=left>
The US Geological Survey's (USGS) EROS Data Center  EDC)is a core element of DOIs focused global change management activities.  The EDC has archived, processed, and distributed a variety of remote sensing data including Landsat and high altitude aircraft imagery.  The EDC has also developed the Global Land Information System (GLIS) as an online, computer-based directory and inventory system to provide users with an interactive, user-friendly source for information about the land-related data sets described above.  
<p align=left>
The National Biological Survey  (NBS) has developed a directory of science data bases that is available in hard-copy form to help users identify and locate terrestrial natural resource data sets.  The directory contains summary descriptions of each data set and information about its availability, location, and research staff contact name.

The US Congress has established that, in order to assure effective implementation and review of science and technology policy, "the Secretary of State shall have primary responsibility for coordination and oversight with respect to all international scientific and technological activities of the US Government involving foreign countries, international organizations, and international commissions."  Furthermore, Congress noted that "individuals and organizations concerned with science and technology should be consulted in the formulation, implementation, and evaluation of foreign policy."
<p align=left>
To carry out this intent of Congress, the US Department of State, through its Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs (OES), has coordination and oversight responsibility for US Government participation in international bilateral and multilateral science programs (including the international dimension of USGCRP), for data and information management and exchange, and for negotiation of related international instruments and agreements.  The Department has established mechanisms for facilitating consultations with concerned individuals and organizations, both within and outside the US Government.

<h1>Environmental Protection Agency</h1>
<p align=left>
<h2>Areas Of Global Change Research</h2>
<p align=left>
The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has the primary responsibility for data on environmental quality and the distribution and effects of pollutants on human and ecological health.  EPA research supports process-level understanding and modeling ca
pabilities to more confidently predict global change impacts and feedback at the regional scale, and examines the relative risk of global change, especially in climate sensitive regions (e.g., tundra and forests).  EPA sponsors research on evaluating the 
processes and quantifying the relative contributions of anthropogenic and biological sources of trace gases, quantifying and modeling the consequences of climate change on ecosystems and their feedback to the atmosphere, and the interaction of trace gases
 in the atmosphere. 
<p align=left>
<h2>Related Research</h2>
<p align=left>
In addition to focused USGCRP research, EPA conducts contributing research including: environmental monitoring and assessment; development of ecological assessment methods; effects of tropospheric ozone on forested ecosystems; evaluation of anthropogenic 
methane mitigation options; evaluation of renewable energy production technologies (biomass, solar, wind); and immunological effects of UV radiation and environmental pollutants and chemicals. 
<p align=left>
The EPA's National Computer Center (NCC), located at Research Triangle Park (RTP), was founded in 1971 with a primary focus on EPA's air quality research and enforcement programs.  The NCC responds to the demands of new environmental legislation, serves as
 the central medium for storing and processing information, and provides nationwide services and support to more than 25,000 Federal, State, and local users of the agency's information resources.
<p align=left>
The National Environmental Supercomputing Center (NESC) at Bay City, Michigan, is the world's only supercomputer center devoted exclusively to environmental problems.  The NESC supports EPA modeling efforts in regional air models, in large ecosystems such
 as the Chesapeake Bay and Great Lakes, and in computational chemistry for the study of toxic substances.
<p align=left>
The EPA maintains a number of on-line resources that are relevant to environmental quality and monitoring.  The <strong>Aerometric Information Retrieval System, (AIRS)</strong> provides information on airborne pollutants.  The <strong>Ozone Transport Asse
ssment Group (OTAG) Emission Inventory Home Page</strong> provides access to state emissions data.  The <strong>Emergency Response Notification System (ERNS)</strong> provides notifications of oil discharges or release of hazardous substances. <strong>Env
irofacts</strong> provides access to data bases from four major EPA Programs:  the Permit Compliance System (information on water discharge permits), the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability System (hazardous site assessments)
, the Toxic Release Inventory System (information on the release and transfer of toxic substances), and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Information System (used to manage and track environmental compliance.) <strong>Enviro$en$e</strong> provides access to information on pollution prevention.  The <strong>EPAGIRAS GIS Data Sets Home Page</strong> provides access to land use/land cover datasets used in environmental monitoring and assessment.  The <strong>Hazardous Waste Home Page</strong> is a compendium of hazardous waste resources. The <strong>EPA/CIESIN Regional Environmental Information Systems (REIS)</strong> provide access to data and information resources for specific regional areas.  Currently, three REIS systems exist:  The Great Lakes REIS
, the Chesapeake Bay REIS, and the US/Mexico Border REIS.

Mission to Planet Earth (MTPE) is NASA's contribution to the USGCRP.  It 
is aimed at characterizing the Earth as a system in order to understand the global environment through studying long-term natural and anthropogenic changes.  Mission to Planet Earth 
has as its cornerstone the Earth Observing System (EOS).  The EOS is a long-term, interdisciplinary, and multidisciplinary research mission to study global-scale processes through simultaneous observations from a suite of instruments in low-Earth orbit and the establishment of the EOS Data and Information System (EOSDIS) to handle all NASA Earth science data including those from other space missions and from nonspace observations.  The Earth Science Data and Information System (ESDIS) Project (Code 505) at Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) is developing and operating the EOSDIS.
<p align=left>
The EOSDIS Version 0 (V0) Information Management System (IMS) allows users to locate, browse, and order data products residing at any of the nine Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs).  NASA also maintains the Global Change Master Directory (GCMD).

<h1>National Science Foundation</h1>
<p align=left>
<h2>Areas Of Global Change Research</h2>
<p align=left>
The National Science Foundation (NSF) sponsors a large and diverse research
community that both uses and produces global change data and information.
Although the NSF has no formal responsibilities for archiving and distributing
data and information, it supports a major facility for meteorological,
oceanographic, and climatology data sets at the National Center for Atmospheric
 Research (NCAR).  By and large, however, NSF-supported scientists rely on other federal agencies for much of their data and information needs and, when
appropriate, for archiving and disseminating the research products they
produce.

<p align=left>
NSF global change research programs support research and related activities that advance fundamental understandings of dynamic physical, biological, and
 socioeconomic systems and the interactions among those systems.  In addition to research on Earth system processes and the consequences of changes in those
systems, NSF programs facilitate data-acquisition and data-management activities necessary for basic research on global change, the enhancement of modeling
 designed to improve representations of Earth 
system interactions, and the advancement of advanced analytic methods that
 facilitate fundamental research.  NSF also supports fundamental research on the general processes used by governments and other organizations to identify and
 evaluate different types of policies for mitigation, adaptation and other
responses to changing global environmental conditions.
<p align=left>
<h2>Related Research</h2>
<p align=left>

In addition to focused USGCRP research, NSF conducts contributing research on
 many topics, including: laboratory and field studies of the atmosphere and the factors that affect it; data management for scientific research and modeling
 activities; generation,transportation, and the fate of chemicals in natural
systems; long-term monitoring and detailed studies of ecosystems; geophysical,
 hydrological, geological, and geochemical processes operating on the Earth's
 surface; composition, structure, and history of ocean floors; and global
 environmental history. 

<p align=left>

The National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) is located in Boulder, Colorado.  The NCAR Data Support Section (DSS) maintains an archive of more than 400 data sets.  Collectively, this archive is designed to support the wide variety
 of atmospheric and oceanic research at NCAR and within the university
community.  The complete archive is available to approximately 400 NCAR and 650 university personnel who use the NCAR computing facilities.  Access to the data sets is also extended to US Government agencies, the private research sector,
 and research groups worldwide by distribution on various media across networks.

<p align=left>

The NSF does not directly administer an archive of data relevant to the human
 dimensions of global change.  However, the NSF has contributed to the support
 of the primary such archive in the United States, the Inter-University
 Consortium for Political and 
Social Research (ICPSR), based at the University of Michigan.  The bulk of data sets archived in the ICPSR consists of survey data on individual attitudes and
 behavior collected by scholars.  The archive also contains US census data and
 surveys on population, health, labor, income, and other conditions collected
by Government agencies, international organizations, and other research
 institutions.  The ICPSR has been working with the Consortium for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN) to identify those data sets in the
archive that would be of interest to global change workers in order to make
 those available through the Global Change Data and Information System (GCDIS).

<h2>Areas Of Global Change Research</h2>
<p align=left>
Within the Smithsonian Institution, research conducted at the Smithsonian
Astrophysical Observatory, the National Air and Space Museum, the Smithsonian
Environmental Research Center, and the National Museum of Natural History
concentrates on monitoring indicators of natural and anthropogenic
environmental change on daily to decadal time scales, and on longer term 
indicators present in the historical artifacts and records of the museums as
well as in the geologic record at field sites.  Efforts involve enhancements
to ongoing research in tropical forest ecosystem dynamics, characterization and quantification of biological diversity, terrestrial and marine ecosystem
response to global climate, atmosphere-ecosystem exchange, past climate change
and ecosystem response, the human dimensions of global change, and quantitative documentation of global volcanism and other natural components of global change.The primary thrust of the Smithsonian's work is to improve knowledge of the
natural processes involved and to continue to provide a long-term repository
for present and future studies.
<p align=left>
<h2>Related Research</h2>
<p align=left>
Contributing research of the Smithsonian Institution on biological diversity and ecosystem functions falls into two broad areas: Tropical Biological Diversity
and Ecosystem Response to Fragmentation.  Studies of Tropical Biological
Diversity are done at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute and the
National Museum of Natural History.  The Tropical Biological Diversity Program
concentrates on inventories of biodiversity and species distribution in tropical forests, monitoring biodiversity through repeated standardized sampling of
flora and fauna, and identifying the physical and biological processes of growth and decline of species.

<h2>U.S. Global Change Research Program</h2>
The United States Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) was established
by the <a href=gcact1990.html> Global
Change Research Act of 1990</a> to provide scientific insight into the
causes, effects, and impacts of changes in the Earth system, especially
those related to human activities, and to develop tools for assessing
options for responding to global change.  The USGCRP is organized
under the auspices of the Subcommittee on Global Change Research
(SGCR) of the National Science and Technology Council's (NSTC)
Committee on the Environment and Natural Resources Research
(CENR).<p>

The major foci of the USGCRP are to:
Observe and record what is happening to the Earth's
 environment;
understand why changes are occurring;
improve predictions of what will happen;
understand the consequences of change; and
develop capabilities for assessing change.
In support of these emphases, the USGCRP has focused most
intensely on:
Supporting land-, ocean-, and space-based systems for
observing global change;
developing worldwide data management and archiving systems
and enhancing data accessibility;
supporting research on Earth system processes to improve
the understanding of the most important physical,
biological, and chemical processes that influence the
global system; and
supporting the development of integrative Earth system models
for predicting the magnitude, timing, and extent of global
change.
In response to new insights on the complexities of global
change, the Program is expanding its efforts to include:
Analyzing the impacts and consequences of global change on
the environment and on society; and
developing tools for assessing national and international policies
and options for responding to global change.

<h1>Global Change Data and Information System (GCDIS)</h1>
<p align=left>
The <a href="http://www.gcdis.usgcrp.gov/">Global Change Data and Information System</a> (GCDIS) is the set of individual agency data and information systems that support global change research supplemented by a minimal amount of crosscutting new infrastructure, and made interoperable by the use of standards, common approaches, technology sharing, and data policy coordination.  The GCDIS user community extends from global change researchers to other researchers, policy makers, educators, private industry, and private citizens.  Through the GCDIS, these users are able to learn about the existence and location of relevant data and information resources, have key holding available in useful forms, and be assured of their quality and continued availability.
<p>
The individual agency components of the GCDIS are funded through their respective budgets.  There will neither be a lead agency nor a separately funded budget for the GCDIS.  Interagency GCDIS implementation will be coordinated through the GCDIS Subgroup of the Data Management Working Group (DMWG) of  the Subcommittee of Global Change Research (SGCR). 
<p>
More detailed information about the GCDIS can be found at the <a href=http://www.gcdis.usgcrp.gov>GCDIS Home Page</a>.  An overview of some important aspects of the GCDIS is presented below.

<h2>Oslo Roundtable Conference on Sustainable<p>
Production and Consumption,<p>
Ministerial Session</h2
 
<h4>Oslo, 8 February 1995</h4>

      In retrospect last year's meeting was a ground-breaking
 event.  It helped catalyse a lively debate on the issue of
 sustainable consumption and production -- which along with
 population and poverty figured as an important though contentious
 cross-sectoral issue during UNCED.<p>
 
      Will society, through the state, the entrepreneurial sector
 and other social sectors, be able to forge a new culture that is
 more altruistic and equitable to replace our society of
 superfluous consumption and inequitable holdings of land and
 resources, where the short-term earnings of the few prevail over
 the integrity of nature and the well-being of present and future
 generations?<p>
 
      That was the essence of the discussion.  That is the
 question that we must ask ourselves with complete honesty.  Never
 before has humanity been at crossroads like this facing it now,
 where its own expansion and its own success as the dominant
 species is threatening its very survival.  And never before has
 humanity been so well connected, so aware of itself and so
 capable of self-reflection concerning its problems.<p>
 
<b>A change of course is now urgent and inescapable.</b><p>

<hr size=4><p>
 
      In these few minutes I want to focus on three myths which
 we need to expose -- because managing change has to start with
 clear understandings.<p>
 
<blockquote><i>The first myth is that sustainable development is
really the same old development + growth model clothed in
green.<p></i></blockquote>
 
      We know that environment is all inclusive encompassing the
 socio-economic as well as the physical environment.  We also have
 come to realize that development policy, if it is to arrive at
 satisfactory solutions to environmental and resource problems,
 cannot rely on incremental, piecemeal or palliative approaches. 
 It is true that such approaches may buy us time.  But for long-
 term solutions, integrated and structural approaches are
 imperative.<p>
 
      Envisaging a future that will ensure production to meet the
 needs of the growing population, safeguard environmental values
 and review consumption trends requires, first and foremost, an
 in-depth analysis of our old concepts of development.<p>

      The reductionist framework of conventional economics has
 given rise to misguided economic policies.  Their essence is the
 attainment of economic growth, a quantitative increase in
 production, which has become identified with "development".<p>
 
      The plundering of ecosystems, the depletion of natural
 resources, global environmental problems, which serve as a
 backdrop for a world rampant with poverty, injustice, disease and
 war -- all too familiar to us -- are firm evidence that
 development understood in terms of the values on which the
 current paradigm is based, is a dead-end road.<p>
 
      The goal of new economic thought is to achieve development. 
 Nevertheless, the concept of development is taking on new
 meaning.  It no longer refers simply to maximizing production and
 consumption -- which frequently means pollution and the
 plundering of natural resources -- but rather to the optimum
 attainment of human well-being maximizing potential.<p>
 
      The new development approach entails a different perception
 of the relationship between society and nature.  It is a shift
 towards a new world view that demands a profound change in
 values.  The physicist Fitjof Capra notes that we need a change
 from expansionism to conservation, from quantity to quality, from
 competition to cooperation, from domination to non-violent
 control.<p>
 
      After two decades of efforts of drawing up specific policies
 to protect the natural environment and improve the quality of
 life, we require innovative socio-economic solutions driven by
 environmental considerations.  We need to identify new
 possibilities for modifying lifestyles and inducing behavioral
 changes, and we need to rearrange our national and international
 institutional mechanisms to make these changes a reality.<p> 

      Perhaps the biggest challenge in realizing this new
 "development" is the challenge of modifying the attitudes of
 producers and consumers to recognize the future that increasing
 scarcity of resources and expanding population growth will bring
 -- and to seek creative solutions.  Evolution towards more frugal
 societies (some would say more responsible societies), and more
 vulnerable and interdependent economies is to a large extent
 dependent on the possibilities for profound social, economic and
 institutional change.<p>
 
<blockquote><i>The second myth is that we can achieve sustainable
 development without fundamentally affecting people's
lifestyles.<p></i></blockquote>
 
      We have yet to fully understand the social and ecological
 limits to the growth of consumption.  But it requires no
 sophistication to see that indefinite increases in certain forms
 of consumption are incompatible with sustainable development.<p>
 
      Can we translate this awareness into practical measures in
 environmental management and economic policy without affecting
 the quality of life?  Change is not automatically negative but,
 clearly, it will require from us all comprehensive measures that
 would reflect the full cost of environmental damage.  It is also
 a question of directing change now or suffering the consequences
 later.<p>
 
      Sustainable consumption embraces ideas and practices such
 as pollution prevention, cleaner production, clean technology,
 waste minimization, recycling, resource conservation, eco-
 efficiency, eco-labelling and preservation of biodiversity.  But
 it also focuses on strategies and actions that define the market
 forces and systems, implying a re-definition of relationships
 between people and the products they consume and their habits and
 practices.  So, on a more fundamental level, sustainable
 consumption implies a change in the global economy, socio-
 cultural values and economic relationships between the North and
 the South as well as within all societies.<p>
 
      Just one example will suffice -- the manufacture of the
 motor car.  This symbol of mobility, of affluence.  Manufacturing
 a car requires metals like steel, copper and aluminium.  It also
 requires plastics, rubber, water and chemicals.  Obtaining the
 iron ore requires mining, smelting and cooling.  Petroleum which
 fuels the car requires oil wells and refineries.  Driving the car
 requires roads.  Roads require land.  Every time it is driven,
 the car emits a range of harmful pollutants.  And when the car
 reaches the end of its useful life, it has to be disposed of,
 creating even more environmental problems.  But this is not all.
 Individual use of cars multiplies the thousands of times over
 more efficient mass systems of transportation.<p>
 
      Sustainable consumption is much more than choosing an
 "environmentally friendly vehicle".  We are already living in a
 time of environmentally driven change.  Recognition of the limit
 of the Earth's carrying capacity will lead inevitably to long-
 term structural economic change.  Artificial low prices for
 resources cover up severe environmental stress at both ends of
 the materials cycle -- production that should not have been
 necessary + disposed of materials that could have been used
 again.  Our purpose is to redefine not only the goals of
 industrialization itself but also its attendant ramifications
 such as urbanization, transportation, energy, land use and their
 relationship to broader societal concerns.<p>
 
      Gunnar Myrdal wrote in 1975, "All the talk about a new
 international economic order without changing lifestyles in the
 developed world is just humbug".<p>
 
<blockquote><i>And the third myth -- sustainable consumption only
affects those in developed countries.  There is a notion that consumers in
the North can alter and reduce resonance consumption input without
affecting the economies, resource allocation, price structures and so on
of the South.  This ignores the compact of stronger economic and
production links between North and South (especially with respect to
non-services, durable goods).  Given the real globalization of economic
markets, any significant change in OECD countries cannot take place in
isolation.<p></i></blockquote>
 
      More and more countries are being drawn into trading
 networks as producers and consumers of goods on world-wide scale. 
 The global proliferation of industrial systems means that there
 is no prospect for any nation-state insulating itself from
 changes in the economic climate, from global change and major
 pollution flows and from the actions of international actors,
 such as the multinational corporations.<p>
 
      And, this process of globalization is not complete. 
 Expansion in world trade has yet to encompass hundreds of those
 who live on the margins of the industrialized world.  Like
 inequality, patterns of unsustainable consumption are not limited
 either to the North or the South.  They manifest themselves in
 contrasting patterns within the geographical boundaries of
 individual nation states, between regions, between urban and
 rural areas and between the lifestyles of the rich and the poor. 
 We need only look to the replication of unsustainable patterns
 of development in rapidly industrializing countries.  Yes,
 changes in consumption and production patterns need to start in
 the North but, we need to broaden the scope of the debate options
 to include the perspectives of the South.<p>
 
      There will be implications for trade flows, upstream
 resource extraction, development and employment.  It seems
 wishful thinking to expect that any real changes can occur in
 consumption patterns also affecting core economic issues.<p>

<hr size=4><p>
 
<b>Let me suggest just three examples.</b><p>
 
     Implications of cleaner production methods on developing
 countries.  Although sustainable consumption places considerable
 premium on eco-efficiency, some empirical work by UNCTAD suggests
 that developing countries are at a disadvantage in implementing
 cleaner production, because of questions of scale, higher capital
 and operating costs, etc.<p>
 
     Implications in terms of investment flows.  It remains
 unclear how private markets are going to respond to this policy
 call.  Analysis by UNEP suggests that equity finance remains
 largely indifferent to environmental technologies.  Hence, there
 is some real work to be done in looking in links between capital
 markets, debt finance and longer-term targets associated with
 sustainable consumption.<p>
 
     Effects of integrated "Green Budgets".  Experiences suggest
 that there will be little gained from shift in market signals to
 sustainable consumption patterns, if gross environmental
 distortions remain in other core areas, including monetary
 policy, subsidies, transport and other areas.  This whole and
 complicated area brings in the question of pricing reforms, and
 the implications of market-based instruments on developing
 countries -- i.e. both in terms of trade and market access issues
 (when used in OECD countries and applied to LDC imports), as well
 as applicability of market-based instruments in developing
 countries which do not have formalized markets.<p>

<hr size=4><p>
 
<b>May I insert here just a word about trade.</b><p>
 
      Some regard international free trade agreements with
 suspicion on the grounds that they promote "harmonization" of
 national standards by reducing the lowest common denominator,
 rather than seeking a general increase in quality thresholds. 
 I agree that the problem of the balance between trade
 liberalization and restrictions based on the need for
 sustainability is immensely complex.  Restrictions on trade could
 be claimed on environmental grounds as a convenient excuse for
 protectionism.<p>
 
      We, in UNEP, think the debate within the WTO should not
 merely revolve around the concepts of free trade and
 protectionism, but also include the question of sustainability. 
 The debate should be one between sustainable and fair trade on
 the one hand, and unsustainable and inequitable trade on the
 other.  There will be need for sensitive rulings in the WTO that
 do justice to environmental concerns, maximize free trade where
 possible, and ensure that the interests of developing countries
 are protected.<p>
 
      So, building sustainable consumption and production patterns
 globally is a task of immense complexity.  It means changing the
 underlying economic principles, including the relationship
 between the North and the South in a cooperative long-term
 endeavour.  It means examining our societal goals and lifestyles,
 injecting an ethical perspective to our actions.  It means living
 within the ecological limits of our planet and the social limits
 of society.  It means reducing our "footprint" on Earth.<p>
 
      It may not be fashionable to say so, but, ultimately, the
 question of achieving and maintaining sustainable patterns of
 production and consumption hinges on the fundamental dimensions. 
 We have to ask ourselves simple but fundamental questions:  How
 should we live?  How much is enough?  What way of life human
 beings ought to pursue?  Simple questions are often the most
 profound, for they challenge the security of our accustomed
 norms.  We have to develop the ecological, holistic world view
 which connects us with our environment and other people and
 species -- both materially and spiritually.<p>
 
      But this Roundtable is about more than understanding why we
 need to change -- and what that might mean -- it's about finding
 actions that will be compelling.  To the menu provided for your
 consideration let me underscore UNEP's commitments.<p>

      <b>First</b>, -- to our Cleaner Production initiatives.<p>
 
     <b>Second</b> -- applying our data and analytical capabilities to
 such concepts as carrying capacity -- globally, nationally and
 locally.  Although this is a major undertaking, the trade-
 environment debate has driven home the need for greater focus and
 harder empirical evidence, of critical ecological thresholds. 
 (Our Environmental Data Report actually attempts this.)<p>
 
      Perhaps case studies of specific consumer products or
 activities in terms of trends, pollution intensity, pricing,
 longer-term sustainability -- "ecological shadow price" of Jim
 MacNeil -- showing that a country's seemingly clean production
 record must be linked to unsustainable resource extraction
 activities done in the neighbouring countries.<p>
 
      <b>Thirdly</b> -- linking science to economic options -- e.g.
 greater analysis of micro-economic aspects of concepts like eco-
 space.<p>
 
      And <b>fourthly</b> -- in the legal arena -- determining how
 commitments on international environmental agreements affect
 production process methods towards greater eco-efficiency.  For
 example, what is the implication for the energy sector of the
 provisions in the Climate Change Convention?<p>
 
      As we concluded the meeting last year I remarked upon the
 necessity for and hope of individual action.  I challenged the
 participants to inform me of three actions they would take
 personally or professionally.  The response was most encouraging
 - but we must not only challenge the converted -- each
 individual, each household, each interest group, each nation must
 be motivated and mobilized.  Anything less will not be enough.<p>

Council 1995 Review Recommendations on the USGCRP</title></head>
<body>

<b><center>National Research Council 1995 Review Recommendations 
on the USGCRP</b></center><p>

Among other comments, the NRC report offered the following key 
recommendations:<p>

<ul>
<hn align=left><b>Program Support</hn></b><br>
<blockquote><li>"Assessing accurately the current state of the global 
environment and increasing our predictive capabilities to aid in 
anticipating how this environment may evolve are enduring 
challenges to science....The scientific and societal motivations of the 
program remain compelling, and [the USGCRP] should be aggressively 
pursued."</blockquote><p>

<hn align=left><b>Program Integration</hn></b><br>
<blockquote><li>"The USGCRP must be implemented as an integrated 
program of observations, process research, modeling, prediction, 
information management, and assessment. In order to achieve this, 
enhanced collaboration and cooperation are required among the 
scientific community, the Congress, Federal agencies, and the 
Executive Office of the President to ensure that all elements of the 
program are considered in the context of the integrated program as a 
whole."</blockquote><p>

<hn align=left><b>Program Priorities</hn></b><br>
<blockquote><li>"The program should focus on priority issues in four 
mature areas of Earth system science that are of great scientific and 
practical importance [seasonal to interannual climate prediction, 
atmospheric chemistry, ecosystems, and decadal to centennial 
climate.]"</blockquote><p>

<blockquote><li>"Implement the first group of Mission to Planet Earth 
(MTPE)/ Earth Observing System (EOS) components: Landsat-7, AM-
1, PM-1, Chemistry-1 (CHEM-1), and Tropical Rainfall Measuring 
Mission (TRMM)."</blockquote><p>

<blockquote><li>"Implement a future framework for MTPE that 
incorporates advanced instrumentation and vehicle technologies, 
such as small satellites and remotely piloted 
vehicles...."</blockquote><p>

<blockquote><li>"Streamline [and] reconfigure 
EOSDIS...."</blockquote><p>

<hn align=left><b>Program Funding</hn></b><br>
<blockquote><li>"Success in attacking the long-term scientific 
challenges of the USGCRP requires an adequate and stable level of 
funding that promotes management efficiency and encourages 
rational resource allocation."</blockquote><p>

<blockquote><li>"The Congress should ensure that program 
authorizations and resource allocations to individual agencies are 
consistent with the implementation of an integrated program...[and] 
provide a mechanism for bipartisan, bicameral oversight of the 
effectiveness of the program in meeting the information needs of the 
Nation."</blockquote></ul><p>

El Ni&#241;o events cause fluctuations in temperature and rainfall patterns 
in the Pacific basin and beyond. These periodic variations that occur as a 
result of the interaction between the ocean and the atmosphere in the tropical 
Pacific region can affect ecosystems and human lives in far flung regions of 
the globe. This ocean-atmosphere phenomenon, known as the El 
Ni&#241;o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO), affects climate-sensitive human 
activities such as agriculture and fisheries. The symbols on this map indicate 
the types of impacts associated with "warm" ENSO events, such as occurred 
in 1982-83 and during the early 1990s, in which ocean waters in the eastern 
tropical Pacific Ocean warm by only one to a few degrees above their normal 
conditions. That these relatively small changes cause such significant 
responses indicates how sensitive the climate, ecosystems, and society are to 
these natural fluctuations. The effects of a La Ni&#241;a event (an anomalous 
cooling of the waters off the coast of South America) also can cause climatic 
and ecological disruptions; in some regions, the impact of La Ni&#241;a is the 
opposite of that caused by El Ni&#241;o. The figure is courtesy of the NOAA 
Office of Global Programs.</i><p>

<center><b>Highlights of Recent Research on Seasonal to Interannual 
Climate 
Fluctuations</b></center>



<P>
USGCRP-sponsored research continues to advance the predictive and 
comprehensive understanding of seasonal to interannual fluctuations 
in the climate, including the socioeconomic implications of applying 
experimental predictions to agriculture and water management. The 
FY96 edition of Our Changing Planet included a summary of recent 
key findings. Highlights of more recent findings follow:  <p>
<UL>
<LI>The TOPEX/Poseidon satellite mission is providing the first precise 
global information on the state of the ocean. The instrument can 
measure changes in ocean height, which is a good indicator of ocean 
temperature and movement. This information is being used to test 
the computer models that predict ENSO events. Testing and 
refinement of the models is important, because ENSO events have 
been shown to disturb the temperature and precipitation systems in 
the tropics, lower latitudes, and parts of the United States, and affect 
agricultural production, fisheries, and water resources.  <p>
<LI>The USGCRP led the world in a critical step toward the development 
of an International Research Institute for climate prediction that will 
generate experimental forecasts of the ENSO phenomenon and make 
them available for socioeconomic applications around the world. 
Representatives of more than 40 countries and 20 international 
organizations gathered in Washington, DC, to address the creation of 
an IRI with the capability to transform scientific information into 
products that can be applied in real-time to economic planning 
associated with water management, agriculture, natural disasters, 
and public health.           <p>
<LI>The GEWEX Continental-Scale International Project is a multi-year 
field experiment underway in the Mississippi River Basin. The 
experiment focuses on improving predictions of changes in water 
resources on monthly, seasonal, annual, and interannual time scales. 
Considerable progress has been made in the development of better 
representations of soil moisture and vegetation cover in regional 
coupled models. While regional in design, GCIP findings are starting 
to provide important information for the water and agricultural 
sectors throughout the United States.    <p>
<LI>A unique effort has been launched in the U.S. Pacific Northwest to 
bring together a multidisciplinary team of researchers with expertise 
in water management, coastal activities, fisheries, forestry, 
hydrologic modeling, institutional arrangements, and climate 
prediction. The scientists are developing an integrated approach to 
analyzing the impacts of seasonal to intradecadal climate variations 
on different social, economic, and ecological sectors with the aim of 
determining how climate forecasts can be used to improve decision 
making in these sectors for the benefit of society.    <p>
<LI>Preliminary analyses climate-crop relationships in Utah and Idaho 
indicate that extreme values of precipitation and temperature have 
the most significant impact on crop yields. These analyses further 
demonstrate the impact of ENSO events on crop yields, rangeland 
conditions, and the duration of forage harvest for grazing. A 
framework for assessing the relationship between climate and land 
use in the states of California, Oregon, Washington, Nevada, Idaho, 
Utah, Colorado, and Wyoming is now under development.<P>

The atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration has risen from about 280 parts 
per million by volume (ppmv) to about 360 ppmv in the period from before 
the Industrial Revolution to the present. This rise of nearly 30&#37; in the 
atmospheric concentration is a result of emissions of carbon dioxide from 
human activities, both from combustion of fossil fuels and from the clearing 
of forested land for agriculture and other uses. Emissions now total about 6 
billion tons of carbon per year (GtC/yr). That the rise in concentrations is 
occurring is confirmed by many types of measurements, including those of 
the carbon dioxide concentration in the air over the past 40 years and in air 
bubbles trapped in glacial ice over the past 1,000 years. The figure is from the 
Working Group I contribution to the IPCC Second Assessment Report (1995).

<html><head><title>Our Changing Planet FY1997 - Key Findings of the IPCC 
Second Assessment Report</title>
<center><b>Key Findings of the IPCC Second Assessment 
Report</b></center>
<p>
During 1995, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
prepared its Second Assessment Report. U.S. scientists and research 
findings played a pivotal role in the development of this assessment. 
The following conclusions about climate change, its consequences, 
and the potential for adaptation and mitigation are extracted from 
the report. The IPCC findings provide important guidance for decision 
makers and identify critical research questions that need to be 
pursued.
<p>
<b>Effects of Human Activities on Regional and Global Climate, and on 
Sea Level</b>  <p>
<UL>
<li>Human activities are increasing the atmospheric concentrations of 
CO<sub>2</sub> and other greenhouse gases that tend to warm the 
atmosphere 
and, in some regions, of aerosols that tend to cool the atmosphere.
<p>
<li>The Earth's climate is changing. The surface temperature this century 
is as warm or warmer than any other century since at least 1400 AD; 
the global average surface temperature has increased by 0.3&#176; to 
0.6&#176; C 
(about 0.5&#176; to 1&#176; F) over the last century; the last few decades have 
been the warmest this century; sea level has risen 10 to 25 cm 
(about 4 to 10 inches); and mountain glaciers have generally 
retreated this century.
<p>
<li>Models that account for the observed increases in the atmospheric 
concentrations of greenhouse gases and sulfate aerosols are 
simulating the recent history of observed changes in surface 
temperature and its vertical distribution with increasing realism.
<p>
<li>The balance of evidence suggests that there is a discernible human 
influence on global climate.
<p>
<li>Without specific policies that reduce the growth of greenhouse gas 
emissions, the Earth's average surface temperature is projected to 
increase by about 1&#176; to 3.5&#176; C (about 2&#176; to 6.5&#176; F) by 
2100-a rate of 
warming that would probably be greater than any seen in the last 
10,000 years.
<p>
<li>The reliability of regional-scale predictions is still low, and the 
degree to which climate variability may change is uncertain.
<p>
<li>Sea level is projected to rise by 15 to 95 cm (6 to 38 inches) by 2100.
<p>
<li>The long atmospheric lifetime of many greenhouse gases, coupled 
with the thermal inertia of the oceans, means that the warming 
effect of anthropogenic emissions will be long-lived.
<p>
<li>Even after a hypothetical stabilization of greenhouse gas 
concentrations, temperatures would continue to increase for several 
decades, and sea level would continue to rise for centuries.
</UL>
<p>
<b>Potential Health and Environmental Consequences of Climate 
Change</b><p>

<ul><li>Human-induced regional and global changes in temperature, 
precipitation, soil moisture, and sea level add important new stresses 
on ecological and socioeconomic systems that are already affected by 
pollution, increasing resource extraction, and non-sustainable 
management practices.<p>
<li>Most systems are sensitive to both the magnitude and rate of climate 
change.<p>
<li>Many regions are likely to experience adverse effects as a result of 
climate change, some of which are potentially irreversible; however, 
effects of climate change in some regions may be beneficial.<p>
<li>The projected changes in climate include potentially disruptive 
effects that will affect the economy and the quality of life for this 
and future generations:<p>
<ul>
<li><i>Human Health</i>. will be adversely affected through an increase in 
the 
rate of heat-related mortality and in the potential for the spread of 
vector-borne diseases such as malaria, dengue, yellow fever, and 
encephalitis and non-vector-borne diseases such as cholera and 
salmonellosis.<p>
 <li><i>Food Security</i>.  will be threatened in some regions of the world, 
especially in the tropics and subtropics where many of the world's 
poorest people live. On the whole, the effects of climate change over 
the next century on total global food production may be small to 
moderate in comparison to the effects of population change and 
demands for improved nutrition. <p>
<li><i>Water Resources</i>. will be increasingly stressed, leading to 
substantial 
economic, social, and environmental costs, especially in regions that 
are already water-limited and where there is strong competition 
among users.<p>
<li><i>Human Habitat Loss</i>. will occur in regions where small islands 
and 
coastal plain and river areas are particularly vulnerable to sea level 
rise.  <p>
<li><i>Natural Ecosystems</i>. will be degraded because the composition, 
geographic distribution, and productivity of many ecosystems will 
shift as individual species respond to changes in climate. This may 
lead to reductions in biological diversity and in the goods and 
services ecosystems can provide for society. </ul>
<p>
<li>Developing countries are more vulnerable than developed countries 
to climate change because of their socioeconomic conditions.
<p>
<li>Impacts will be hard to quantify with certainty because of 
uncertainties in regional climate projections, the complicating effects 
of multiple stresses, and a lack of understanding of some key 
processes.</ul>
<p>
<H4>Approaches to Mitigate or Adapt to Climate Change</H4><p>
<ul><li>Adaptation-which involves adjustments in practices, processes, or 
structures of systems-can be helpful in reducing adverse impacts or 
in preparing to take advantage of potential beneficial changes in 
climate.<p>
<li>Successful adaptation will depend upon education, technological 
advances, institutional arrangements, availability of financing, 
technology transfer, information exchange, and incorporation of 
climate change concerns into resource-use and development 
decisions. Potential adaptation options for many developing countries 
are extremely limited due to the limited availability of technological, 
economic, and societal capabilities.<p>
<li>Options such as migration corridors to assist adaptation of natural 
ecosystems to new climate conditions are, however, currently limited 
and their effectiveness is generally unproven.<p>
<li>Stabilization of the atmospheric concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub> at 
three times 
the pre-industrial concentration or less will eventually require 
human-induced emissions of greenhouse gases to be cut below 
today's levels.<p>
<li>Gains in energy efficiency of 10-30% above present levels are 
feasible at little or no cost in many parts of the world through 
technical conservation measures and improved management 
practices over the next 2 to 3 decades.<p>
<li>Significant reductions in net greenhouse gas emissions can be 
achieved utilizing an extensive array of technologies, and policy 
measures that accelerate technology development, diffusion, and 
transfer in all sectors.<p>
<li>Flexible, cost-effective policies relying on economic incentives and 
instruments, as well as internationally coordinated instruments, can 
considerably reduce mitigation and adaptation costs.

<html><head><title>Our Changing Planet FY1997 - Highlights of Recent 
Research on Climate Change</title>

<center><b>Highlights of Recent Research on Climate Change</b></center>
<p>
USGCRP-sponsored research continues to advance understanding of 
the causes, magnitude, and consequences of climate change over 
decades to centuries. The FY96 edition of Our Changing Planet 
included a summary of recent key findings. Highlights of more recent 
findings follow:
<p>
<ul>
<LI>Measurements of global surface air temperature over the land and of 
sea surface temperature over the oceans indicate that 1995 was the 
warmest year since the beginning of continuous records circa 1860 
(see <a href="temptrend.html">figure</a>). Despite the century's largest volcanic 
eruption in 1991, four of the warmest years of the 140-year record 
occurred during the 1990s. Proxy records from ice cores and other 
long-term data archives indicate that this century is the warmest in 
recent history. This evidence that temperatures are rising is further 
confirmed by indications of receding mountain glaciers and rising sea 
level.
<p>
<LI>Satellite data from the Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment II 
(SAGE II) instrument indicate that the very substantial stratospheric 
aerosol layer caused by the June 1991 volcanic eruption of Mt. 
Pinatubo had been significantly thinned by early 1994, but that 
aerosol levels were still nearly 10 times greater than before the 
eruption, exerting a cooling influence that lasted several years. Data 
from the Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) also showed that the 
stratosphere was warmed and the troposphere was cooled by the 
Pinatubo eruption, thereby requiring a correction for these events 
before performing a trend analysis with this data set in search of 
human-induced climatic change.
<p>
<LI>Tropospheric aerosols, both from sulfur dioxide emissions from fossil 
fuel combustion and from biomass burning, have been demonstrated 
to have had a regional cooling influence on the climate. Model 
simulations suggest that, at least near and downwind of source 
regions, aerosol-induced cooling could be offsetting greenhouse-induced 
warming, although the patterns of change and the 
subsequent response of the global climate are complex. Inclusion of 
the cooling influence of aerosols in model simulations of climate 
change has improved the agreement between simulated and 
observed temperature changes over the last century.
<p>
<LI>Recent improvements in the ability to compare the spatial and 
temporal patterns of climate change predicted by models with 
observations suggest that the geographic pattern of climate change is 
more likely due to emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols than 
to natural variations in the climate. Similarly, the latitudinal and 
latitudinal pattern of change is more likely to be due to human-induced 
changes than to changes in natural factors such as volcanic 
eruptions and solar radiation. Together, these global and regional 
analyses suggest that a significant fraction of climate change over the 
last century is due to human rather than natural influences.

<html><head><title>Our Changing Planet FY1997 - 1995 Nobel Prize in 
Chemistry</title>

<center><b>1995 Nobel Prize in Chemistry</b></center>
<p>
For their work in atmospheric chemistry, particularly concerning the 
formation and decomposition of ozone, the Royal Swedish Academy 
of Sciences awarded the 1995 Nobel Prize in Chemistry to:
<p>
<UL>

<LI>Professor Paul Crutzen of the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry in 
Mainz, Germany. Dr. Crutzen was born in The Netherlands and is a 
Dutch citizen.
<p>
<LI>Professor Mario Molina of the Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and 
Planetary Sciences and Department of Chemistry at the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Massachusetts. 
Dr. Molina was born in Mexico City and is now a U.S. citizen. He is a 
member of the National Academy of Sciences.
<p>
<LI>Professor F. Sherwood Rowland of the Department of Chemistry at 
the University of California, Irvine, California. Dr. Rowland was born 
in Ohio. He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, and is 
currently its Foreign Secretary.
</UL>
<P>
The announcement by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences stated 
that these three scientists "...have all made pioneering contributions 
in explaining how ozone is formed and decomposes through chemical 
processes in the atmosphere. Most importantly, they have in this 
way showed how sensitive the ozone layer is to the influence of 
anthropogenic emissions of certain compounds. The thin ozone layer 
has proved to be an Achilles heel that may be seriously injured by 
apparently moderate changes in the composition of the atmosphere."
<P>
In 1970, Dr. Paul Crutzen "...showed that the nitrogen oxides NO and 
NO<sub>2</sub> react catalytically (without themselves being consumed) 
with 
ozone, thus accelerating the rate of reduction of the ozone 
content....These nitrogen oxides are formed in the atmosphere 
through the decay of the chemically stable nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O), 
which 
originates from microbiological transformations at the ground. The 
connection demonstrated by Crutzen between microorganisms in the 
soil and the thickness of the ozone layer is one of the motives for the 
recent rapid development of research on global biogeochemical 
cycles....This was also the start of intensive research into the 
chemistry of the atmosphere which has made great progress during 
the past several years."
<P>
"The next leap in our knowledge of ozone chemistry was in 1974, 
when Mario Molina and Sherwood Rowland published their widely 
noted Nature article on the threat to the ozone layer from CFC gases-
'freons'-used in spray bottles, as the cooling medium in refrigerators 
and elsewhere, and plastic foams....Molina and Rowland realized that 
the chemically inert CFC could gradually be transported up to the 
ozone layer, there to be met by such intensive ultraviolet light that 
they would be separated into their constituents, notably chlorine 
atoms. They calculated that, if human use of CFC gases was to 
continue at an unaltered rate, the ozone layer would be depleted by 
many percent after some decades....Many were critical of Molina and 
Rowland's calculations but yet more were seriously concerned by the 
possibility of a depleted ozone layer. Today, we know that they were 
right in all essentials. It was to turn out that they had even 
underestimated the risk."
<P>
Thanks to the good scientific understanding of the ozone problem 
achieved by Crutzen, Molina, and Rowland, as well as others who 
have made crucial contributions, it has been possible to make far-
reaching decisions on regulating the release of gases that destroy 
ozone. A protocol on the protection of the ozone layer was negotiated 
under the auspices of the United Nations and signed in Montreal, 
Canada, in 1987. "Since it takes some time for the ozone-destroying 
gases to reach the ozone layer, we must expect the depletion, not 
only over Antarctica but also over parts of the Northern Hemisphere, 
to worsen for some years to come. Given compliance with the 
[Montreal Protocol], the ozone layer should gradually begin to heal 
after the turn of the century. Yet it will take at least 100 years 
before it has fully recovered."

<i>This figure shows the amount of chlorine and bromine (expressed as the 
effective equivalent chlorine, or EECl) in the lower atmosphere. This quantity 
is a good indicator of the amount that is predicted to be released a few years 
hence in an inorganic form in the lower mid-latitude stratosphere, where it 
can contribute to ozone depletion. Estimates are made on a monthly basis for 
the Northern Hemisphere (open diamonds), Southern Hemisphere (open 
squares), and global mean (closed circles). The EECl is derived by considering 
the changing concentrations of about a dozen gases that can affect the 
stratospheric ozone concentration and developing an index based on their 
ability to catalyze the destruction of ozone relative to the ability of chlorine 
(the units of EECl are in parts per trillion by volume). As a result of controls 
instituted under the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone 
Layer and subsequent agreements and amendments, the stratospheric 
chlorine concentration is expected to start decreasing in the near future, 
allowing the stratospheric ozone concentration to begin what will be a multi-
decadal recovery period. The figure is courtesy of S. Montzka of the NOAA 
Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory in Boulder, CO, and appeared 
in Science, 272, pp. 1318-1322 (1996). </i><p>

<html><head><title>Our Changing Planet FY1997 - Highlights of Recent 
Research on Atmospheric Chemistry</title>

<center><b>Highlights of Recent Research on Atmospheric 
Chemistry</b></center><p>

USGCRP-sponsored research continues to advance understanding of 
the causes, magnitude, and consequences of changes in stratospheric 
ozone, UV radiation, and atmospheric chemistry. The FY96 edition of 
Our Changing Planet included a summary of recent key findings. 
Highlights of more recent findings follow:  <p>
<ul>
<LI>Atmospheric concentrations of ozone-depleting chemicals are starting 
to decrease. Over the past few decades, global atmospheric 
monitoring stations had reported the steady growth in the 
concentrations of CFCs and other ozone-depleting chemicals. Recent 
observations have not only shown a slowdown in growth, but also 
are revealing, for the first time, decreasing concentrations. These 
downward trends are the first observed atmospheric response to the 
international agreements to halt production of these ozone-depleting 
chemicals.
<p>
<LI>Year-to-year changes in the stratospheric ozone layer have been 
explained. Superimposed on the observed overall downward decadal 
trends in the ozone layer are variations over periods of a few years. 
The long-term declines have been associated with the growth in the 
use of ozone-depleting chemicals, such as CFCs, but the shorter term 
changes have been unexplained. Recent theoretical modeling studies 
have shown that these shorter term variations can be explained by 
the augmented ozone depletion caused from the chemistry on 
surfaces of particles resulting from episodic volcanic eruptions, 
thereby providing a more complete picture of ozone layer changes.
<p>
<LI>Soils may be a larger methyl bromide sink than previously thought. 
Because methyl bromide is involved in the destruction of ozone in 
the stratosphere, this finding suggests that management of soils may 
have implications for the stratospheric ozone budget and the amount 
of UV radiation that reaches the Earth's surface.
<p>
<LI>Satellite data have confirmed, on global scales, the expected 
stratospheric abundance's of ozone-depleting chemicals. Surface-level 
stations have long monitored the lower atmospheric growth of 
the ozone-depleting chemicals that are released into the atmosphere 
by human activities. Balloon and airborne measurements have 
tracked the resulting ozone-related chlorine and bromine compounds 
in the stratosphere in particular regions. However, recent satellite 
data have provided the first truly global look at these species and 
have confirmed the picture of the human contributions to the global 
budget of these ozone-related species.
<p>
<LI>Carbon monoxide concentrations were measured from latitudes from 
Alaska to the Antarctic using an instrument mounted in the Space 
Shuttle on two flights in 1994. These measurements demonstrated a 
capability for providing global data sets and measuring seasonal 
variations. The measurements showed the expected higher levels 
near the source regions, mainly in the Northern Hemisphere and near 
areas of biomass burning in the tropics, but were also able to observe 
the much lower concentrations over the Southern Ocean areas that 
are seldom measured. Carbon monoxide affects the rate of 
tropospheric chemical removal of other pollutants that affect the 
concentration of tropospheric ozone, which is both a photochemical 
oxidant and a greenhouse gas.

<hr><br>

<i>Beech trees are currently found throughout much of the eastern United 
States (left panel). This distribution is determined largely by the climate. 
Changes in climate as a result of the increasing concentrations of carbon 
dioxide and other greenhouse gases are expected to change the optimum 
growing range for beech trees, thereby changing their distribution. Predictions 
of future climate conditions from the climate models of the NOAA 
Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) and the NASA Goddard 
Institute for Space Studies (GISS) have been used to estimate the types of 
shifts in optimum growing range that could occur a century hence as a result 
of changes in the concentrations of greenhouse gases alone (thus representing 
an extreme condition). While this warming will likely be delayed somewhat 
as a result of sulfate aerosol injections, the results suggest that the optimum 
growing ranges may shift roughly 300 miles to the north, changing the 
character of forests. The figure is adapted from M.B. Davis and C. Zabinsky, 
Changes in geographical range resulting from greenhouse warming: Effects 
on biodiversity in forests. In: Global Warming and Biological Diversity [R.L. 
Peters and T.E. Lovejoy (eds.)]. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT (1992).

<html><head><title>Our Changing Planet FY1997 - Highlights of Recent 
Research on Land and Ocean Ecosystems</title>

<center><b>Highlights of Recent Research on Land and Ocean 
Ecosystems</b></center><p>

USGCRP-sponsored research continues to advance understanding of 
the causes, magnitude, and consequences of changes in land cover 
and in terrestrial and marine ecosystems. The FY96 edition of Our 
Changing Planet included a summary of recent key findings. 
Highlights of more recent findings follow:
<p>
<ul>
<LI>New understanding has been gained of the contemporary global 
carbon cycle through the measurement and analysis of changes in 
the atmospheric concentration of oxygen and the ratio of 13C&#176; to 
12C&#176;
in atmospheric carbon dioxide. These measurements and analyses 
support the hypothesis that terrestrial ecosystems of the mid-latitudes of the 
Northern Hemisphere have functioned as a significant 
carbon sink (up to about a third of the fossil fuel emissions) in the 
first half of the 1990s. Without this sink, the causes of which are not 
yet understood, the rate of carbon dioxide accumulation in the 
atmosphere would have been even faster.
<p>
<li>Large-scale ecosystem modeling efforts are making important 
progress. The models being developed are prognostic and can be 
used to simulate a range of ecological responses to changes in climate 
and the chemical composition of the atmosphere. Among the 
responses that can start to be considered are time-dependent 
changes in the distribution of terrestrial plant communities across 
the globe as climate changes.
<p>
<LI>Long-term ecosystem-level experiments are now providing evidence 
that biodiversity plays a critical role in the carbon and nutrient 
cycles of terrestrial ecosystems. In addition, regular measurements 
are now being taken that will lead to improved estimates of the 
effects of interannual climate variability on carbon exchange 
between land ecosystems and the atmosphere. This information can 
be used to develop and test process-based ecosystem models that are 
important components of the larger Earth system models. These 
models are critical research tools in global change science and 
assessment, and will benefit greatly from improved representation of 
ecosystem processes.
<p>
<li>New land-cover data for South America, Southeast Asia, and the 
conterminous United States have been released on the World Wide 
Web <a href=http://amazon.unh.edu/pathfinder/> 
http://amazon.unh.edu/pathfinder/ </a>
and 
<a href="http://edcwww.cr.usgs.gov/landdaac/"> 
http://edcwww.cr.usgs.gov/landdaac/</a>. The data were developed 
from Landsat products. The new information for South America and 
Southeast Asia will facilitate better estimates of rates of 
deforestation and of the flux of carbon to the atmosphere associated 
with forest clearing. The land-cover data for the conterminous United 
States, which have a 1-km resolution, are an important information 
base for resource managers working on regional-scale planning.
<p>
<LI>Recent modeling studies have shown that unusual physical conditions 
along the break in the Georges Bank's shelf during the late 1950s and 
1960s can be traced to changes in the strength of the cold Labrador 
Current. The dynamics of planktonic animal populations on the Bank 
are thought to be strongly influenced by biological and physical 
events in the surrounding deep basins in the Gulf of Maine, the 
offshore slope water, and upstream waters on the Scotian Shelf. 
Changes in planktonic populations in turn influence the marine 
resource populations of these ecosystems. Scientists are evaluating 
the impact of such decadal-scale climate-related events on the 
seasonal cycle of heating and cooling that controls water column 
structure, local circulation, and plankton dynamics.
<p>
<LI>Recent studies in the tropical Pacific Ocean indicate that iron, which 
is relatively abundant in waters near land, may be the limiting 
nutrient in determining primary production of marine life in the blue 
waters of the central ocean basins. In a series of field experiments 
involving controlled additions of iron salts to surface waters, 
scientists documented dramatic plankton blooms and concomitant 
draw down of other excess nutrients. These results are encouraging 
studies of factors controlling primary production, carbon cycling, and 
ocean-climate impacts elsewhere in the world ocean.

<LI>National and international standards should be used to the greatest 
extent possible for media and for processing and communication of 
global data sets.<p>
<LI>Data should be provided at the lowest possible cost to global change 
researchers in the interest of full and open access to data. This cost 
should, as a first principle, be no more than the marginal cost of 
filling a specific user request. Agencies should act to streamline 
administrative arrangements for exchanging data among researchers.  <p>
<LI>For those programs in which selected principal investigators have 
initial periods of exclusive data use, data should be made openly 
available as soon as they become widely useful. In each case, the 
funding agency should explicitly define the duration of any 
exclusive-use period.<p>

<p>
<sup>*</sup> The National Institutes of Health devote approximately 
$28M per year to the study of the effects of UV-radiation on health.  
This research is sponsored by the National Cancer Institute, the 
National Eye Institute, the National Institute of Arthritis and 
Musculoskeletol and Skin Diseases, and the National Institute of 
Environmental; Health Sciences (NIEHS). While all of this research 
was included in the compilations for the USGCRP budget in the FY95 
and FY96 editions of <i> Our Changing Planet,</i> for FY 97 only the 
component within NIEHS is included, since it is done primarily as a 
result of concerns about global environmental change.  For this 
reason, the HHS/NIH contribution to the USGCRP budget for FY97 is 
now given as $4M; the entries for previous years have been adjusted 
for comparability.<p>

<b>Related Research. </b>In addition to focused USGCRP research, NIH 
conducts research related to human health and other impacts of 
global environmental change, including toxicity and effects of metals 
and agricultural chemicals; health effects of air pollutants; 
metabolism, bio-transformation, and toxicity of pesticides; 
occupational exposure and health effects of materials used in 
alternative energy production; and infectious diseases, including 
encephalitis, malaria, dengue, lyme disease, and leishmaniasis, whose 
incidence would be affected by climate change.<p>

<b>Mapping of Budget Request to Appropriations Legislation. </b>In 
the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education 
and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill, USGCRP activities are 
funded in the NIH section of Title II - Department of Health and 
Human Services, within the National Institute of Environmental 
Health Sciences account.<p>

<h3><p align=center>Department of Transportation</h3>

<b>Areas of Global Change Research. </b>The Federal Aviation 
Administration (FAA) within the DOT, in conjunction with the 
Atmospheric Effects of Aviation Project of NASA, conducts research 
to develop an improved scientific basis for assessment of the 
environmental impacts of subsonic and supersonic aviation, 
particularly the atmospheric impacts of commercial aircraft cruise 
emissions. This information is needed to determine the effects 
aircraft emissions will have, particularly on stratospheric and 
tropospheric ozone concentrations and on the global climate. FAA

<b>Areas of Global Change Research. </b>NASA research efforts in 
global change involve space-based studies of the Earth as an 
integrated system, including research and satellite programs 
studying atmospheric ozone, ocean surface winds, tropical 
precipitation, and the Earth's upper atmosphere. The space-based 
activity complements ongoing ground-based research programs in 
the observation, understanding, and modeling of radiation, climate 
dynamics, and hydrology; ecosystem dynamics and biogeochemical 
cycles; atmospheric chemistry; solid Earth science; and the 
processing, archival, retrieval, dissemination, and use of global 
change data. The focus is Earth system science, which involves 
interdisciplinary research and coupled modeling. Development of 
algorithms for retrieval of the information content of space-based, 
remotely sensed observations is carried out as part of the flight 
mission.<p>

<b>Areas of Global Change Research. </b>NSF global change research 
programs support research and related activities that advance 
fundamental understanding of dynamic physical, biological, and 
socioeconomic systems, and the interactions among those systems. In 
addition to research on Earth system processes and the consequences 
of changes in those systems, NSF programs facilitate data-acquisition 
and data-management activities necessary for basic research on 
global change, the enhancement of modeling designed to improve 
representations of Earth system interactions, and the advancement of 
advanced analytic methods to facilitate fundamental research. NSF 
also supports fundamental research on the general processes used by

<h3><p align=center>Smithsonian Institution</h3>

<b>Areas of Global Change Research. </b>Within the Smithsonian 
Institution (SI), research conducted at the Smithsonian Astrophysical 
Observatory (SAO), the National Air and Space Museum (NASM), the 
Smithsonian Environmental Research Center (SERC), and the National 
Museum of Natural History (NMNH) concentrates on monitoring 
indicators of natural and anthropogenic environmental change on 
daily to decadal time scales, and on longer term indicators present in 
the historical artifacts and records of the museums as well as in the 
geologic record at field sites. The primary thrust of the Smithsonian's 
work is to improve knowledge of the natural processes involved and 
to continue to provide a long-term repository for present and future 
studies.<p>

Global Change Research Program during FY95.<p>

<b>Related Research. </b>Contributing research of the Smithsonian 
Institution on biological diversity and ecosystem functions falls into 
two broad areas-tropical biological diversity, and ecosystem response 
to fragmentation. Studies of tropical biological diversity are 
performed at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI) and 
the National Museum of Natural History. The Tropical Biological 
Diversity Program (TROBID) concentrates on inventories of 
biodiversity and species distribution in tropical forests, monitoring 
biodiversity through repeated standardized sampling of flora and 
fauna, and identifying the physical and biological processes of growth 
and decline of species.<p>

<b>Mapping of Budget Request to Appropriations Legislation.</b> In 
the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill, Smithsonian 
Institution USGCRP activities are funded in the SI section of Title II - 
Related Agencies, within the Salaries and Expenses account. 
Appropriations Committee reports specify funding for a  Sciences line 
item component of this account, which includes USGCRP programs.<p>

<center><H2>PREFACE 
</H2></center>
<H3>About the National Science and Technology Council 
</H3><P>President Clinton established the National Science and Technology 
Council  (NSTC) by Executive Order on November 23, 1993. This cabinet-level 
council  is the principal means for the President to coordinate science, 
space, 
and  technology policies across the Federal Government. The NSTC acts as a  
"virtual" agency for science and technology to coordinate the diverse parts of

<br>Unfortunately, many closely held businesses are found lacking when it comes to succession plans. The lack of this type of plan is potentially disastrous. In order to protect oneself from the risk of not planning ahead, business owners should enter into buysell agreements. These agreements, when properly financed, can ensure that the family is taken care of and that the business thrives.<P>

<br>Estate planning is often put off by those who view it as too complicated. However, avoiding proper planning can lead to some severe consequences for one's family and heirs. One of the major problems resulting from poor planning is a lack of liquidity. However, with the help of an advisor and some powerful planning techniques, these potential dangers can be averted.<P>

Entrepreneurs and executives, no matter how successful, are
vulnerable to law suits. As such, measures must be taken to protect
their assets. Two of the most effective tools for accomplishing this
task are the corporate entity and irrevocable trusts.  When used
properly, these powerful tools can protect the assets of the
entrepreneur or executive.<br>

Alternative funding is becoming very popular. No longer is
self-insurance available only for the very large
companies. Self-insurance can now be made available to a company with
as few as 20 employees. Self-insurance allows for flexibility as well
as protection. When designed correctly, this type of policy will
attract and retain employees, save money, and protect the company as
well.<P>

The business world has lately been focusing more on the
fundamentals of management as opposed to long-term plans. One of the
most essential of the basics is proper business insurance
coverage. The proper coverage is dependent on the particular growth
stage of the company. Above all else though, insurance should be
flexible and adapt with the company.<P>

<br>Many business owners today, though successful, have not yet considered
what will happen to their business when they retire, become disabled,
or pass away. The buy-sell agreement is a very powerful tool in dealing
with this problem. The contract specifies who can buy the interest in
a company, the price, and the period within which this transaction
must occur. With proper financing, this type of agreement can be
beneficial to both parties.<P>

<a href="/consulting.html"><IMG  WIDTH=47 HEIGHT=20 SRC="consult.gif" alt="consult"></a>
<br>Sudden disability of a business owner or key employee can have a
severe impact on the bottom line of a business. It can result in the
draining of funds as well as operating expertise. However, the use of
a Wage Continuation Plan can help businesses weather these problems.<P>

<br>The importance of a well drafted buy/sell agreement was
convincingly demonstrated in the case of the Estate of Joseph
H. Lauder. This case is extremely important to business owners because
it offers some insight into the way the Courts may value a closely
held business, discount for lack of marketability, and allowance for
partial marital deductions.<P>

<br>Estate planning is a very important process which ensures that
estates are passed down to heirs as they were intended to be, with
minimal state control and taxes. There are a variety of ways to
protect an estate from government control and high taxes, and each
estate plan should be carefully considered to formulate the most
advantageous strategy.<P>

<br>Estate planning is often put off by those who view it as too complicated. However, avoiding proper planning can lead to some severe consequences for one's family and heirs. One of the major problems resulting from poor planning is a lack of liquidity. However, with the help of an advisor and some powerful planning techniques, these potential dangers can be averted.<P>

<br>Estate taxes are voluntary. If an individual chooses not to plan ahead, that individual may be choosing to pay over 50% in estate taxes. One of the most powerful techniques in avoiding these high taxes is through gifting. With the proper use, this transfer of assets will allow family members, as opposed to the government, to inherit an individual's estate.<p>

<br>Raising a special needs child is a responsibility which requires

One out of every three members of the workforce who are now 35 years
old will suffer a long-term disability. The best way to compensate for
a possible future disability is by preparing with disability
insurance. In addition to making up for lost income due to disability,
disability insurance allows individuals to invest and plan correctly,

introduction. It allows insurance for multiple life coverage when only
one death benefit is necessary. First-to-die insurance offers costs
which are 20% - 4O% lower than multiple single life policies. Due to
the savings and practicality of this financial instrument, it is
becoming more widely used in both the business and the home.<P>

<br>Financial planners are constantly attempting to identify ways

options. Although strictly long-term in nature, this form of
investment is appealing, and justifiably so, to many investors.

<br>Due to recent tax law changes and required participation,
qualified plans have become far less attractive. The popular
alternative, SERPs (Supplemental Executive Retirement Plans), has its
downsides as well. The solution to this problem can be found, however,
in an Executive Split Dollar Delayed Roll-Out Plan. This plan has a
number of advantages over the others including substantial retirement
income, security against the failure of the corporation, and complete
cost recovery.

<h1><center><IMG  WIDTH=39 HEIGHT=29 SRC="/icon.gif"> Business Planning: Business Sucession Plan</center></h1>

<h2><center>By <a href="/bios/henry.html">Vaughn W. Henry</a></center></h2>

<hr><P>

A partnership from hell -- that's what it must feel like to suddenly be in business with your best friend's spouse. Worse yet, finding yourself forced to work through his/her attorney, and it could be catastrophic to own a business with the ex-wife's new husband and his attorney. How does this happen? If your succession plans do not include the possibility of death, disability or retirement for the owners of a closely held business, then you are faced with just this scenario. While the Chrysler Corporation can have Lee lacocca step down and not disrupt the company's profitable outlook, not many closely held or family businesses have the same degree of continuity.<P>

When a small business owner-employee steps out of the picture, the surviving partners and surviving spouse usually have differing goals. The business owner usually wants to continue operations and put any profits back into growing the business, while the surviving spouse wants income and minimal risk. The logical solution is for the surviving partner or the business to buy out the deceased owner's interest, but that entails coming up with cash. Where does an owner look for funding to maintain control? There are only four sources of funding to provide value to heirs, and they are cash in the business, sale of assets, borrowed funds and insurance products.<P>

Each of these sources of capital has advantages and disadvantages, so decisions are based on personal needs and economic evaluations.

<ol>
<li>Use cash in the business or personal funds to buy out the surviving spouse. By accumulating after-tax funds on a steady basis, it's possible to set aside adequate capital to purchase those business interests. These sinking funds work well enough if there is adequate time, but the risk is absorbed by the partners if something happens too early and derails the plan. In a 33% tax bracket, one needs to earn $1.50 to have $1 available for this purchase. Also remember that fluids set aside in a corporation may be subject to excess accumulation penalties. Even businesses with significant cash flow may not be able to sustain required payments with a principal player who contributed to the profitable operation out of the picture. Uncertainty and unfavorable tax leveraging are the major disadvantage of this method.<P>
<li>Assets sold under pressure rarely bring more than discounted garage sale prices. As long as they are not the major income producing assets of the business, maybe you can do without them. However, most nonessential assets will not bring their full market value, so the best assets must be offered for sale instead. Business liquidators report that a 40% loss in value is typical, so that option would appear to be undesirable.<P>
<li>If borrowing credit is still intact after the loss of a major "rainmaker" in the business, maybe a lending institution will loan the survivor the funds. Of course, the money needs to be repaid with interest using after-tax dollars. Even if the heirs finance an installment sale, the business will eventually have to purchase itself more than once. In this case, the surviving heirs must assume the risk that the business will continue to be profitable enough to provide a steady source of income with a restructured management team.<P>
<li>Properly structured insurance products within a buy-sell agreement have the potential to provide necessary tax-free cash when the event (death, disability or retirement) that triggers the need for funding exists. There are a number of strategies available to purchase these special insurance contracts with tax advantaged premium payments. Some of today's most popular discretionary perks now include using life insurance products in creative ways to pay for personal needs with corporate dollars. Recent changes in tax laws now make these discretionary programs more appealing, making them one of the few tools available that favor the small business owner.
</ol>

Buy-sell agreements form much of the basis for continuity in business operations, whether it be for sole proprietors, partners or corporations. A welldrafted agreement ensures the family that the business will be either retained or disposed of fairly. The contract also establishes an upper limit for the IRS as a market value for estate tax purposes. If there is a closely held business interest in your estate, it would be a good idea to sit down with your estate planning team and explore the various options to preserve value and control. Good planning can reduce uncertainty, expenses, tax liabilities and improve both the clients' and heirs' income potential.<P>

<h2><IMG  WIDTH=39 HEIGHT=29 SRC="/icon.gif"> <i>Executive Summary</i></h2>
<h2>Business Planning: Business Sucession Plan</h2>

<h3>By <a href="/bios/henry.html">Vaughn W. Henry</a></h3>

A succession plan is crucial to the continuing existence of any business. Frequently, though, small businesses are found lacking when a business owner passes away. Many times, the business ends up being run by the ex-partner along with the exspouse. Considering the two different goals each has; the partner wants to improve and grow the business, while the ex-spouse is looking for security; this is not a promising situation. The best way to deal with this situation is for the surviving partner to buy out the deceased partner's interest. The problem next becomes how to raise the necessary capital to carry this out. There are four potential sources of funding: cash in the business, sale of assets, borrowed funds, and insurance products. Each source has its own advantages and disadvantages.<P>

It is possible to accumulate enough after tax funds within the company to be able to afford to buy out the deceased partner's interest. However, although this works fine if their is sufficient time to save the necessary funds, the partner is assuming the risk of something occurring before the funds are accumulated. Additionally, excess accumulation penalties may be charged on cash left to accumulate within the business.<P>

Unfortunately, assets sold under pressure rarely bring a fair price. Liquidators report that a 40% loss in value is typical, making this option very undesirable.<P>

Credit, too, poses a risk. Assuming that borrowing capacity is still intact after the loss of a partner, it may be difficult to pay back the loan. Even if the heirs finance an installment sale, there is no guarantee that the company will remain profitable enough to purchase itself, with interest.<P>

Within a buy-sell agreement, properly structured insurance products have the potential to provide the necessary tax-free cash when the situation that triggers the need for funding exists. There are a number of different strategies to purchase these types of instruments with tax advantaged premium payments.<P>

Buy-sell agreements offer advantages for all types of businesses. The agreement ensures the family that the business will be either retained or disposed of fairly. Additionally, the contract offers several tax advantages. Any individual with a closely held business in their estate would be well advised to explore the various options open to them to preserve value and control.<P>

<h1><center><IMG  WIDTH=39 HEIGHT=29 SRC="/icon.gif"> Estate Planning: Estate Planning Goals</center></h1>

<h2><center>By <a href="/bios/henry.html">Vaughn W. Henry</a></center></h2>

<hr><P>

Most people put off estate planning because they do not want to make unpleasant decisions or errors. They view the process as too complicated and so they do nothing. Since the government has already established a default blueprint, why go through the effort? If they want what is best for the family, then these matters are best handled while they have the opportunity to control the process and enforce their wishes. Their goals should include:

<ul type=disc>
<li>Resolving guardianship issues for minor children or, more frequently seen today, continuing the care of elderly and dependent parents
<li>Establishing priorities
<li>Gathering legal, personal, tax and financial documents in an organized fashion and making them easily available when needed
<li>Improving management options of the estate in the event of your absence
<li>Avoiding family conflict and future ill-will
<li>Minimizing expense, delay and publicity of the probate process
<li>Stipulating who will operate the business and handle
family affairs during a disability or after death 
<li>Eliminating unnecessary income and estate taxes 
<li>Providing adequate liquidity to pay final expenses and taxes
<li>Passing assets to heirs as planned, under conditions that best that meet family needs and their abilities to effectively manage an inheritance
</ul>

Typically the biggest shortcoming is providing for estate liquidity. All too often, a lot of cash is needed to take care of repaying debts, the funeral and expenses associated with any final illness. In addition to these obligations, the survivor may have income needs and ongoing family expenses that may include education and relocation. If there are business interests or significant assets involved, there may also be federal and state estate taxes to pay. Even if there are not estate transfer taxes, there are nearly always property taxes, payroll taxes or federal and state income tax payments due.<P>

Specific bequests to heirs or charities may also generate a need for extra liquidity. If there is an ongoing business, it must be maintained or sold. In either case, capital will be required to keep the business or farm operating until the heirs or new owners can decide how to best continue it. Further drains on estate resources are the funds needed for legal, tax, accounting and appraisal fees associated with the probate or estate settlement process. The national average for these clearance costs has been variously estimated at 6 to 7.2 percent of the gross estate. Whatever the number, for many families this is a significant expense and liquid assets should be available to offset those costs as well.<P>

As long as the majority of estates lack sufficient liquidity to pay their settlement costs, solutions are limited. Marketable assets sold under pressure are usually the most valuable; but, with a little forethought, this tragedy could be avoided. Unhappily, most administrators wind up selling illiquid assets at a steep discount to pay expenses. As a result, the family loses both the asset and the income it should have generated. Good planning can provide alternatives to the forced sale of assets under unfavorable conditions. However, time is a big factor in settling many estates. Any transfer tax is due in just nine months and is based on the fair market value at death. By the time appraisals are done and bills are paid, tax time creeps up and the executor starts looking for quick sales to pay this penalty for success.<P>

Failing to create an estate plan and revising it as family and economic conditions change set the estate up for problems. Besides the liquidity issues, failing to use approved tax saving strategies and improperly owning and coordinating life insurance are common mistakes. Flexible risk management should have your asset portfolio include insurance and emergency savings as well as investments. Other planning questions to answer deal with family business interests. Can it be or should it be sold? Is there a buyer? How can the asset be converted quickly for cash? Each family needs to resolve these issues before they are forced into bad decisions.<P>

As with any estate planning activities, a competent and experienced team of advisors should be consulted. Since no one has a comer on good advice, it pays to have your team coordinate their efforts to present an integrated plan. For those with a desire to check on their potential for tax, a 3 1/2" or 5 1/4" MS-DOS computerized estate and gift tax calculator is available free of charge. Contact the author in care of the I.A.F.P. to have one mailed to you.<P>

If you are an entrepreneur or a executive, chances are very good
that you will be sued some time in your life. We in America are living
in a highly litigious society. Against the threat of these lawsuits,
an entrepreneur or executive must undertake asset protection
techniques to anticipate and reduce the likelihood of loss of assets
as a result of lawsuits against the entrepreneur or executive. The
entrepreneur or executive must insulate his or her assets from
judgments in the event of a successful lawsuit against the
entrepreneur or executive.<P>

<b>I. Who Really Owns Your Property?</b><P>

We have all heard stories about how a hard-working entrepreneur or
executive, who is financially successful, loses everything as a
result of one lawsuit. Entrepreneurs or executives may be unable to
afford sufficient liability insurance coverage. It is imperative that
the entrepreneur or executive consult a lawyer familiar with asset
protection.<P>

You hold your property for your creditors. This is because your
creditors can go after all of your assets that are not exempt from
levy and execution. Therefore, due to the high vulnerability of
entrepreneurs and executives to lawsuits over which they may have
little or no control, most entrepreneurs and executives who have
consulted with a lawyer do not own personally most of their property.<P>

It is important that the entrepreneur or executive distinguish
between assets owned solely by the entrepreneur or executive and
assets owned solely by the spouse of the entrepreneur or executive,
as well as property owned jointly between the spouses. A spouse's
separate property belongs to that spouse and to no one else. This
includes property given to that spouse by other people as well as
property given by his or her spouse "for love and other
consideration," so long as the transfer did not run afoul of the rules
prohibiting fraudulent transfers to defraud creditors. <a
href="#foot1">(1)</a><P>

As applied to a married couple, this rule offers certain asset
protection potential:<P>

<blockquote>

1) All the assets of a spouse owned prior to the marriage, plus the
money that that spouse has saved from that spouse's own earnings
during the marriage generally are insulated from the other spouse's
creditors;<P>

2) Property that a donor spouse has given to the donee spouse is
vulnerable to the creditors of the donee spouse, but generally it is
safe from the creditors of the donor spouse so long as the initial
transfer was not made by the donor spouse so as to defraud his or her
creditors.<P>

</blockquote>

<b>II. Partnership: A Lurking Timebomb?</b><P>

A partnership is a common form of business ownership. A partnership is
"an association of two or more persons to carry on as co-owners a
business for profit,"<a href="#foot2">(2)</a> provided that the
association is not a corporation or some other business entity.<P>

Partnerships offer several advantages denied other forms of
business. Generally they can operate informally, and there are no
filing fees or minimum capital requirements for partners.
Partnerships need not issue shares, hold meetings, keep minutes or
conduct elections.<P>

Creditors of a partner generally cannot invade the partnership for
firm assets, however, a creditor does have recourse (i.e., access to)
an entrepreneur or executive's interest in a partnership.<P>

The creditor must first obtain a judgment against the entrepreneur or
executive. The creditor would then have to apply to a court to
charge the entrepreneur or executive's interest in the partnership
with the entrepreneur or executive's debt. The court order cannot
invade the partnership in order to get at its assets. Instead, the
court order can only apply payments that the partnership would
otherwise have made to the entrepreneur or executive.<a
href="#foot3">(3)</a> Most businesses that conduct business as
partnerships do so as general partnerships. This is to be contrasted
with limited partnerships, which offer greater asset protection to
limited partners.<P>

As a partner, however, an entrepreneur or executive can still lose
everything. In most instances, each partner is jointly and severally
liable for all partnership debts and obligations. This means that an
entrepreneur or executive can be a 25% partner, and be held
responsible for 100% of the liability!<a href="#foot4">(4)</a> A
partner can be held liable for debts that the partner was unaware of
because they were incurred by the other partner(s) and/or the
partnership's employees. Thus, in a partnership, there is so-called
"cross-liability" among partners.<P>

<b>III. Corporation: A Diminishing Shield?</b><P>

There are a number of reasons to incorporate.  Every entrepreneur or
executive must discuss with his or her lawyer the advantages and
disadvantages of incorporating, from an asset protection perspective,
as well as for other reasons. Among the most common reasons to
incorporate are the following:<P>

<blockquote>

1) If the business has employees, even part-time employees, it makes
sense to incorporate. As a sole proprietor the entrepreneur or
executive is personally responsible and liable for the negligence
and most other wrongdoing of any employees.<P>

2) If an entrepreneur or executive conducts business with one or
more partners, it makes sense to incorporate. As a partner, an
entrepreneur or executive can be held personally liable for
virtually all acts and misdeeds of the entrepreneur or executive's
partner(s), with nearly unlimited liability exposure.<P>

3) If the entrepreneur or executive participates in joint ventures
with others, it is quite likely that the entrepreneur or executive
could be held personally liable for all the debts and obligations of
the joint venture; and it makes sense to incorporate.<P>

4) If the entrepreneur or executive is involved in a potentially
hazardous business or situation for which insurance coverage is
insufficient and/or prohibitively expensive, it makes sense to
incorporate. Examples include executives engaged in the hazardous
waste advisory and consulting business.<P>

5)If the entrepreneur or executive desires to protect his or her
personal assets in the event the business is unsuccessful, it makes
sense to incorporate.<P>

6) An entrepreneur or executive will want to protect his or her
business in the event of his or her personal bankruptcy. For reasons
unconnected to the business, the entrepreneur or executive may
become so deeply indebted to personal creditors that he or she may be
forced to file for personal bankruptcy. Through proper planning as to
the ownership of the stock, perhaps by family members, it is possible
to protect a successful business from the entrepreneur or
executive's personal bankruptcy.<P>

7) There are some income tax advantages available to
shareholder-employees of regular corporations. These advantages mostly
involve fringe benefits, such as life insurance, health insurance,
"cafeteria plans," company cars, tax deductible trips and expense
accounts.  Often these fringe benefits are not available on a tax-free
basis to 2% or more stockholders of S corporations.  Nevertheless, in
consultation with a tax lawyer, it may be determined that it is
desirable for a number of other tax reasons for the entrepreneur or
executive to have his or her corporation elect S corporation
treatment.<P>

8) The entrepreneur or executive may want sophisticated estate
planning.  Through proper estate planning, it is possible to address
issues such as planning for Medicaid, avoiding probate, and reducing
estate taxes.<P>

</blockquote>

Limited liability is generally considered to be the most important
reason to incorporate. The corporation is one of the best entities to
use to shield personal assets. The corporation will shield an
entrepreneur or executive's personal assets in a variety of
different types of situations. A corporation will protect the business
owner from vicarious liability resulting from the acts of the owner's
employees. Generally, if a business has any employees it is preferable
to incorporate.<P>

As a sole proprietor or general partner of a partnership, the
entrepreneur or executive is personally liable on all contracts of
the business. If the entrepreneur or executive incorporated,
generally the corporation, and not the entrepreneur or executive,
is the contracting party. As such, the corporation is the party
responsible. The corporation may protect the entrepreneur or
executive from liability resulting from ownership of dangerous
assets.  This could include trucks, heavy equipment and the like. It
could also include production machinery and equipment.  The
corporation, rather than the entrepreneur or executive personally,
generally would be liable.<P>

A corporation generally protects the entrepreneur or executive from
liability resulting from dangerous activities. As discussed in greater
detail below, so long as the entrepreneur or executive were not
personally negligent himself or herself, use of a corporation should
protect the business owners personal assets from a lawsuit arising
from dangerous activities.<P>

A corporation generally can protect an entrepreneur or executive
from liability resulting from the negligence or other wrongdoing of
"the corporation." Even where the entrepreneur or executive is the
driving force behind the corporation, generally the entrepreneur or
executive is not personally liable for the acts of corporate
employees, other than his own wrongful acts.<P>

There are limitations on the use of corporations as an asset
protection vehicle.<P>

A corporation will protect the entrepreneur or executive only if
the corporation is properly organized and the business is truly
conducted as a corporation with full attention to proper corporate
details.  It is very prudent to hire and involve a skilled business
lawyer to be sure that all corporate formalities have been adhered to.<P>

Creditors of another stockholder can obtain ownership of that
stockholder's stock, and they may be able to cause the liquidation of
the corporation, which may result in a great loss to all stockholders.<P>

A corporation will not protect the entrepreneur or stockholder in all
business situations.  If the entrepreneur or executive personally
guarantees a corporate debt, obviously the entrepreneur or
executive is personally responsible for that debt. A corporation
will not protect the entrepreneur or executive from liability for
his or her own negligence or wrongdoing.  All too many people fail to
understand this legal concept.<P>

When active stockholders control the corporation and in some manner
misuse the corporate form so that the separate identities of the
corporation and the stockholders effectively no longer exist, and it
would be unfair to shield such stockholders from personal liability,
then the law may disregard the separate legal existence of the
corporation. This is called "piercing the corporate veil."<P>

There is a growing trend in our legal system for courts to "pierce the
corporate veil" in order to hold the business owner personally
responsible for corporate debts and other obligations.<P>

The entrepreneur or executive must follow a number of rules to
avoid such a drastic result.  The business must be actually
transferred into the legal name of the corporation. Corporate
formalities must be followed at all times and should be overseen by an
involved business lawyer. The corporation must be adequately
capitalized. The entrepreneur or executive must always treat the
corporation as an entity that is completely separate and distinct from
the personal affairs of the entrepreneur or executive.<P>

In a situation in which a court will "pierce the corporate veil," it
must be kept in mind that the law is imposing liability on the persons
who control the corporation and in some manner misuse the corporate
form. This is to be distinguished from a situation imposing personal
liability on a person for active participation in the underlying tort
or contract violation which gave rise to the corporate liability.<a
href="#foot5">(5)</a> An officer, director or stockholder is always
personally liable for his or her own wrongdoings.<a
href="#foot6">(6)</a><P>

The law realizes that it is normally important to preserve the concept
of limited liability for stockholders.  Therefore, a corporate entity
is not lightly disregarded. The plaintiff, as the party seeking to
hold the corporate stockholders, officers or directors personally
liable, has the burden of proof in showing good reason to "pierce the
corporate veil."<P>

Courts often draw a distinction between tort cases and contract cases
in "piercing the corporate veil." In a contract case, the contracting
party enjoyed the element of choice.  In the absence of fraud or
misrepresentation, a creditor may have accepted the risk of limited
liability in dealing with a corporation. Often when a creditor in a
contact case attempts to "pierce the corporate veil," a court will
find that the creditor could have protected itself by other means,
such as obtaining personal guarantees from the stockholders, or filing
liens on the property it sold to the corporation.<P>

In a tort case, which is a non-criminal wrongdoing such as negligence,
by contrast, the creditor usually has not voluntarily chosen to deal
with the limited liability of a corporation. As to involuntary
creditors, factors relating to financial liability of the corporation,
including under-capitalization and a possible pattern of diversion of
assets from the corporation to stockholders, directors or officers,
are normally required in order to hold a person personally liable.<P>

Courts often list the factors that they consider significant in
determining who should bear the risk of loss based on the equities of
the particular case.  Usually, no single factor is determinative in
itself.  Generally, the following four factors are commonly regarded
significant in determining whether or not to "pierce the corporate
veil:"<P>

<blockquote>

1) Under-capitalization is normally considered one of the most
important factors, particularly in the situation of a "one-person" or
closely-held corporation. Under-capitalization is most important in
tort cases, due to the unfairness in permitting an inadequately
capitalized corporation engaged in a risky business to shift the risk
of loss to innocent members of the general public.<P>

2) The law frowns upon diverting corporate assets or personally using
corporate assets.  The entrepreneur or executive must always
remember that his or her corporation is an entirely separate
entity.<P>

3) Failing to observe corporate formalities can be combined with other
criteria to show that the corporation should be ignored, in part,
because the stockholder, officer or director himself or herself
essentially ignored the existence of the corporation. On this point,
retention of a competent corporate lawyer can assure compliance with a
lengthy list of required corporate actions.<P>

4) Finally, misrepresentation by a stockholder or other control person
can result in personal liability.<P>

</blockquote>

As an officer or director of a corporation, an entrepreneur or
executive is generally not liable for the corporation's torts or
wrongdoings simply by virtue of holding such positions. However,
authorizing improper dividends or disbursements of corporate funds can
cause personal liability to a director, and officers can be liable for
nonpayment of payroll withholding and sales taxes. Further, officer,
director or stockholder status does not insulate the entrepreneur or
executive from individual liability for corporate torts or wrongful
acts in which the entrepreneur or executive actively participates.<P>

<b>IV. Use of Co-Ownership of Property or Irrevocable Trust May Protect
Personal Assets</b><P>

Holding title to property with another person through various joint
and concurrent ownership arrangements and use of the Massachusetts
homestead exemption can provide some degree of protection to the
entrepreneur or executive.  Other states have similar homestead
provisions, but the amount varies from state to state.  Often the most
important asset which an entrepreneur or executive will want to
protect is the personal residence.<P>

For many married entrepreneurs and executives, it is very likely that
holding title to their personal residence in a relatively recently
created "tenancy by the entirety" will offer the most protection
against creditors of the entrepreneur or executive. This type of
tenancy protection is only available for married couples who created
or took title to their residence as "tenants by the entirety since
1980. A "tenancy by the entirety" created by married couples before
1980 does not protect all of their equity in their residence and
should be examined by a business lawyer. Similar to a joint tenancy, a
"tenancy by the entirety" automatically carries with it rights of
survivorship in the property for the surviving spouse. According to the current
statute governing "tenancies by the entirety" in Massachusetts and
most other states, the creditor of one spouse cannot seize the other
spouse's interest as a "tenant by the entirety for the payment of
debts where the other spouse is not liable on the debt and the
property involved is the principal residence of the non-debtor
spouse.<a href="#foot7">(7)</a> An attachment may be placed on the
principal residence by a creditor of the debtor spouse which will
place a cloud on the title and will satisfy the creditor if the
non-debtor spouse predeceases the debtor spouse, in the event of a
divorce or if the couple wishes to sell the residence.<P>

Often entrepreneurs and executives are unaware of the possible limited
protection afforded married and single individuals by homestead
laws. To take advantage of this limited protection, the entrepreneur or
executive (and spouse) would declare a "homestead estate" by filing an
instrument at the County Recorder of Deeds office where the residence
is located. The effect of declaring a "homestead estate" is that it
may protect $100,000 in equity in the residence for the entrepreneur
or executive. Generally, the "homestead estate" will be free from
attachment by creditors. An often overlooked feature of the homestead
exemption is that a "homestead estate" of $200,000 in equity may be
acquired if the owner is over the age of 62.<P>

Many planning techniques commonly used in traditional estate planning
may also be available to protect an entrepreneur or executive's
assets from the claims of his or her creditors. In the best of worlds,
creditor protection should only be a byproduct of a total estate
plan. Often this is not the case. The most effective asset protection
plan should be implemented as part of the estate plan before the
entrepreneur or executive encounters financial difficulties.<P>

Certain types of trusts can be a very suitable asset protection
vehicle. Used properly, these trusts can protect an individual's
personal assets against lawsuits, creditors and bankruptcy, as well as
other undesirable effects.  A trust exists when the entrepreneur or
executive enters into a written agreement with a trustee under the
terms of which the entrepreneur or executive transfers assets to
the trustee and the trustee manages those assets and pays the income
and/or principal to the beneficiaries in accordance with the terms of
the trust instrument.<P>

There are two kinds of trusts: revocable and irrevocable. In a
revocable trust, the entrepreneur or executive reserves the right
to alter, amend, or terminate the trust at his or her complete
discretion. A revocable trust allows a person to take the property
back. Revocable trusts are used mostly to avoid probate.  Most
importantly, revocable trusts, do not protect assets from the
entrepreneur or executive's creditors because anything that the
entrepreneur or executive can obtain, his or her creditors can also
obtain.<a href="#foot8">(8)</a><P>

Irrevocable trusts are the cornerstone of sophisticated estate plans
for wealthy individuals and can also provide asset
protection. Irrevocable trusts can provide tax benefits and satisfy
other goals of the entrepreneur or executive. Every entrepreneur or
executive must understand that there are advantages and
disadvantages involved in establishing an irrevocable trust. The fact
that the trust is "irrevocable" requires the entrepreneur or
executive to give serious consideration before entering into this
type of arrangement.<P>

In order to place assets beyond his or her possession and control, the
entrepreneur or executive must understand that if he or she
transfers assets to an irrevocable trust, the entrepreneur or
executive cannot withdraw the assets from the trust and cannot
change the terms of the written trust agreement.  To achieve maximum
protection from creditors' claims, the entrepreneur or executive
must not retain even a discretionary interest in the trust (i.e., the
entrepreneur or executive must not be a potential beneficiary of
the trust).<P>

If the entrepreneur or executive relinquishes control over an
asset, and makes a completed gift in respect to the assets, a tax
attorney must assess whether the entrepreneur or executive has made
a taxable gift. Generally, the entrepreneur or executive can
transfer annually to the trust $10,000 ($20,000 for married couples)
times the number of trust beneficiaries and have the gifts qualify for
the annual gift tax exclusion. If the gift does not qualify for the
annual exclusion or exceeds the annual exclusion, a taxable gift will
have been made and a gift tax return (I.R.S. Form 709) must be filed
reporting such gift.<P>

As discussed previously, Massachusetts and most other states have
adopted the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act.<a href="#foot9">(9)</a>
The purpose behind this law is to prevent transfers of property to
circumvent and defraud a debtor's creditors. The most important
provisions of the fraudulent conveyance law apply to transfers which
make the entrepreneur or executive insolvent,<a
href="#foot10">(10)</a> and transfers made with the intent to hinder,
delay or defraud present or future creditors.<a
href="#foot11">(11)</a><P>

Transfers by an entrepreneur or executive to an irrevocable trust of
which the entrepreneur or executive is not a beneficiary and over
which the entrepreneur or executive retains no powers of control
generally will be insulated from claims of creditors of the
entrepreneur or executive, so long as the transfer does not constitute
a fraudulent conveyance.  If the trust agreement contains a
"spendthrift" provision, the trust property should also be protected
from claims of the beneficiary's creditors. Massachusetts and most
other states recognize "spendthrift" provisions.<a
href="#foot12">(12)</a><P>

It is possible for an entrepreneur or executive to create a foreign
or offshore trust to achieve his or her asset protection
objectives. One should proceed very carefully when contemplating use
of foreign or offshore trusts - they are complicated, potentially risky,
and generally very expensive. Executive foreign trustees often
impose their own requirements as to the form of the trust. A typical
form of offshore trust would resemble an irrevocable domestic trust,
discussed above, except that the trust property would be physically
located and managed offshore. The same gift tax consequences would
have to be analyzed.<P>

Some jurisdictions such as the Cayman Islands have fraudulent
conveyance laws that are relatively favorable to debtors. Typically,
the offshore trust offers the most protection for an entrepreneur or
executive looking to maximize asset protection. A very aggressive
asset protection plan would have a foreign trust company as trustee
and hold as the sole asset of the trust 99% of the limited partnership
interests (equity) in a U.S. limited partnership.  The entrepreneur or
executive would be the general partner and own 1% (of the equity)
of the limited partnership.<P>

Use of an offshore trust might create serious roadblocks for
creditors. For example, the offshore jurisdiction may not enforce
judgments of U.S. courts and the creditors might have to prove their
claim to trust assets under the law in the offshore jurisdiction. The
offshore jurisdiction might have a relatively short statute of
limitations period in its fraudulent conveyance statute. Many
individuals will be unwilling to pay the expenses associated with an
offshore trust and relinquish control over large amounts of equity in
the U.S. to a foreign trust company with whom they have little, if
any, familiarity.  Moreover, repatriating or returning the assets to
the U.S. may be difficult and may require an unduly long period of
time before the person has liquidity in the U.S.<P>

<b>V. SUMMARY</b><P>

If you are an entrepreneur or executive in a licensed profession,
it probably makes sense to incorporate. Incorporation will not
insulate the professional from the professional's malpractice
liability. It should, however, protect the entrepreneur or
executive against other forms of liability, including vicarious
liability for many acts of employees.<P>

An irrevocable trust is an excellent asset protection tool. The trust
can be designed to suit the entrepreneur or executive's family
needs and desires. It can be as flexible as possible. By using an
independent trustee, an irrevocable trust can reduce estate taxes by
removing assets from an individual's gross estate.<P>

<html><head><title>Asset Protection for the Entrepreneur or
Executive (Summary)</title></head><body>

<h2><img src="/icon.gif"> <i>Executive Summary</i></h2>
<h2>Asset Protection for the Entrepreneur or Executive</h2>

<h3>By Melvin A. Warshaw, Esq.</h3>

In a society as litigious as ours, entrepreneurs and executives
must constantly be concerned with protecting their assets against
losses resulting from law suits. Two of the most popular and most
effective tools for asset protection are the corporation and the
trust.<P>

There are a number of reasons why an entrepreneur or executive
would choose to incorporate. Generally, limited liability is
considered to be the most important reason to
incorporate. Additionally, there are several tax advantages associated
with incorporation. However, there has been a growing trend towards
"piercing the veil." This refers to the process of stripping away the
protection that corporations offer their stockholders. This usually
occurs when the corporate form has been misused in some way so that
the separate identities of the corporate entity and shareholders no
longer exist. In order to prevent this from occurring, the
entrepreneur or executive must abide by certain corporate
formalities and must always treat the corporations as a separate and
distinct entity. The courts do, however, understand the need for
limited liability for stockholders, and, as such, they will not
dismiss it without sufficient proof of a valid reason. It must be
said, though, that a corporation cannot protect the entrepreneur or
executive from being held accountable for their own negligence or
wrongdoing.<P>

Another asset protection vehicle which might be suitable for the
entrepreneur or executive is the trust. Used properly, a trust can
guard assets against lawsuits, creditors and bankruptcy, as well as
other undesirable effects. There are two major categories of trusts:
revocable and irrevocable. Revocable trusts allow the entrepreneur or
executive to alter, amend, or terminate the trust at their
discretion. Thus, revocable trusts are a poor choice for asset
protection since whatever can be obtained by the entrepreneur or
executive can be obtained by their creditors. The irrevocable
trust, on the other hand, provides asset protection, tax benefits, and
possibly other benefits as well. In order to place assets beyond the
reach of creditors, the entrepreneur or executive must also place
the assets beyond their own reach. Once an irrevocable trust has been
established, the assets cannot be withdrawn, nor can the terms be
altered. To achieve maximum protection, the entrepreneur or
executive must divest themselves of all interest in the trust.<P>

The threat of lawsuits and other financial disasters loom over all
entrepreneurs and executives. However, with the proper use of the
corporate entity and irrevocable trusts, assets can be protected
against these factors.<P>

For Big Companies</title></head><body>

<h1><center><IMG  WIDTH=39 HEIGHT=29 SRC="/icon.gif"> Business Planning: Alternative Funding, Not Just For Big Companies</center></h1>

<h2><center>By <a href="/FNEA.html#sheehan">Daniel D. Sheehan</a>, CFP</center></h2>

<hr><P>

You don't have to be a large employer to reap the rewards of
Alternative Funding. Today, companies with as few as twenty employees
can take advantage of this type of <i>self insurance program.</i><P>

In fact, self-insurance and stop-loss protection are becoming the
rule, rather than the exception for more and more small
firms. Together, employers, employees and insurers are playing an
active (instead of reactive) role in the fight against rampid health
costs.<P>

The main reason? <i>Cost control.</i><P>

Unlike conventional insurance, where premiums are prepaid for future
claims that are based on worst case scenarios, most self funding
programs allow you to hold the premium money, and then <i>pay for your
claims as they occur.</i> Which gives you greater control over financing,
cost, benefit design and risk.<P>

Depending on your insurer's program, you may enjoy several
self-insurance benefits. Some of the most attractive advantages are
direct and immediate benefits from a favorable claims experience,
money savings when claims are limited and total below what a
traditional premium would have been, liability protection through
stop-loss arrangements, substantial reductions or limitations on
premium taxes... the list goes on and on.<P>

And, when it comes to employee incentives, a self-insured company, may
be in a <i>stronger position to proclaim an advantage </i> over a
traditionally insured firm. For example, a self-insured employer could
position itself to share any realized profits and gains with employees
by contributing a specific percentage to the employee's 401(k) or
profit-sharing plan. This makes for a very attractive win/win
experience.<P>

One other benefit is the ability to <i>avoid expensive state-mandated
benefits. </i> Just how can you do this? Simply make sure your carrier
offers an Administrative Services Only (A SO) option.<P>

<i>But not all ASOs are alike.</i><P>

The best plans provide services that extend far beyond simple claims
processing and administration. When shopping for an ASO, look for one
that includes Claims Administration, Banking Arrangements,
Administrative Services, Information/Consulting and Stop-Loss
Coverage.<P>

Also, look around for an ASO that focuses on simplification. For
example, you should receive an administrative guide and contract that
spells out each party's responsibilities. Another feature you may want
is to have your plan documents written and printed by your
administrator.<P>

Your administrator should provide your employees with enrollment
materials and identification cards. A good insurer will also give you
annual cost projections, work-force composition and inflation
trends.<P>

With this information at hand, <i>you can prepare your benefits
budgets in advance. </i> Your insurer can also show you ways to save
dollars by advising you of the latest economic developments affecting
your plan. In addition, many give a recommendation as to the amount of
funds to set aside for reserves.<P>

One of the <i>most effective deterrents against skyrocketing health
care costs, </i> is to combine your ASO with a managed health program,
such as an HMO or PPO. At times, this strategy has produced
spectacular double-digit savings for employers.<P>

However, to protect you against overutilization and/or a catastrophic
claim, ASOs include comprehensive stop-loss arrangements. The best are
<i>flexible </i> enough to meet individual company needs, provide
specific, aggregate and terminal stop-loss protection, and thirdly,
integrate protection with banking and cash flow, so you don't
overextend yourself, and fund beyond your stop-loss levels.<P>

With all these glowing benefits, you may be wondering, "Is there a
catch?" When a company terminates an ASO provider, it is hit with
termination fees to cover yet unsubmitted future claims. The good news
is that after a certain timeframe, if the termination fee wasn't fully
depleted by claims, you -- the employer -- <i>receive a full
refund. </i><P>

Clearly, the advantages of self-insurance outweigh the
negatives. Remember, the big benefits to you are lower premium taxes,
smaller administrative expenses and exemption from having to provide
costly state-mandated benefits. Plus, you increase your cash flows by
keeping premiums where they belong. <i>In your pocket.</i><P>

Self-insurance makes for a compelling argument. All of us want greater
control of our health benefit costs. And one of the best ways to
obtain that control is self-funding. Especially if your goal is to
minimize costs and maximize benefits.<P>

And that's good news for everyone. Because when a firm's group medical costs are down, and cash flows are up, everybody comes out a <i>winner!</i><P>

<h2><IMG  WIDTH=39 HEIGHT=29 SRC="/icon.gif"> <i>Executive Summary</i></h2>
<h2>Business Planning: Alternative Funding, Not Just For Big Companies</h2>

<h3>By <a href="/FNEA.html#sheehan">Daniel D. Sheehan</a>, CFP</h3>

It is no longer necessary to be a large employer in order to enjoy the
benefits of Alternative Funding. In fact, more and more small
companies are utilizing self-insurance and stop-loss protection in an
effort to keep costs down.<P>

Unlike traditional insurance, self funding programs allow the company
to hold the premium money, and then pay for its claims as they
occur. Employer's can also use this type of plan as an incentive for
employees. This could be accomplished through a profit sharing plan
involving the realized gains and profit from the policy. Another
benefit of this type of insurance is the ability to avoid expensive
state-mandated benefits. This can be done if the carrier offers ASO,
or Administrative Services Only option.<P>

Many firms offer services that extend far beyond claims processing and
administration. It is important, when looking for an ASO, to look for
factors such as claims administration, banking arrangements,
administrative services, information/ consulting, and stop-loss
coverage. This stop-loss coverage is essential, and companies should
make sure that not only is it flexible, but suited exactly to their
needs. A very effective deterrent against high health care costs is to
combine an ASO with a managed health care program, such as an HMO or
PPO.<P>

There is however, a negative side to ASOs. For instance, when a
company terminates their ASO provider, it is hit with termination fees
to cover any yet unsubmitted future claims. However, after a certain
time frame, whatever is left of the fee after all claims have been
settled, will be refunded.<P>

Self-insurance makes a very strong argument for itself. It allows
company's greater control, yet still affords them the protection of an
insurance plan. All things considered, it has far more benefits than
conventional plans.<P>

<h1><center><IMG  WIDTH=39 HEIGHT=29 SRC="/icon.gif"> Back-to-Basics Focus Includes
Business Insurance Fundamentals</center></h1>

<h2><center>By <a href="/FNEA.html#sheehan">Daniel D. Sheehan</a>, CFP</center></h2>

<hr><P>

<b>Back-to-basics focus Includes business insurance fundamentals</b><P>

If you've ever worried that, amid the day-to-day skirmishes for new
customers, better market share, and more profit, you neglected to
formulate your company's "mission" much less an insightful,
forward-looking "vision" for the next decade or two... R E L A
X. According to a recent Wall Street Journal report, "vision" is
out. In its place: a short-term focus on results and a return to the
basics of good business management.<P>

Even such industry giants as IBM's Louis Gerstner, Microsoft's William
Gates, and Chrysler's Robert Eaton, are concentrating more on the
fundamentals these days; "casting aside their crystal balls to
concentrate on the nuts and bolts of running their businesses in these
leaner times," the Journal says, and keeping a "sharp eye on the
short-term bottom line."<P>

For small business owners, getting back to the basics of business is
relatively easy because, for the most part, you never left them. One
of those basics is business insurance coverage. Yet, depending on the
stage your company is in -- startup, growth, or maturity -- your menu
of insurance needs may change. Here's a quick rundown of the key
requirements for any small business enterprise.<P>

<b>Basic coverage for the beginning business</b><P>

A startup business needs basic protection: business and personal loan
protection and life and disability insurance for the owner. If you
haven't done so already, this is the time to put a business
continuation plan in place so both your company and your family are
provided for in the event of your death or disability. This is also
the time to consider business overhead expense (BOE) protection
(funded by life and disability income policies) so your business and
personal loans are repaid. Finally, to get and keep top performers,
you'll want individual disability policies for your key associates and
a qualified retirement plan.<P>

With personal tax rates escalating, the qualified retirement plan can
help you save for your retirement years and minimize your current tax
burden. In addition, if there is a great age difference between you
and your rank and file employees, the new age-based contribution
retirement plan may be a money saving option you should
consider. Proper plan design will ensure that you have the best
solution for both your personal and your business needs.<p>

<b>As your company begins to grow</b><P>

Once yours is an established and growing concern, you'll be in a
position to provide: 1) a cost-effective small group life and health
plan for all employees and 2) extra incentives for your key people. At
this point, an executive benefits plan (such as a "deferred
compensation" or a "split dollar" arrangement) offers you two
important advantages. It enriches your standard benefit package so you
can attract and retain high-level employees and it may be paid for
with corporate dollars. Other plan options such as employee stock
ownership and profit-sharing plans can also meet these needs.<P>

<b>When business is booming</b><P>

The mature, established enterprise needs expanded employee benefits
such as a group pension or 401(k) plan and group disability income (or
long-term disability) coverage and, most likely, corporate dollars
will now be available to do this. A key person protection plan also
may be in order to guard against the financial losses incurred when
you lose a top executive to death or disability. A good plan gives
valued employees the incentive to remain loyal to you -- and may keep
them from the clutches of your competition.<P>

Business and personal estate planning, designed to ease the transfer
of your company and minimize your family's estate tax burden, are also
in order. You'll want to consider the estate tax consequences of
passing the business on to your heirs and successors and to plan
appropriately for that possibility. A skillfully designed plan lets
you control the destiny of your business and provide for your family's
future.<P>

Finally, at every stage, flexibility of plan design and ease of plan
administration are critical considerations so your employee and
executive benefits, insurance, and disability coverage keep up with
the changes in your business. Your insurance agent and/or business
financial advisor can provide valuable assistance to you in this
area.<P>

<h2>Back-to-Basics Focus Includes Business
Fundamentals</h2>

<h3>By <a href="/FNEA.html#sheehan">Daniel D. Sheehan</a>, CFP</h3>

Recently, executives have begun to focus more on the short-term
results and the basics of good management. Insightful "vision" is
being left behind as the interest shifts to the fundamentals. One of
the very basic fundamentals of good management is business insurance
coverage.<P>

The type of insurance that is necessary for a company depends on what
stage of growth that company is currently in. A start-up business
needs basic protection, consisting of business and personal loan
protection, as well as life and disability insurance for the
owner. Individual disability policies and a qualified retirement plan
should also be considered in order to maintain a qualified staff of
employees. As the company begins to grow, two more concerns
arise. First, the company is now in the position to offer group life
and health plans for all employees. Secondly, extra incentives such as
deferred compensation and split dollar arrangements can be used to
attract high-level employees and help retain them as well. A mature,
established enterprise needs to consider expanded benefits such as
group pension plans, 401(k) plan, and long-term disability
coverage.<P>

A key element of all of this is the necessity, at every stage, for
flexibility. Benefits and insurance should be flexible enough to keep
up with any changes in the business.<P>

Agreement</title></head><body>


<h1><center><IMG  WIDTH=39 HEIGHT=29 SRC="/icon.gif"> Business Planning: Don't Put Off The
Buy-Sell Agreement</center></h1>

<h2><center>By <a href="/FNEA.html#sheehan">Daniel D. Sheehan</a>, CFP</center></h2>

<hr><P>

What would happen to your business if you decided to retire? If you
suffered a disability? If you died? Who would run the business -- your
spouse, an employee, your children a business partner? And, how would
you get money out of the business for either your retirement or your
family's inheritance?<P>

If the answers to these questions disturb you -- or worse, if you have
no answers -- you should start arranging now for your business to
continue in the future. The fact is, while many people are well on
their way to building a successful and profitable business today,
plowing profits back into their business, too many have not taken the
time to plan for the day when hard assets have to be converted into a
stream of income.<P>

Considered the classic solution to problems caused by retirement,
disability, or death of a business owner, the buy-sell agreement is a
contract between two parties that binds a purchaser to buy the
business within a certain period of time at a set price. In other
words, a buy-sell agreement sets the stage for events which are
inevitable.<P>

<b>ADVANTAGES OF A BUY-SELL AGREEMENT</b><P>

By pre-arranging an agreement between the owner's family and potential
buyers, a number of problems can be avoided. The buy-sell agreement
ensures that the business will be managed by the people who have the
expertise to keep it profitable. For instance, the buy-sell agreement
can keep heirs who may have no business expertise from becoming major
shareholders, and allow other family members or partners to run the
business.<P>

The major advantage of an agreement is to determine in advance how the
owner's shares will be divided -- a controlling interest to those who
have the experience, and a minority interest to those who do not. A
smooth transition to new owners boosts the confidence of those
involved with the business -employees, partners, customers, creditors,
and stockholders.<P>

<b>TYPES OF BUY-SELL AGREEMENTS</b><P>

There are two basic types of buy-sell agreements, the cross purchase
and the entity purchase. The cross purchase agreement allows various
stockholders to buy the shares of the business owned by the deceased
or departed owner. For example, a widowed restaurant owner named
Charles wants to leave his business to his daughter, Mary, but does
not want to deprive his two other children of their share of the
inheritance. He can do this with a cross purchase buy-sell
agreement. In the agreement he can stipulate that Mary will inherit
one third interest in the business and his estate will inherit the
remaining two thirds. With a life insurance policy Mary owns on
Charles' life, she will purchase the remaining interest, with the
proceeds going to her siblings.<P>

Another type of buy-sell agreement is the entity purchase
agreement. This allows the company to buy the shares owned by the
deceased or departed owner. In the following illustration, Kathleen
and two partners own a very successful hardware store. Kathleen's
daughter, Suzanne, was brought into the business, but proved to be a
failure. In order to keep Kathleen's stock interest from passing to
Suzanne in the future, the partners can set up an entity buy-sell
agreement between the business and Kathleen. The business insures
Kathleen to provide the funds to buy her stock at her disability,
death, or retirement, thus assuring that the partners do not have to
include Suzanne in the ownership of the hardware store.<P>

<b>FUNDING A BUY-SELL AGREEMENT</b><P>

A buy-sell agreement will not work effectively unless there are
available funds, at the right time and in the right amount, provided
by properly arranged disability and life insurance with cash values.<P>

There are several alternatives available to fund the agreement. Some
businesses have enough accumulated capital to fund the buy-sell
agreement. Companies also rely on future earnings after death or
retirement to fund the buyout through regular payments. Still other
firms borrow the funds or sell assets to generate the cash. But the
best option is for the company to purchase insurance on the life of
the owner with the beneficiary of the policy stipulated in the
buy-sell agreement. Life insurance automatically provides funds for
the buyout upon the death of the business owner, or in the case of
retirement, loans can be made against the cash value of the policy to
generate cash.<P>

Effective business planning for today and tomorrow requires that a
buy-sell agreement be properly arranged and funded. Business owners
must take the time out of their busy schedules to ensure the smooth
and profitable continuation of the business, a business that often has
taken many years of hard work to build. And, by working closely with a
team of financial advisors -- lawyer, accountant, insurance agent -- the
buy-sell agreement can be tailored to business and personal needs,
giving the owner the assurance that a lifetime invested in business
will yield adequate income and peace of mind.<P>

<h2>Business Planning: Don't Put Off The Buy-Sell Agreement</h2>

<h3>By <a href="/FNEA.html#sheehan">Daniel D. Sheehan</a>, CFP</h3>

Many people today, though financially successful, have little idea of
what will happen to their business when they retire, become disabled,
or pass away. The classic, and very effective solution to this problem
is the buy-sell agreement. This agreement binds a purchaser to buy the
business at a set price within a pre-designated period of time.<P>

The main concern of the buy-sell agreement is to pre-arrange how the
owner's shares will be divided. Typically, this would involve ensuring
that controlling interest in the company actually went to some
individual with the experience necessary to run the company
successfully. This type of smooth transition encourages those involved
with the company: employees, partners, banks, etc., to have confidence
in the company.<P>

There are two basic types of buy-sell agreements: the cross purchase
and the entity purchase. The cross purchase allows specific
stockholders to buy shares of a business owned by a deceased or
departed owner. The entity purchase agreement allows a company to buy
the shares owned by the deceased or departed owner.<P>

The success of a buy-sell agreement is contingent on the availability
of funds at the correct time. This is often provided for by arranging
disability and life insurance with cash values.<P>

Other financing options, such as accumulated capital, future earnings,
debt, or sales of assets can also be used to finance this
agreement. Life insurance seems to be the best option because it
automatically provides funds for the buyout upon death, or, in the
case of retirement, loans can be made against the cash value of the
policy. Anyway the agreement is funded, a buy-sell agreement is an
important contract which allows people to help plan for the
inevitable.<P>

<html><head><title>Business Planning: Protecting Your Business
Against Sudden Disability</title></head><body>

<h1><center><IMG  WIDTH=39 HEIGHT=29 SRC="/icon.gif"> Business Planning: Protecting Your Business
Against Sudden Disability</center></h1>

<h2><center>By <a href="/FNEA.html#sheehan">Daniel D. Sheehan</a>, CFP</center></h2>

<hr><P>

Sudden disability of a business owner or key employee can severely
impact the bottom line of a business. The owner and employees are the
most valuable assets to any business, large or small. When disability
occurs, however, those assets can quickly become liabilities.<P>

When a capable, productive key employee suffers a long-term sickness
or accidental disability, not only does the employee face considerable
personal expenses, but the company is faced with the obligation to
continue the employee's salary. Plus, the company must bear the added
cost of temporarily replacing the key employee, resulting in a
significant drain on business funds and operating expertise. And, if
the owner suffers a disability, the survival of the business may be in
jeopardy.<P>

Long-term disability happens more often than you think. In fact, the
chance that an individual will become disabled at age 35 is three
times greater than the loss of that person due to death. And
surprisingly, roughly three out of four business owners do not have
disability protection.<P>

There is a reasonably simple solution to this problem. Employers
should set up a Wage Continuation Plan for themselves and key
employees. The federal government has recognized the importance of
such plans, providing a number of tax advantages for them.<P>

A Wage Continuation Plan ensures that the owner and key employees will
continue to receive a salary despite a long-term disability. With a
plan, the payment of benefits to a disabled employee or owner will
qualify as "necessary business expenses" and are tax deductible to the
firm. Plus, certain disabled employees may be eligible for tax
credits.<P>

In addition to the tax advantages, these plans replace a potentially
costly drain on the business with a reasonable fixed business
expense. A Wage Continuation Plan also earns the good will of current
key employees and attracts other high quality personnel as well.<P>

Once the decision to prepare a proper Wage Continuation Plan is made,
the next step is to determine how to fund that plan. There are several
possible alternatives available. Some businesses rely on current
revenue or retained earnings. Other firms may borrow the funds.<P>

A more viable funding option is for the company to purchase individual disability income policies for the necessary funds upon disability. Other benefits to this method of funding include:

<ul type=disc>
<li> placing the burden of an employee's salary continuation on the insurance company, rather than the employer;<P>

<li>establishing company policy before disability occurs; and,<P>

<li>obtaining the tax advantages afforded to Wage Continuation Plans.
</ul>

These types of plans reflect sound business management and can be tailored to the particular company. Business owners interested in investigating the specifics of a qualified Wage Continuation Plan should work with their legal counsel and insurance advisor.<P>

<h2>Business Planning: Protecting Your Business Against Sudden Disability</h2>

<h3>By <a href="/FNEA.html#sheehan">Daniel D. Sheehan</a>, CFP</h3>


Sudden disability of a business owner or key employee can have a
severe impact on the bottom line of a business. The long-term sickness
or accidental disability of a key employee can be very damaging to a
business. Besides the obligation of continuing to pay the employee's
salary, a temporary replacement for the employee must be found. This
can not only drain funds but operating expertise as well. The
long-term disability of a company owner can have an even larger impact
on the business, potentially putting its very existence in
jeopardy.<P>

There is, however, a simple and effective solution to this
problem. The Wage Continuation Plan is a plan set up to ensure that
owners and key employees will continue to receive a salary despite a
long-term disability. With a plan, the payment of benefits to a
disabled employee or owner qualify as "necessary business expenses"
and thus, are tax deductible. In addition, the plan replaces a sudden,
potentially costly drain on the business with a reasonable fixed
business expense. Knowledge that a company offers this plan should
also attract more quality employees and help to retain them.<P>

There are several ways to finance this type of plan. Some companies
merely rely on revenues or retained earnings. Others finance it with
debt. An alternative to these methods is to purchase individual
disability income policies for the necessary funds upon
disability. This option allows a company to place the burden of an
employee's salary continuation on the insurance company, establish a
policy before disability occurs, and obtaining the tax advantages
afforded to Wage Continuation Plans. When properly financed, a Wage
Continuation Plan can have offer a company many benefits for a
reasonable price.<P>

<h1><center><IMG WIDTH=39 HEIGHT=29 SRC="/icon.gif"> Business
Planning: The Importance of a Well Drafted Buy/Sell Agreement</center></h1>

<h2><center>By <a href="/bios/cushing.html">Leo J. Cushing</a>,
Esq.</center></h2>

<hr><P>

No business owner should underestimate the importance of a well
drafted buy/sell agreement given the disastrous estate tax
consequences in Estate of Joseph H. Lauder. T.C. Memo 994-527.  In
Lauder, the Tax Court rejected the estate tax value of the Est&eacute;e
Lauder perfume company based on a corporate redemption buy/sell
agreement which set the price at " net per share book value"
determined on the last day of the fiscal year of the corporation prior
to the date of death. In an earlier case, involving the same estate,
Estate of Lauder v. Commissioner T.C. Memo 1992-736, the Tax Court
concluded that the shareholder agreement was invalid as a device to
allow the shareholders to transfer stock to the natural objects of the
decedent's bounty for less than adequate and full consideration. As a
result, the formula price set forth in the Company's buy/sell
agreement would not control for purposes of determining the fair
market value of this stock owned by the decedent on the date of his
death.<P>

Once the buy/sell agreement was set aside, the IRS assessed an estate
tax deficiency of $43,000,000! The estate had reported the value at
$29,000,000 based on book value. The IRS claimed that the fair market
value of the stock was $90,000,000. To make matters worse, none of the
increased value would be eligible for the marital deduction according
to the IRS, since under state law, the company legally was obligated
to pay the estate only $29,000,000 based on the value set forth in the
buy/sell agreement. The lessons of Est&eacute;e Lauder are extremely
important to business owners because of the Court's analysis of the
proper approach to valuing of closely held businesses, its
consideration of an appropriate discount for lack of marketability and
the Court's allowance of a partial marital deduction attributable to
an indirect transfer of wealth from the decedent to his spouse by way
of the bargain sale of the decedent's shares to the corporation.<P>

<ol>

<li><b>Valuation</b>. The Court summarily rejected any valuation based
exclusively on "net per share book value". The definition of fair
market value is the "price at which the property would change hands
between a willing buyer and a willing seller, neither being under any
compulsion to buy or to sell and both having reasonable knowledge of
all relevant facts". The determination of fair market value is a
question of fact requiring the trier to weigh all relevant evidence of
value and draw appropriate inferences. Expert testimony concerning
value is admissible if it will assist the trier of fact in determining
value.<P>

After rejecting the value based on the price established in accordance
with the buy/sell agreement, the Court determined the Company's value
based on the price earnings ratios of comparable companies within the
industry. The Court ruled that such an analysis provides the most
objective and reliable basis for determining the fair market value of
the stock.<P>

At trial, the estate presented expert evidence concerning numerous
publicly traded companies such as Avon Products (Avon),
Cheseborough/Pond s (Ponds), Dell Laboratories, Inc. (Dell), Faberge,
Inc. (Faberge), Helene Curtis Industries, Inc. (Helene Curtis), Mary
Kay Cosmetics, Inc. (Mary Kay), MEM Company, Inc. (MEM) and Revlon
(Revlon). The Court considered each of the following comparable price
earning multiples based on the decedent's date of death.<P>

<pre>
	Company			Price Earning Multiple
	Avon				10.6
	Ponds				12.3
	DelI				9.4
	Faberge				18.9
	Helene Curtis			24.8
	LaMaur				12.0
	Mary Kay			25.3
	MEM				8.5
	Noxell				14.3
	Revlon				11.0
</pre>


The Court rejected the high multiple of Faberge based on testimony
that it was artificially high and reflected analyst's expectations
that its earnings would continue to rebound and begin to achieve
margins commensurate to that of the industry in general. Like,
Faberge, the Court determined that the Helene Curtis multiple of 24.8
would not be instructive since Helene Curtis had introduced several
new products during the preceding years resulting in unexpected
revenue growth of 18.6%. Likewise, Mary Kay was rejected because it's
financial record could also be described as "extremely impressive"
with sales and net income growing at compound annual rates of 54.3%
and 56.3% during the prior years. Those impressive financial results,
stated the Court, reflected the cost advantages of direct sales to the
consumer through saleswomen.<P>

The estate urged the Court to adopt a price earning multiple of twelve
times Est&eacute;e Lauder's most recent annual earnings. Applying this
multiple to the Company's earnings of $33,500,000, the decedent's
expert concluded that, if publicly traded, the common stock would sell
for $12,253 per share. The Court, however, determined that the
operating performance and future earnings potential would be best
reflected in a price earnings multiple of 12.2. Applying this
multiple to earnings of $33,500,000, the stock, if publicly traded,
would have sold for $12,457 per share.<P>

<li><b>Discount for lack of marketability</b>.  Once the fair market
value of the stock was determined, the Court considered an appropriate
discount for lack of marketability. The decedent urged the court to
adopt a substantial discount of ninety percent but this was
rejected. The Court found that such high discounts are better suited
to investments that involve enormous financial risks and present no
market, public or private, for liquidating a particular investment. In
light of Est&eacute;e Lauder's long term financial success and its position
as an industry leader, the company was not considered such an extreme
risk. Nevertheless, the Court, after considering all of the
circumstances and recognizing the intention to maintain family control
over the company allowed a forty percent discount to reflect lack of
liquidity. As a result, the price per share of $12,457 was discounted
by forty percent leaving a per share price of $7,474 or an aggregate
value of $50,494,344. At this point, however, the estate tax liability
would still be in excess of $30 million dollars not including
penalties and interest unless the decedent was able to show that a
marital deduction should be allowed.<P>

<li><b>Marital Deduction</b>. The real risk associated with having a
buy/sell agreement which sets an artificially low price is the lack of
a marital deduction sufficient to cover the increase in value. In the
usual situation, the business owner alone will own stock which will be
redeemed by the corporation.  In this case, the decedent reported the
estate tax value in accordance with the buy/sell agreement at
$29,000,000. The IRS claimed that the value should be the
$90,000,000. Under state law, the buy/sell agreement was binding for
purposes for of determining the actual cost to the company. Therefore,
the estate would be paid only $29,000,000 as per the buy/sell
agreement and would have only $29,000,000 with which to fund a marital
deduction. The difference between the assessed value of $90 million
and the cash proceeds of $29,000,000 would become fully taxable.<P>

</ol>

The decedent in Est&eacute;e Lauder, however, was somewhat lucky. At the
time of the decedent's death, the decedent's widow owned 39.26% of the
outstanding shares of the corporation. The court allowed a marital
deduction equal to 39.26% of the total increase in value based on the
court's determination of fair market value. The Court held that the
bargain sale to the corporation, pursuant to the buy/sell price,
represented in indirect shift in wealth to the surviving spouse based
on her outstanding ownership in the corporation on the date of her
husband's death. The estate was unable to cite any authority to
support its argument, but nevertheless, the Court afforded substantial
relief by allowing a marital deduction equal to $24,000,0 00 39.26%
based on the surviving spouse's the value of which was indirectly
increased by virtue of the bargain sale.  Most business owners would
not be so fortunate.<P>

The lesson of Est&eacute;e Lauder is to use a realistic valuation formula
based on earnings, not book value alone, when planning business
succession with buy/sell agreements.<P>

<h2><IMG  WIDTH=39 HEIGHT=29 SRC="/icon.gif"> <i>Executive Summary</i></h2>
<h2>Business Planning: The Importance of a Well Drafted Buy/Sell Agreement</h2>

<h3>By <a href="/bios/cushing.html">Leo J. Cushing</a>, Esq.</h3>

The importance of a well drafted buy/sell agreement cannot be
overestimated. This point was dramatically made in the case of the
Estate of Joseph H. Lauder. In this case, the tax court rejected the
estate tax value of the Est&eacute;e Lauder company based on the corporate
redemption buy/sell agreement. This was based on an earlier decision
which stated that the shareholder agreement was invalid as a device to
transfer stock for less than adequate and full consideration. Whereas
the value was thought to be, based on the agreement, $29 million
dollars, the IRS claimed that fair market value of the company was $90
million. Based on the IRS's figure, it was also calculated that there
was an estate tax deficiency of $43 million. To make matters worse,
none of the increased value was eligible for the marital deduction,
because the company was only obligated to pay the estate $29
million.<P>

This case is extremely important to business owners because of the
Court's analysis of the proper approach to the valuing of a closely
held business, its consideration of an appropriate discount for lack
of marketability, and the Court's allowance of a partial marital
deduction attributable to an indirect transfer of wealth from the
decedent to his spouse by way of the bargain sale of the decedent's
shares to the corporation. The court, when dealing with the valuation
of the company, dismissed the value proposed by the buy/sell
agreement. In its stead, the Court determined the value based on the
price earnings ratio of comparable companies within the industry. To
reflect the lack of marketability, the court allowed for a 40%
discount. Additionally, the court allowed for a marital deduction
equal to million. The rationale behind this was as follows: The
decedent's widow owned 39.26% of the outstanding shares. Holding that
the bargain sale to the corporation represented an indirect shift in
wealth to the surviving spouse based on her ownership in the
corporation, the court allowed a marital deduction of 39.26% of the
total increased value.<P>

The lesson learned in the case of Est&eacute;e Lauder is an important
one. Realistic valuation formulas should be used when planning
business succession with buy/sell agreements.<P>

<h1><center><IMG  WIDTH=39 HEIGHT=29 SRC="/icon.gif"> Charitable Planning: Charitable Roll-Overs</center></h1>

<h2><center>By <a href="/bios/henry.html">Vaughn W. Henry</a></center></h2>

<hr><P>

Interested in leaving a little something to a favorite charity? There
are new ways to meet those heroic goals. The biggest hurdle is saving
value at the same time for the remaining family.<P>

For most people, a charitable bequest uses a cash transfer from the
estate's after-tax assets. Unfortunately, when using cash that the IRS
has already taxed, it reduces the final value of those gifted
dollars. A better way to control your estate is to donate funds from
your IRA, qualified retirement account or tax deferred annuity. Since
these pre-tax dollars have not yet been devalued by income taxes, a
greater donation can be made. This gift occurs without cutting value
your heirs, since the remaining can then be kept in the family.<P>

Besides making a typical bequest in a will, there are other options
that should also be explored. Of the many ways this might work to an
advantage is the use of a "charitable roll-over". In one example of
its use, John Client has built up a retirement account of
$300,000. Since there are other assets to fund his retirement, he
wishes to leave the IRA proceeds to his disabled daughter. However, he
knows that after estate and income taxes on the IRA, there will be
less than $ 100,000 usable to pay for her future care. A better choice
is to name his Charitable Remainder Trust (CRT) as beneficiary of the
IRA. The CRT would then annually pay his daughter a percentage of the
trust's value. By choosing an 8% payout, his CRT will create $24,000
free of IRA restrictions for his daughter's use. At her death, the
remainder interest in the trust then passes to either a named charity
or a family foundation for management and distribution. Since the full
amount of the IRA is available for investment and income production,
this provides a more powerful way to protect his family.<P>

Charitable roll-over techniques have the potential to create greater
legacies for both sets of recipients. This unique transfer of
qualified funds may be made through either a testamentary or an
inter-vivos document, depending on your goals. For clients desiring
more direct control of the future flow of funds, these useful tools
can be further improved. By gifting pre-tax dollars to a charitable
remainder trust or your family foundation, you cut out the government
middle-man. The purpose of capturing this "social capital" is that
personal assets are effectively managed and distributed by your
family, instead of the IRS. In this way, your favorite charitable or
community projects will have lasting support through a very visible
gift. Your family will have some societal impact and you create a
lasting legacy.<P>

If estate taxes are not a major concern in your plan, then other
choices about preserving value for the family can be evaluated. When
there are highly appreciated stocks or property, there are two
excellent ways to shift value. If the property is to be kept by the
family, it is better to transfer those assets by yvill or trust to
your heirs. In this way, the assets are inherited with a stepup in
basis, which reduces future tax burdens on any eventual sale. If the
property is likely to be sold rather than kept, then a CRT is an
excellent way to improve income and minimize tax liabilities. A
remainder trust coordinated with a wealth replacement trust then
provides cash to the heirs in place of the gifted assets. This method
also provides more incentive to support charitable programs in the
community. The heirs then have an option of donating cash to the
family's charity and taking a deduction on their own income tax
return. In the more traditional approach, when the appreciated asset
is directly donated to the charity, its value may not be as
efficiently replaced.<P>

There are some very creative ways to make charitable gifts and control
social capital. If clients reduce tax liabilities and can also support
good works through philanthropic programs, everyone benefits. As
always, these can be very complex situations and you should seek
expert advice to properly assess your options.<P>

<h2>Charitable Planning: Charitable Roll-Overs</h2>

<h3>By <a href="/bios/henry.html">Vaughn W. Henry</a></h3>

Many people are interested in leaving a portion of their wealth to
charity. However, what many people don't realize is that through
proper planning, not only are they able to give more to their favorite
cause, but they are also able to provide for the security of their
family.<P>

Most people use a cash transfer from an estate's after-tax assets to
fund a charitable bequest. By using cash that the IRS has already
taxed, they are reducing the potential value of the gift. A much more
effective way to do this is to donate money directly from their IRA,
qualified retirement account, or tax deferred annuity. Since these
dollars are pre-tax, a greater donation can be made.<P>

One very popular method that many people opt for is the "charitable
roll over." This plan involves the transfer of assets into a
Charitable Remainder Trust. The Trust will then pay out a certain
percentage to the intended beneficiaries. At the death of the
beneficiary, the remainder interest in the trust then passes to a
charity. These charities can, and often do, include family
foundations.<P>

Highly appreciated assets can be dealt with in two ways. If the assets
are to be kept, it is best to shift them, through will or trust, to
the heirs. However, if the assets are to be sold, a Charitable
Remainder Trust is the superior way of minimizing tax liabilities and
improving income.<P>

There are many creative ways to give charitable gifts. One of these,
the Charitable Remainder Trust, not only provides for charities, but
protects assets against taxes, allowing even more money to be
donated. Additionally, this form of trust can provide for a
beneficiary, with the money going to a charity, only after the
intended beneficiary's death.<P>

<html><head><title>Does My Family Really Need an Estate
Plan</title></head><body>

<h1><center><IMG  WIDTH=39 HEIGHT=29 SRC="/icon.gif"> Does My Family Need
an Estate Plan</center></h1>

<h2><center>By <a href="/FNEA.html#sheehan">Daniel D. Sheehan</a>, CFP.</center></h2>

<hr><P>

As Ben Franklin once said, "... in this world, nothing is certain but
death and taxes." This statement still rings true today as the number
of people age 65 or older doubles over the next several decades. This
genera will be wealthier than any previous one, and subject to
significant estate taxes at death. That's why estate planning has
become a growing concern to families.<P>

The purpose of estate planning, quite simply, is to ensure that your
estate reaches your heirs the way you want it to. This is especially
important if you want to make sure that heirlooms stay in the family
after you die. Through estate planning, you also minimize federal and
state death taxes that can shrink your estate. And, if you're a
business owner, you can use estate planning to protect your business
interest.<P>

The benefits of estate planning are many. However, to develop a game
plan to meet your needs, you should understand how your death will
affect your property, and what it will mean to your survivors.<P>

<b>The Will</b><P>

Regardless of your age, marital status, or health, you need a will to
protect your assets. Why? If you die intestate, without a will, you
are putting the state in charge of deciding who gets what. That means
that you may accidently disinherit a family member or a close
friend. And, if you and your spouse die without leaving specific
instructions for your children, you give up the right to decide who
will raise them. Plus, dying without a will may commit your estate to
a long and expensive wait in probate court.<P>

Other potential complications relating to wills are numerous. For
instance, your house, bank accounts, stocks, and any other personal
property that may be owned jointly will transfer to your spouse by
law, regardless of what your will says. And, in many states, if you
are married and have children, your spouse may inherit only a portion
of your estate, while the rest would be distributed equally to your
children. Other assets such as life insurance proceeds and pension
benefits pass to named beneficiaries unless you specify an executor,
estate, or trust as beneficiary. Because some assets don't pass
exclusively by will, it's especially important that titles on property
and other personal holdings match those named in your will to avoid
complications.<P>

<b>Sheltering the Estate from Taxes</b><P>

Once you've decided how to distribute your assets, you should then
consider ways to minimize your taxes. If you don't, your heirs may
face estate taxes ranging from 18 to 50-plus percent for estates
valued at over $3 million. There are a number of ways to reduce estate
taxes, including the use of the marital deduction and the Federal Gift
and Estate Tax Unified Credit, giving gifts to your family and close
friends while you're still alive, and by making use of trusts.<P>

The marital deduction lets you leave all property to your spouse
tax-free, regardless of its value. That's the good news. The bad news
is, if you leave everything to your spouse, eventually some of it will
end up in the hands of the federal government when your spouse
dies. This is where estate planning becomes essential in minimizing
death taxes.<P>

It's also important to use the federal gift and estate tax unified
credit, which allows approximately $600,000 of your assets to pass to
your heirs free of federal gift tax during your lifetime, or estate
tax at your death. By taking advantage of both the marital deduction
and the unified credit, you and your spouse can pass on a legacy of up
to $1.2 million to your heirs without any estate taxes.<P>

Another way to reduce taxes on your estate is by giving gifts to
family members and close friends while you're still alive. You and
your spouse each can give away as much as $10,000 per person per year,
in addition to being able to use your unified credit.<P>

By making use of trusts, the estate tax savings can be significant as
well. For example, you can set aside some of your assets in a trust,
which can exclude those assets from your taxable estate. However, be
forewarned that trusts are quite complex. In some instances, you must
give up control of the income and principal in the trust and the right
to make any subsequent changes in the trust itself. You should meet
with your attorney or financial advisor to discuss the trusts most
suited to your needs and tax situation.<P>

<b>Ways to Pay</b><P>

Even with the best designed estate plan, your heirs may still end up
paying taxes on your estate. According to government statistics, over
a million people living now will owe federal estate taxes when they
die.<P>

The options for paying estate taxes--saving, borrowing, or selling
assets-all require you or your heirs to pay a cost at least equal to
the actual tax liability. <P>

Saving requires strong discipline in putting aside large sums of
money. Borrowing costs you more than the actual tax amount because of
the interest you would pay on a loan. And selling assets may also cost
you more if assets had to be sold below their actual market value. A
way to accumulate the money to pay taxes in a more cost effective
manner is through life insurance.<P>

Many life insurance companies offer a life insurance policy especially
designed for the estate planning market, called survivorship life of
second-to-die policy. A joint life policy that insures both you and
your spouse, a survivorship life policy pays the death benefit at the
death of the second spouse, which is also when estate taxes become
due. The policy can be set up in an irrevocable trust to keep the
proceeds out of your estate, thereby avoiding any additional estate
taxes.<P>

These are just some of the basics to help get you started in planning
your estate. What's important is to take the time to evaluate your
estate planning situation now. By doing this with the help of a
professional advisor, you will be able to rest assured that your
wealth is passed on as you wish after you're gone.<P>

<h2>Estate Planning: Does My Family Really Need An Estate Plan?</h2>

<h3>By <a href="/FNEA.html#sheehan">Daniel D. Sheehan</a>, CFP</h3>

Estate planning is the process of ensuring that an estate is handed
down to heirs in anyway that is desirable to the estate owner. Through
estate planning, federal and state death taxes can be minimized and
business interests can be protected.<P>

Regardless of age, marital status, or health, a will is a very
necessary financial instrument. Without a will, the government
automatically takes control of an estate. It is the state who decides
who gets what portion of the estate. Not only will the state's
division of an estate probably be very different from that which was
intended, the estate may be committed to a long and expensive wait in
probate court. In addition, if a couple passes away without leaving
specific instructions for their children, the state will decide who
will raise them.<P>

One of the most important aspects of estate planning is sheltering the
estate from taxes. If the estate is not put into any type of shelter,
estate taxes can potentially be over 50%. Several options are open to
people interested in protecting their assets. Marital deductions, the
Federal Gift and Tax Unified Credit, giving gifts to family and close
friends while still alive, and using trusts are all options available
to those concerned with the future of the estate.<P>

Another problem is that, no matter how well designed your estate plan
is, some taxes will have to be paid. The traditional options for
paying estate taxes: saving, borrowing, or selling assets, each
require the payment of a cost at least equal to the actual tax
liability. Many life insurance companies now offer a policy, called
survivorship life or second-to-die policy, which is specifically
designed for the estate planning market. This policy covers both
spouses, but pays the benefit only after the death of the second
spouse, when the estate taxes come due.<P>

<h1><center><IMG  WIDTH=39 HEIGHT=29 SRC="/icon.gif"> Estate Planning: Power Gifting Techniques in Your Estate Plan</center></h1>

<h2><center>By <a href="/bios/henry.html">Vaughn W. Henry</a></center></h2>

<hr><P>

All too often, estate planning is perceived as something only done late in life. In reality, the accumulation, management and distribution of assets (estate planning) is done on a daily basis by everyone. However, if minimizing estate taxes is a consideration, then one component of a good estate plan involves the use of gifts. Under current law, the gift tax and the estate tax are treated in the same way. The Unified Credit now allows each person the opportunity to gift both real and personal property worth up to $600,000 either before or after death without paying any tax to transfer that asset. Additionally, an individual is allowed to give $ 10,000 per year to any number of recipients and exclude that amount from the gift tax as well.<P>

Gifts made in this calendar year need to be completed before December 31. The courts have held that if checks are used, they must have cleared the donor s account by the end of the year. Only gifts of present interest count as a completed gift. If you have conditions on the gift that affect its disposition or use or you don't relinquish control, you may invalidate the gift for tax purposes and wind up with its value back in your estate. Why would anyone transfer assets before death? There are a number of good reasons:<ul type=disc>

<li>Assets that will increase in value are often gifted to remove that asset, its future growth and the increasing tax liability from the donor's estate.
<li>Donors can gift an asset tax-free and monitor the use by the recipient. If the donor feels that the gift is appreciated and used properly, it may encourage additional gifts in future years. This also provides a sense of satisfaction to older family members who may have concerns about the recipients' maturity, responsibility and capacity to properly manage a significant estate.
<li>The $600,000 exemption has only been in place since 1986, and there is still some concern that Congress will reduce this exemption to provide additional revenue to gain control of the federal deficit. So there is a "use it or lose it" thought process to address for many people concerned about keeping property in the family.
<li>You may lower the family's total income tax bill if income producing gifts are shifted to an individual in a lower tax bracket.
<li>Testamentary charitable gifts are traditionally used to do social good, but there are new techniques involving IRC Section 664 trusts which generally will allow more flexible planning and permit families to redirect their social capital. This enlightened self-interest gifting can be a major component in a well designed estate plan.</uL><P>

How does gifting work best inside an estate plan? Cash is not the only way to pass gifts. Stock and other hard to value assets might ultimately be more beneficial when shifted to the next generation. For example, business owners have used corporate recapitalizations as a means of shifting future growth into the next generation's hands while still retalning income and control. Recent changes to the laws now allow Family Limited Partnerships the same opportunities to leverage a gift and pass the tax ownership in an operation to family members while still retaining rights to participate in management. For instance, a married couple with a $2 million to $3 million farm or business could pass tax free ownership to their children and grandchildren and still maintain all of the needed income for themselves and their children. This can be done while they are retaining control in all management decisions. With a 33 per cent discount for lack of marketability, control and management, the minority partnership interests that the grandchildren now own could qualify for this tax free shift through the
use of each grandparent's $ 1 million generation skipping tax exemption. Within the Family Limited Partnership, the family farm or business continues to operate successfully and will not have to address significant estate burdens until the third generation has to deal with their estate tax problems in the future. Although the problem is only postponed, all of the growth and subsequent tax liabilities are deferred and this provides adequate time to improve the succession plan, use the assets and concentrate on what the family does best.<P>

Besides the typical will and trust documents, business continuity plans may include buy-sell agreements and life insurance trusts. These tools will improve the odds of your family keeping the business intact, whether death, disability or retirement take you out of the picture. If you are serious about disinheriting the IRS and keeping your business in the family, a well-structured gifting program will allow your heirs to inherit the fruits of your labor.<P>

Estate taxes are voluntary. If you choose not to plan ahead, you have made a conscious decision to let the government's default estate plan take control of your assets. It is a straight forward deal. Would you rather the government or the family inherit your business? For further information on eliminating estate tax liabilities and improving the chances of keeping a family business intact, an estate planning team should be assembled to create an integrated plan that solves the problems. Unfortunately, traditional planning options no longer solve all of the family's needs. Today, business and personal plans have had to become more complex as laws and family priorities change, and no one person has a corner on good ideas.<P>

	If minimizing estate taxes is a consideration, the value of gifts should not be underestimated. Under the current law, the gift tax and estate tax work in the same way. The Unified Credit now allows each person the opportunity to gift both real and personal property worth up to $600,000. Additionally, an individual is allowed to give $10,000 per year to any number of recipients. In both of these cases, the gifts are tax free.<P>

	There are a number of good reasons to transfer assets before death through the use of gifts. For instance, assets that will increase in value are often gifted to remove the asset, including its future growth and tax liability from the donor's estate. Additionally, donor can give an asset tax-free and monitor the use by the recipient. The donor can then decide if the gift was handled properly and if additional gifts should be given. Gifts are also frequently given to lower the family' s tax bracket by shifting income to an individual in a lower tax bracket. In addition, there is some question over the ultimate fate of the $600,000 exemption. Many who believe that the exemption will soon be done away with by Congress are taking advantage of it while it still exists.<P>

	Cash is not the only form a gift can take. Stock, as well as other forms of hard to value assets can be even more beneficial when shifted to the next generation. Recent changes in tax law now make it possible, within Family Limited Partnerships, to leverage a gift and pass the tax ownership in an operation to family members while still retaining rights to participate in management. Add to this the 33% discount for lack of marketability, control, and management, and this becomes an incredibly powerful tool. Given, this only puts off the problem of taxation until the third generation. However, it does give the opportunity for the improvement of the succession plan, the use of the assets and the concentration on the management of the Family Limited Partnership.<P>

	Estate taxes are voluntary. If an individual chooses not to plan ahead, they are choosing to pay estate taxes of up to 55%. it would seem that most people would prefer that their family, not the government, inherit their estate. With the help of certain gifting techniques, this desire can be made a reality.<P>

<h1><center><IMG WIDTH=39 HEIGHT=29 SRC="/icon.gif">Estate Planning: Solutions for Parents of Special Needs Children</center></h1>

<h2><center>By <a href="/FNEA.html#sheehan">Daniel D. Sheehan</a>, CFP</center></h2>

<hr><P>

Raising any child requires the wisdom of Solomon, the patience of Job,
boundless energy, an unsinkable sense of humor, and lots of
unconditional love. Even so, it's impossible to keep it all in balance
sometimes.<P>

When you're the parent of a physically, mentally, or emotionally
challenged child, these basic requirements become further complicated
by visits to specialists, therapy, medication, special schooling, and
sometimes, constant care. What you need is more time and energy. What
you don't need are more "should dos" in your already busy life.<P>

So while you know you "should" plan for your special child's future
financial needs -- as well as for your own -- it may be something you
put aside for another time. As one parent of a physically disabled
youngster suggests, "Plans for the future fall to the bottom of a very
long and full list."<P>

The good news is that it need not be time consuming or difficult to do
the long-range financial planning you've been putting off. With the
right people in place to help you, it should take only a few hours of
your time to work out a plan that protects your whole family,
including your child with special needs.<P>

Who are the "right people"? The two essential advisors are an estate
planning attorney (preferably one who has worked with families of
children with special needs) and your insurance agent.<P>

The attorney will serve as your guide through the maze of legal
decisions about wills, trusts, and guardianships you'll need to
make. And he or she will work with you and your insurance advisor to
create and fund an estate plan that avoids the traps that can
unwittingly nullify your best intentions.  Your insurance agent can
help you take the appropriate steps now to protect your entire family
against a loss of income due to death or disability and to begin
building a nest egg for future education, care for your special needs
child, and your retirement needs.<P>

Here are the areas you'll want to cover with both advisors to be sure
that your needs, and those of your special child, are adequately
addressed:<P>

<ol>

<b><li> Family protection:</b> If a bread-winning spouse dies or
becomes disabled there is not only loss of income for the family,
there is also a loss of the parent's care for the special needs
child. Extra funds will be needed to keep the family going. Planning
now will help create those funds with "cheaper dollars. "<P>

<b><li> Mortgage protection:</b> Being forced to move after the death
of a parent may be more than a hardship: it may be difficult to find
substitute housing with the proper requirements (ramps or wide
doorways, for instance) for a handicapped child. Planning now can
create the funds that will allow the family to have options.<P>

<b><li> Education funding:</b> Special needs children who can attend
school may incur additional expenses for transportation, personal
care, and customized learning materials (Braille books or specially
designed computers). A college savings plan can provide for all your
children who wish to pursue higher education.<P>

<b><li> Retirement planning:</b> "I worry about putting something
aside for me as I always have to shift money to something else," is
how one parent describes her dilemma about retirement planning. But
such planning is critically important. With an adequate income later
on, you'll be in a better position to help your special needs child
when he or she reaches adulthood. Planning now will allow you to save
a little for longer.<P>

<b><li> Wills and trusts:</b> Above all, the special needs child must
be provided for while other children in the family are treated
fairly. Yet an outright legacy to the special child may be undesirable
because it disqualifies him or her for government assistance.<P>

Trusts, on the other hand, can provide additional protection,
especially if one of the trustees is an institutional trustee
appointed to manage funds while siblings (or others of your choice)
oversee the child's general care. Trusts also offer parents more
flexibility and privacy concerning the details of a child's
care. Their only drawback: some trusts can be expensive to establish
and maintain. So you'll want to think through all the issues carefully
and get good information from the attorney and insurance
professional.<P>

Depending on your individual circumstances, your attorney may
recommend establishing a Special Needs Trust that provides sufficient
assets for your child's care while still maintaining his or her
eligibility for Supplemental Security Income benefits from Social
Security, Medicaid and other programs. You'll also need to decide
whether the trust should be revocable or irrevocable.<P>

Many parents have found that life insurance trusts are the most
secure, direct way to provide ongoing support to their special needs
children. These trusts allow you to take care of other children and
leave a larger amount to the disabled child without hurting your own
retirement nest egg.<P>

Again, your advisory team can review the various options available to
you and help you prepare the legal documentation that your unique
situation requires. They may also recommend that you write a detailed
Letter of Intent outlining your desires for the care of your disabled
child. Along with the standard legal documents, this letter becomes a
helpful guide for future trustees, conservators, and the courts should
there ever be any question as to what you really wanted.<P>

<b><li> Guardianships:</b> Special needs children who are not fully
capable of managing their own affairs should have a guardian and/or
conservator with appropriate powers of attorney. Yet care must be
taken to choose a guardian who is willing to take on the extra
burdens, possible disruptions, and legal requirements involved. For
the more severely disabled child, the need for guardianship may
continue even after the child reaches adulthood (majority), so the
responsibility becomes a lifelong commitment. Your advisory team can
help you with this important decision and discuss the options
available in your state.<P>

</ol>

Calling on the expertise and assistance of the insurance and legal
professionals who are knowledgeable about working with the parents of
special needs children is an important step toward assuring that you
and your family are well positioned for the future. And it lets you
scratch off one more nagging "should do" from that long, full list.<P>

<h2>Estate Planning: Solutions for Parents of Special Needs Children</h2>

<h3>By <a href="/FNEA.html#sheehan">Daniel D. Sheehan</a>, CFP</h3>

Raising a child is, in and of itself, an epic feat. The
responsibilities that go along with raising a child who is physically,
mentally, or emotionally challenged, makes this feat even more
extraordinary. However, with the proper help, important tasks such as
ensuring for the financial stability of your child, can be
accomplished in a short time with very effective results.<P>

The two advisors necessary to this project are an estate planning
attorney and an insurance agent. Together, these advisors can aid
parents in deciding how to deal with the major problems such as family
protection against the death or disability of a parent, mortgage
protection to ensure proper housing is always available, education
funding, and planning for the retirement of the parents.<P>

Trusts are perhaps the best way to provide for a special needs child
in the future. One particular type of trust is a Special Needs
Trust. This type of trust provides sufficient assets for the child's
care as well as still leaving the child eligible for Supplemental
Security Income, such as Social Security, Medicaid, and other
programs. Another option is a Life Insurance Trust. This type of trust
allows parents to take care of their children without hurting their
own retirement nest egg.<P>

Another major concern is guardianship. For those children who are not
fully capable of managing their own affairs, a guardian should be
appointed with appropriate powers of attorney. This guardian should be
selected carefully, seeing as how they will have to potentially assume
substantial legal, financial, and emotional burdens. <P>

Calling upon the expertise of an estate lawyer and an insurance agent
is the wisest move when planning for the future. These advisors have
the experience and knowledge to advise parents on how to best plan for
the future welfare of their special needs child.<P>

<h1><center><IMG  WIDTH=39 HEIGHT=29 SRC="/icon.gif"> The Family Limited Partnership</center></h1>

<h2><center>Transferring Wealth from generation to generation with
minimal tax consequences and optimal asset protection.</center></h2>

<h3><center>By <a href="/bios/warshaw.html">Melvin A. Warshaw</a>, Esq.</center></h3>

<hr><P>

Family limited partnerships are becoming a popular way for affluent
families to transfer wealth to the next generation. Such partnerships
minimize estate taxes and also afford a degree of asset protection for
the family as a whole. Indeed, family limited partnerships are one of
the best estate-planning options available today to the wealthy.<P>

Traditionally. an affluent investor with a significant portfolio has
had to give up lifetime control over assets when making gifts. Take
the situation of a wealthy retired businessman who, together with his
wife. has been making maximum tax-free gifts to his two children and
four grandchildren each year. He has to give up control of the $
120,000 that he and his wife are giving to the six family members. The
retired businessman and his wife are taking advantage of the annual
$10,000 gift-tax exclusion. (The exclusion is $20,000 for married
couples.) However, the retired businessman is concerned that many of
the recipients are very young and do not understand how to manage
investments. He is still active in investing so, after the gifts are
made, he typically manages the money for his family because he is
aware of investment opportunities of which his children and
grandchildren are not.<P>

After approaching his estate-planning or tax attorney, the retired
businessman has found that there is a better way to transfer assets to
the next generation-by transferring a portion of his portfolio to a
family limited partnership. He and his wife will act as general
partners in charge of all investment decisions. They plan to continue
the $120,000-a-year gift-giving program, but now they will instead
make gifts of limited partnership interests.<P>

Anyone with $2 million or more in investments or significant
investment real estate should consider implementing a family limited
partnership. Clients with estates of this size usually face estate
taxes in excess of 50%. For couples with estates of less than $2
million, a family limited partnership is not cost effective due to
existing tax exemptions and insurance.<P>

The first advantage of the family limited partnership is that the
parents can give away wealth without giving up control over the
assets. The children and grandchildren, as limited partners, have no
say in the management of the partnership's assets.<P>

A second major advantage of the family partnership arrangement is that
the transfer (i.e., gift) of the limited partnership interests to
younger generations can often be valued at 20% to 30% below the
underlying asset value for gift-tax purposes. The discount reflects
certain restrictions and the nature of family partnership
interests.<P>

The family partnership interests that are given away are typically
small limited partner interests which carry no say in the management
of the partnership's affairs and which represent only a fraction of
all partnership interests. The limited partnership interests given
away are of little value to an outside, third parry and are not traded
on any exchange. The limited partnership interests cannot, without the
consent of the general partner, compel a liquidation of the
partnership and reach the underlying assets.<P>

Finally, the limited partners cannot transfer their limited
partnership interests except with the consent of the general partner
and then only to other family members. For all of these reasons, an
outside third party buyer-who would have no access to or voice with
respect to the partnership's underlying assets-would discount or
reduce the amount paid for a limited partnership interest by a
significant amount.<P>

The tax law looks to the price a willing outside buyer would pay as
the measuring rod by which to value intrafamily transfers of limited
partnership interests for gift-tax purposes. Recently, the Internal
Revenue Service announced that it would no longer try to aggregate a
family's ownership in a closely held business, including partnerships,
when valuing transfers of ownership interests. Each transfer of an
ownership interest stands on its own, and each may be entitled to a
minority discount. This is certainly a victory for wealthy
taxpayers.<P>

Until recently, the family limited partnership also provided
protection from creditors in lawsuits and bankruptcy proceedings. When
creating a family limited partnership for asset-protection reasons,
one must be careful to ensure that, at the time the partnership is
formed or when gifts of limited partnership interests are made, such
transfers are not transfers to defraud creditors. A couple of recent
cases have also expanded the rights of creditors to force a sale of a
debtor's limited partnership interest. It had previously been thought
that a creditor's only remedy against a debtor partner was to seek a
charging order or reach-and-apply order which would entitle the
creditor to satisfy any deficiency with the partner's share of
profits, but which would not permit the creditor to become a partner
in the partnership. The message is now clear that one should use
extreme caution when contemplating a family limited partnership as an
asset-protection vehicle.<P>

<b>General Partners and Limited Partners</b><br>

In a family limited partnership, there are typically two types of
owners. The parents or older generation, as general partners, will
manage the assets they have transferred to the partnership. As general
partners, the parents or older generation are entitled to a small
management fee. In setting up the partnership, the parents or older
generation will also be the only initial limited partners. Thereafter,
the parents will start making tax free gifts of limited partnership
interests up to the maximum permitted by the gift-tax laws.<P>

	Unlike gifts of cash or securities, gifts of limited
partnership interests may be discounted by 20% to 30%. This enables
the parents to give away more underlying assets to the next
generation. A word of caution is in order. It is imperative that the
parents or older generation obtain an outside, independent, written
appraisal of the gift-tax value of the limited partnership interests
to be transferred. Although it is not a requirement of the tax code to
do so, obtaining a sound written valuation at the time gifts are made
comes in very handy if the IRS chooses to audit the gift-tax value of
the limited partnership interest many years later.  (The statute of
limitations does not run on a gift unless there is an actual gift tax
paid.)<P>

Alternatively, the parents or older generation may sell limited
partnership interests to the younger generation, taking back a
note. The parents or older generation may have to pay a capital-gains
tax on such a sale, depending on the unrealized appreciation of the
underlying assets at the time of sale. Through thoughtful planning,
the note could be structured to end at the parents' death without
adverse estate-tax consequences.<P>

Eventually, the children and grandchildren will own the majority of
the partnership interests. The parents or older generation must retain
at least a 1% general interest to satisfy certain tax-law
requirements. Despite such ownership, while the parents are alive, the
children and grandchildren will have no say over how the partnership
assets are invested or managed, and whether income should be
distributed to the partners or accumulated by the partnership. In
addition, the children and grandchildren have no ability to liquidate
the partnership unilaterally. After the parents or older generation
pass away, the partnership is usually dissolved with the assets
divided among the children and grandchildren in proportion to their
partnership interests.<P>

If the parents own commercial real estate, the family limited
partnership may be an ideal vehicle. Valuation experts are likely to
give a higher discount where the underlying assets are illiquid, such
as real estate. rather than where liquid assets, such as stocks and
bonds, are owned by the partnership. Suppose the parents transfer
their $ 1,000,000 commercial property to a family limited
partnership. They give each of their two children and four
grandchildren a 3% limited partnership interest, each worth $30,000 in
underlying asset value. The appraiser determines that due to the
illiquid nature of the underlying real estate as well as all of the
other discounts to which a transfer of limited partnership interests
is entitled, the value of the limited partnership interests to be
given away to each recipient for gift-tax purposes is slightly under
$20,000. The parents can then use their $20,000 gift-tax exemption on
the gifts to each child and grandchild. In this manner, the parents
can transfer a total of $ 180,000 worth of limited partnership
interests tax free to the next generations. Using the limited
partnership format, the parents can give away an extra $60,000 a year
free of gift taxes compared to outright gifts of cash or securities.<P>

The most difficult issue in a family limited partnership is how large
a discount to claim in valuing the gifts of limited partnership
interests. The courts have indicated repeatedly that a taxpayer is
entitled to a discount on these types of gifts, but how much is not
clear. A reasonable and conservative discount is in the 20% to 30%
range. However, in certain situations, the IRS has accepted
significantly higher discounts. It is best to be conservative and
obtain an independent appraisal in order to avoid any penalties.<P>

It will also be necessary for the general partners to distribute
enough cash from the partnership each year so that the limited
partners can pay their annual taxes. This means that the general
partner should be prepared to distribute roughly a third of the
partnership's income to all of the partners.<P>

There are costs involved in implementing the family limited
partnership transaction. The estate planning attorney will charge to
draft the partnership agreement, transfer assets to the partnership
and advise the client on the overall strategy. The client must be
willing to hire an independent outside appraiser to determine the
market value of the limited partnership interests to substantiate the
discount for gift-tax purposes. As an estate-planning vehicle, the
family limited partnership is probably the last best option available
to wealthy clients who wish to minimize estate taxes while still
maintaining control over their assets.<P>

(Summary)</title></head><body>


<h2><IMG  WIDTH=39 HEIGHT=29 SRC="/icon.gif"> <i>Executive Summary</i></h2>
<h2>Estate Planning: The Family Limited Partnership</h2>

<h3>By Melvin A. Warshaw, Esq.</h3>

Family limited partnerships are quickly becoming a popular way for
affluent families to transfer wealth to the next generation. Such
partnerships minimize estate taxes and also serve to protect the
assets. Traditionally, it has been necessary to give up lifetime
control over assets when they are given as gifts. Although the $10,000
gift-tax exclusion ($20,000 for couples) serves to minimize taxes,
many affluent people are skeptical about the financial responsibility
of those to whom the gifts are given. Frequently, the receivers of the
gifts are children or are those unacquainted with the business
world. This raises many concerns over the handling and management of
the assets. Recently, this problem is being addressed more frequently
by the use of family limited partnerships. This involves a family
member transferring a portion of their portfolio to a family limited
partnership. This individual will act as a general partner and manage
the investments. Gifts will continue to be given, but they will now
take the form of limited partnership interests.<P>

There are several advantages to the family limited partnership. First
off, parents can pass wealth down to younger generations without
losing control of the assets. Those receiving limited partnership
interests will have no say in the management of the partnership's
assets. Secondly, due to certain restrictions and the nature of family
limited partnerships, interest in family limited partnerships is
usually discounted 20%-30% for tax purposes. Even though the family
limited partnership does supply some modicum of asset-protection, one
should be very careful about using it for this purpose. Recent cases
have made it much less difficult for creditors to become partner in a
partnership.<P>

Although family limited partnerships involve some significant costs,
the implementation of a family limited partnership can be very
beneficial. For affluent individuals who are seeking to minimize
estate taxes while still maintaining control over the assets, family
limited partnerships are the best available option.<P>

Benefit Plans</title></head><body>

<h1><center><IMG  WIDTH=39 HEIGHT=29 SRC="/icon.gif">Executive Compensation: Non-Qualified
Excess Benefit Plans</center></h1>

<h2><center>By <a href="/bios/harrington.html">Don Harrington</a></center></h2>

<hr><P>

"Excess Benefit" plans are one of the most popular forms of
non-qualified deferred compensation used to fund the shortfall created
by the limits imposed on deferred benefit pension plans. This article
will provide an overview of the problem associated with qualified
defined benefit pension plans and the use of non-qualified excess
plans to fill the income gap.<P>

Corporations adopt defined benefit pension plans to provide their
employees with adequate funds for retirement These programs provide a
retirement income stream based on an employees final pay, determined
by the plan's "benefit" formula.<P>

The major problem associated with defined benefit pension plans is
that the amount of compensation which can be provided to the highly
compensated executive is limited by Section 415 of the Internal
Revenue Code. In addition, the shortfall for executives has become
much worse with the enactment of the Revenue Reconciliation Act of
1993.<P>

Even though many employers today have switched to defined contribution
programs, such as profit sharing and 401(k) plans, there are still a
large number of corporations who offer traditional defined benefit
plans. Non-Qualified Excess Benefit Plans can be used effectively to
provide executives with the additional retirement income needed to
restore the level of benefit intended by the corporation. Any
established company that has a defined benefit qualified plan and
highly compensated executives should consider such a program.<P>

<h3>Qualified Plan Limits</h3>

Congress has placed many limitations on qualified plans so that they
do not disproportionately benefit highly compensated executives. These
restrictions have created a new class of discriminated employee, the
"highly compensated executive. "<P>

Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code places restrictions on the
maximum amount an employee may receive from a defined benefit pension
plan. The maximum benefit that may be paid by a qualified plan is
determined by two factors:

<ul type=square>

<li>First, the benefit which can be paid annually cannot exceed 100%
of the participant's average compensation in their highest consecutive
three years of employment or $118,800, whichever is lower. This limit,
"Section 415 Maximum Benefit," is indexed annually to keep pace with
the cost of living.

<li>The second limit caps the amount of compensation that may be taken into account in calculating the pension benefit at $150,000 and is referred to as the "Maximum Includable Salary." This amount has been reduced under the Revenue Reconciliation Act from a level of $235,840 in 1993. This cap will be indexed, although the indexing will occur in increments of $ 10,000.

</ul>

The Maximum Includable Salary and Section 415 Maximum Benefit Limits
materially reduce the amount of income a highly compensated executive
could otherwise receive from a Qualified Defined Benefit Plan.<P>

<h2>Sample Pension Benefit Shortfall</h2>

Understanding how these limits can effect an executive's income is
illustrated in the following example.<P>

The benefit shortfall for three key executives of different ages and
salaries will be computed. Their employer offers a defined pension
plan with a benefit equal to 50% of the average last three years of
pay.<P>

To compute the projected shortfall for each executive we must
determine the following:

<ul type=square>

<li>Project final average salary based on current salary and a salary
increase rate

<li>Calculate the projected benefit without limitations by applying
the average salary to the benefit formula

<li>Project the maximum includable salary limit adjusted for the cost
of living

<li>Calculate the projected benefit using the pension benefit formula
and the maximum includable salary

<li>Project the Section 415 maximum benefit adjusted for inflation

<li>Calculate the qualified plan benefit due to limits

<li>Calculate the pension benefit
shortfall

</ul><P>

The table set forth below clearly illustrates
 compensation can create substantial pension shortfalls,
especially for older highly compensated executives. Our example uses a
simple plan design, however a large number of pension plans have more
complicated formulas which can include calculations for past years of
service. To accurately determine the shortfall for an executive a
complete analysis of their existing plan is essential. In addition,
once a program is implemented, it should be monitored on a yearly
basis.<P>

<pre>

									Annual	Projected	Projected	Annual	
				Salary			  Projected	Benefit	Maximum		Section 415	Benefit	Pension
			Current	Increase	RetirementFinal Avg	Without	Includable	Maximum		with	Benefit
		Age	Salary	Rate		Age	  Salary	Limits	Salary		Benefit		Limits	Shortfall

Executive	55	180,000	5%		65	  266,153	133,076	190,000		155,007		95,000	38,076
				
Executive	48	200,000	5%		65	  416,116	208,058	240,000		190,639		120,000	88,058

Executive	39	95,000	5%		65	  306,628	153,314	310,000		248,741		155,000	0


Pension Benefit Formula: 50% of the average final three years of pay	Maximum Includable Salary:	$150,000
									Section 415 Maximum Benefit:	$118,800
									Inflation Rate:			3%

</pre><P>

<h2>"The Solution" A Non-Qualified Plan</h2>

The effect of the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1993 will be to
encourage the installation of excess benefit plans and other types of
non-qualified deferred compensation programs. In situations where a
substantial shortfall exists, a non-qualified plan could be designed to
replace these lost benefits. For example, in the case of our 55 year
old executive, the non-qualified plan would pay the projected annual
shortfall of $38,076.<P>

<i><b>Informal Funding of the Plan</b></i><br>

Non-qualified plans should not be formally funded due to tax and ERISA
considerations. It is common and prudent, however for a corporation to
informally fund these plans to provide for the future liability of the
program. Mutual funds and corporate owned life insurance are
traditionally the vehicles of choice in these types of programs.<P>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

Non-Qualified "excess" benefit plans continue to play a major role in
providing highly compensated executives with pension "parity." The
recent changes in funding limits will only increase the use of this
benefit planning technique as well as all forms of non-qualified
compensation programs.<P>

<h2>Executive Compensation: Non-Qualified Excess Benefit Plans</h2>

<h3>By Don Harrington</h3>

"Excess Benefit" plans are one of the most popular forms of
non-qualified deferred compensation used to fund the shortfall created
by the limits imposed on defined benefit pension plans. Corporations
utilize defined benefit pension plans to provide adequately for their
employees post-retirement years. These plans provide a stream of
income based on the plan's benefit formula and the employee's final
salary. However, there is a problem with plans such as this. Current
tax law severely limits the amount of compensation that can be
provided to a highly compensated executive. The answer to this problem
is Non-Qualified Excess Benefit Plans. These plans can be utilized by
any company which currently uses a defined benefit plan and has highly
compensated executives.<P>

Non-qualified plans should not be formally funded due to tax and ERISA
considerations. However, it is quite common, as well as prudent, for a
corporation to informally fund these plans to provide for the future
liability of the program. Usually, mutual funds or corporate owned
life insurance are the preferred vehicle for these types of
programs.<P>

Non-Qualified Excess Benefit plans have been playing an expanding role
in the last few years. Due to the limits placed on qualified plans,
corporations have really begun to look into unqualified plans as a
means to provide for their executive's post-retirement years.<P>

<html><head><title>Executive Compensation: Split Dollar and the Executive Carve-Out Sale</title></head><body>

<h1><center><IMG  WIDTH=39 HEIGHT=29 SRC="/icon.gif"> Executive Compensation: Split Dollar and the Executive Carve-Out Sale</center></h1>

<h2><center>By <a href="/bios/harrington.html">Donald Harrington</a></center></h2>

<hr><P>

The Executive Group Term Carve-Out sales concept has become a popular
executive benefit, even in today's tough business climate. The market
has grown out of the inability of group term insurance to meet the
needs of the highly compensated executive. In addition, group term
insurance is a benefit which statistically the executive will never
use. Therefore, the cost of group term insurance to both the executive
and the corporation becomes a sunken cost.<P>

<h2>Group Term Insurance</h2>

Group term insurance is a popular benefit which companies provide to
their employees. Group insurance is well administered and
uncomplicated to implement, and in most cases, the medical
underwriting is kept to a minimum and is often "Guaranteed". In
addition, the expense of the insurance is deductible by the
employer. However, there are a number of disadvantages of group
insurance, especially for the highly compensated.<P>

<h3>Phantom Income</h3>

Employees with group term insurance must pay income tax on the value
in excess of the first $50,000. The executive is taxed based on the
IRS Section 79 Table I Rates as follows:<P>

<pre>

			AMOUNT ANNUALLY
			TAXABLE PER 1,000
	AGES		OF COVERAGE

	45-49		3.48
	50-54		5.76
	55.59		9.00
	60-64		14.04
	6569		25.20
	70+		45.12

</pre>

This benefit becomes expensive for executives with large amounts of
group insurance, especially as the individual gets older.<P>

For example, an executive age 45 with $500,000 of excess group term
coverage will have taxable income between age 45-64 of $80,700. In a
40% tax bracket, the executive will spend approximately $32,280 in
taxes for a benefit which statistically they will never use.<P>

In addition to the phantom income the executive will be charged, there
are a number of other disadvantages associated with group term
insurance, as follows:<P>

<h3>Sunken Cost</h3>

Most employees take their group term benefit for granted. From the
employers perspective, the group term is an expense that has no real
measurable return<P>

<h3>Lack of Portability</h3>

Group term insurance benefits are not portable and an executive may
not be insurable at standard rates. Especially in today's environment
of layoffs and restructuring, a program which is portable, would be
well received.<P>

<h2>The Solution: An Executive Split Dollar Plan</h2>

An Executive Split Dollar plan is a more efficient use of both the
executive's and the corporation's dollars, and provides for a
permanent form of protection pre- and post- retirement for the
participants' beneficiaries. The main features of the program are:<P>

<ul type=disc>
<li>Executive is taxed at low cost term rates instead of the
government Table I rates
<li>Provides post-retirement death protection
<li>Benefit can be portable
<li>Death benefit is received tax-free
<li>Employer can recover all of its cost
<li>Proceeds can be excluded from the estate
</ul>

<h3>Plan Mechanics</h3>

The most common plan design is an Equity (Collateral Assignment) split
dollar program. The executive will apply for and own a permanent
insurance policy on his or her life. The corporation will pay the
premium on the policy less the executive contribution, which is the
economic benefit derived from the program. The executive will
collaterally assign back to the corporation an interest in the
policies cash value and death benefit equal to its cumulative premium
payments.<P>

The level of insurance coverage is determined based on the amount
of excess coverage (above $50,000) the executive would have under
their current group term insurance program.<P>

At retirement or year 16, whichever is longer, the corporation will be
reimbursed for its cumulative premiums by "rolling out" the policy. It
is important not to rollout the policy prior to year 16 so as to
avoid violating the forced out gain rules under IRC section 7702.<P>

Once the corporation is reimbursed for its cost of the program, the
collateral assignment is released and the executive will then own 100%
of the policy.<P>

The following example outlines the advantage of a Split Dollar Program
to both the corporation and the executives:<P>

<b>ASSUMPTIONS:</b>

<ul type=disc>
<li>Executive age: 45
<li>Excess Group Term coverage of: $300,000
<li>Coverage increase rate: 3 %
<li>Corporate tax bracket: 40%
<li>Executive tax bracket: 40%
<li>Post Retirement Coverage: 50% of final benefit
<li>Group Term cost: 60% discount to NY table Y mortality rates
<li>Corporate use of funds: 3% after tax
<li>Insurance Policy = High cash value policy
</ul>

<pre>

</pre>


<h3>Executive</h3>

Under the Split Dollar Program, the executive will have a total cost
of $17,075, which is based on the projected contribution as measured
by the imputed income of the plan. Under the Existing group term
program, the executive would have a net cost of $28,106, which
represents the after tax cost of the Table I income. The split dollar
program will save the executive $ 11,031 in taxes, and produce an
illustrated cash value of $202,460 at age 65. This will support a
death benefit post retirement in excess of $400,000 to age 98 without
further premium payments (under current assumptions).<P>

<h3>Corporation</h3>

The Split Dollar Program will turn an expense, group term insurance,
into an asset. Table I outlines the effect on corporate earnings of
the Split Dollar Program.<P>

It is clear to see that not only did the corporation recover its
entire cost of the program ($146,043) at Roll-Out, but they also saved
$57,332 in after tax group term savings. The group term savings will
be more than sufficient to reimburse the corporation for its use of
funds (3% after tax) under the Split Dollar Plan.<P>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

An Executive Carve-Out Program is an attractive alternative to excess
group term coverage. The use of a Split Dollar Program is an efficient
use of both the corporation's and executive's funds to provide the
executive benefit.<P>

In addition, the Split Dollar Carve-Out program can be incorporated
into other post-retirement programs such as, Supplemental Executive
Retirement Plans (SERP'S).<P>

<h2>Executive Compensation: Split Dollar and the Executive Carve-Out Sale</h2>

<h3>By Don Harrington</h3>

The Executive Group Term Carve-Out sales concept has become a very
popular executive benefit. This has occurred because of group term
insurance's inability to meet the needs of the highly compensated
executive. When combined with the fact that, statistically, group term
insurance is a benefit which executives do not use, it is readily
apparent that there was quite a gap for a new type of plan to fill.<P>

Group term insurance is a popular benefit which companies provide to
their employees. On the upside, group insurance is well administered
and uncomplicated to implement. Additionally, the medical underwriting
is kept to a minimum and is often "guaranteed". However, there are
quite a few problems with this type of insurance. First off,
executives must pay income tax on the amount of coverage they have
over $50,000. Furthermore, most employees take their group term
benefit for granted and employer's perceive it as a sunken cost with
no measurable return. Another factor which is especially important in
today's economic environment is portability. Group term insurance is
not portable, and, as such, executives seek an alternative.<P>

An executive split dollar plan utilizes both the executive's and the
corporation's dollars, providing a permanent form of pre- and
post-retirement protection. There are many benefits to this plan
including: post-retirement death protection, benefit can be portable,
employer can recover all of the costs, and proceeds can be excluded
from the estate.<P>

The most popular form of this type of plan is an Equity (Collateral
Assignment) split dollar program. The executive will own a permanent
insurance policy on his life. The corporation will then pay the
premium on the policy less the executive contribution, which is the
economic benefit derived from the program. The executive will then
collaterally assign back to the company an interest in the cash value
of his policy, as well as part of the death benefit. Combined, these
two factors will equal the company's contributions in the form of
premium payments. At retirement or year 16, whichever is longer, the
corporation will be reimbursed for its cumulative premiums by "rolling
out" the policy. Once the corporation is paid off, the executive owns
100% of the policy.<P>

An Executive Carve-Out Program is an attractive alternative to excess
group term coverage. The use of a Split Dollar Program is an efficient
use of both the executive's, and the corporation's money in an effort
to provide the best possible benefits for the executive.<P>

Planning: Financial Fitness Check</center></h1>

<h2><center>By <a href="/FNEA.html#sheehan">Daniel D. Sheehan</a>, CFP</center></h2>

<hr><P>

While it's true that some folks actually have the time and energy to
pore over their investments, check share prices and net asset values
daily in The Wall Street Journal, and touch base with their brokers
and insurance agents on a regular basis, most of us are just too
busy.<P>

After working eight (or more) hours in a demanding professional
position, fulfilling myriad work and social obligations, taxiing
youngsters to ballet, Little League, and music lessons, and (finally)
tucking them into bed, there's not much time or energy left for
thoughtful, detailed financial management. As one busy parent recently
put it, "Not much planning goes on -- we just try to save something
every month so we'll have a cushion when it's time for college and
retirement."<P>

This couple is not alone in their struggle to maximize savings and
plan for the future. A recent survey by economists at the University
of Pennsylvania and Boston University suggests that Americans "are now
saving at less that one quarter of the rate observed in the 1950s and
1960s and less than one-fifth the rate of Japan and many other
developed countries."<P>

Yet, without some planning, today's two-income couples with children
may unknowingly be putting themselves and their families at risk.<P>

Here's a quick 5-minute check you can do on the train to work or at
home in your favorite easy chair (once the kids are asleep). By
looking at your income protection needs, college cost considerations,
retirement savings strategies, and long-term care options, this brief
review can help you pinpoint any weak spots in your current financial
picture. Once you do, you can focus your precious time and energy
where it counts.<P>

<ul type=disc>

<li><b>Are both of your incomes protected?</b><P>

If you both work, chances are that the second income is now essential
to your family's lifestyle. So the long-term loss of one paycheck
could have serious financial consequences. That's why an emergency
fund plus adequate life insurance and disability income insurance are
at the top ofthe list of "must haves" for financial health.<P>

For your emergency fund, a cash reserve that covers two to six months
of living expenses should be adequate. Make sure this money is readily
available by keeping it in a money market or similarly liquid
investment. You may need access to this extra cash during a job change
or career transition.<P>

While you probably have basic life insurance and short-term disability
coverage where you work now -- you may want to supplement this with
personally-owned policies that won't go away if you change jobs. With
so many life insurance options now available to you, including
policies that insure two people at once and those that build cash
values at current interest rates, you're sure to find one that meets
your particular needs.<P>

Think about adding a long-term disability insurance policy that can
provide income to your family if you should become ill or
disabled. This long-term policy will kick in when your employer's
standard short-term coverage runs out. It can be a life saver if an
illness or injury keeps you from working for more than a few
months.<P>

<li><b>Have you started socking something away for future college costs?</b><P>

A recent survey by the International Association of Financial Planners
(IAFP) shows that Americans rank education number two on their list of
financial priorities. (Housing, by the way, is number one.) At the
same time, college costs continue to escalate. This year, in fact, the
cost of a single 4-year private college education just broke the
$100,000 barrier.<P>

While the price tag for a college degree can be daunting, it's
certainly not hopeless. Loans, financial aid, and a second mortgage
can cover a large portion. To cover the rest, think about starting a
college savings program and contributing to it regularly. The sooner
you start, of course, the better, because compound interest helps even
a small, regular investment grow substantially over time.<P>

If you establish your child's college fund as a custodial account
under the Uniform Gift to Minor's Act (UGMA), there may be tax savings
as well. But remember, once your offspring reaches 18, he or she gains
full control over all the money in this account.<P>

<li><b>What about retirement?</b><P>

If paying for college seems somewhat far away, retirement probably
seems even farther. But if it comes on the heels of your child's
education, both of you may not have enough time to fund your
retirement adequately.  If you're also members of the "sandwich
generation" -- caught between caring for your children and helping
your parents financially -- you'll have even less time and money to
build toward retirement.<P>

Most experts now suggest that you'll need 60% to 80% of your
pre-retirement income to enjoy a comfortable retirement -- perhaps
more if you plan to travel or pursue a special interest. Between
retiring early and living longer than ever before, you may need your
retirement income to last for a good many years.<P>

While the traditional sources, including employer pensions, 401(k),
and Social Security, will provide a base, you'll most likely need some
additional income from personal savings to reach your retirement
target. Today's retirees, in fact, are finding that nearly 35% of
their income must come from these other sources.<P>

Your life insurance cash value can provide one source of additional
income as can a personal IRA (or a Simplified Employee Pension (SEP)
or Keogh if you're self-employed). And even if your IRA contribution
is not tax-deductible because you already have a pension plan, it is
tax-deferred so your money compounds tax-free until your
retirement. An annuity also offers the advantage of tax-deferred
earnings plus fewer limitations on how much you can contribute each
year.<P>

Your insurance agent or investment advisor can help you decide which
alternative is the most cost-effective for your situation.<P>

<li><b>Have you planned for long-term care?</b><P>

Current estimates suggest that 54% of women and 30% of men over age 65
will require nursing home care at some time. (If you're helping your
own parents with this expense, you already know the burden this can
place on your own children.)<P>

One easy solution is an accelerated benefits rider attached to your
existing life insurance policy that allows you to use policy cash
values in case of terminal illness. Another option may be to purchase
a Long Term Care insurance policy. Ask your insurance agent or
financial advisor for recommendations and information.<P>

</ul>

Now that you've finished this quick financial fitness check, use it as
a guideline when you and your spouse next talk to your financial
advisor. It can help you focus your attention so the meeting is short,
productive, and to the point. You may even find you've saved enough
time to take in a movie together.<P>

Although some investors have the time to continuously follow their
investments and constantly adapt and modify their portfolio in order
to optimize their investments, most investors don't. However, without
some planning, investors and individuals in investment of general are
putting themselves, as well as their families at risk. Even with
minimum investment of time, there are some important factors which
should be considered.<P>

Income protection is a very important topic. In order to ensure
financial health, there are certain, "must haves." These include an
emergency fluid, adequate life insurance, and disability income
insurance. Although most people receive some sort of short-term
disability coverage as well as life insurance it is usually not
enough.<P>

Education continues to be one of the top priorities for many
Americans. However, the cost of college continues to escalate, already
having reached six digits for four years of private schooling. A large
portion of this can be covered by savings, loans, financial aid, and a
second mortgage. However, to ensure that fluids will be available when
needed, it is recommended that families start college savings
programs, and contribute to them regularly. Obviously, the earlier a
program like this is started, the more it is worth.<P>

Retirement is also a major concern right now. Experts suggest that an
individual will need 60% to 80% of their pre-retirement income to
enjoy a comfortable retirement. Although traditional sources, such as
employer pensions, 401(k) plans, and social security can provide a
significant amount to retirees, retirees are quickly finding that
almost 35% of their income must come from other sources. Plans like
cash value life insurance, personal IRAs, simplified Employee
Pensions, or Keoghs can make up this difference.<P>

Another important issue to consider is long-term care. Evidence
suggests that 54% of women and 30% of men over the age of 65 will
require nursing home care at some point in time. An easy way to be
prepared for this eventuality is to get an accelerated benefits rider
on existing life insurance policies that allow the use of policy cash
values in the case of terminal illness. Another option is to simply
purchase a Long Term Care insurance policy.<P>

There are many financial concerns and priorities in people's
lives. This is why it is important to consider what the priorities
are, and, how they can be financed.<P>

<h2><center>By <a href="/bios/henry.html">Vaughn W. Henry</a></center></h2>

<hr><P>

Although nobody likes to enter a marriage thinking about the potential
for problems, they happen. It's a statistical probability that some
marriages will fail, no matter how genuine the couple's romantic
intentions. Second and third marriages are particularly prone to
uncertainty, as both parties are usually older and less
flexible. There are often children from previous relationships and the
couple may bring considerable assets or debts into this new
marriage. It is these commingled assets and liabilities that cause
serious disputes when the union starts to split apart. Deciding early
on what is mine, yours and ours is important, otherwise it becomes a
constant source of irritation in a blended family. To deal with
complex financial problems while both parties are alive is difficult;
it's overwhelming to deal with family issues after a death.<P>

While property held in joint tenancy passes to the surviving owner,
any remaining assets may be up for grabs. Unless the surviving spouse
has waived the statutory right to the deceased's estate, any children
from an earlier marriage may be effectively disinherited. This right
to disclaim effectively puts the step-parent in line for one-half of
the estate, despite the late spouse's original intentions. Worse yet,
the children of the surviving spouse may ultimately walk off with the
bulk of both estates, leaving the first family cut out of the loop.<P>

This unpalatable situation can be remedied with a series of trusts
designed to preserve each family's original assets. Notably, the QTIP
(Qualified Terminable Interest Property) or ABC Trust allows each
spouse to direct how their assets will be distributed, while still
providing lifetime security for the surviving marriage partner. Assets
placed in a properly drafted QTIP Trust qualify for the unlimited
marital deduction, and this action postpones any estate taxes normally
due at the first death. The QTIP also reduces the possibility of
assets passing out of the original family's control due to a future
remarriage of the surviving spouse. This specialized trust is
particularly useful in protecting children of a previous marriage from
being disinherited by the surviving step-parent.<P>

Less obvious problems in second marriages include being inattentive
about beneficiary designations on insurance policies and retirement
plans. All too often, the ex-spouse receives an unexpected windfall,
while leaving estate taxes and final expenses up to the new
family. Most companies will provide beneficiary change forms for
insurance, annuities and qualified retirement plans, so there is no
excuse for making this oversight.<P>

Estates of married couples that are under $600,000 now (including life
insurance) and not likely to exceed this amount in the future use
different planning techniques. While smaller estates will generally
not benefit tax-wise from either the traditional Credit Shelter or
QTIP Trust, a living trust and durable powers of attorney are still
valuable tools. Families below the federal estate tax threshold still
can unintentionally lose assets to another family, and this is a
serious problem requiring good planning.<P>

Many legal specialists recommend prenuptial agreements to minimize
potential disputes and protect assets. However, some clients are
uncomfortable with the complete disclosure needed to make these
contracts binding. Other planners suggest the use of Family Limited
Partnerships (FLP) as a way to protect assets and insulate the
children of previous marriages. Assets held in these specialized
partnerships allow the parent, as general partners, to still control
both income and management. Children, on the other hand, as limited
partners, are treated as passive investors in the family assets. Since
the future heirs already have paper ownership of the family assets,
there is little chance of losing them to another family. Of special
interest to parents is the creditor protection provided to family
business assets held by a FLP. Asset protection for limited partners
is based on the inability to force a partnership to relinquish
property. Although a judge may issue a charging order that allows a
creditor access to the partnership distributions, the creditor only
takes the place of the limited partner. However, the general partner
still controls the timing of income distributions. As a result,
creditors may find themselves in the unpleasant position of receiving
tax liabilities from the partnership, but having no income distributed
to pay the bill. Most creditors would prefer to avoid that situation,
and this provides heirs with some leverage for negotiations.<P>

For the more determined clients, an international trust may provide a
mechanism to better protect and control the original family's
assets. Although there are a lot of hoops to jump through in order to
keep everything legal, these trusts offer many advantages for
individuals with potentially big exposures. To keep from conveying
property fraudulently, planning must occur before any litigation or
threat of legal action occurs. The major advantage to holding assets
off-shore lies in the difficulty of attaching assets in any legal
action. Most judges feel that such assets are held outside of their
jurisdiction and not subject to the court's control. Other asset
protection features of these trusts include blocking frivolous
litigation by forcing all proceedings to occur in the foreign country
where the trust is located. This hurdle prevents most lawsuits from
moving in directions unfavorable to the client. To evaluate the best
use of asset protection strategies and integrated estate planning,
experienced legal, tax and financial advisors should be consulted.<P>

<h2>Financial Planning: Planning for the Second Time
Around</h2>

<h3>By <a href="/bios/henry.html">Vaughn W. Henry</a></h3>

Although nobody enjoys considering the potential for divorce when
entering into a marriage, divorces do occur. Regardless of how sincere
a couple's feelings may be, there is a significant chance that the
marriage will end in divorce. As such, it is necessary to consider the
implications of a divorce.<P>

Estate planning is difficult enough, but once second and third spouses
enter the picture, along with their children, estate planning becomes
even more complex. There are many things to consider. Any property
held in joint tenancy passes to the surviving owner. The rest of the
assets, however, may be up for grabs. Potentially, any children from
an earlier marriage may be disinherited. Ultimately, the children of
the surviving spouse may end up with the bulk of both family estates.<P>

There are remedies to this situation. One of these is the QTIP
(Qualified Terminable Interest Property) or ABC Trust. This allows
each spouse to direct how their assets will be distributed, while
still providing for the lifetime security of their spouse. Assets
placed in a QTIP Trust qualify for the unlimited marital
deduction. This trust also reduces the possibility of the assets
passing out of the original families control due to the future
remarriage of the spouse.<P>

Another common problem is that people are often inattentive to
beneficiary designations on insurance policies and retirement
plans. All too often, this simple mistake results in an ex-spouse's
windfall, while the new family must deal with the estate taxes.<P>

Estates of couples that are under $600,000, and are not likely to
increase beyond that mark, need to use different planning
techniques. Living trusts and durable powers of attorney may be very
valuable tools in this situation. Families below the federal estate
tax threshold can still lose assets to another family.<P>

Although many legal specialists advise clients to get prenuptial
agreements to minimize potential disputes, many people are
uncomfortable with that idea. An alternative may be to set up a Family
Limited Partnership. This would effectively protect assets and
insulate the children of a previous marriage.<P>

For those whose potential exposure is great, an international trust
can be a powerful tool. Although it is somewhat difficult to establish
an international trust, the advantages of one are substantial. Once an
international trust is set up, they can usually protect one's assets
from most litigation. Most judges feel that the assets are outside of
their jurisdiction and are thus not subject to the court's
control. Additionally, frivolous litigation can be minimized by
forcing all proceedings to occur in the foreign country in which the
trust exists.<P>

Second marriages can add a host of new problems to financial
planning. However, with the proper advisors, and tools such as QTIP,
Family Limited Partnerships, and international trusts, these problems
can be dealt with in a way which is most beneficial to the client.<P>

<h1><center><IMG  WIDTH=39 HEIGHT=29 SRC="/icon.gif"> Insurance Planning: Disability
Income Protection: Never Leave Work Without It</center></h1>

<h2><center>By <a href="/FNEA.html#sheehan">Daniel D. Sheehan</a>, CFP</center></h2>

<hr><P>

How are you going to pay the bills if you're injured and unable to
work for a long period of time? Unless your employer continues your
income or you're independently wealthy, you could be facing a
financial nightmare. For most people, the answer is disability income
insurance (DI) -- insurance that pays your bills and provides income
for you and your family to live on until you're able to return to
work.<P>

People often react to disability by saying, "it will never happen to
me." But statistics show that disability is a real risk faced by
virtually everyone. In fact, one of every three members of the
workforce now age 35 will suffer a longterm disability (90 days or
more) before retirement.<P>

Despite the need for DI, most people still do not have adequate DI
protection. In fact, four of every five workers between age 25 and 64
do not have disability income insurance beyond what might be provided
under Social Security. Many of those who do have long-term coverage do
not have sufficient amounts of coverage to adequately provide for
their total financial needs.<P>

The first step in taking action against this potential financial
disaster is to seek out the proper coverage to meet your needs. While
this article will outline some major points you need to know to choose
the right DI insurance for you, you should also consider meeting with
a financial representative who will help you identify your disability
income insurance needs.<P>

Once you've made the decision to purchase a policy, you need to
determine how much you should purchase. To start, you should estimate
your present monthly expenses and sources of income to meet those
expenses should you suddenly become disabled. The difference between
the two figures will guide you to the amount of additional DI needed
to fill the void, and it may be safer to consider a policy that more
than meets that figure.<P>

<b>Shopping for DI Insurance</b><P>

Now that you have an understanding of how much DI insurance to buy,
you must consider what type of policy is right for you. To make an
educated decision, a basic understanding of terms used in disability
income contracts is essential.<P>

A <i>non-cancellable, guaranteed renewable policy </i> means that the
policy can never be cancelled and the premium rate is guaranteed to
age 65. While policies with these provisions are generally more
expensive than ones in which the insurer has the option of refusing
renewal, the policy's extra cost is often worth it.<P>

<i>Definitions of disability </i> are the four basic conditions under
which disability benefits may be paid. First, the "any occupation"
definition allows you to collect only if you are unable to work at any
position for which you are reasonably fitted by education, training,
and/or experience. Second, the "regular occupation" definition allows
you to collect disability payments if you can't perform your current
duties. Third, and most favorable, the "own occupation" definition
allows you to collect the full Total Disability Benefit if you can't
perform your current duties, even if you are working in a different
occupation. Fourth, under an income replacement policy, if you lose a
certain percent of income due to disability, you could collect a
percentage of the benefit as a ratio of the difference between your
former earnings and whatever income you can earn after disability.<P>

<b>Other Things to Consider</b><P>

There are also many optional riders available to help you customize
your coverage to meet your exact needs and budget.<P>

Inflation poses a twin threat to disability income plans. First, the
purchasing power of coverage can be eroded over time, making the
disability policy inadequate should a claim occur. An <i>Automatic
Increase Benefit </i> will help maintain that purchasing power. It
will automatically increase the monthly benefit by specified
percentage for a certain number of years. The second threat that
inflation poses is that it can erode the purchasing power of benefits
currently being paid out. A <i>Cost-of-Living Rider </i> will increase
your monthly benefit while disabled. In addition, if your income, is
going to increase dramatically in the future, a <i>Future Income
Option Rider </i> may be desirable. This rider would allow you to
purchase additional benefits, based on increased income and
maximums.<P>

Most disabilities begin with a total loss of earnings power, but some
do not! If your earnings ability would be impaired if you could only
work part-time, you may want to consider a <i>Residual Disability
Rider </i> which will supplement the loss of earnings.<P>

A <i>Lifetime Disability Income Rider </i> can guarantee that your
retirement savings will not be depleted if you were struck with a
long-term disability during your early fifties. It will provide for
the continuation of benefits for life as long as your total disability
started before a specified age.<P>

Also available are Premium Refund Benefits, Supplemental Social
Insurance Benefits, Hospital Confinement Benefits, and Reduced
Elimination Period Options.<P>

In conclusion, the financial planning process begins with managing
your risk effectively. Whether you are a professional or small
business owner, it is only after you adequately insure your income,
life, and property that you should consider the other areas of the
financial planning process. Keep in mind, however, that your earning
power is the foundation on top of which all other future investments
must be built.<P>

<h2><IMG  WIDTH=39 HEIGHT=29 SRC="/icon.gif"> <i>Executive Summary</i></h2>
<h2>Insurance Planning: Disability Income Protection: Never Leave Work Without It</h2>

<h3>By <a href="/FNEA.html#sheehan">Daniel D. Sheehan</a>, CFP</h3>

One out of every three members of the workforce who are now 35 years
old will suffer a long-term disability (90 days or more) before
retirement. Considering this fact, it is surprising that most people
do not have adequate disability insurance. Disability insurance covers
expenses such as bills, as well as supplying individuals and their
families with income until the insured individual can return to
work.<P>

The first concern when purchasing disability insurance is to estimate
present monthly expenses, as well as sources of income which could
meet those expenses in case of disability. The difference between
these two figures is the additional amount of disability insurance
needed. Once the amount needed is understood, it is time to consider
what type of policy is needed. To do this, one must understand the
terms used in insurance. For instance, a non-cancelable, guaranteed
renewal policy means that the policy can never be canceled and that
the premium rate is guaranteed until the insured reaches the age of
65. One of the most important factors to consider is how "disability"
is defined. There are four basic definitions of disability. First ow,
there is the "any occupation" definition. This means that in order to
collect, an individual must be unable to work in any capacity. The
second definition, "regular occupation," allows for the collection of
disability payments if an individual cannot perform their duties. The
third definition, "own occupation," is by far the most favorable
because it allows for the collection of full benefits if an individual
cannot perform their current duties, regardless of whether or not they
are working in a different occupation. The fourth is an income
replacement policy where any percentage of income lost due to
disability would make the insured eligible to collect a percentage of
the benefit as a ratio of the difference between former earnings and
income earned after disability.<P>

Along with the different types of basic policies, there are also many
optional riders which can be used to customize the individual
policies. The Automatic Increase Benefit and the Cost-of-Living Rider
both seek to offset inflation by steadily increasing benefits. A
Future Income Option Provider makes it possible to purchase increased
benefits at a later time. If partial disability is a question needing
to be addressed, a residual Disability Rider will provide benefits for
those whose disability limits them to part-time work. Additionally, a
Lifetime Disability Provider can guarantee benefits after retirement
as long as total disability begins before a particular age.<P>

Before any other investment possibilities are considered, earning
power must be secured. This is what makes disability insurance so
important. Disability insurance allows individuals to confidently
proceed with their financial planning, knowing that their earning
power will not be compromised by disability.<P>

<h1><center><IMG  WIDTH=39 HEIGHT=29 SRC="/icon.gif"> When First to Die Life Insurance is
Right For You</center></h1>

<h2><center>By <a href="/FNEA.html#sheehan">Daniel D. Sheehan</a>, CFP</center></h2>

<hr><P>

Over the last two years, first-to-die life insurance, insurance that
covers two to several lives, has been gaining a reputation as one of
the most innovative products to hit the financial services marketplace
in a long time. Today it's being hailed by many as "the life insurance
product of the '90s."<P>

In a great many situations there is a need to insure more than one
life--but only one death benefit is necessary. If you take a close
look at first-to-die life insurance you'll conclude that the product
is not only gaining a good reputation but, more important, it's
earning one.<P>

First-to-die is earning its reputation because it can address a
variety of business and personal financial needs at less cost -- 20 to
40 percent less-than people would pay to purchase multiple single life
policies to solve the same financial problems. So first-to-die life
insurance can be a real bargain.<P>

Here is a closer look at first-to-die to see if it fits your
needs--focusing first on business needs and then on personal
needs. Please consider these two basic questions:<P>

<ul>
<li>Will first-to-die cover your needs adequately?
<li>Will first-to-die save you money?
</ul>

<b>Business Applications</b><P>

A growing number of businesses are finding it makes sense and saves
money to use first-to-die life insurance to fund buy/sell agreements
and for multiple key person insurance.<P>

Life insurance is often used to fund stock redemption and cross
purchase buy/sell agreements should a partner or a stockholder in a
business die. In some situations, though, multiple single life
policies can be too expensive and administratively cumbersome. For
example, for a group of eight partners or owners, it can result in up
to 56 policies! That is because the owners need coverage on the other
seven.<P>

First-to-die insurance could do it with one policy at a more
affordable price. Upon the first death, the surviving partners use the
death benefit proceeds to purchase the deceased owner's interest, and
the coverage can be continued with a new policy to fund subsequent
buy-outs.<P>

First-to-die is also becoming increasingly popular in funding key
person insurance. Typically, separate policies on key persons are
owned and paid for by the company, and death proceeds are paid to the
company. However, only one first-to-die policy maybe necessary at a
more affordable price than multiple single life policies.<P>

There can be some tax questions that may arise in using first-to-die
in these situations, so you should consult with your financial
advisors in setting up these plans.<P>

<b>The Home Front</b><P>

First-to-die policies are becoming increasingly attractive to
consumers looking for a more affordable way to meet their personal
financial needs and obligations. Again, in the personal market as in
the business world, first-to-die can be used in many situations where
more than one person must be insured, but only one death benefit is
actually needed.<P>

The most common use for first-to-die on the home front is to protect
dual income couples. First-to-die life insurance can be used to meet
almost any financial need that arises when the first spouse
dies. These needs include income protection, mortgage cancelation,
funds for child care, education funding, grandparent gifting, pension
maximization and estate planning.<P>

<b>Key Benefits and Features</b><P>

As you consider first-to-die insurance you'll want to look into some
key features and benefits. For example, savings of up to 40 percent
could be achieved, compared to insuring each of the people
individually. Plus, the first-to-die policy is normally more
competitive than term insurance when you hold the policy more than 10
years.<P>

Some key features of The New England's policy called First Provider
include the option of choosing between fixed and flexible premium
payments. The policy also gives the option of increasing or level
death benefits. You'll also want to look for the ability to choose
different coverage levels for each of the insureds, using term
insurance riders. Remember the features of the policy will vary by
company so you'll want to compare products with the help of your
insurance agent.<P>

In conclusion, it should be noted that first-to-die is not a product
for everyone in every situation. Buying any financial product can be
compared to getting fitted for a new suit, and first-to-die is no
exception. It has to fit before you buy because even the best product
is no bargain if it doesn't fit. Therefore, the advantages of a
first-to-die contract should always be compared to the advantages of
single life contracts.<P>

However, chances are first-to-die might fit one of your home or
business needs and save you some money!<P>

<h2>When First to Die Life Insurance is Right For You</h2>

<h3>By <a href="/FNEA.html#sheehan">Daniel D. Sheehan</a>, CFP</h3>

Over the past four years, first-to-die life insurance has been
becoming more and more popular as a practical, low cost way to cover
two or more lives. This innovative coverage has been hailed as the
life insurance product of the nineties. It fills the need for insuring
multiple lives when only one death benefit is necessary. First-to-die
life insurance, with its costs being 2O%-4O% less than multiple single
life policies, addresses a variety of both business and personal
issues.<P>

First-to-die is being used more and more by businesses to fund
buy/sell agreements and for multiple key person insurance. By using
first-to-die policies, businesses can cut the amount of separate
policies they need to a fraction of what would have been necessary
using multiple single life policies. This cuts out much of the cost as
well as the administrative tasks of dealing with such a large numbers
of policies.<P>

First-to-die is also becoming increasingly more attractive to personal
consumers. First-to-die can, and is, often used to protect dual income
couples. It can provide for any financial need that occurs after the
first spouse dies, such as mortgage cancelation, funds for child
care, education funding, and a host of others.<P>

First-to-die life insurance has many practical features. The savings
when compared to multiple single life policies can be up to 40%. In
addition, the first-to-die policy is more competitive than term when
you hold the policy for more than 10 years. However, first-to-die is
not the proper type of coverage for everyone. First-to-die should be
compared to other life insurance policies to see which one best suits
an individual or organizations needs.<P>

Funds</title></head><body>

<h1><center><IMG  WIDTH=39 HEIGHT=29 SRC="/icon.gif"> Institutional Asset Class Mutual
Funds: A Low Cost Alternative</center></h1>

<i><center>This lower-cost segment of the mutual fund industry may
offer planners new opportunities for adding value to client investment
portfolios.</center></i><P>

<h3><center>By <a href="/bios/bowen.html">John J. Bowen</a>, Jr, CFP.</center></h3>

<hr><P>

Many financial planners are attempting to identify ways in which they
can add substantial value to the investment portfolios of clients. An
often overlooked strategy is die utilization of institutional asset
class mutual funds. These large mutual funds represent whole market
segments of securities with similar risk characteristics and can he
used as effective tools to achieve diversification. Since such mutual
funds are not available to the general public, most planners have
never even heard of them. However, planners now have access to these
funds for their clients through Charles Schwab, Fidelity, and other
securities firms.<P>

When our firm first started offering investment strategies to our
clients, we were forced to use retail asset class mutual funds, but
found that they had significant structural problems. It wasn't until
we discovered institutional asset class mutual funds that many of
these earlier structural problems were solved, adding significant
value to our clients' investment performance. Here is what we have
learned about institutional asset class mutual funds and how planners
can use them as tools to achieve effective diversification.<P>

<hr>

<h3>Lower Operating Expenses</h3>

Institutional asset class mutual hint are true no-load mutual funds. A
true no-load mutual fund has no sales commissions when holders
purchase or redeem shares. In addition, they have no back-end lo,st,
redemption foes' or 12b-1 marketing fees. However, all no-load mutual
funds have operational expenses that include management fires and
administrative expenses. ,Th,e average retail no-load equity mutual
fund today has a total expense ratio of 1 .45% -- almost three times
greater than die average ratio hit institutional funds.1 (The expense
ratio is defined as the ratio of operating expenses to average net
assets.)<P>

In this regard, an important study by Elton and Gruber found that nor
only did retail equity mutual funds under-perform the market, but
managers reporting die highest operating expenses had the worst
performance. It seems die more mediocre the performance, the higher
the fee.<P>

<hr>

<h3>The Impact of Lower Turnover</h3>

The average retail mutual fund recorded approximately an 85% asset
turnover in 1993. Thus, if $100,000 were invested in a mutual fund,
$85,000 worth of underlying securities will have been bought and sold
during the year. This is important because each trade involves a
transaction cost -that is, a commission and/or the "bid/ask" spread --
which can easily amount to muck more than he total operating expenses
disclosed in the prospectus.<P>

Why do retail mutual funds have such high turnover? First, hey are
under tremendous pressure to perform; and second, the only way that a
mutual fund manager can add value "perceived in the market" is to
attempt to guess market turning points or identify individual
securities that may outperform the market. Both efforts create
substantial turnover. And by the law of probability, a few of them
will succeed, but most will not. In addition, a portion of the retail
public is chasing performance. moving in and out of retail mutual
funds and forcing managers to buy and sell more often than they would
prefer.<P>

What happens when mutual fund managers succeed? They are highlighted
in the financial press and money comes rating in. Who pays the cost of
investing these new funds? The existing shareholders bear the burden,
not the new investors. The new shareholders are going to bay at
today's net asset prices (NAV) and the fund manager will have to buy
securities for new investors. The trading cost of investing that
amount of new money will be significant. Indeed, the money managers
may also exert some market impact and drive up the prices of the very
stock they are purchasing with new inflows of funds. The market
effects are likely to be significant if he mutual fund, for example,
invests in small company stocks. Therefore, planners and heir clients
who take a long-term perspective and stay in a fund that has "hot
money" coming in, will bear the cost.<P>

What happens when the performance is poor? The fund may be featured
again on the cover of The Wall Street Journal, but in this case some
investors may withdraw money from the fund. Who pays hat oust? The
exiting shareholders are able to redeem at NAV, so the cost of selling
out that portfolio is once again borne by existing
shareholders. Institutional investors won't put up with this, so they
will not invest in publicly available funds.<P>

Elton and Gruber studied turnover among mutual funds.3 Not
surprisingly, they found that the greater the turnover the more
negative the managerial performance, as measured by alpha. Financial
advisors necessarily seek mutual funds with positive alphas. If not,
they can simply invent clients' funds in an index. mutual fund for a
particular market segment and obtain an implied alpha of zero. At
least index funds will turn in a performance that is much better than
the negative alphas recorded by so many other types of mutual funds.<P>

To address the turnover issue, institutional investors significantly
increased their return by demanding a separate group of mutual funds
for institutions. However, access solved only half the problem. Our
clients, unlike most institutions, were also subject to tax. We had to
determine the effectiveness of institutional asset class mutual funds
in a taxable environment.<P>

Mutual funds are required to distribute 98% of their taxable income
each year, including realized capital pins, to remain tax exempt If a
mutual fund has a turnover of 80% per year, on average, it will
realize 80% of the capital gain' and that will be taxable each
year. On the other hand, the average turnover of institutional asset
class funds is approximately 16%. In other words, 84% of the taxable
gains are deferred until recognized. <P>

<hr>

<h3>Studies on the Impact of Taxes</h3>

Two recent academic studies indicate that mutual fund capital gains
and dividends will reduce after-tax returns for shareholders, and that
asset class mutual funds can protect against those tax losses. These
studies demonstrate that tax efficiency is an important factor to
consider in equity mutual fund selection. The finding is particularly
significant since numerous mutual funds, in their quest for top
performance, may reduce their shareholders' potential after-tax
returns by producing high taxable distributions, such as capital gains
resulting from frequent buying and selling of appreciated
securities. Dividends, taxed as ordinary income, may also reduce
potential after-tax reruns.<P>

In one study commissioned by Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. and conducted
by John B. Shoven, Professor of Economics at Stanford University and
Joel M. Dickson, a Stanford Ph.D. candidate, taxable distributions
'were found to have an impact on the rates of return of many
well-known retail equity mutual funds.4 The study measured the
performance of 62 equity funds for he 30-year period from 1963 through
the end of 1992. It found that the high-tax investor who reinvested
only slier-tax distributions would end up with accumulated wealth per
dollar invested equal to less than half (45%) of he funds' published
performances. An investor in the middle tax bracket would experience
only 55% of the performance published by the funds.<P>

Another study, by Robert H. Jeffrey and Robert D. Arnott, concluded that
extremely low portfolio turnover can be a factor in improving a fund's
potential after-tax performance.5 Asset class funds typically have
very low portfolio turnover, which translates into less frequent
trading, and therefore may result in lower capital gains. Low turnover
may also benefit shareholders by holding down trading costs.<P>

Jeffrey and Arnott compared she performance of large, actively managed
equity mutual funds with a passively managed equity index. fund from
1982 to 1991. They found that only 21% (15 of the 72 equity funds)
outperformed the index fund on a pre-tax basis during that period. Only
5 (of the 72 funds) outperformed an index fund after factoring in
taxes. The Jeffrey and Arnott study does raise he point that, despite
high turnover and capital gains distributions, some funds can produce
higher after-tax returns than funds with low portfolio turnover and no
capital gains distributions. This was demonstrated by the five funds in
the Jeffrey study that out-paced the after-tax returns of an
index. fund over the nine years examined. Jeffrey and Arnott note'
however, that it may be difficult to predict which funds will exhibit
that performance. "While it is tempting to assume that these
exceptions are evidence that Lit can he done' (i.e., that funds
producing superior after-tax returns can be identified ten years in
advance), the reality is that the chances of success are slim at
best."<P>

The Jeffrey and Arnott study concluded that "Passive indexing is a
very difficult strategy to best on an alter-tax basis, and therefore,
active taxable strategies should always be benchmarked against the
after-tax performance of an indexed alternative."<P>

<h3>Lower Trading Costs</h3>

Trading costs can be much more significant than operating expenses and
harder to determine. Consider one trade that a mutual fund might
execute over the counter in the NASDAQ market. If the stock were
currently at $10 ask and $9.50 bid, what would be the cost of buying
and selling the stock' assuming no price change? The $.50 spread
represents a 5% cost of trading on she $10 purchase price. If a
portfolio turned over 80% during the year, a cost of 80% of 5%, ma
total coat due to turnover of 4% would be incurred -a hidden expense
that can adversely affect a client's investment program.<P>

Moreover, trading costs can far exceed management fees. Trading costs
are composed of agency costs (commissions and/or hid/ark spread) and
market impact, and increase significantly for smaller company
stocks.<P>

To calculate this effect let us examine a range of sizes. As of the end
of 1993, 2,290 companies 'were listed on the NYSE. These companies
were divided into 10 equal group (deciles) bated on market
capitalization, or the market price of that issue multiplied by the
number of shares outstanding. Each decile holds 229 stocks, ranked by
their market size. American Stock Exchange and NASDAQ issues are
included in thee last two columns of Exhibit 1.<P>

General Electric Co. was the largest company listed on the NYSE, with a
market capitalization of more than $89 billion dollars at the end of
1993. The largest company in the 10th decile was Ampco Pittsburgh
Corp. with a market size of only $68 million dollars. This huge
difference in size plays a significant role in cost. The smaller the
market size, the higher the potential trading costs and the smaller
the daily trading volume.<P>

The bid/ask spread as a percentage of price shown in Exhibit 2
represents a conservative estimate of actual trading costs. This
estimate is more than 14 times as great for the smallest decile as for
the largest decile (6.82 versus 0.46). Thus, an investor purchasing at
the ask and selling at the bid would pay trading costs of 0.46% for
the largest stocks and 6.82% for the smallest stocks if the trades do
not move the market. A large order that is a significant part of the
daily trading volume is likely to move the market against the
investor, adding additional costs. The $29 million dollars in daily
trading volume of a single decile 1 stock or more exceeds the combined
volume of four hundred decile 10 stocks.<P>

The planner can calculate a very conservative trading cost estimate
for a mutual fund by multiplying its turnover ratio by the bid/ask
percentage spread for its average market capitalization. For example,
a mutual fund with an average market capitalization in the 5th decile,
with a turnover of 203%, would produce estimated hidden costs of 2.03
x 1.33% = 2.69%.<P>

<h3>Consistent Maintenance of Market Segments</h3>

It was not until the 1970s that many institutional investors demanded
index mutual funds, the forerunners of asset class funds. These first
index funds were portfolios that matched a broad-based market index
(such as Standard & Poor's 500 Index). Many institutions placed money
in index funds when they realized that efforts to beat the market
averages over the long run are futile and that their investments in
the index funds would at least keep up with the market segments in
which they had invested. The fact that most mutual funds do not
consistently perform as well as the index funds hat represent the
market is strong evidence that the market is efficient.<P>

If the financial adviser is responsible for maintaining the policy
allocation, then only mutual funds that may have relatively consistent
exposure should he considered. Institutional asset class funds are, by
their very design, consistent.<P>

Unfortunately, most financial advisors have not been adequately
exposed to institutional asset class investing. Without this exposure,
there has been little demand fort making institutional asset class
funds available. With management fees averaging only one-third the
cost of retail funds, it is unlikely that many mutual fund sponsors
will be enlightening she public. Planners who carefully explore the
advantages and availability of institutional asset class funds will
have at their disposal a major new approach for improving the results
of their clients' investments.<P>

(Summary)</title></head><body>

<h2><IMG  WIDTH=39 HEIGHT=29 SRC="/icon.gif"> <i>Executive Summary</i></h2>
<h2>Institutional Asset Class Mutual Funds: A Low-Cost Alternative</h2>

<h3>By John J. Bowen, Jr, CFP</h3>

Financial planners are constantly searching for ways in which to
increase the value of their client's portfolio. One frequently
overlooked method is the utilization of institutional asset class
mutual funds. Institutional asset class mutual funds do not have many
of the structural problems that plague retail asset class mutual
funds, and, as such, can add significantly to the value of a client's
portfolio.<P>

Institutional asset class mutual funds offer several advantages over
retail asset class mutual funds. First off; institutional funds are
true no-load mutual funds. In other words, these funds have no sales
commission when holders purchase or redeem shares. Neither do they
have back-end load, redemption fees, or 12b-l marketing fees. Although
the funds still have management and administrative expenses, they are,
on average, one-third of the average for retail funds. Another large
problem with retail funds is their high asset turnover rate (85% in
1993) and the transaction cost associated with each trade. Whether the
fund is successful or not, existing shareholders bear the cost of
other investors buying and selling the fund. Institutional investor's
solve this problem by demanding separate funds which are not publicly
available. This ability to curb the turnover rate also protects
against taxes. An average of 84% of the taxable gains are deferred
until recognized. <P>

<h1><center><IMG  WIDTH=39 HEIGHT=29 SRC="/icon.gif"> The Tax-Deferred Allure of Variable Annuities</center></h1>

<h2><center>By <a href="/FNEA.html#sheehan">Daniel D. Sheehan</a>, CFP.</center></h2>

<hr><P>

What has made the headlines as one of the most popular tax advantaged
investments for retirement? If the two words "variable annuities"
don't come to mind immediately, read on!<P>

Often misunderstood by many Americans, an annuity is simply a contract
that guarantees an income or payment for your lifetime, or for another
period you specify. Investors today are attracted to the tax deferred
growth of money invested in an annuity contract.<P>

There are two types of annuities: the fixed annuity and the variable
annuity. A fixed annuity works like a CD or savings account and is
best suited for the investor looking for interest guarantees and
safety of principal. During the accumulation period, the insurance
company sets the rate of return which remains constant for a specified
period, usually one year. After that, the rates are adjusted to
reflect market conditions, but will never fall below a minimum
guarantee amount.<P>

A variable annuity allows you to invest your money in a variety of
professionally managed fund options such as common stock, bond, and
money market funds. Plus, variable annuities readily adapt to changing
market conditions by allowing the investor to transfer monies between
the various funds -- tax free.<P>

With the variable annuity you participate directly in the investment
performance of the underlying funds, and the value of a variable
annuity will vary according to investment results.<P>

Since all earnings are automatically reinvested in the underlying
funds without current taxation, money invested in a variable annuity
over time can grow and compound faster than investments in mutual
funds outside of an annuity contract.<P>

In addition, variable annuities offer flexible payment schedules. Some
people prefer to pay in one lump sum. Others prefer an ongoing
investment program, such as monthly payments. Typically, the variable
annuity payment schedule allows you to increase or decrease your
payments, or stop them altogether and resume investing at a later
date.<P>

Due to the tax consequences of early withdrawal and because investors
bear the risk of the performance of underlying funds, variable
annuities should be viewed as long term investments.<P>

There are withdrawal provisions that allow you to get at your
money. Withdrawals are generally subject to surrender charges, but
many insurance companies allow contract owners to withdraw up to 10%
of their accumulated value in any contract year without incurring
surrender charges. Be aware that withdrawal are subject are subject to
federal taxes, and money taken out prior to age 59 1/2 is usually
subject to a penalty tax. Before choosing a variable annuity, be sure
to consider the pros and cons listed below:<P>

<b>PROS:</b><P>

Tax-deferred growth<P>

Earnings automatically reinvested<P>

Income for life option<P>

Professional fund management<P>

Tax free transfers among investment options<P>

Unlimited contributions<P>

Generally no up front sales charge<P>

Guaranteed minimum death benefit<P>

<b>CONS:</b><P>

Withdrawals during accumulation period may be subject to tax penalties
and surrender charges<P>

Unsuitable for short-term financial needs<P>

Investment options may be more limited than a family of mutual funds<P>

Consumers are more aware of the advantage of variable annuities,
making these products the most talked about tax-advantaged investment
around for retirement. Now that you are familiar with how a variable
annuity can work overtime for you, don't delay in taking advantage of
this excellent, tax-advantaged investment.<P>

<h2>The Tax-Deferred Allure of Variable Annuities</h2>

<h3>By <a href="/FNEA.html#sheehan">Daniel D. Sheehan</a>, CFP</h3>

An often misunderstood form of investment, the variable annuity, is
quickly becoming one of the most popular tax advantaged investments
for retirement. An annuity is basically a contract which guarantees an
income or payment for a specified amount of time. A fixed annuity will
have the return fixed for a specified period, usually one year, and
then the rates fluctuate according to market conditions. However, the
rate will never fall below a preset minimum. A variable annuity, on
the other hand, allows an investor to invest in professionally managed
funds including stocks, bonds, and money market funds<P>

There are several advantages associated with variable annuities. Variable annuities allow an investor to transfer monies between various funds without the burden of taxation. In addition, all earnings are automatically reinvested in the underlying funds, tax-free. Variable annuities also offer flexible payment schedules. This can range from lump sum payments to long-term monthly payments.<P>

Although variable annuities are a wise investment for many people, there are certain things which must be considered before investing in them. First off; there is a significant penalty for early withdrawal. Hence, variable annuities should only be considered as long term investments. Additionally, variable tax annuities lack some of the diversity and options found in large families of mutual funds. However, for the right investor, variable annuities can be a significant step towards a well financed retirement. <P>

<h1><center><IMG WIDTH=39 HEIGHT=29 SRC="/icon.gif"> Retirement
Planning: 401(k) Plans: Your Best Bet For Retirement and Tax
Savings</center></h1>

<h2><center>By <a href="/FNEA.html#sheehan">Daniel D. Sheehan</a>, CFP</center></h2>

<hr><P>

IRAs, once the American consumer's most popular way to save for
retirement, have lost much of their appeal since the Tax Reform Act of
1986 limited their deductibility.<P>

There's still hope, however, for those who want to save for a
comfortable life during retirement and cut their taxes in the
meantime. Consumers can slash taxable income over $8,000 annually
(adjusted annually for cost of living) and save on a tax-deferred
basis by taking advantage of their employer's 401(k) plan.<P>

These plans have caught on fast. According to a study by the
Government Accounting Office, over 35,000 companies employing more
than 9.9 million workers across the U.S. offer their employees 401(k)
plans. Most major companies have 401(k) plans for their employees; a
growing number of smaller firms are adopting them, too.<P>

How does the plan work? The employee contributes a portion of his/her
income to the plan on a pre-tax basis. By taking money out of the
paycheck before it is taxed, not only do employees systematically and
conveniently save for retirement, but they also benefit from instant
tax savings. Typically, employees can choose investment options for
their 401(k) contributions from those that the employer has made
available in the plan.<P>

These choices often include a guaranteed fund or other fixed income
fund, one of more equity funds, and a bond or balanced fund.<P>

Employee and employer contributions to the plan grow tax-free until
withdrawn by the employee, resulting in a sizable fund for
retirement.<P>

For example, assume that an employee makes 401(k) contributions to the
plan for 25 years. At the start of his/her career, the annual salary
is $20,000. Each year, the employee receives a 5 percent raise and
contributes 5 percent of the annual salary to the plan. Over 25 years,
interest compounds tax-free at a fixed rate of 8 percent (see
chart). After 25 years, the 401(k) account would grow to $120,346,
assuming no withdrawals were made during that time.<P>

<pre>
	401(k) contributions		contributions + earnings

	Year 1		$1,000			$ 1,043
	After 5		5,526			6,710
	After 10	12,578			18,424
	After 15	21,579			38,002
	After 20	33,066			69,788
	After 25	47,727			120,346
</pre>

Withdrawals from 401(k) savings can be made after the employee reaches
age 59 1/2, frequently at additional tax savings. Money can also be
taken out in cases of total disability, leaving the company, or
death.<P>

And, funds can often be withdrawn from the plan in cases of financial
hardship. The IRS has set guidelines for financial hardship which
typically include expenses for college tuition, buying a new home or
paying extraordinary medical bills. Be aware that hardship withdrawals
are subject to an additional 10 percent tax.<P>

The special features of 401(k) plans encourage all Americans to become
more self-reliant in providing for their retirement. These plans offer
employees a unique opportunity to accumulate money for retirement
systematically while reducing the amount paid in taxes each year.<P>

Although 401(k) plans have undergone some changes as a result of the
Tax Reform Act, for many employees they remain the only viable method
to save for retirement on a tax-deferred basis.<P>

<h2>Retirement Planning: 401(k) Plans: Your Best Bet For Retirement Planning and Tax Savings</h2>

<h3>By <a href="/FNEA.html#sheehan">Daniel D. Sheehan</a>, CFP</h3>

401(k) plans are quickly taking the place of IRAs. IRAs, though once
the most popular way to save for retirement, have lost a lot of their
appeal since the tax laws of 1986 limited their deductibility. Using a
401(k) plan, consumers can significantly cut taxable income, as well
as save on a tax-deferred basis.<P>

The process is a simple one. An employee contributes part of their
income to the plan on a pre-tax basis. By taking the money out before
it is taxed, employees manage to benefit instantly from tax
savings. Employees can typically choose investment options from a few
alternatives which the company offers. These alternatives frequently
include a guaranteed or other fixed income fund, equity funds, and
bonds. The contributions made will grow tax-free until withdrawn by
the employee.<P>

Withdrawals can begin once the employee reaches 59 1/2 years of
age. In the cases of total disability, leaving the company, or death,
the money can also be withdrawn. Even financial hardship, such as
college tuition, buying a new home, or high medical bills, can be the
grounds for withdrawal (although an extra 10% tax is imposed).<P>

The 401(k) is a unique plan which offers employees the opportunity to
accumulate money for retirement while systematically reducing the
amount paid in taxes each year. Although the 401(k) plan has gone
through some revisions in the last few years, it still remains one of
the most effective ways to provide for a comfortable retirement.<P>

<hr><P>

<font size=+2><b>Q</b></font>. I heard a financial planner speak about several advantages of non-qualified retirement programs, are they as good as my regular retirement program?<P>

<font size=+2><b>A</b></font>.	Sometimes they are better, sometimes worse; it depends on your needs and the circumstances. I think everyone agrees that saving for retirement is an important goal, and there are many ways to do just that. Non-qualified programs can be an excellent way to save for retirement, and they're definitely not inferior to qualified plans. By definition, they just don't have to adhere to all of the same IRS and Department of Labor guidelines as typical pension plans do. Basically, a qualified program allows
 an employer or business to deduct
the cost of the pension contribution in the year it is made, and the employee doesn't have to pay any income tax on the earnings until it is withdrawn during retirement. If employees make contributions, they are deductible, or made with "pre-tax dollars", and the funds in the account stay untaxed until the employee is in receipt of their money at retirement In the meantime, all earnings grow tax deferred in these special accounts. Most pension plans, 401(k), 403(b), etc. are typical of qualified plans in general use today. Remember, qualified doesn't mean it's automatically a good retirement plan or that's it's approved by the government, it just meets certain guidelines.<P>

A non-qualified plan can also be an excellent source of retirement funding, and it's major difference is that any deposit made to this retirement account isn't paid to the employee with pretaxed earnings. Nonqualified programs are usually created with after-tax dollars. These funds still grow in a tax advantaged account and they can accumulate a significant amont of money for retirement planning. By eliminating all of the restrictions about the amount of money which can be deposited, meeting top heavy regulations, who is allowed to participate and how much money must be taken out at retirement, there is a good reason for switching to non-qualified plans. They avoid the hassles. Nonqualified plans can be "discriminatory", which means that they can be set up for any employee; not everyone has to be included. Basically they are used by many companies, both large and small, to reward productive key employees and to develop a sense of long term commitment to the employer.<P>

When the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1993 changed the compensation limit from $235,840, as indexed in 1993, to $150,000 highly paid individuals and their employers were encouraged to establish non-qualified retirement plans. Besides the new limitations on future growth, the flexibility had greater appeal than meeting restrictive new guidelines.  Previously, if an employer contributed 15% of pay into a qualified pension program for all employees, highly compensated employees making $200,000 would have had $30,000 contributed to their pension account Today, this law would limit the same percentage of contribution to $22,500.<P>

Besides new limits on contributions, there are little known "success taxes" which penalize savers for having too much money in their retirement plans. If a too-generous retirement benefit is earned, then an additional 15% tax kick in. This particularly affects an individual's estate because it may result in a family losing 80% or more of those savings. With increases in estate taxes, retirement funds may be a source of funds for family liquidity and there are new and highly specialized techniques available to minimize these limitations. The use of qualified retirement funds to pay for estate settlement expenses in a tax advantaged way has been a powerful tool to receive increased value from pension money. Consult with your tax and financial advisors to see whether or not you would be better served by coordinating qualified and nonqualified programs to enhance your planning options.<P>

<h2>Retirement Planning: Discretionary Retirement Planning</h2>

<h3>By <a href="/bios/henry.html">Vaughn W. Henry</a></h3>

Non-qualified retirement plans are often believed to be somehow
inferior to qualified plans. However, that is far from the
truth. Although qualified plans do offer significant advantages,
non-qualified plans come with an assortment of advantages as well.<P>

The major advantage to having a qualified retirement plan is that
contributions are put in on a pre-tax basis. This is, indeed, a
significant advantage. However, in order to be considered a qualified
plan, a plan must meet certain criteria, such as: contribution
restrictions and non-discriminatory policies. This is where
non-qualified plans have an advantage. They do not have to meet these
criteria. By eliminating the restrictions on qualified plans,
non-qualified plans make themselves into a very attractive investment,
even with after-tax dollars.<P>

One of the most notable advantage to the non-qualified plan is the
fact that it can be discriminatory. This means that employers can use
it to reward key employees, without having to offer the plan to every
employee. Due to recent compensation limiting legislation, these types
of plans have become more and more popular. They are being used to
offset the lower compensation for highly compensated employees.<P>

Although non-qualified plans have an advantage over non-qualified
plans in that fact that the contributions are made with pre-tax money,
this does not automatically make them superior. Non-qualified plans
gain a considerable advantage from the flexibility afforded
non-qualified plans and are often a solid way of planning for
retirement. <P>

Planning: Introducing ABC Plus</center></h1>

<h2><center>By <a href="/FNEA.html#sheehan">Daniel D. Sheehan</a>, CFP</center></h2>

<hr><P>

While regulation is often perceived negatively by the business
community, sometimes it can be welcome news. The non-discrimination
regulations for pension and profit-sharing plans are an example of
rules that have actually enhanced the ability of employers to meet
business and personal objectives on a cost-effective basis.<P>

The new regulations modify and simplify earlier regulations released
in September 1991. They have produced a new plan design offering
selective benefits for key employees, Age-Based Contribution Plus (ABC
Plus).<P>

<b>What Makes These New Plans Possible?</b><P>

Pension and profit-sharing plans may not discriminate in favor of
highly paid employees. To ensure this, the Internal Revenue Service
has drafted regulations establishing objective standards and tests
that all plans must satisfy.<P>

These regulations permit a plan to satisfy the non-discrimination
requirement by providing employees with either non-discriminatory
contributions (input) or non-discriminatory benefits
(output). Historically, defined benefit plans have satisfied the
nondiscrimination requirement by providing all employees with
equivalent benefits (output), and defined contribution plans have
provided employees with equivalent contributions (input).<P>

The non-discrimination regulations provide standards that permit
"cross testing." This means that defined benefit plans may satisfy the
non-discrimination standards based on contributions (input), and
defined contribution plans may test based on benefits (output).<P>

<b>Enhanced Cross Testing Options</b><P>

The regulations proposed provide two alternative testing methods. A
plan may prove compliance at the individual participant level, or a
plan may group participants and base the test on the average benefits
pro vided to each group. Testing at the group level using average
benefits creates a unique plan sometimes referred to as "new
comparability."

By applying this technique, a plan can be designed which pro vides one
contribution rate to a select group of employees, with a different and
much lower rate (or rates) for employees who are not part of the
select group. As long as the plan can demonstrate that the average
benefits of the highly paid employees are equivalent to those of the
non-highly paid group, the plan will be non-discriminatory.<P>

The beauty of ABC Plus is that employers have complete control over
which employees are included in the select group.<P>

For example, the select group could be designed to cover:
<ul type=disc>
<li>Highly compensated employees
<li>Owners and key executives
<li>Salaried employees
<li>Long service employees
<li>Officers and managers
</ul>

In this respect, ABC Plus offers many of the advantages usually
associated with executive benefit plans, yet it retains all the tax
advantages of pension and profitsharing plans.<P>

<b>Who Should Consider ABC Plus?</b><P>

ABC Plus will be attractive in a variety of situations where key
employees are older. This includes: 
<ul type=disc> 

<li>Businesses with an existing defined contribution plan where there
is a desire to increase amounts allocated to select personnel.

<li>Businesses with defined benefit plans where there is a need to increase contribution flexibility or minimize administrative costs.

<li>Businesses which have never established or have previously terminated a plan because the cost of covering non-key employees was too great compared to the benefits that could be provided to the select group.

<li>Businesses looking for a tax-deductible method to pay for a second-to-die policy to meet estate planning needs.
</ul><P>

Today it is possible to design a plan that offers the power of a
pension, the simplicity and flexibility of profit-sharing and the
selectivity desired by many business owners. This is welcome news,
even if it does come from more regulation.<P>

<h2>Retirement Planning: Introducing ABC Plus</h2>

<h3>By <a href="/FNEA.html#sheehan">Daniel D. Sheehan</a>, CFP</h3>

According to federal tax law, pension and profit-sharing plans may not
discriminate in favor of highly paid employees. The regulations which
define whether or not a plan is discriminatory allows plans to satisfy
the non-discrimination requirement by either providing for
non-discriminatory input or non-discriminatory output. Historically,
defined benefit plans have satisfied this requirement by providing all
employees with equivalent benefits. At the same time, defined
contribution plans have provided employees with equivalent
contributions. The non-discrimination regulation does, however, allow
for "cross-testing." This means that defined benefit plans may satisfy
the non-discrimination standards based on contributions, while a
defined contribution plan may test based on benefits.<P>

There are two alternative testing methods which are provided for. A
plan can prove compliance at the individual participant level, or the
plan may base the test on the average benefits provided to a group of
participants. Using this technique, a plan can be designed which
provides a higher contribution rate to a select group of employees,
while offering a much lower rate to those not in the select
group. Employers have complete control over which employees are
included in the select group, as long as the plan can demonstrate that
the average benefits of the highly paid employees are equivalent to
those of the non-highly paid group.<P>

It is now possible to design a plan that offers the power of a
pension, the simplicity and flexibility of profit-sharing, and the
selectivity desired by many business owners. This type of plan needs
to be considered by a wide range of business owners as it offers too
many advantages to be overlooked.<P>

Years</title></head><body>

<h1><center><IMG  WIDTH=39 HEIGHT=29 SRC="/icon.gif"> Six Key Strategies for Planning in
Your Later Years:</center></h1>

<h2><center>A little financial foresight will take you comfortably
Into the future</center></h2>

<h3><center>By <a href="/FNEA.html#sheehan">Daniel D. Sheehan</a>, CFP</center></h3>

<hr><P>

From the time you finish your own formal education to the time your
last child packs her trunk for college, life can be somewhat hectic
and fast-paced. No wonder so many of us look forward to the years when
the kids are gone, the house is paid for, and we can finally find the
time to do the things we've been "planning to do" all those years.<P>

As you shift gears into a new, active, independent way of life, it's
also a good time to take stock of your finances. When you do, here's a
quick checklist of things to consider.<P>

<b>1. Invest with growth in mind.</b><P>

Though you may have more discretionary money than you did years ago,
don't forget that there's a lot of life ahead. If you're in your 50s
or early 60s, current statistics say that you probably have 25 to 30
full and active years. That means you'll want to think about putting a
portion of your retirement money in growth-oriented investments such
as stocks or stock mutual trends that will help you stay ahead of
inflation throughout retirement.<P>

Some planners suggest keeping from 20 to 40% of your investments in
stock or stock funds during your pre- and post-retirement years. Their
reasoning: even though stocks are riskier in the short term and more
subject to market fluctuations, they have generally outperformed all
other types of investments in the long term. So if you won't be using
the money for seven years or more, go for growth.<P>

<b>2. Diversify to moderate risk.</b><P>

While the current rule of thumb for a comfortable retirement is to
plan for 70% - 80% of your pre-retirement income (including Social
Security, pensions, and your individual retirement savings), don't
forget that your upcoming plans to travel, start a business, or pursue
a special interest or hobby may actually require more than that. So if
you've been too conservative by investing in low-interest CDs and
fixed income bonds, you may also want to think about moving some of
th:at money to a tax-deferred variable annuity or a "growth and
income" mutual fluid that gives you a higher return with moderate
risk.<P>

Whatever choices you make, be sure to keep your investments
diversified among all three investment categories: stocks, bonds, and
money market instruments (or cash equivalents). Diversification helps
moderate the risk In your total investment portfolio.<P>

<b>3. Maximize your pension plan assets,</b><P>

If you leave or change jobs before retirement, be sure to "rollover"
your pension assets properly. Otherwise, you stand to lose much of
your retirement nest egg the lull amount will be subject to ordinary
income tax and it may be subject to a 10% penalty if you choose to
take it early. When the time comes, be sure your employer provides you
with information on how to initiate a "direct" rollover to an
individual Retirement Account (IRA) to avoid a newly required 20%
withholding against possible taxes due. Or, check with the investment
company where you already have a retirement account. Though you only
have 60 days to rollover your money, you should fully understand your
options before you make a final decision.<P>

Knowing your options becomes even more important when you reach
retirement. when you do, your employer will ask you to decide how you
wish to receive your pension plan proceeds. And once you do so, you're
locked in. Most pension plans won't allow you to change your mind.<P>

If you choose a "joint and survivor" annuity benefit for retirement,
for instance, your spouse can still receive income after your death,
but your regular income payments are reduced to compensate. On the
other hand, if you choose a larger pay-out that doesn't include the
survivor benefit, your income stops at your death. For many retirees,
neither option is satisfactory.<P>

That's why you may want to think about adding an insurance policy to
your financial plan. To maximize your pension income, you can elect to
receive the highest possible pension pay-out during your lifetime while
the additional insurance policy assures the continuation of income to
your spouse alter your death. Check with your insurance agent or
financial advisor for more details.<P>

<b>4. Insure your independence.</b><P>

Long-term care coverage and some form of disability insurance can help
you maintain your independence as you grow older. (A year in a nursing
home could easily wipe out $30,000 to $40,000 or more of your
savings!) If you're already adequately covered by life insurance, now
is the time to look at adding a long-term care (LTC) rider for
protection against uncertain future medical costs. The rider gives you
access to your insurance policy death benefits in the case of terminal
illness.<P>

<b>5. Draw up the "basic four" documents.</b><P>

Now is also the time to be sure you have the essential documents in
place. These include:<P>

<ul> <li>A <i>will</i> to provide legal instructions for the
distribution of your assets.

<li>A <i>list of essential financial information,</i> such as where
you have your bank, investment, and insurance accounts and how to
locate your professional advisors.

<li>A <i>living will</i> that designates someone to make decisions on
your behalf regarding life- sustaining procedures.

<li>A <i>power of attorney</i> that authorizes someone to manage your
finances for you, usually in case you should become sick or
disabled.</ul><P>

<b>6. Finally, consider a plan for your estate.</b><P>

While it would be nice to pass something along to the next generation,
don't feel guilty if you can't. Concentrate more on making sure that
you'll have what you need now -- and in the future -- to live a long,
active, and comfortable life.<P>

If your estate will be larger than the $600,000 exempted from federal
estate taxes, focus your estate planning activity on strategies that
can help reduce the burden of a hefty estate tax bill and thus
maximize the amount your heirs will receive. Consider setting up a
life insurance policy in an irrevocable trust. Because the proceeds
from such a policy can provide liquidity to pay state and federal
estate taxes, your heirs won't need to borrow money or sell
investments to pay the estate tax bill.<P>

In some situations, life insurance trusts may prove to be a better
solution than an outright inheritance. If you have a dependent child
with special needs, for instance, you may want to set up a <i>Special
Needs Trust</i> to provide sufficient assets for your child's care 
while still maintaining his or her eligibility for Supplemental
Security Income benefits. If you have special ties to a charitable
organization, you may want to consider establishing some type of
"giving" trust. These trusts allow you to provide a benefit to your
favorite charity while you take care of your family's needs. And all
have tax benefits. But you'll want to work closely with your attorney
and your financial advisor to determine if the benefits outweigh the
costs of establishing and maintaining these trusts.<P>

To be sure, managing your financial affairs in your later years will
not be entirely carefree. You'll still need to evaluate and update
your insurance polices and your investment accounts periodically. But
the beauty of planning from a more mature perspective is that you
finally have the time and energy to make thoughtful, Informed
decisions. And you can took forward with a renewed sense of
independence to many years ahead.<P>

<h2>Six Key Strategies for Planning in Your Later Years</h2>

<h3>By <a href="/FNEA.html#sheehan">Daniel D. Sheehan</a>, CFP</h3>

Retirement is something that many people look forward to. However, not
everyone who looks forward to retirement is financially prepared for
it. The current rule of thumb for a comfortable retirement is 70%-80%
of pre-retirement income. One of the most important rules when
investing is to keep a portfolio diversified among stocks, bonds, and
money market instruments. Some planners suggest that 20%-40% of your
investments should be placed in stocks. Although stocks are riskier in
the short term, they have outperformed all other types of investment
in the long term. A "growth and income" mutual fund can offer a high
return while keeping risk at moderate levels.<P>

Knowing all the facets of a pension plan is very important to those
looking forward to retirement. Early withdrawal penalties, rollovers,
and benefit options should all be known in order to make the best
possible decisions. In addition, some sort of long term care coverage
or long term care rider for a life insurance policy should be
considered to protect against the expenses that go along with
prolonged illness.<P>

There are five major documents which should be drawn up. These include
a will, a list of essential financial information, a living will, and
a power of attorney. In addition to these, a plan on what will be done
with the estate should also be decided. If the estate is greater than
the $600,000 exempted from federal estate taxes, strategies should be
concentrated on reducing the burden of the tax. Many different trusts
exist which can aid in both preserving and passing wealth down to
younger generations.<P>

<html><head><title>Retirement Planning: An Alternative to
Non-Qualified SERPs</title></head><body>

<h1><center><IMG  WIDTH=39 HEIGHT=29 SRC="/icon.gif"> Retirement Planning: An Alternative
to Non-Qualified SERPs</center></h1>

<h2><center>By <a href="/bios/harrington.html">Don Harrington</a></center></h2>

<hr><P>

<b>INTRODUCTION</b><P>

The tax law changes of 1986 and the new Revenue Reconciliation Act of
1993 have dramatically curtailed the benefits that can be achieved for
highly compensated executives with qualified retirement plans.<P>

In addition to these new restrictions, there has been a dramatic
increase in the costs of qualified plans due to required participation
criteria for other employees.<P>

These changes have created a need for corporations to adopt
"non-qualified" retirement programs for their highly compensated
executives. Non-qualified plans offer the corporation the mechanism
needed to attract, retain and reward key individuals.<P>

<b>NON-QUALIFIED PLANS</b><P>

Traditionally, corporations have turned to non-qualified supplemental
executive retirement programs (SERP's) to restore to highly
compensated executives the benefits lost due to the restrictions
placed on qualified retirement programs.<P>

SERP's are designed to provide an executive with a "promised" benefit
at retirement, which is backed by the assets of the sponsoring
company. Corporations can informally fund the benefit obligation, and
to provide further protection to the executive they may utilize a
Rabbi Trust to hold the asset.<P>

SERP's are regarded by corporations as an excellent benefit program
which can assist the executives in reaching their retirement
objectives.<P>

However there are a number of inherent problems with the traditional
SERP approach, as follows:

<ul type=disc>

<li><b>Unsecured Promise to Pay</b><br>
SERP's are funded by the assets of the corporation and are subject to
the claims of the corporation's creditors. The use of a Rabbi Trust
only protects the executives in the event of reorganization or a
change of management.<P>

<li><b>Liability Accrual</b><br>
The contractual nature of the company's promise to pay benefits
requires it to recognize its liability by establishing a long-term
liability account on its balance sheet. The actual accounting
methodology will be selected by the company's accountants, but will
most likely be governed by FASB 87.<P>

The amount of this accrued liability can become substantial. For
example, an executive age 45 with a SERP benefit of $95,000 a year has
an estimated first year accrual of $29,149 which grows to $925,819 by
age 65.<P>

The inability of corporations to secure the funding of the executives
benefits and the major impact on earnings of the accrued liability for
the SERP have prompted corporations to seek other alternatives.<P>

</ul>

<h3>The Solution:</h3>

<b>Adopt An Executive Split Dollar Delayed Roll-Out Plan</b><P>

"Split Dollar" is an industry term for the technique of dividing the
ownership, cost and cash value of an insurance policy between the
executive and the company.<P>

The Split Dollar approach is not a specific insurance policy, but an
agreement between an employer and employee.<P>

The use of a split dollar plan in providing non-qualified executive
retirement benefits has a number of advantages, as follows:

<ul type=disc>

<li>The employer has complete discretion in selecting plan
participants

<li>No maximum or minimum participation requirements

<li>No IRS approval

<li>Plan design and implementation are simple

<li>Low administration expenses

<li>Contribution levels can vary among participants

<li>The plan can be designed to recover employer cost

<li>Employer contributions can be vested

</ul>

Disadvantages are as follows:

<ul type=disc>

<li>No current tax deduction for employer contributions

<li>Excess earnings above employer's cumulative premiums are
automatically vested to the employee

</ul>

<b>Plan Mechanics</b><br>

The employer and executive enter into a written agreement under which
a permanent life insurance contract is purchased on the executive's
life.<P>

The agreement outlines how premium, death benefit and cash value will
be shared. In a "employee pays P.S. 58 cost" plan such as this, the
executive pays the portion of the premium equal to the annual
"economic benefit" derived from the life insurance protection; the
employer pays the balance of the premium due on the permanent
policy.<P>

The executive (or a third party designated by the executive) is the
owner of the life insurance policy. The policy is assigned as
collateral against premiums paid by the employer, thereby assuring
that the employer's cost will be reimbursed prior to retirement.<P>

At retirement, the employer's interest in the policy is "frozen" and
is carried as an asset on its balance sheet. The executive will have
access to the cash values in the policy in excess of the corporation's
interest. The executive will withdraw a stream of payments from the
policy which will provide for a post-retirement benefit. In addition,
sufficient funds will be withdrawn to reimburse the participant for
the after tax cost of the post-retirement imputed income created by the
Split Dollar arrangement. <b>It should be noted that in the plan
design withdrawals of policy values are utilized instead of loans to
protect the executive in the event of corporate bankruptcy.</b><P>

At death or at a specified age, the corporation will receive back its
accumulated premiums (cost recovery). This is accomplished by the
corporation's share of the death benefit or cash value.<P>

<b>SUMMARY</b><P>

A Split Dollar program as an alternative to a traditional non-qualified SERP offers the following advantages:

<ul type=disc>

<b>Corporation</b>

<li>An effective executive benefit program with complete cost recovery
<li>No need to book an accrued liability for the benefit
<li>An alternative to group term insurance on a pre-retirement basis
<li>No IRS approval

<P>

<b>Executive</b>
<li>Substantial retirement income
<li>A level of security if corporation fails
<li>Pre- and post-retirement death benefit at a minimal cost 

</ul>

<h2>Retirement Planning: An Alternative to Non-Qualified SERPs</h2>

<h3>By Don Harrington</h3>

The changes in the tax law in 1986 and 1993 have severely limited the
benefits that highly compensated executives can receive. In addition,
due to required participation in qualified plans, the cost of these
plans has gone up. These two factors, when added together, create a
need for corporations to adopt "non-qualified" retirement programs for
their highly compensated executive.<P>

Supplemental executive retirement programs are used by corporations to
make up for benefits lost due to restrictions placed on qualified
programs. SERPs provide executives with a "promise" benefit at
retirement. This benefit is backed by the assets of the company. These
programs have become very popular and are seen as an excellent way to
provide for the retirement needs of executives. There are however,
quite a few problems with SERPs. First off, since these plans are
backed by the assets of the corporation, they are vulnerable to the
creditors of the corporation. Secondly, due to the contractual nature
of the plan, it is necessary for corporations to establish long-term
liability accounts on their balance sheet. The amount of the accrued
liability can be substantial. The inability of corporations to secure
the necessary funding for these plans, as well as the impact on the
earnings has forced corporations to seek alternatives to SERPs.<P>

"Split Dollar" is the technique of dividing the ownership, cost and
cash value of an insurance policy between the executive and the
company. The way this plan works is that the employer and the
executive enter into a written agreement under which a permanent life
insurance contract is purchased on the executive's life. The
particular agreement that is made will outline how premium, death
benefits, and cash value will be shared. The executive is the owner of
the life insurance policy. The policy is assigned as collateral
against premiums paid by the employer, ensuring that the employer's
costs will be reimbursed prior to retirement. At retirement, the
employer's interest in the policy is "frozen" and is carried as an
asset on the balance sheet. The executive will have access to the cash
values in the policy in excess of the corporation's interest. The
executive can withdraw a stream of cash payments from the policy which
will provide for a post-retirement benefit. In addition, sufficient
funds will be withdrawn to reimburse the participant for the after-tax
cost of the post-retirement imputed income by the Split Dollar
arrangement.<P>

This type of plan has a number of advantages. First off, the employer
has complete discretion in selecting plan participants. Secondly,
there is no maximum or minimum participation requirements, nor is
there any IRS approval necessary. Additionally, there are very low
administrative expenses, and contribution levels may vary among
participants. Finally, the plan can be designed so as to recover
employer costs. However, there are no current tax deductions for
employer contributions and excess earnings above employer's cumulative
premiums are automatically vested to the employee.<P>

Off-shore trusts have an undeserved reputation as a vehicle used by
criminals to squirrel away ill-gotten gains. In reality, both domestic
and international trusts have a long history of safekeeping assets and
enforcing the wishes of the trust creator. Additionally, they offer a
wide range of legitimate protections. This appeal to a broad based
need makes the off-shore trust an especially effective tool in
controlling property. Usually viewed as a means of illegally evading
taxes, the reality is much different. The IRS agent handbook defines a
tax haven as "a term that generally connotes any foreign country that
has either a very low tax or no tax at all on certain categories of
income." The IRS guide goes on to state "U.S. taxpayers may also use
tax havens for tax-planning reasons. Some transactions conducted
through tax havens have a beneficial tax result... that is completely
within the letter of the US. tax law." If tax reduction is not the
primary objective, what are the advantages to an off-shore trust?

<li> More control over trust features
<li> Improved investment diversification
<li> Greater flexibility of design 
</ul>

Privacy and confidentiality are the principal reasons for establishing
an off-shore trust or international business corporation. Combined
with asset protection features, these structures can effectively
shield the creator from frivolous lawsuits. This ability makes them
ideal for professionals concerned about malpractice exposure or
business owners worried about excessive liability for the actions of
their employees. Contrary to popular belie?, this is not a means of
fraudulently hiding assets from legitimate creditors. However, it can
be a speed bump and barrier to creative personal injury attorneys
looking for deep pockets.<P>

Properly done, a trust insulates the beneficiaries from the actions of
others. Although control is an important part of any structure used for
financial or estate planning, sometimes too much control is an
issue. Unfortunately, many foreign trusts are established incorrectly
and can create more problems than they were supposed to solve. Ml too
often, tourists visiting a tax-haven country decide on a whim to set
up a trust or foreign corporation, not realizing U.S. laws could be
violated. The local off-shore advisors may be technically correct in
stating that their foreign laws are not being broken, but they may not
address the more worrisome U.S. regulations.<P>

Generally, first time trust creators fret about assets disappearing
from their accounts, but typically far more damage is done through
incompetence than by misappropriating assets. Good trust sites operate
under very strict laws and in many cases, their obligations and
standards exceed those of U.S. trust companies. For that reason, the
selection of the jurisdiction and specific trustee is very
important. Competent trust companies with U.S. tax law experience,
operating in English speaking countries, are critical to
success. These locations should have good accessibility, long standing
laws and modern telecommunications for these trusts to work
properly.<P>

The second major concern is the investment used within the trust
portfolio, but diversification generally offsets that worry. These
issues are especially important as investors seek higher returns on
their assets. The services of a private banking firm allow clients the
opportunity to structure business and personal finances in ways that
are especially beneficial in multi-generational planning. There is
also a wider selection of investment options offered through
international trusts. The ability to work in more than one currency,
use unregistered mutual fluids or purchase both domestic and foreign
securities is a powerful and unique feature of international
trusts. Additionally, since many off-shore banks operate under
different regulations, they can pay more generous interest rates on
fluids invested with them. Some investors are initially uncomfortable
investing outside the U.S., so offshore mutual fluids and investment
companies now offer popular fund managers and familiar U.S. stocks to
overcome that obstacle. The ability to rearrange the chess pieces on
your financial game board allows for improved returns and better
management.<P>

U.S. trusts are prohibited from acting in perpetuity. However, many
families need a structure that will safeguard grandchildren and
great-grandchildren, so foreign trusts may be designed for much longer
periods of activity. Besides protecting estates from forced heirships,
a well-designed plan allows for tax deferred earnings and may
eliminate some income and estate taxes. It's not so much what you
earn, as what you keep is their final measure of success. As with any
sophisticated planning tool, a competent and experienced team of
advisors should be consulted. This is not a do it yourself
project. <P>

<h2>Tax Planning: Beyond the Palm Trees -- Tax Havens and Estate Planning</h2>

<h3>By <a href="/bios/henry.html">Vaughn W. Henry</a></h3>

Offshore trusts are frequently looked on merely as vehicles used by
criminals to hide their ill-gotten gains. However, this reputation is
undeserved. Offshore trusts offer a wide range of legitimate services
which can be very beneficial to the protection of an estate.<P>

Two of the principal reasons for establishing an offshore trust or
international business corporation are privacy and
confidentiality. Assets can be effectively protected from frivolous
law suits, thus reducing the extravagant risk of being a professional
in today's litigious society.<P>

If executed properly, a trust can insulate the beneficiaries from the
actions of others. However, an incorrectly established foreign trust
can cause more problems than it solves. Local off-shore advisors,
though knowledgeable about their own particular laws, may not be
familiar with US regulations. It is essential to choose a competent
trust company with US tax law experience, operating in English
speaking countries. These locations should have good accessibility,
long standing laws, and modern telecommunications.<P>

The second major concern is the investment used within the trust
portfolio. This is usually offset, to some degree, by
diversification. As investors seek higher returns on their
investments, though, this becomes a more important issue. Services
provided by private banking firms allow clients to structure business
and personal finances which are especially helpful in
multi-generational planning. Other opportunities which may present
themselves through a foreign trust are the ability to work in more
than one currency, use unregistered mutual funds, or purchase both
domestic and foreign securities. Since many investors are skeptical
about investing out of the US, offshore mutual funds have begun to
offer popular fund managers and familiar US stocks.<P>

Since US trusts are prohibited from acting in perpetuity, many people
are turning towards international trusts. Besides protecting assets, a
well designed plan may eliminate some taxes as well as providing for
deferred earnings. However, as with any financial planning, a
competent and experienced team of advisors should be consulted. <P>

Law</title></head><body>

<h1><center><IMG  WIDTH=39 HEIGHT=29 SRC="/icon.gif"> Tax Planning: Strategies To Cope With The New Tax Law</center></h1>

<h2><center>By <a href="/FNEA.html#sheehan">Daniel D. Sheehan</a>, CFP</center></h2>

<hr><P>

The recently enacted tax bill changes many of the rules for
individuals and businesses alike.  Tax planning strategies that made
sense prior to 1993 many no longer be right for you.  So here's a
brief overview of the most significant provisions of this legislation,
along with ideas on how to cope.<P>

<h3>Business Owners (Corporate and Non-Corporate)</h3>

Increased federal income taxes and the elimination of the Medicare
ceiling make qualified pension and profit sharing plans more
attractive than ever.<P>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Establish a plan.  If your combined federal and state marginal tax
bracket is 45%. each dollar contributed to plan costs 55 cents
after-taxes.<P>
<li>Maximize your tax deductible contributions.  You may want to
increase contributions to an existing plan.<P>
<li>Review your existing plan.  Your old plan may not be producing the
maximum advantage.  Investigate the opportunities presented by the new
age weighted profit sharing plans (ABC and ABC Plus).<P>
</ul>
</blockquote>

Higher income retirees will be taxed on 85% of their Social Security
benefits.  Increased retirement income will be needed to offset the
higher tax amount.<P>

<blockquote><ul>
<li>Supplement your pension or profit sharing plan.  A Private Pension
Plan, capitalizing on the tax free accumulation and loan features of a
life insurance policy, can replace Social Security income lost to
taxes.<P>
<li>Purchase a single premium annuity.  The purchase price can be
recovered over life expectancy income tax free.  The recovered amount
is not subject to the computation making Social Security taxable at
85%.<P>
</ul></blockquote>

<h3>Business Owners (Self Employed and S Corporation)</h3>

Many businesses avoided C corporation status because of the higher
rates on corporate income.  Personal income tax rates may now be
higher than corporate rates.  This means adopting C corporation status
may be worthwhile.<P>

<blockquote><ul>
<li>Analyze the affect on income taxes.  Income left in a corporation
may be taxable at 15%, compared to a 40% - 45% personal tax rate.<P>
<li>Investigate non-qualified executive benefits. Deferred
compensation, split dollar and stock option programs may generate
additional tax leverage for owners and key employees.<P>
</ul></blockquote>

<h3>Salaried Employees</h3>

Higher federal income taxes increase the value of employee benefit
plans, which can be used to reduce taxable income. Salaried employees
should:<P>

<blockquote><ul>
<li>Maximize 401(k) contributions.  The deferral limit for 1993 is
$8,994.  If you are eligible. increase your deferrals for the balance
of the year.<P>
<li>Take advantage of your cafeteria plans.  Medical reimbursement and
child care expenses can be paid with pre-tax dollars.<P>
</ul></blockquote>

<h3>Estates</h3>

Estate and gift tax brackets were capped at 50% under prior law.  Now, the tax rate for estates of $2.5 million will be 53%.  A 55% rate applies to estates in excess of $3 million.<P>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Discuss your potential estate tax liability with your attorney or
tax advisor.  Consider using an irrevocable trust to meet estate
liquidity needs.<P>
<li>Review your current estate plan.  Additional liquidity may be
required to meet the higher estate taxes under the new law.  Consider
the purchase of additional insurance to meet any increases
liability.<P>
</ul>
</blockquote>

Financial strategies must examined and adjusted from time to time, to
ensure maximum results.  If you haven't reviewed your financial plan
for a while, the new laws offer the perfect opportunity to bring your
tax planning up to date.<P>

<h2><IMG  WIDTH=39 HEIGHT=29 SRC="/icon.gif"> <i>Executive Summary</i></h2>
<h2>Tax Planning: Strategies To Cope With The New Tax Law</h2>

<h3>By <a href="/FNEA.html#sheehan">Daniel D. Sheehan</a>, CFP</h3>

The changes in the tax law in 1993 have made many of the previously
popular tax planning strategies obsolete. In order to cope with the
changes, investor's should understand the new law and the alternatives
open to them.<P>

There have been significant changes which are of interest to corporate
and non-corporate business owners. Due to the increase in federal
income taxes and the elimination of the Medicare ceiling, qualified
pension and profit sharing plans are more attractive than
ever. Additionally, higher income retirees will be taxed 85% of their
Social Security benefits. To offset these taxes, pensions and profit
sharing plans should be supplemented. A Private Pension Plan can work
to replace the money lost to taxes. In addition, a single premium
annuity can be purchased. This annuity is not taxable at the 85% rate
and the purchase price can be recovered over life expectancy tax
free.<P>

There are also many changes which affect self-employed business owners
as well as S Corporation business owners. Considering how personal
income tax rates may now be higher than corporate rates, adopting C
Corporation status might be very rewarding.<P>

Salaried employees should also be concerned about the changes. Higher
federal income tax rates call for greater contribution to 401(k)
plans. Cafeteria plans, medical expenses, and child care expenses,
can, and should, be paid with pre-tax dollars.<P>

Estates are very affected by the recent changes. The new bracket cap
is up to 55%. An irrevocable trust might be useful to aid in meeting
liquidity needs. Additionally, extra insurance might be purchased to
cover any increased liability.<P>

Financial strategies should be continuously reviewed and adjusted to
deal with changes in tax structure. By not paying attention to the
law, investor's leave themselves open to sub-optimal investments.<P>

Sweden is not only one of the ABB Group's most important home markets but also the base for the very successful exporting of ABB's products, systems and plants throughout the world.<P>

The Swedish ABB, with Asea Brown Boveri AB as Parent Company, has 27,500 employees working in around 100 ABB companies. Besides R&D units and manufacturing plants, there are ten larger regional sales offices. ABB also has nearly 130 service centres and installation offices throughout the country. In addition, certain ABB companies have sales offices of their own.<P>
  
Most of the ABB Group's business areas are represented in Sweden. The operations of the Swedish ABB span the entire electrical power sector. Sweden is ABB's leading supplier of equipment and systems for power transmission and distribution as well as for rail transportation. The Swedish ABB also lies in the forefront as regards products, systems and plants for industrial automation and environmental control, e.g., flue gas cleaning. Several Swedish ABB companies have global responsibility for the operations in their business areas.<P>
 
The head office of the Swedish ABB is located in V&auml;ster&aring;s. About 9,000 people are working here in 
around 30 ABB companies. Other major operations of ABB Sweden are based in Ludvika, Finsp&aring;ng, V&auml;xj&ouml;, Stockholm, J&ouml;nk&ouml;ping, Enk&ouml;ping, Norrk&ouml;ping, Gothenburg, Helsingborg and Kalmar.</font size=+1>

 - a process of continuous change</H3></CENTER>

<font size=+0>When the Swedish ABB launched T50 in 1990, the goal was to create a customer-driven, 
efficient and continuously learning organization by means of satisfied customers and motivated employees. 
This is still very much the case and today it is just as important as then that the individual employees are comitted to common goals. <p>

In ABB Sweden there is plenty of scope for local solutions along with personal initiative and taking responsibility. 
This is the strength of T50 that has made the process today a household word in Swedish industry.<p>

T50 is a process and not a project extending over a certain specific period of time. Now that the first phases have been completed, developement of the T50 process is continuing. It is not sufficient for the Swedish ABB merely to be best in Sweden. Now the focus is on  being a world-beater in all business areas and on all organizational levels. The goal is to exceed customer expectations all time.<p>
Customer focus, the pace of technical innovations and the commitment of the employees are now therefore being further intensified and developed. A global approach is needed in an increasingly borderless world subject to growing competition. It is with this vision that the Swedish ABB companies are now further developed.

to 16 bar by compressed air from the gas turbine<BR><BR>

<STRONG>F= Fluidised</STRONG><BR>
The bed behaves like a boiling liquid or fluid when the air flow produces sufficient pressure for bubbling, i.e. fluidisation, to occur. Hence the name.<BR><BR>

<STRONG>B= Bed</STRONG><BR>
The environment in which the coal burns. Also contains the embedded tubes of feedwater for steam generation. At full load the bed, which consists of 99% ash and 1% coal, is approx 4 meters in depth.<BR><BR>

<STRONG>C= Combined-cycle</STRONG><BR>
Power generation using a combined cycle is based on the joint use of a gas turbine and a steam turbine for extra efficiency. PFBC is the only technology using a coal-driven gas turbine. As the steam turbine generates approx. 80% of the output, and the gas turbine approx 20% of the output, this gives PFBC a 20% better efficiency rate than conventional coal-fired plants.

<H2>Clean coal technology</H2>

<STRONG>COAL</STRONG><BR>

Coal accounts for almost 40% of the worlds power generation, and its abundant resources ensure that it will be the major fossil fuel source well into the next century. World demand for energy, and especially for electricity, is likely to grow substantially during the next century, and it is probable that use of coal will continue to grow with the electricity demand. Estimates of the global market for power generation equipment suggest that about 800 GWe will be needed during the next decade and that approximately half of that will be coal-based. 
<BR><BR>

Another advantage of coal is that its price is more stable than that of other fuels, and for many countries it offers the chance of energy independence, by using indigenous resources rather than relying upon the price and availability of imports.
<BR><BR>

<STRONG>Clean coal</STRONG><BR>

Because of these two factors, an enormous variety of coal-burning technologies have evolved on the market. Pulverised coal plants (PCs) still dominate the power plant spectrum, as they have done since the early nineteen-hundreds. But environmental concerns have led to major restrictions being imposed on the emissions from power plants, with the result that only plants with high thermal efficiencies and low emissions will survive on the marketplace. A PC alone is no longer acceptable, but requires add-on cleaning equipment to deal with the sulphur and nitrogen oxides resulting from the combustion process. Other clean-coal contenders have arrived on the scene, the major actors being PFBC (Pressurised Fluidised Bed Combined-cycle) and IGCC, (Integrated Gasification Combined-cycle). The combined cycle, using both steam and gas cycles to increase output and reduce losses, is taken for granted.
<BR><BR> 

Coal qualities and properties vary from country to country, from hard coals and anthracites to brown coals and lignites. The amounts of ash and sulphur, metals and other elements in the coal also vary. It is the exact composition of the coal which determines its combustibility. It also requires a process which is capable of dealing with e.g. sluggish or slow-burning fuels. PFBC has proved that it has that capacity.
<BR><BR>

<STRONG>Other fuels</STRONG><BR>

In its Process Test Facility in Finspong, ABB Carbon has investigated combustion parameters with brown coal, oil shale and petroleum coke and can now offer fully commercial plants with these fuels. Tests have also been successfully performed using up to 40% biofuel mixed with the coal. Fuels tested are olive pips, palm nut shells and wood chips. Combustion efficiency and smooth operation are unaffected by the inclusion of biomass.
<BR><BR>
 
<STRONG><A NAME="ash">Ash</A></STRONG><BR>
Traditionally ash and other solid residue from power generation have been disposed of in landfills, adding to the cost of electricity.
<BR><BR>

Gradually the focus has changed to useful exploitation of the ash, rather than disposal.
<BR><BR>

<STRONG>PFBC ash utilisation</STRONG><BR>

<UL>
<STRONG>Some promising applications for PFBC ash are:</STRONG>
<LI>Synthetic gravel
<LI>Landfill preparation
<LI>Land reclamation
<LI>Building material
</UL>

</TABLE></CENTER>
<BR>

A PFBC power plant is highly efficient and requires 10-15% less fuel per kWhe than a Conventional coal fired plant. This means that the amount of ash accompanying the coal into the fluid bed and the amount of sorbent needed for sulphur capture are correspondingly lower.
<BR><BR>
 
The ash leaving the PFBC plant is a stable end product. It is water resistant with low leachability. It contains virtually no free lime, making it easy and safe to handle.

The Component Test Facility (CTF) is a 15MWt pilot plant which was used extensively before the first commercial plants were built. Most recently the CTF has been used to carry out a program sponsored by the International Energy Agency to investigate hot gas filters. A Process Test Facility (PTF) which has a thermal input of 1MW is used regularly to test new fuel types and to investigate process improvements leading to the next generation of plants.
<BR><BR>	
Since receiving  the first order for a commercial plant in 1986, ABB Carbon has supplied five PFBC plants with outputs of  around 80MW (electric equivalent) and is currently supplying its first 350 MWe plant. A further 80MW electric equivalent unit is on order. PFBC plants come in discrete sizes, the P200 (80-100 MWe) and P800 (350-425 MWe).<BR>

<H2>What is PFBC ?</H2>

PFBC stands for <A HREF="PFBC1.HTM">Pressurised Fluidised Bed Combined-cycle</A>. It is a technology which has been developed within the ABB Group for the last twenty years. The PFBC technology is based on combustion of coal in a pressurised so-called fluid bed. The electricity is generated in two systems. One of them drives a steam turbine in which approx. 80% of the electricity is generated. The remaining 20% is generated in the other system, which drives a gas turbine. This ensures high efficiency, giving something like 15% lower fuel consumption than with conventional technologies.
<BR><BR> 

Prior to combustion the coal is crushed and then mixed with limestone (dolomite). The fuel is injected into the fluidised bed and burned. The temperature in the bed is kept constant at approx. 850C. The boiler is pressurised with the help of the gas turbine. The flue gas from the combustion is taken to the turbine, where it expands and drives the compressors used to pressurise the combustion air and the generator for electrical generation. 
<BR><BR>

The feedwater is converted to steam in a number of pipe coils submerged in the fluid bed. The steam is expanded in the steam turbine - where the electricity is generated - and then taken to a condenser, where the steam is condensed back to water, for reuse in the process.
<BR><BR>

In order to further improve fuel utilisation, the PFBC plant can be used for cogeneration, i.e. production of both electricity and heat.

<STRONG>Familiar</STRONG><BR>
The fluidised bed combustion process is familiar, and has been used since the 1940s. Pressurised FBC is a development of that process, using familiar components. The combined cycle, using both gas turbine and steam turbine, is fast becoming a prerequisite in generation technologies for maximum plant efficiency.

<TD>The GT35P PFBC-machine used in P200 PFBC plants is a ruggedisation of the GT35, ABBs most widely sold gas turbine during the last forty years. The GT140P used in P800 PFBC plants is an upscaling of the GT35P. Experience from the operation of the first plants provided ABB with a bank of knowledge which could be applied direct to the utility-sized turbine.</TD>

<TD VALIGN=TOP><STRONG><EM>Steam turbine</EM></STRONG></TD>
<TD>In refurbishing projects, most often the existing steam turbine can be reused. If has outlived its useful life, or for greenfield projects, then it is the customers preference which determines the choice of steam turbine. PFBC is compatible with them all.</TD>

<TR><TD></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><STRONG><EM>Fluid bed</EM></STRONG></TD>
<TD>Fluid bed technology has existed for many years. The difference with PFBC is the pressurisation of the bed through the addition of compressed air from the turbine. The advantage of pressurisation is that it enables a deeper bed, with longer residence times for the fuel to burn out. The higher pressure also renders high temperatures unnecessary, and this is an advantage in that it avoids the formation of thermal NO<SUB>x</SUB>, a burden for other processes.</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<P>

<STRONG>Inherent emission control</STRONG><BR><BR>

No add-on deSO<SUB>x</SUB>or deNO<SUB>x</SUB> equipment. A conventional pulverised coal plant requires add-on cleaning equipment to remove gases from the exhaust. PFBC controls emissions via the process itself. Sorbent, either limestone or dolomite, is mixed with the coal to absorb the sulphur released from the coal during combustion. Up to 99% sulphur capture has been achieved in PFBC. Thermal NO<SUB>x</SUB> is not formed at all, and fuel NO<SUB>x</SUB> can be reduced during combustion by the introduction of ammonia in freeboard or before the turbine. CO<SUB>2</SUB> is always produced by the combustion of coal, but since PFBC uses 15% less coal per output than conventional PCs, the production of CO<SUB>2</SUB> is correspondingly 15% less.
<BR><BR><BR>


<H2><A NAME="efficient">PFBC is efficient</A></H2>

<STRONG>Low fuel consumption</STRONG><BR>
PFBCs efficiency means that approximately 15% less coal can be used to generate the same amount of electricity as a conventional coal-fired plant.<BR><BR>

<STRONG>Low emissions</STRONG><BR>
Efficient use of fuel - less fuel input for greater power output - by definition leads to lower emissions. See also inherent emission control (PFBC is simple).<BR><BR>

<STRONG>Low ash production</STRONG><BR>
The amount of ash produced is directly proportional to the amount of coal fed in. Since PFBC requires 10-15% less coal per kW than a conventional plant, the amount of ash exiting is proportionally smaller. The amount of ash corresponds to approximately 20% of the amount of fuel used.
<BR><BR><BR>
 
<H2><A NAME="compact">PFBC is compact</A></H2>

<STRONG>Easy siting</STRONG><BR>

The small dimensions of the PFBC, and the absence of secondary cleaning equipment, mean that PFBC literally fits congested sites which could not accommodate a larger plant.
<BR><BR>

<STRONG>Allows urban and existing sites</STRONG><BR>
This also means that it is possible to site a PFBC without damage or disturbance to surrounding buildings or thoroughfares. PFBC can easily be used to refurbish part of a larger generating complex, or be slotted into an urban environment. This was the case with Vrtan in Stockholm, where building restrictions could not have been more restrictive. (Vrtan was 2/6  repowering project, with listed buildings on site and a restriction that nothing was to disturb the skyline!)
<BR><BR>

<STRONG>Facilitates permitting</STRONG><BR>
The aesthetics and the practical advantages of the compact PFBC have the additional advantage that it is easier to gain planning, building and environmental permission than for bulkier, more precarious buildings. The appearance and therefore the proximity of the plant does not provoke controversy.
<BR><BR>

<STRONG>Less material</STRONG><BR>
The pressure vessel is approximately one third of the size of a conventional coal-fired boiler. It therefore needs less material for construction, an economic advantage, and this in turn means that it weighs less, and is therefore easier to transport.

<STRONG>To be flexible</STRONG><BR><BR>

<EM><STRONG>Modularity</STRONG></EM><BR>
PFBC comes in two sizes, the P200 rated at 85-100MWe, and P800 rated at 350-425MWe. These can be built singly or in configurations for an infinite variety of plant sizes. Standard design means that the units are mutually compatible.
<BR><BR>

<EM><STRONG>Coal qualities</STRONG></EM><BR>
ABB can offer PFBC plants using any type of coal, even of very poor quality, e.g. high ash, high sulphur content.<BR><BR>

<EM><STRONG>Technical concepts</STRONG></EM><BR>
The simplicity of the process renders it flexible and easy to use in a variety of applications. PFBC can be offered for reheat/non-reheat, for example, for condensing or district heating applications.<BR><BR>


<STRONG>To be financable</STRONG><BR>
PFBC is a viable investment, not merely a technical prospect for a utility.

<H2><A NAME="Tidd">The Tidd plant, Ohio, USA.</A></H2>

American Electric Power (AEP) selected the TIDD power plant to demonstrate the technical and commercial viability of PFBC. It involved raising efficiency and significantly reducing emissions from the 46 year old plant by retrofitting with a P200 unit provided by a joint venture between ABB and B&W. The AEP group received financial support from the US Department of Energy (DoE) Clean Coal Technology programme and from the State of Ohio Coal Development Office.<BR><BR>

The modular nature and small size of the PFBC system enabled the combustor to be constructed in workshops and then shipped to the site. The plant was successfully operated from 1991-1995, generating electricity and providing a basis for testing of sorbent utilisation and hot gas filters.<BR><BR><BR>

Empresa Nacional de Electricidad SA (ENDESA) is a state-owned utility producing about a quarter of Spains electricity from different coals, including lignite. A P200 module was used to repower an existing steam turbine at Escatron and demonstrate PFBC technology - a first step for ENDESA to incorporating PFBC in larger power plants.<BR><BR>

The Escatron unit was built by a consortium of ABB and Babcock & Wilcox Espaola. The PFBC installation at Escatron is fuelled by Aragon black lignite with an ash content of 36%, a sulphur content of 6.8% and approximately 20% moisture. Results prove that PFBC can successfully use lignite fuel: with no increase in consumption the plants output increased by over 20%.<BR><BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Golden Robot Award winner 1996 - Fran&ccedil;ois Ronssin</B></FONT>
<BR><BR>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>The Award Jury motivates its decision as follows:</B></FONT>
</CENTER>
<BR>
<I>"Mr. Fran&ccedil;ois Ronssin has shown himself to be a genuine ambassador for robotics in his own field of
TV-tube manufacturing. He was initially highly active in bringing around homogeneous automation for tube
handling, replacing 3-axis manipulators generally with robots in order to optimise availability and virtually
eliminate downtime. He has also propounded that concentration on robotics solutions reduces maintenance and
training costs. With his broad R&D experience and his dynamic forward looking approach he has further promoted
the use of robots for process application such as graphite laying and enamelling. Mr. Ronssin is a fervent
advocate of inter-plant cooperation and benchmarking and has proved to be ever alert to new robotic concepts
and applications."</I>
<BR><BR>
Fran&ccedil;ois Ronssin is engineering manager at the Display Components Division of Philips, in Dreux, France,
which is one of eight factories in the world producing colour picture tubes for TVs. Mr Ronssin was a pioneer
in promoting robots to the Philips plant. With more than 110 robots in operation, the Dreux facility is
recognized as one of the largest robot user anywhere outside the automotive industry. Ronssin's task is to
keep production technology at a world class manufacturing level. He is responsible for developing new processes
and equipment, and for maintenance and general services in the plant. Robotics plays an increasing role.

<P>
<I>The following Press Release was issued by SwePol Link on December 12:</I>
<P>
(Translation from Swedish)
<P>
<H2>
  ABB selected as supplier for the HVDC link to Poland
</H2>
<P>
An HVDC link is planned to be built between Sweden and Poland. ABB has been
selected as supplier. The final agreement will be signed when the permits
to build the link have been further clarified.
<P>
The DC link being planned between Sweden and Poland will connect two different
power systems, which gives mutual benefits for both countries in economic
as well as environmental terms. The whole Baltic region will benefit from
the environmental advantages.
<P>
The process to secure the necessary permits is underway. The procurement
process has been completed. ABB is the company having presented the most
attractive proposal. SwePol Link, which will own the link, has now signed
a Letter of Intent with ABB. The Letter of Intent will enable SwePol Link
to order the link during 1997, when all permits are expected to be obtained.
<P>
ABB has supplied all existing Swedish HVDC links. There is now more than
40 years of experience from these installations. The experiences concerning
reliability and environmental impact are good.

  Long Island Cable Project
</H2>
<P>
<I>The following Press Release was issued by NEES, Westborough, MA, USA on
December 11:</I>
<H3>
  UTILITY PROPOSES SUBMARINE POWER LINK BETWEEN CONNECTICUT AND LONG ISLAND
</H3>
<P>
Westborough, MA (December 11, 1996). Westborough-based New England Electric
System (NEES) is proposing to develop a 600-megawatt high-voltage, direct
current (HVDC) submarine cable transmission connection between Connecticut
and Long Island.
<P>
The new transmission system or "energy bridge" would introduce competitively
attractive sources of power into Long Island.
<P>
The proposed cable would run under Long Island Sound, connecting United
Illuminating Company's East Shore substation in New Haven, Conn. to Long
Island Lighting Company's Shoreham substation in Shoreham, Long Island. The
cable would be approximately 25 miles in length.
<P>
"We have met with various stakeholders, public and regulatory officials,
and environmental agencies to explain the project and garner support," says
Dan Lorden, NEES project manager. The proposed Long Island Cable Project
uses an independent transmission project (ITP) model that appropriately allocates
costs, risks, and benefits to owners and users of the cable.
<P>
The cable would have minimal environmental impact and require no new land
takings, since it is proposed that both ends of the cable would terminate
on existing utility property.
<P>
NEES plans to solicit potential users to support the ITP project through
its permitting phase, and would build, operate, and maintain facilities for
a fixed price. The company is working with ABB, the world's largest HVDC
supplier, to provide the necessary equipment.
<P>
Users that support the development of the project would have the first right
to enter into firm transmission service agreements for their share of the
project's transmission capacity under accepted Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission tariffs.
<P>
"Initial reactions to the project have been very favorable," says Lorden.
"We will conduct a solicitation of interest to support the project's permitting
costs in March 1997. If successful, NEES would complete permitting, including
regulatory approvals, by the end of 1998. The project's planned in-service
date is June 2000. The current cost estimate is $200 million.
<P>
New England Electric System (NYSE:NES) is a public utility holding company
headquartered in Westborough, Massachusetts. It is the region's lowest-cost
major electric utility, and services 1.3 million customers through its retail
companies in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and New Hampshire.

  ABB Power System has been awarded three contracts for a total of four Static
  Var Compensators and one contract for a Series Capacitor installation.
</H4>
<H3>
  Virginia Power
</H3>
<H4>
  The first contract has been awarded by Virginia Power, U.S.A. for a Utility
  SVC. This has a continuous rating of 78 Mvar capacitive to 30 Mvar inductive
  with a short-time overload rating of 167 Mvar for 10 seconds. The site for
  the compensator is located on one of the islands off the North Carolina coast
  and the compensator will regulate the system voltage and eliminate phase
  voltage unbalances during normal load fluctuations in the network. The SVC
  also has a short-time overload rating to give reactive power support following
  severe disturbances and contingencies in the network. The compensator is
  planned to be in commercial operation in July 1997.
</H4>
<H3>
  Saldanha Steel
</H3>
<H4>
  The second contract is for the turnkey delivery of two Power Quality SVCs,
  awarded by Saldanha Steel, South Africa. One of the SVCs is for a rolling
  mill and has a controllable range of 0-60 Mvar. The other SVC is for an electric
  arc furnace and has a controllable range of 15 Mvar inductive to 150 Mvar
  capacitive. Both SVCs will secure the operation of the steel mill as well
  as mitigate disturbances generated by the loads. The installation will be
  completed and commissioned in 1997.
</H4>
<H3>
  Jisco
</H3>
<H4>
  The third contract, also for a Power Quality SVC, was awarded by Jisco, China.
  The main task of this compensator will be to control the voltage variations
  on the load bus and to minimize disturbances in the network. The SVC has
  a controllable range of 5 Mvar inductive to 25 Mvar capacitive and will be
  installed at the Jisco steelworks. The installation will be completed and
  commissioned in 1998.
</H4>
<H3>
  Svenska Kraftn&auml;t
</H3>
<H4>
  Svenska Kraftn&auml;t, the Swedish National Grid, has awarded ABB a turnkey
  contract for the delivery of a 400 kV series capacitor installation to Isovaara
  in the northern part of Sweden. The capacitor bank, with a total rating of
  500 Mvar, will increase the transmission capability and improve the stability
  of the intertie transmission line between Sweden and Finland. The installation
  will enter into operation in October 1997.

<p><center>Over the years, we have built up a reputation
among shipyards and ship owners throughout
the world, with more <BR>than 10,000 installations
in different types of vessels. To support these,
we have a service organization covering <BR>every
major shipping center.
  Our business covers all applications of
marine refrigeration, from container ships<BR>
and reefers to provisions refrigeration and
comfort cooling for passenger ships.
  While we already account for a <BR>large
proportion of the world's marine refrigeration
installations, we pursue a dedicated programme 
of product <BR>and system development
to maintain the reputation we have won.
  The introduction of new systems based
on <BR>environment-friendly refrigerants is an
important part of this work.</center>

<br>
<hr width=90% align=center size=1>
<center>Modern reefers are universal in the sense that
they cover the whole temperature range from
+15 to -30 C. We have been developing 
refrigeration techniques for this purpose for
several decades.
  Among our innovations is the screw
compressor for marine applications. With its
compactness and high reability, it has become
a favorite among the world's ship owners.
Further reasons for our success in the
marine sector is our experience and knowledge in designing air 
circulation system for sensitive cargos and our early development 
of the Stalectronic family of automatic control
systems. These ensure optimal operation of
installations and correct temperature of cargoes at all times.

<br>
<p><center><font size=+1><b>CONTAINER VESSELS</b></font></center>
<br>
<hr width=80% align=center size=1>
<center>In the early 60's, we developed both air circulation
and refrigeration systems for porthole
containers. The containers<BR> were cooled by
fixed installations in the ships.
  Later, we launched two further systems
which are among the most <BR>commonly used
today. Staloduct, which supplies all the containers
in a stack with cold air from a common
cooler, <BR>and Stalicon, in which the air
flow and temperature can be individually
controlled for each container.

<center>We supply comfort cooling and provisions
refrigeration equipment for various types of
passenger vessel. The technical requirements
are highest in the case of cruise liners, where
we have the largest market share. We also
provide equipment<BR> of this type for general
cargo vessels. At present, about 4,000 of
our installations for provisions refrigeration
and comfort <BR>cooling are in use throughout
the world.

<center><p>We have a sincere
commitment to environmental questions. For
a long time, the majority of our refrigeration
installations have used ammonia as refrigerant 
and this technique is now being introduced
in comparatively small installations.
Ammonia is at present the only medium
without a negative effect on either 
the ozone layer or global warming.
  We are heavily engaged in testing future
alternatives to the hazardous chlorinated
refrigerants.
  At the same time, we pay attention to 
environmental aspects such as gas tightness
and efficient energy utilization, right from the
system and component design stage.
  We take a great interest in all aspects that
have a direct impact on the human environment.<br></center>

<center>Cooling equipment for air conditioning
systems plays an important part in people's
well-being and performance. <BR>We supply
cooling installations in industrial, public and
private environments. Our extensive chiller
ranges cover <BR>most requirements and include
a new type which uses a very small charge of
ammonia refrigerant.
  Here too, <BR>our know-how in environment friendly

<p><center><font size=+1><b>HEAT UTILIZATION</b></font></center>
<br>
<hr width=80% align=center size=1>
<br>
<center>Both industrial and sports facilities are
making increased use of the heat normally
generated by refrigeration systems.<BR>
  In addition to straightforward heat recovery,
 we offer an extensive product programme
and know-how in heat pumps.<BR> These can be
integrated with advantage in our installations

<FONT  SIZE=+2><STRONG>A<FONT SIZE=-1>BOUT THE FUTURE  A WORD FROM OUR PRESIDENT</FONT></STRONG></FONT><BR>




<P> 
<FONT SIZE=+2>"D</FONT>edicated work to develop the technology of the future breeds the need for innovation and experience.
<P>
A century in turbine technology not only makes us familiar with a wide range of steam and gas turbine applications, but also gives us profound knowledge of the needs of customers, their goals and concerns, be it in industry, utilities or in shipping.
<P>
ABB Stal is committing major efforts and resources to R&D and co-operates closely with corporate research centres within the <A HREF="http://www.abb.ch/abbgroup">ABB Group.</A> One example of the R&D work is the <A HREF="abbdle.htm">Dry Low Emission (DLE) burner</A>, developed by ABB Corporate Research and now fitted to our  <A HREF="gt10.htm">GT10</A> and <A HREF="gt35.htm">GT35</A> industrial gas turbines.<P> 
The new DLE technology reflects our commitment to the environment. ABB Stal's products contribute to a better life for thousands of people around the world by producing power and heat in the most efficient way and with low emissions.<P>

Total quality is the target of our Continuous Improvement Programme involving all employees. Everyone contributes his best efforts and knowledge to reaching this goal. We were, of course, certified according to the ISO 9001 standards since several years ago.
<P>Gas and steam turbines for industry are the main focus of our company: gas turbines up to 50 MW and steam turbines up to 100 MW. We have also accumulated considerable experience in building and servicing large steam turbines for both nuclear and fossil fired power plants in the Swedish and Finnish markets.
<P>The <A HREF="combined.htm">combined cycle</A> / cogeneration markets provide a great opportunity for turbines in our size range. The oil and gas industry requires reliable drives for compressors and pumps. Propulsion of high-speed ferries represents an emerging market and a challenge for reliable and clean gas turbines. ABB Stal has wide experience of the propulsion of large ships in the past, when the AP steam turbine machinery was a favourite among shipowners.
<P>Today, ABB Stal is well equipped to satisfy the demands of qualified customers around the world and to build on the engineering heritage from the pioneers of the past."

A French Company With Long-Term Experience in the Nuclear Power Business</B></FONT></TD>
</TR></TABLE></CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=0><TR>
<TD WIDTH=478>
<B>At the end of 1994, ABB Atom acquired the French company Barras Provence, a well-reputed company in the field of nuclear power. Owing to its recognized PWR reactor expertise and its knowledge of the French market, Barras Provence will serve well as a complement to the other companies in the ABB Atom&#146;s Nuclear Power Business Area. ABB Atom works closely with Barras Provence.</B>
<P>
ABB Barras Provence is situated at Manosque, about 80 kilometers north of Marseille. Its employees number about 250.  The company, which has a current turnover of approximately FRF 200 million, was founded in 1962 primarily to carry out electro-mechanical installations and service for the Commissariat &agrave; l&#146;Energie Atomique (CEA) located at Cadarache, some 15 kilometers south of Manosque. The company&#146;s operations were gradually diversified to also include the design and manufacture of equipment for nuclear power plant maintenance and service as well as the design and manufacture of equipment in the fields of defense, telecommunications, and education. The company has excellent expertise in systems for the control of robots and manipulators and in equipment for use in various kinds of tough environments. Business from the nuclear power industry today accounts for 60 per cent of the turnover, and this is expected to increase considerably over the next few years.</TD>

&#147;As Barras Provence is now part of the ABB Group, the prospects for ABB&#146;s nuclear power pro- ducts in France are good,&#148; says Philippe Gros-Gean, the marketing manager for international projects. &#147;Because of the special French specifications, most of the products will have to be modified. We have years of experience in how this is to be done. The reason for such adap- tation is that there is only one owner of all the commercial nuclear power plants, EDF (Electricit&eacute; de France), which places stringent demands on even small components.&#148;
<P>
Even if the French market ranks highest, Barras Provence figures on exporting its expertise more and more.
<P>
&#147;Customers in Sweden and in other countries can benefit greatly from our PWR expertise and our unique know-how in controlling robots and manipulators,&#148; says President Lars Rylander. &#147;We also have access to very advanced technology in the field of 3-D videogrammetry. As an example of our work, I can mention the design and manufacture of prototype equipment for Vattenfall Ringhals for the internal inspection of main cooling systems.&#148;</TD>

Intensive work is now underway at ABB Barras Provence to certify the repair of Nuclear Steam Supply Systems (NSSS) in France. Certification  will mean that the company will be able to assume total responsibility for repair projects and thereby, for example, be directly responsible to safety authorities. The ongoing work encompasses a thorough quality assurance audit as well as the formalization of the collaboration with the other companies in ABB&#146;s Nuclear Power Business Area. These companies and Barras Provence will be audited by the French authorities.<P>

&#147;The certification, &#146;Reparateur Certification&#146;, will involve a substantial expansion of our domestic market,&#148; says Lars Rylander. &#147;This, together with increases sales of products from other ABB companies as well as an increase in exports of French nuclear power technology, gives me a positive view of the future. I think that it&#146;ll be possible to double turnover within the next three years.&#148;</TD>

<B>ABB TRC is a wholly owned subsidiary of ABB Atom operating in the field of <A HREF="b20.htm">non- destructive testing</A>. The business was founded as early as 1937, at that time as a department of the Royal Academy of Engineering Scien- ces. Four years later, TRC became a corporation. ABB Atom acquired 50- percent ownership in the company in 1986, and took over the remaining shares in 1989.</B></TD>

</TR></TABLE>
TRC has its headquarters in T&auml;by, just north of Stockholm. The number of employees is around 115, about 100 of whom work in the main office. Business is almost totally directed toward the nuclear power industry. The company offers a comprehensive program of diverse inspection services for BWR, PWR and RMBK reactors. The major part of income is derived from the domestic market (Sweden and Finland), but exports are taking on a growing importance. Present significant export markets are France and Lithuania, and, to a certain extent, Belgium. Close collaboration is often established with ABB companies in other countries, such as with ABB Barras Provence in France and ABB Reaktor in Germany. TRC has, itself, a subsidiary in V&auml;ster&aring;s, the NDT Training Center, with about five employees.
<P>
TRC has specialized in advanced non-destructive testing, i.e., mechanized and automated test programs using advanced computers and robots. In addition to offering testing services, it also develops and sells equipment for non-destructive testing. TRC has its own workshops for manufacturing vital parts for this equipment, such as sensitive transducers. A big advantage is that TRC has access to a testing and service facility for active equipment in which it is possible to set up large measuring rigs. At the time of this reporter's visit, work was in progress to overhaul SESAM rigs used to test pipe connections and reactor vessels.</TD>

&#147;TRC has undergone a very positive develop- ment since ABB Atom became the owner,&#148; says Sven Hedenstr&ouml;m, the head of administra- tion. &#147;We have increa- sed income from about 70 million kronor to 120 million. During the same period, the number of employees has increased from 81 to 115, and the possibilities for further expansion are good. We are, for instance, far out in front when it comes to compiling with the statutes of the Swedish Nuclear Inspectorate.
<P>
When TRC was established, X-ray testing was the most modern technology imaginable, and operations were totally directed to its exploitation. As the years passed, development trends have been toward tests using ultrasonics and electromagnetic techniques, and X-ray work has diminished in importance. Despite the &#147;R&ouml;ntgen&#148; in the company&#146;s name, X-ray inspection now constitutes a small part of its current operations.</TD>

&#147;Progress is swift, and it&#146;s totally imperative for us to keep up,&#148; says Sven Hedenstr&ouml;m. &#147;A lot of money is invested every year in new technology and in new equipment. We have, furthermore, established a development section for ultrasonics and other testing methods at ABB Power in Telford, U.K. There, we have a chance to get hold of the specialists we need.&#148;
<P>
A problem for TRC is that almost all the work on the domestic scene arrives at the same time, during the period from April to September.
<P>
&#147;We are focusing on increasing exports in order to even out the work load,&#148; says Jan Gustafsson, Marketing Manager. &#147;During recent years, we have penetrated a number of new markets. At present, for example, we have people in Korea to test reactor vessel lids. We&#146;ve been asked to increase the level of safety surrounding the reactors at Ignalina in Lithuania, and we have delivered equipment for reactor vessel inspection to Sizewell B in the U.K. Our efforts at Ignalina are a success, and arouse a great deal of interest. I believe we have plenty of opportunity to further develop exports.&#148;</TD>

A number of organisational changes have taken place within ABB Carbon since the summer. Business is unaffected. ABB Carbon is now a division of the company ABB Stal, on the same Finspong site, with direct access to the manufacturing, technical and service resources of the 100 year-old, 2000 employee company, also the supplier of the specially adapted PFBC-machines, the gas turbines 35P and 140P. <BR>
Tomas Wngberg is the new manager for ABB Carbon. Tomas has wide experience of power generation for industry within ABB. He succeeds Hans Malm, who is now responsible for business development for ABB utility steam power plants, based in Mannheim. New Marketing & Sales manager since September is Jim Anderson, previously technical director for Carbon. He succeeds Krishna Pillai, who has been appointed manager JGT, Japan Gas Turbine KK, a joint venture between ABB and Kawasaki, based in Kobe. Jan-Eric Rydn now has responsibility for the entire engineering department, previously two groups.<BR><BR>

</TABLE></CENTER><BR>


7th October the print dried on the signatures of Rafi Peled, president of Israel Electric Corporation, and Tomas Wngberg, president of ABB Carbon, on a frame agreement between the two companies, defining future cooperation for PFBC combustion of oil shale. The agreement also specifically covers a verification programme encompassing conceptual design of those PFBC-systems which will be non-standard for an oil shale-fired plant, and three months testing of 600 tons of Israeli oilshale in the Finspong Process Test Facility. The tests are currently under preparation, and will begin in December this year. The purpose of the tests is to sound the limits of the combustion parameters: in previous tests Carbons PTF  has already accumulated 270 hours of successful operation under conditions which have caused problems for competing technologies with this fuel.<BR>
Oil shale is a low-grade fuel, which is nonetheless widely used in a number of countries where it is indigenous. Recent technical and economic investigations indicate that PFBC has the potential to provide cost-effective power generation, with easy operation and low environmental impact.
Since it was estabished in February 1995, the Process Test Facility has accumulated over 1900 operation hours with a variety of fuels and fuel mixes. The next mix to be tested for a two-week period is a mixture of coal and predried sewage sludge (10-15%). <BR>

By the end of October the GT140P PFBC-machine will be completed and ready to begin its testing schedule. Cold testing will be completed before Christmas, after which hot testing will begin. Continuous measurement will be made of important operation parameters: temperature, pressure, output, vibrations, noise levels and so on. Hot testing will continue until the autumn of 1997, when the machine will be dismantled, inspected and shipped to the Karita site in Japan. Installation and erection planning are already underway.<BR>

</TABLE></CENTER><BR>

ABB has been awarded a contract to build a PFBC combined heat and power plant in Cottbus in eastern Germany. The order was placed by Stadtwerke Cottbus and the Hamburg Kommunal Finanz Group, April 22nd, 1996. A long-term service contract was also entered into. The project is a breakthrough on the German market for ABBs clean-coal PFBC technology, and the first PFBC to use brown coal. This plant, which  will be an important reference for the use of this widespread fuel, will be supplied by ABB Kraftwerke and ABB Carbon.<BR><BR>

The combined heat and power plant (CHP) will use the locally mined Lausitzer brown coal and will provide the town with district heating as well as electricity (maximum production being 74 MWe and 120 MWth in district heating mode). In addition to the P200 combined cycle plant, two gas-fired boilers will be supplied for use during periods of high heat demand, bringing the maximum heat output up to 220 MWth. 
Site work will begin in autumn 1996 and erection will start at the beginning of 1997. Commissioning is scheduled to start in summer 1998 and the plant will be on line in the summer of 1999.<BR><BR>

PFBC technology was chosen as being the most modern commercially available clean-coal technology with high efficiency and extremely low emissions.<BR><BR>

During a state visit to Sweden during the first week of June, Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua was received at the Vrtan PFBC plant by Percy Barnevik, CEO and Chairman of the ABB Group, who personally submitted a complete financing proposal for a 2 x P200 PFBC plant for China. The Chinese government has included the construction of a Clean Coal Plant by the year 2000 in its 9th Five Year Plan The ABB proposal is for this first plant in China to be a cogeneration plant.<BR><BR>

A Memorandum of Understanding had previously been signed in Vsters, Sweden, on Saturday 27th April, between ABB Sweden and the SSTC (State Science and Technology Commission) of the Peoples Republic of China for cooperation in the fields of PFBC and Transmission and Distribution. The SSTC is an advisory and approval organisation directly responsible to the Leaders Council.<BR><BR><BR><BR>

The current wave of deregulation means that a utility has to sharpen its products in order to remain competitive in a market that's growing tougher everyday. Network operators' efficiency levels are being scrutinized. While at the same time, customers are demanding better service from their energy suppliers.

<DD>A utility's ability to compete is determined by a better understanding of the business process and internal work processes. Having the right information at the right time can mean everything to competitiveness. Not to mention the ability to ensure reliability and efficiency in electricity supply.

<DD>Information Technology (IT) is the key element. And that's just where ABB Network Partner AB can help.<P>

<B>Panorama meets the new demands!</B><BR>
The power industry is developing and so are the needs of products and services in this big change. That's why we've changed our business concept in order to meet these needs. The result is our Panorama Concept. 

<DD>Panorama is the ABB Network Partner AB's solution for economical, efficient and reliable management of power networks. From power generation to distribution.


<DD>The concept offers integrated solutions as well as independent products for every need. The solutions are developed for all electricity customers - both for private consumers and major industries. All with one purpose, to respond to the new and greater demands for coordinated monitoring, control, protection and metering of the power process.<P>

<B>A complete supplier</B><BR>
ABB Network Partner AB in Vsters, Sweden, markets, supplies and maintains the entire Panorama concept. We have an annual turnover in excess of $130 millions with our 730 employees.

<DD>Besides our own competence, know-how and resources, we have access to the resources and expertise of over 6.000 people in our worldwide business area.

<DD>ABB Network Partner AB can deliver the world's most complete, modern and flexible monitoring, control and protection systems. Our investment in business management systems and customer service solutions brings completeness in our Panorama offerings for the needs of the power industry.<P>

<B>At the forefront of development</B><BR>
Two key systems in the global Panorama concept - S.P.I.D.E.R. and PYRAMID - are developed by ABB in V&auml;ster&aring;s, Sweden. 

<DD>Each year ABB Network Partner AB invests more than 10% of its turnover in research and product development. This investment combined with additional efforts in R&D within our business area assures Panorama's position at the forefront in one of the fastest growing branches - information technology for the power industry. <P>

<B>With long experience</B><BR>
The roots of ABB Network Partner AB go back to the turn of the century. We installed our first protection relay in 1905 and by 1925 we had a remote controlled station in operation. Down through the years we've introduced a great number of leading innovations within our business area, appreciated even from a global perspective.

<DD>Our strategy has always been to be on the cutting edge of development supplying the power industry with solutions that are both technologically advanced and cost effective.

<DD>ABB has supplied over 1.500 network control systems and tens of thousands protection relay systems to customers world-wide. Since ABB Network Partner AB is the largest supplier, we can offer an unbeatable experience for creating solutions for monitoring, control and protection of power systems.

  HVDC
</H2>
<H4>
  The HVDC technology is used to transmit electricity over long distances by
  overhead transmission lines or submarine cables. It is also used to interconnect
  separate power systems, where traditional alternating current (AC) connections
  can not be used. ABB pioneered the HVDC technology and is the undisputed
  world leader in the HVDC field.

  one point in a three-phase AC network, converted to DC in a converter station,
  transmitted to the receiving point by an overhead line or cable and then
  converted back to AC in another converter station and injected into the receiving
  AC network. Typically, an HVDC transmission has a rated power of more than
  100 MW and many are in the 1000 - 2000 MW range.
</H4>
<H4>
  HVDC transmissions are used for transmission of power over long or very long
  distances, because it then becomes economically attractive over conventional
  AC lines.
</H4>
<H4>
  With an HVDC system, the power flow can be controlled rapidly and accurately
  as to both the power level and the direction. This possibility is often used
  in order to improve the performance and efficiency of the connected AC networks.

  Reactive Power Compensation (RPC)
</H2>
<H4>
  Rising energy costs, increased transmission distances and use of large generating
  machines are resulting in increased demands for reliable and more economic
  operation of transmission and distribution systems.
</H4>
<H4>
  Reactive power appears in every AC power system and causes instability, unbalance
  and high losses of the active power. The reactive power compensation systems
  will achieve improvement of transmission capacity, reduction of losses and
  stability of voltage.

    Influence of <B>SVC</B> and <B>SC</B> on Power Transmission Capability
  </CENTER>
</H4>
<P>
<IMG SRC="influen.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">
<H4>
  Between electric power systems which are interconnected via a relatively
  weak line, power oscillation problems often arise. Damping is often the factor
  that determines the transmission capacity. Static Var Compensators (SVC)
  and Series Compensators (SC) increases the damping action so that more power
  can be transmitted. The installation of new lines can therefore be avoided
  or postponed.

  The Bakun Project a Good Strategy for Sustainable Development
</H2>
<P>
One of the overriding tasks facing mankind is to give the deprived and rapidly
growing three-quarters of the worlds population possibilities to break out
from their poverty and create a better life. In parallel with the necessary
growth, we must also conserve our earths finite resources. This concerns
addressing successfully such problems as food production, the availability
of clean water and the supply of energy without destroying our common
environment. The Rio Conference in 1992 stated that economic growth was needed
to eradicate poverty and to save the environment.
<P>
We in the rich world have a responsibility to change our own lifestyle when
it comes to economizing on the consumption of resources and to eco-cycle
concepts. We also have a responsibility towards the developing countries
by transferring to them the experiences of our own industrialization as well
as efficient and clean technology, which can help them along the road to
so-called sustainable development. They must avoid the mistakes we made during
our industrialization. The warning example here is the ruthless exploitation
of the environment during the industrialization of the former Soviet Union.
<P>
Billions of deprived people in the East and South have started to move. It
is no longer a question of small developing islands like Singapore or Taiwan,
but 700-800 million people in countries like China and India are now experiencing
a rapid economic growth. In ten years perhaps twice as many will be able
to share in this growth. The increased strain on the global environment resulting
from the accelerating growth will overshadow all previous experience.
<P>
Certain people in the rich world paint doomsday scenarios and assert that
our common environment will not be able to cope with this industrialization
and increased consumption of energyultimately an improved standard of living
of the globes impoverished people. With what right can we stop this development
towards a higher standard of living in the poor nations, which we ourselves
have experienced over the last one hundred years? This question should be
posed loudly and clearly. The answer is that we do not have this right, but
instead the obligation to lessen our own impact on the environment and to
help the poor nations on the road to sustainable development. The supply
of energy and in particular electrical energy represents here an important
motor in the development, irrespective of whether we talk about rural areas,
cities, industry or transportation.
<P>
<H3>
  Electrical energy policy in a developing country
</H3>
<P>
In, for example, parts of Asia the GNP is growing at an annual rate of around
10 percent. The need for further electrical power generating capacity in
India and Asia Pacific is estimated to be 1.5 million MW up to 2020 or 60,000
MW per year. This presupposes at the same time the refurbishment of existing
power plants to make them more efficient and to reduce emissions as well
as the adoption of modern and energy-saving technology for the distribution
and use of electricity. The total increase corresponds to roughly half of
the worlds installed power generating capacity. As comparison, it can be
mentioned that Sweden over a period of one century built 33,000 MW. This
consequently corresponds to what is now being planned to be built over six
months merely in India and Asia Pacific.
<P>
The principal options for electricity production during the coming decades
in these regions are coal, oil, natural gas, nuclear power and hydro power.
What is economically and environmentally best varies depending on the local
conditions such as the availability of primary energy resources, suitable
sites for hydro power plants and the existing infrastructure. Certain countries
have good prerequisites for biomass, while direct-acting solar energy and
wind power will be marginal in the foreseeable future. Their ambition is
also to avoid dependence on a single form of energy, and it is necessary
to distinguish between base and peak load generating capacity.
<P>
Each country is responsible for its own energy policy and we must also accept
the right and capability of a developing nation to set its own priorities.
My perception is that environmental awareness among a considerable number
of developing nations is even greater that in certain so-called developed
nations. There sometimes occurs in the Western environmental debate an unpleasant
tendency towards old colonial attitudes, where people talk about what a
developing nation should or shall do or even try to exert economic and political
pressure. We can draw a parallel with the poor Sweden one century ago, which
was dependent on the import of capital and technology. How would we have
reacted if, for example, British and German interests demanded that we should
build coal-fired power plants instead of harnessing our rivers?
<P>
<H3>
  The fundamental selection situation
</H3>
<P>
If we accept the right of deprived people to raise their standard of living
and perceive that this in turn requires among other things an increased supply
of energy including electrical power generation capacity, the following question
then arises: What technology is to be adopted to optimize in an economic
and environmentally sound way and create sustainable development? At this
point the debate frequently gets derailed, since people one-sidedly reject
an option based on its disadvantages without comparing it with other options
and their disadvantages. Finally, all realistic options have been rejected.
It is a well-known and self-evident fact that all technical options for providing
new power generating capacity have negative impacts on the environment. This
applies also to other infrastructure projects like ports, bridges, airports,
hospitals, schools, etc.
<P>
Negative consequences for the environment arouse strong feelings among many
people and one can readily understand that all those who make pronouncements
do not have an overall picture or possibility to penetrate frequently complex
comparisons of different alternatives. When debaters possessing more knowledge
one-sidedly reject one option without seriously discussing other ones, I
do not hesitate to call this populism or intellectual dishonesty. Sometimes
I feel that among these people there exists an underlying perception that
the poor nations should not really raise their standard of living out of
consideration for the global environment. Instead of clearly stating this,
they say no to all realistic alternatives.
<P>
<H3>
  The Bakun project and Malaysia
</H3>
<P>
All the ingredients I have just mentioned above are to be found in the current
debate on the Bakun project. I would have preferred that a neutral body had
discussed the environmental and economic consequences, because there exists
a self-evident and inbuilt distrust of the arguments put forward by somebody
like me and ABB having an economic interest in the project. Let us therefore
put to one side the positive effects for ABB (value of the contract approximately
SEK 20 billionUS$ 3 billion), increased employment in different countries
(e.g., 10,000 man-years in Sweden), the transfer of technology and the
establishment of local businesses and industry in Malaysia for future projects
and exports (fully 30 percent of the project local value added), etc. As
far as ABBs role is concerned, let us also disregard the fact that any other
company would build the power plant if we dont do this and let us also disregard
the consequences of other future hydro power projects. As far as possible
the following reasoning is based exclusively on Malaysias economic and
environmental considerations.
<P>
In brief, the project involves a 2,400 MW hydro power plant with associated
dam at Bakun in the Malaysian province of Sarawak on Borneo. The power plant
project including the power transmission to the mainland is expected to start
up in late 1996 and be completed in the year 2003 at a total cost of
approximately SEK 35 billion (US$ 5 billion). The power transmission has
a length of 1,300 km, half of it on land and half in submarine DC cables.
As a result of the head and the deep valleys, the area of the reservoir
(approximately one-third of that of Lake V&auml;nern) will be limited in
relation to the amount of power that can be obtained. The project includes
the building of roads and modern housing for the 9,500 or so people who will
have to move from the vicinity of the reservoir. Some of the persons affected
are positive, others negative. It can be noted that the Malaysian authorities
have made far-reaching undertakings concerning compensation for land, buildings
and jobs as well as possibilities of continued fishing and agricultural
activities.
<P>
The ABB consortium was selected by the customer and the Malaysian Government
to execute the project against severe competition from a number of international
consortia. The motive was the best technology and the lowest cost. The best
technology includes very low electrical transmission losses with ABBs HVDC
technology. The conditions for the project include compliance with Malaysias
environmental legislation and this will be monitored by Malaysias and Sarawaks
environmental agencies during the progress of the project. In addition, the
consortium will have its own environmental management system to minimize
the impact on the environment at and around the working site.
<P>
With 19 million inhabitants Malaysia is currently undergoing fast economic
development, including the expansion of its electricity supply. At present,
70 percent of the electricity generation is based on natural gas (several
gas-fired power plants have been built by ABB), and 10 percent each on coal,
oil and hydro power. The per capita consumption of electricity is today only
one-tenth of that in Sweden. They have chosen not to invest in nuclear power,
which is a wise decision, since the level of technology in the country is
still not so high. Gas-fired power plants could be rapidly built and this
had moderate environmental consequences. They now wish, however, to use natural
gas in the petrochemical industry and, further, the gas reserves are limited.
A careful expansion of hydro power, the green electricity, therefore constitutes
an important factor in Malaysias electricity strategy.
<P>
When Bakun starts to operate and a number of other projects are completed,
it is estimated that, in about ten years, the oil-based share of the electricity
production will become marginal and gas-based production below 50 percent,
while coal-based electricity production will increase to just below 30 percent
and hydro power production to 20 percent. Even if the combustion of coal
increases, the overall consumption of fossil fuels will decrease.
<P>
The first question to be posed when a choice is to be made is: What is the
best expansion of hydro power production in Malaysia with respect to the
economy and the environmental impact in relation to the power that can be
obtained? After 15 years of studies of the hydro power potential, the answer
was the Bakun project. The next question is: Where does the Bakun project
stand in relation to other technologies, primarily expansion with fossil
fuel? The answer was that the Bakun project was best, when all the economic
and environmental arguments are weighed together. The dam reduces the area
of the rainforest by 70,000 hectares and requires the moving of 9,500 persons,
but at the same time gives large amounts of renewable energy for coming
generations. The other principal options entailed the increased combustion
of fossil fuels with global consequences such as climatic changes and local
effects in the form of acidification of lakes and the soil. If, for example,
the Bakun project were replaced by oil- and gas-fired power plants, this
would be equivalent to the consumption of oil transported by two supertankers
every month or two gas carriers every week. Even if the best coal technology
were adopted, the coal combustion would annually produce carbon dioxide emissions
of about 11 million tons or 30,000 tons per day. This can be compared with
the total annual CO2 emissions from cars and buses in Sweden of 14 million
tons.
<P>
Over a long period of time Malaysia has been studying its electrical energy
strategy, utilizing the services of international experts and the best experience
to optimize the economic and environmental consequences. Personally, I feel
they have succeeded well and have a good strategy for, as far as possible,
a sustainable development.
<P>
In the debate it has been asserted that ABB does not live up to its environmental
responsibility and that the project contradicts my earlier statements in,
for example, the book Changing Course. These assertions are without any
foundation and I wish absolutely to reject them. The Bakun project is in
line with the Rio Declaration, Agenda 21 and the Climate Convention. It is
based on renewable energy and makes a very limited contribution to the so-called
greenhouse effect. And even if the project also entails negative consequences
for the local environment, these are overall less compared to the negative
consequences resulting from other feasible options.
<P>
I am glad not only that the ABB consortium has won on the basis of better
technology and economy, but also that ABB is committed to developments within
this part of the world through both the transfer of the best possible technology
and the establishment of local businesses and industry. Furthermore, I consider
that a careful utilization of the hydro power potential in Asia, Africa and
Latin America should be given higher priority in the global electrical energy
planning.

<H2>Applications of Controllable Series Capacitors for Damping
of Power Swings</H2>

<H4>Below is the abstract of the paper. To receive a paper copy,
please send an e-mail to <A HREF="mailto:info@sepow.postnet.se">info@sepow.postnet.se</A>.
</H4>

<H4>&quot;This paper examines the use of controllable series capacitors
for damping of electromechanical oscillations. The fundamental
input signal for damping of power swings is discussed based on
the study of eigenvalues of a linearized power system. The impact
of a CSC on damping of a power system is shown through an analytical
approach. Use of appropriate locally measurable input signals
are investigated for two power systems. The performance of CSC
for damping of power swings is compared with that of a PSS. It
is shown that a CSC can be a very effective device for damping
of power swings using locally measurable input signals.&quot;

  Bakun Hydro-Electric Corporation and ABB consortium signed contract
</H2>
<H4>
  On October 2, ABB and its consortium partner Companhia &nbsp;Brasileira de
  Projetos e Obras (CBPO) of Brazil, signed the contract with the Malaysian
  customer Bakun Hydro-Electric Corporation Sdn Bhd for the construction of
  the 2400 MW hydro-electric power plant, including the associated 1300 km
  <A HREF="l1411.htm">HVDC transmission </A>at Bakun in Sarawak, Malaysia.
  <P>
  The contract was signed in Kuala Lumpur by the three parties in presence
  of the Prime Minister of Malaysia, Dr. Mahathir Mohamad, and most of his
  cabinet ministers. The project is valued at over USD 5 billion and is the
  largest ever undertaken by ABB. &nbsp;Construction is scheduled to start
  later this year.

  ABB's consortium partner for the civil works will be CBPO of Brazil, a large
  civil engineering company belonging to the Odebrecht Group. In addition,
  substantial parts of the project will be carried out by Malaysian companies
  and other groups from Asia, Latin America and Europe.
</H4>

  Percy Barnevik, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of ABB,
  says: "Malaysia's energy requirements are growing rapidly as the country's
  manufacturing sector takes off and purchasing power increases. ABB is committed
  to supporting this positive development with the most advanced technology
  available for an important renewable energy source."
</H4>

  The concrete face rockfill dam (CFRD) will be among the highest in the world
  of its type - 205 metres, and the 670-kilometre high-voltage direct-current
  submarine cable link between Sarawak and Peninsular Malaysia will be the
  world&#180;s longest. Even with such dimensions and high ratings, the Bakun
  HEP will be safe and efficient, being based on sound and proven technologies.

  National Power Corporation is constructing a 440 MW, 350 kV monopolar HVDC
  link to transfer power from the geothermal power plant on the island of Leyte,
  to the southern part of the main island of Luzon to feed the existing AC
  grid in the Manila region.
</H4>
<H4>
  Contract comprising design, delivery, installation and commissioning of two
  converter stations as well as electrode and cable stations was awarded in
  1994 to ABB Power Systems AB, Sweden in cooperation with Marubeni Corporation,
  Japan
</H4>
<H4>
  The new HVDC interconnection will be beneficial both to industry and the
  inhabitants of the Manila area, not only through the added power influx,
  but also through the inherent stabilizing effect of an HVDC link on the AC
  network.
</H4>
<H4>
  The use of geothermal power contributes significantly to environmental
  improvements on a national as well as a global scale.
</H4>
<P>
<H3>
  Project status December 1996

<H4>
  System engineering and equipment design have been compleeted and transportation
  to the sites in the Philippines is in progress.

  The civil construction at the sites is proceeding well and installation will
  start in January 1997.

  The Maharashtra State Electricity Board of India (MSEB) is constructing an
  HVDC link between Chandrapur and Padghe, in the Mumbai (Bombay) area, to
  transmit bulk power of 1500 MW at a DC voltage of 500 kV. The terminals are
  being constructed by ABB of Sweden, ABB of India and Bharat Heavy Electricals
  Limited of India. The in service date is November 1997 for Pole 1 and February
  1998 for Pole 2. The HVDC link incorporates control features to stabilise
  the Maharashtra grid, increase the power flow on the existing east-west 400
  kV AC lines and minimise the total line losses. Difficulties in obtaining
  right-of-way for the 400 kV AC alternative was an additional reason for choosing
  HVDC as the environmental impact is lower.
</H4>
<P>
<H4>
  Project status December 1996
</H4>
<H4>
  The project is developing according to schedule. System engineering and equipment
  design have been completed as has manufacturing of the European equipment
  (Thyristor valves, converter transformers, control equipment HV filter
  capacitors, breakers, telecomm equipment, etc). Transportation of equipment
  to the sites in India is almost complete (Control equipment is still at sea,
  Telecomm equipment is being shipped)
</H4>
<H4>
  The civil construction at sites is proceeding well, and installation of equipment
  has started. Each site has a work forces of over 650 people.

<H3><A NAME="When fuel economy is more than important">When fuel economy is more than important</A></H3>
Base load power generation with over 50% efficiency, cogeneration with efficiencies approaching 90% and with a 1:1 power-to-heat ratio, what other process can offer better fuel saving features than combined cycle plants?
High conversion efficiency also results in less pollution per generated unit of power  especially important for curbing emissions of pollutants like carbon dioxide, for which no commercial abatement method is yet available.
The low-NO<SUB>X</SUB> burners delivered as a standard with ABB gas turbine plants makes them among the most environmentally sound power generators you are likely to find, as well as the most economical.

<H4>The secret behind the success of ABB gas turbine cogeneration and combined cycle sales:</H4>
<UL>
<LI>The experience and capabilities of ABB as a turnkey partner</LI>
<LI>High fuel efficiency</LI>
<LI>Environmentally sound</LI>
<LI>High availability</LI>
<LI>Full automation / low personnel costs</LI>
<LI>Low investment cost</LI>
<LI>Compact design</LI>
<LI>Short delivery and erection time</LI>
<LI>Fuel flexibility</LI>
<LI>Short start-up time</LI>
<LI>Low cooling-water demand</LI>
</UL>
<H5>That's why ABB combined cycle plants offer the best overall economy</H5>
<IMG SRC="bar1.gif" WIDTH=600 HEIGHT=2>
<H3><A NAME="The combined experience of ABB">The combined experience of ABB</A></H3>
<P>ABB is the ideal partner for combined cycle and cogeneration projects. Our company's history goes back to the invention of the steam turbine and the three-phase generator. We have developed and manufactured industrial gas turbines for more than half a century.
<P>When fuel prices started to soar, and when efficiency became a key word in power generation circles, it was natural for us to enter the market for combined cycle plants.
<P>ABB supplies combined cycle plants based on state-of-the-art technology. The fact that we manufacture the prime components ourselves is one of the reasons for the documented high performance and availability of ABB combined cycle plants.
<P>Our customers also appreciate the local presence of ABB in virtually all parts of the world, the company's financial strength and precise delivery times.
<P>An ABB combined cycle plant is ready to generate power and profits for you, whenever you need it.
<IMG SRC="bar1.gif" WIDTH=600 HEIGHT=2>
<H3><A NAME="Avariety of applications">Avariety of applications</A></H3>
<P>ABB industrial gas turbines and combined cycle plants are finding numerous applications around the world, from open-cycle stand-by power plants to the most energy-efficient industrial combined cycle plants. The flexibility of the ABB modular component programme makes it possible to offer the optimal plant design for each application.
<P>ABBcan offer two heavy-duty industrial gas turbines, the GT10 and GT35. While the <A HREF="GT10.HTM">GT10</A>, with a nominal output of 25 MWe, is designed with cogeneration and combined cycle duty in mind, the <A HREF"GT35.HTM">GT35</A>, rated at 17 MWe, has found applications as a simple cycle and cogeneration unit. 
<H4><A NAME="Gas turbine power generation">Gas turbine power generation</A></H4>
<P>The simple gas turbine plant is used for both continuous operation and for emergency and stand-by duty. In countries where the fuel price is moderate, or surplus fuel is available from an industrial process, the simple cycle gas turbine is the solution.
<P>The most common applications for simple cycle gas turbines are for emergency and stand-by service. The fuel flexibility and short start-up time of industrial gas turbines make them especially suitable for this type of service.
<P>The <A HREF"GT35.HTM>GT35</A> is used wherever continuous base load power, availability, ease of maintenance and fuel flexibility are important requirements.
The turbines are used as mechanical drives or for stand-by power and combined cycle cogeneration, which clearly indicates the versatility of these robust, yet lightweight models.
<H4><A NAME="Gas turbine cogeneration">Gas turbine cogeneration</A></H4>
<P>Equipping the gas turbine with a heat recovery steam generator is a simple way to achieve cogeneration that requires only moderate initial investment.
<P>The recovered heat can be used for production of industrial process steam or for district heating.
<P>The GT35 and GT10 gas turbines are both ideal for these types of application, due to their high fuel-to-power efficiencies and moderate-to-high exhaust gas temperatures.
<P>Replacing the boiler fan with a gas turbine is another effective way to increase the power generating capability and electricity-to-heat ratio in an existing plant at a modest investment cost.
ABB has delivered a large number  units for cogeneration.
<H4><A NAME="Combined cycle power generation">Combined cycle power generation</A></H4>
<P>With the introduction of the combined cycle, gas turbines "graduated" from typical peaking power generators to both medium- and base load applications.
<P>ABBgas turbines are designed for heavy duty and long, continuous operation, making them especially suitable for base load power operation. Our combined cycle plants have net efficiencies typically over 50% and they retain high efficiencies over long periods of time and at part loads. The gas turbines use both gaseous and liquid fuels and, in the case of dual fuels, can automatically switch from one fuel to another during operation.
<P>ABBStal combined cycle plants are used for a wide spectrum of power and heat generation applications within industries ranging from utility and food industry to pulp and paper mills and the chemical industry.
<P>Whenever you need a low-cost, efficient and environmentally sound solution for your heat and power generation needs  a solution that can also be used in densely populated areas  an ABBcombined cycle plant will be the better choice.
<H4><A NAME="Combined cycle cogeneration">Combined cycle cogeneration</A></H4>
<P>The number of possible industrial cogeneration applications are virtually unlimited for a combined cycle plant.
<P>The most common one is to utilise back-pressure steam at about 8-10 bar, or steam extraction, for an industrial process. 
<P>But there are many other cogeneration possibilities that are sometimes overlooked.
<P>Using a combined cycle unit together with an incineration plant is an application of increasing interest to the market. The otherwise moderate steam temperature of the incineration boiler is superheated in the HRSG of the gas turbine to boost the power output and overall efficiency substantially.
<H4><A NAME="District heating">District heating</A></H4>
<P>Combined cycle plants are ideal for district heating applications. Environmentally sound, compact, easy to locate and involving a low investment cost, they offer a quick and economical solution for power generation in combination with heat production.
<P>The GT35 has found many applications as the most suitable gas turbine for utilising the exhaust gas for heating purposes, resulting in a simple and reliable heating plant.
<P>For higher power-to-heat ratios, the GT10 gas turbine in combination with a steam turbine has been very successful in district heating applications ever since it was introduced on the market.
<P>A typical GT10 combined cycle plant has a power output of 35 MWe and a heat output of 30 MWth for an an overall efficiency of close to 90% in a district heating application.
<IMG SRC="bar1.gif" WIDTH=600 HEIGHT=2>
<H3><A NAME="Compact layouts">Compact layouts</A></H3>
<P>ABBmedium-sized combined cycle plants are always designed to meet the special needs of each customer. The modular design allows for many different variations with a limited number of standard sized components, enabling short delivery times and low plant costs.
<P>The flexibility also extends to the way in which we supply our machinery. Our concept includes the supply of:
<UL>
<LI>the basic gas and steam turbines, or
<LI>the single power train, including gas and steam turbine with electric generator on a single shaft, or
<LI>the power train and HRSG, complete with control system, or
<LI>turnkey delivery of combined cycle power plant
</UL>

<P>Whichever way you prefer to do business with ABB Stal, you will get all the necessary technical support from our project engineers for the best design of your plant.
<IMG SRC="bar1.gif" WIDTH=600 HEIGHT=2>
<H3><A NAME="Control system">Control system</A></H3>
<P>An important feature of ABB combined cycle plants is that they are fully automated and can be integrated with the control system for the process environment in which they operate.
<P>This means that there are normally no extra personnel requirements for the operation of the combined cycle plant, when it is located on the site of an industrial facility.
<P>The plant's heat and power output can be directly and automatically governed by the process demands.
ABBcombined cycle plants utilise a control system from the ABB family, or a system with similar capacity. This is a general programmable control system for industrial use, which can be easily used as a stand-alone controller unit or be integrated in larger systems.
<IMG SRC="bar1.gif" WIDTH=600 HEIGHT=2>
<H3><A NAME="Environmental performance">Environmental performance</A></H3>
<P>Combined cycle plants are environmentally sound by design and definition  their high efficiencies result in low emissions per generated unit of electricity. This is especially important for reducing emissions of greenhouse gases such as CO<SUB>2</SUB>. In addition, combined cycle plants, when fired with natural gas, have virtually no particle or sulphur emissions.
<P>ABB research has resulted in the development of a new combustion technology  the EV burner  that reduces NO<SUB>X</SUB> emissions to levels below 25 ppm. The technology is based on a dry method that eliminates the complexity and costs of steam or water injection.
<P>Noise levels are low, due to the designs of the air intake and exhaust in combination with a silencing arrangement.
<P>A combined cycle plant is easy to locate, for example, close to city centres where there is typically a demand for power and heat, because of its compact design and the fact that it does not require an elaborate and potentially polluting fuel handling system.
<P>The success of ABBmedium-sized combined cycle plants in recent years can be attributed to a large extent to their exceptionally good environmental performance, achieved, for example, by means of the dry low-NO<SUB>x</SUB> arrangement.

<P>The double-coned EV burner, developed by ABBCorporate Research, dramatically reduces NO<sub>x</sub> emissions from a gas turbine. The burner is included as a standard component in the GT10 and GT35 combustor systems. Each Dry Low Emission (DLE) combustor incorporates up to 18 EV-burners.
<IMG SRC="dlecombh.gif" LOWSRC="dlecombl.gif" WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=106 HSPACE=15 VSPACE=15 ALIGN=left>
<P>Equipped with the DLE combustor, ABB Stal gas turbines are among the world's most environmentally friendly in their power range.

<P>
Additional benefits of gas turbines with the DLE combustor systems are that they maintain a low specific fuel consumption in combined cycle plants and do not require any supply of expensively produced water or steam.

<font  size=+2><b>Gas turbines for high-speed ferry</b></font><br><br>

Finspong, Sweden, August 12, 1996--In the face of strong competition ABB Stal 
has received an order for two GT35 gas turbines to be used for the propulsion of 
the high-speed ferry Buquebus B60. The ferry will be built by the Spanish shipyard
E.N.Bazan in San Fernando.<P>

ABB Stal will also be responsible for supplying the ferrys automation system, 
while ABB Stal and Bazan will share the delivery of the electrical equipment.<P>

The Buquebus B60 ferry is designed for a cruising speed of 60 knots, which makes it 
the worlds fastest car/passenger ferry in regular traffic.The two gas turbines together
develop a shaft power of 34,000kW, which corresponds to about 46,000 h.p. In
addition, the gas turbine system has been developed to operate on low cost IF 30 type
of intermediate fuel oils to achieve low operating costs.<P>

When completed, the ferry will enter into regular traffic on the Buenos-Aires, Argentina-
Montevideo, Uruguay route, at the end of 1997.<P>

In 1995 ABB Stal received an order from Stena Line for four GT35 gas turbine sets
for installation in their HSS 900 high-speed ferries. Two GT35 sets for the first ferry 
were delivered in the spring of 1996, while the two sets for the second ferry are now 
under delivery.<P>

ABB Stal, which was earlier well-known under the name of STAL-LAVAL, was the worlds leading supplier of steam turbines for marine propulsion during the 1960s and 1970s. Today, the company is a member of the ABB Group and has about 2,000
employees and product portfolio comprising industrial steam and gas turbines.(End)<P>

<font  size=+2><b>Gas turbine for Russia</b></font><P>

Finspong, Sweden, August12,1996-- ABB Stal has recently signed a contract
with VAO Zarubezhenergostroy in the city of Ryazan, south of Moscow, for 
the supply of one GT35 gas turbine (17 MW ).The turbine will be delivered to 
the new combined heat and power (CHP) plant in Ryazan, which will be built 
and commissioned in 1998 and will become the first municipally owned power 
plant in Russia.<P>

The project is being launched within the framework of a programme aimed at
supplying heat and power to the Ryazan region. The power plant is the second 
of its kind to be provided with ABBs GT35 gas turbine.This is being built to meet
the needs of Russian municipalities for electricity and district heat. The first unit is
currently being built for the city of  Electrostal in the Moscow region.<P>

Significant features of ABBs industrial gas turbine of type GT35 are its high 
efficiency, low emissions, which meet very stringent environmental standards,
and low maintenance costs. Yet another reason why the GT35 was chosen for Ryazan is that turbine components will be manufactured in Russia and about 3,000 employees
in the Power Generation, Power Transmission and Industrial and Building Systems segments. ABBs Power Generation segment employs more than 46,000 people
worldwide with an order intake in 1995 of over US$ 10 billion. The ABB Group
employs approximately 210,000 people with an order intake in 1995 of over
US$ 36 billion.(End).

<font  size=+2><b>Third ABB Stal steam turbine
for Swedish utility</b></font><P>

Finspong, Sweden, August12,1996-- ABB Stal has received an order from the power 
utility Skellefte Kraft AB for yet another steam turbine. The type LT turbine, with an output of 5 MW, is a low-pressure machine. ABB Stals deliveries also include the condenser, evacuating equipment and condensate pumps.<P>

The site for the steam turbine is adjected to Hedensbyn Combined Heat and Power
(CHP) Plant in northern Sweden and the erection will start in the spring of 1997. 
The turbine is scheduled to enter into service during the late autumn of 1997.<P>

With this investment Skellefte Kraft AB, which is one of Swedens larger power 
utilities, is entering the biomass fuel market. ABB Stals steam turbine will namely 
be installed to utilise waste steam from a biomass fuel drying plant. It will supply 
the steam turbine, via a heat exchanger, with saturated steam at a pressure of 4 bar. 
This is the first time in the world that a biomass fuel drying plant is being integrated 
into a CHP plant and is being provided with an energy-recovery low-pressure steam 
turbine.<P>

There is every indication that the district heating industry in countries with a good availability of biomass fuel will show great interest in Skellefte Kraft ABs new plant(End).<P>

Examples of the proven design are the latest delivered ABB Atom units, Forsmark 3 and Oskarshamn 3. They were placed in operation in 1985. Their essential features are
<P>
&#128;	internal main recirculation pumps,
<P>
&#128;	fine-motion control rod drives,
<P>
&#128;	prestressed containment,
<P>
&#128;	4-train safety systems completely separated from each other.
<P>
This is the result of more than 30 years of disciplined evolution.
<P>
ABB Atom&#146;s evolutionary advanced reactor design, denoted BWR 90+, is further developed and refined in cooperation with utilities.

Together with the plant operators, ABB Atom is carrying out design reconstitution projects to re-evaluate the design and safety status of the ABB Atom BWRs that have been operating for 15 years or more.
<P>
The performance and safety of the plants are compared to present-day requirements and to design characteristics of modern plants in a second phase of the design reconstitutions. The results of these comparisons provide an excellent basis for additional plant modernizations.
<P>
Another major benefit of the design reconstitution projects is their contribution to the transfer of knowledge between organizations and between experienced and less experienced personnel.
<P>
The design reconstitution projects started in 1993 and will be finished in 1998.</TD>

Plant modernization assures long-term economical and safe energy production. Part of this is to implement the changes resulting from the evolution of safety requirements.
<P>
ABB Atom was the designer and main contractor of Oskarshamn 1, the first Swedish plant placed in commercial operation in 1972. Today, ABB Atom has an important role in the extensive modernization program for this unit. The objectives are to introduce improvements in safety functions as well as to replace old components with those of modern standards.
<P>
ABB Atom is also engaged in the modernization efforts of the two Finnish plants TVO I and II, delivered in 1978 and 1980. This modernization is aimed at preventing the effects of ageing and to secure a high production capacity, for the future.
<P>
The study phase of this project has been completed and has confirmed the projected benefits of the modernization efforts. A power uprating by 15% will take place in 1998 in addition to the increase of 8% made in 1984.</TD>

Since 1991, ABB Atom has delivered compact storage canisters for spent fuel to the CLAB interim storage facility through a multiyear contract with the Swedish Nuclear Fuel and Waste Management Company, SKB. ABB Atom was also heavily engaged in the design, construction, and project management of the CLAB, which was placed into operation in 1985.
<P>
The new ABB compact storage technology has almost doubled the storage capacity at CLAB. Consequently, it proved possible to postpone construction work for a new storage cavern deep down in the bedrock by several years, with subsequent savings.
<P>
ABB&#146;s spent fuel storage equipment has been delivered to many PWRs in the U.S.A., Germany, the Republic of Korea, and Sweden, as well as to BWRs in Sweden and Finland.
<P>
ABB Atom is involved in the design work of a high level encapsulation plant, and is also studying a waste back-end treatment concept for SKB comprising
<P>
&#128;	design studies for encapsulation and final disposal,
<P>
&#128;	decommissioning studies for power plants,
<P>
&#128;	canister design,
<P>
&#128;	cost calculations for the entire back-end concept.
<P>
With the Compact Mobile Solidification System, MOSS, mounted into a standard transport container, we perform solidification of low and medium level radioactive liquid waste generated by BWR and PWR plants as well as by other nuclear facilities. We have also delivered MOSS units for the client&#146;s own use, e.g. to the Borssele PWR unit in the Netherlands.
<P>
After backfitting the waste treatment plant at the Swiss M&uuml;hleberg BWR unit with a Cement Volume Reduction System, CVRS, the waste can now be pretreated in a volume reduction step followed by solidification into a cement matrix.</TD>

Advanced systems for 3-D (three-dimensional) plant modeling and 2-D (two-dimensional) CAD are available to support the design work. The 3-D plant modeling system is used with data interfaces for geometries to other similar systems.
<P>
Plant and component data-base systems have also been implemented. These were used during the design work for the proposed fifth nuclear power plant in Finland.
<P>
State-of-the-art computer codes for both BWR and PWR plant simulation are used. They cover transient events, core stability performance, accident events including severe accidents involving core meltdown, and local transients in process systems. These codes support both the design work (e.g. by calculation of loads on structures) and the safety evaluation work.
<P>
Major computer codes for safety evaluation work have been reviewed and approved by safety authorities in a number of countries including the U.S. NRC.
<P>
Plant and systems evaluations using reliability and probabilistic methods including PSA (Probabilistic Safety Analysis) are also performed. Tools for this work also include modern codes for PSA work.
<P>
Methods and tools for PSA Level 2 evaluations (probability of environmental impact) include methods for evaluating fault trees, event trees, and accident scenarios.

ABB Atom has proven to be a technical world leader of <A HREF="bwrbundl.htm">BWR fuel</A> technology, pioneering features such as
<P>
&#128;	SVEA fuel design,
<P>
&#128;	10x10 rod array,
<P>
&#128;	Alloyed Zr-liner.
<P>
The most recent (1996) fuel design, the SVEA 96+, offers exceptional performance combined with flexibility and margins. It is provided to customers in Europe and Japan through ABB Atom and in the U.S.A. and other countries through ABB Combustion Engineering Nuclear Operations.
<P>
Commercial deliveries of SVEA 100/96 started in 1988, and several reactors now operate with almost the entire core composed of this fuel.
<P>
The ABB Atom alloyed Zr-liner has completely and successfully operated in more than 30 batches of fuel, offering full PCI (Pellet Clad Interaction) resistance for very demanding operating conditions.
<P>
Using also technology and experience from its sister company, ABB Combustion Engineering Nuclear Operations, ABB Atom provides advanced <A HREF="pwrbundl.htm">PWR fuel</A> to European customers.
<P>
Different designs, such as 16x16, 17x17, and 18x18 are available. For very demanding conditions, special cladding such as the Duplex-type cladding can be provided. Full debris protection is provided by the GUARDIAN &#129; lower end fitting.</TD>

Highly experienced personnel, continued development of expertise, and access to modern high-tech equipment - these prerequisites result in effective work during and between overhauls. Advanced equipment and well-proven methods help save valuable reactor and service time.
<P>
&#128;	<A HREF="telesipp.htm">TELESCOPE Sipping</A>, for instance, is performed in parallel with unloading of fuel in PWRs and BWRs, thereby cutting critical path time considerably, resulting in savings for the utilities.
<P>
&#128;	Gamma scanning is a cost-saving method in accurately surveying irradiated fuel in the pool.
<P>
&#128;	Crud sampling and analysis together with fuel rod oxide measurements are good tools for knowing the plant process water chemistry and reducing the dose rate.
<P>
&#128;	Dimensional measurements are important to secure mechanical integrity of irradiated fuel rods, fuel bundles, fuel channels, and control rods.</TD>

The personnel resources of ABB together with its own workshops and testing facilities make rapid progress in new technical solutions possible, technical solutions that are well tested before being put to use in nuclear power plants. The testing of components and their functions, as well as work methods under real-life conditions prior to delivery, is a necessary provision for high-quality work.
<P>
Service personnel belonging to ABB as well as customers and, sometimes, customer entrepreneurs are trained at the LWR Service Center in V&auml;ster&aring;s. The center has a full-scale reactor hall including the most important segments of a reactor vessel, a service bridge, and the necessary tools and other equipment.  When necessary, full-scale mockups of the reactor components in question are constructed. This facilitates the design of tools as well as the training in their use.
<P>
Our latest addition in the field of testing and verifying equipment and work methods is our UTC (Underwater Tool Center). The center has a tank measuring nine meters deep and nine meters in diameter, holding 600 cubic meters of water. This makes possible the creation of a realistic testing environment for various types of work to be done under water in a nuclear power plant.
<P>
Other ABB service centers can be found in Ladenburg outside Mannheim, Germany, and at the Southeast Nuclear Service Center in Chattanooga, Tennessee, U.S.A.<P>
The safety valves of nuclear power stations are to be tested once a year and adjusted for correct settings. This is carried out under realistic conditions in a test rig called TRYM.<P>
Materials testing and the study of crack propagation etc. under nuclear conditions can be carried out in the ABB laboratory in V&auml;ster&aring;s. Radioactive material and components can be handled and processed in specially equipped hot workshops.</TD>

ABB TRC, a subsidiary of ABB Atom, is a leading supplier of advanced non-destructive testing services and systems for the nuclear power industry in Europe.
<P>
The company was founded in 1937. Today, it has grown to employ over 100 highly skilled people in its facilities situated at T&auml;by, just north of Stockholm.
<P>
 TRC has been carrying out in-service inspection on the primary systems of various types of BWRs and PWRs for more than 20 years.  TRC also works with Russian RBMK-type reactors.
<P>
In ultrasonics - the company&#146;s main field of competence - very high standards have been established that encompass everything from the design and manufacture of sophisticated probes to the analysis and characterization of discovered defects. Time-of-flight and diffraction ultrasound as well as electromagnetic acoustic transducers and phased-array probes represent some of the advanced technologies presently used by TRC.
<P>
The growing demand for reliable inspection procedures that can detect surfacebreaking cracks has spotlighted the benefits offered by eddy current inspection methods.  TRC uses this technology in its various inspection procedures. It also develops probes and integrates signal presentations with ultrasonic results.
<P>
TRC, moreover, carries out a large number of visual inspections in which video camera techniques are employed, mostly in underwater applications. In the process, company personnel have acquired a vast storehouse of knowledge covering the inspected objects.
<P>
To gain access to the areas to be inspected, and to carry out the necessary scanning patterns by remote means, TRC has designed and manufactured a wide range of manipulators and continues to develop new ones. These innovative products extend all the way from small tools designed for dedicated inspection assignments to large mast manipulators built for complete reactor pressure vessel examinations.
<P>
The international operations of  TRC account for approximately 50% of the company&#146;s turnover. Although mainly concentrated within Europe, sophisticated inspec-tions are also carried out by TRC in North America and in Asia.</TD>

For ABB Atom, Total Quality means the continuous improvement of all of our activities to satisfy and, preferably, surpass the expectations of our customers. Our Total Quality philosophy is very much a case of putting the customer in focus and, also, of empowering company employees. We conduct ongoing improvement programs that cover all areas of the company, and these pro- grams are never ending. When we are through changing, we are through.
<P>
<TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=Right><TR>
<TD><IMG SRC="b22im5.gif"></TD>
</TR></TABLE>
The main driving force for carrying out the improvement programs is an active leadership as demonstrated by all managers. We derive the input to these programs from, for example, listening to our customers, our employees, and our suppliers.
<P>
The tools used in this endeavor are surveys and interviews. The results of our efforts can be followed up by reviewing our different metrics covering, for instance, customer, employee, and supplier satisfaction.
<P>
<TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=Right><TR>
<TD><IMG SRC="b22im6.gif"></TD>
</TR></TABLE>
Valuable independent input is also derived from business assessments according to the Swedish Quality Award. This is a tool that has been used since 1992 by the Nuclear Fuel Division and, since 1995, by the entire company. The Swedish Quality Award is very similar to the Malcolm Baldridge National Quality Award.
<P>
The evaluation criteria are as follows:
<P>
&#128;	Leadership,
<P>
&#128;	Information and Analysis,
<P>
&#128;	Strategic Planning,
<P>
&#128;	Human Resource Development and Involvement,
<P>
&#128;	Business Processes,
<P>
&#128;	Results,
<P>
&#128;	Customer Satisfaction.
<P>
Traditional basic quality issues such as product/service quality and on-time delivery will always be given top priority. That is why our metrics for these areas will always have the goal of zero defects and 100% on-time delivery. As always, we still believe in a good quality system. We will continue to maintain and develop our systems by using the valuable input from customer audits as well as from internal audits.
<P>
ABB Atom and its subsidiary, TRC, are certified according to ISO 9001.
<P>
Further, as a continuation of the quality efforts, the introduction of an environmental management system according to the international standard ISO 140001 is well in progress.</TD>

<P>
<B>As a consequence of the nuclear accident at Chernobyl in April, 1986, considerable work has been expended to boost the reliability and safety of RBMK-type nuclear power plants. Swedish efforts have primarily been directed towards the nuclear power plant at Ignalina in Lithuania. The Ignalina plant, with two blocks of 1,500 MW each, is the closest nuclear site to Sweden. The coordinator of this work has been the Swedish Nuclear Power Inspectorate (SKI).</B>
<P>
ABB Atom&#146;s participate has included equipment required to penetrate the reactor-core&#146;s biological shield in order to improve the reactor cavity pressure relief system in the two INPP-plants.  Owing to the high radiation level, the work had to be carried out by remote control. The ABB Atom equipment is provided with tools for milling and welding, and with a TV camera mounted to furnish monitoring capability. Maneuvering has been done from a control and monitoring console in the reactor hall.
<P>
A full-scale mockup of the biological shield section that was to be worked on was built at ABB Atom&#146;s LWR Service Center in V&auml;ster&aring;s to test and fine tune the work. The employees at Ignalina were trained using this mockup during the summer of 1993 so as to learn how to handle the equipment and to carry out the work.
<P>
The biological radiation shield, which is three meters thick and consists of crushed rock, gravel, and other material, is contained by two steel plates each four centimeters thick. In order to run pressure-relief pipes (dia. 60 cm) through the radiation shield between the core and the reactor hall, the solid steel plates had to be penetrated and the shielding material had to be removed by vacuum cleaning. 
<P>
For various reasons, such as unclear directives regarding nuclear responsibility issues between Lithuania and certain bordering countries, delivery of the equipment was delayed until the spring of 1996. During the summer and autumn of 1996, relief pipes were installed in block I and II. The employees at Ignalina, assisted periodically by ABB Atom, have successfully performed the work.
<P>
This project is a good example of a common effort engaging Swedish authorities, suppliers, and the employees of the nuclear power plant to increase safety.

<FONT SIZE=5><B>SVEA Fuel Benefits Forsmark</B></FONT>
<P>
<B>A high degree of availability and high power capacity - these are the primary characteristics of a power plant. In the case of ABB Atom&#146;s BWRs, anything beyond one shutdown a year for overhaul and reloading is considered obstructive downtime.</B>
<P>
One particular type of &#140;obstruction&#146; has previously occurred during the initial startup following a shutdown. The fuel must then be &#140;conditioned&#146; by increasing the load in gradual steps, a so-called PCI (Pellet Cladding Interaction) restricted startup. The purpose of this is that the fuel should adapt itself to the conditions that exist during full power.
<P>
SVEA 10x10 fuel was developed to avoid having to do this. This method of operation has now been demonstrated with a reactor core to the largest extent comprising of SVEA-96 or SVEA-100 fuel. The first reactor to have a complete 10x10 core is Oskarshamn 3, following the annual outage for &#146;96. Forsmark 2 and 3 also have chiefly SVEA-100 fuel, that is, 84% and 95% of the core, respectively.
<P>
At the time of this year&#146;s restart following fuel reloading at Forsmark 2, a power increase to 100% full reactor output (2,711 MWth, thermal output) was carried out without any fuel conditioning. The earlier wait for the accumulation of fission products, which previously was set at about 65% of output, could be dispensed with. The entire runup, after generator synchronization, to the full licensed power output of 108%, took less than 48 hours. Conventional startups, in comparison, take about four days. The production gain is estimated to equal almost 24 hours of full output.
<P>
The PCI margins remained very good throughout the entire startup phase. 
<P>
The figures below show the startup sequence and the PCI margins, continuously evaluated by the plant&#146;s core-monitoring system.

----------------<P>
<FONT SIZE=4><FONT SIZE=6><B>Fast Repair at Barseb&auml;ck 1</B></FONT>
<P>
<B>An intensive repair job was carried out at Barseb&auml;ck 1 during the annual overhaul shutdown. Regular inspections had indicated that there were a number of cracks in the cooling system pipes for shutdown reactor. All in all, there were some ten cracks detected at welding joints. These were attributed to Intergranular Stress Corrosion Cracking (IGSCC).</B>
<P>
ABB Atom&#146;s Field Services was given the task of replacing the unsound pipe sections, and it helped Barseb&auml;ck with the required examination and documentation work. Some 30 ABB Atom people were engaged in the project under the leadership of Christian L&ouml;f.
<P>
Although the pipe lengths to be replaced were not extensive, the work still involved numerous complex operations. These included cutting, measuring, surface preparation, and multiple inspections. It also involved fitting the new sections exactly to the existing system, a task that was particularly difficult.
<P>
The radiation level of the pipes being worked on was very high, and this required extreme care in planning and execution. The dose rates were minimized because as much of the work as possible was automated using remote-controlled welding machines.
<P>
The paperwork surrounding this type of work is normally considerable. The necessary documents must be produced quickly so as not to delay approval from inspecting bodies and the authorities. Complete final documentation for the repair work at Barseb&auml;ck 1 was turned over to the customer one day after the last job was finished in the plant.
<P>
<B>Preparation</B><BR>
The repair work could be quickly started and carried out within a short period of time, because ABB Atom and Barseb&auml;ck, prior to the shutdown, had come to an agreement about special preparations. This meant that a preparatory organization was set up that was ready to handle an immediate work start and that important tentative routines were set up in case remedial measures would be necessary.
<P>
Planned and executed preparations can result in substantial time savings. Using experience from a number of damage scenarios, ABB Atom has worked out routines and developed tools and work methods enabling fast action in the event of unforeseen problems in power plants. Through its work with TRC, ABB Atom has established complete work routines for comprehensive inspections, test sampling, material analysis, and repairs, as well as routines for reporting to the authorities.

<FONT SIZE=4><B>Young Communicators take action!</B>
<P>
Within the well established Young Generation organisation, a group has formed to work with information regarding energy production and the environment. The group of communicators consists of young employees from ABB Atom and the nuclear power producing companies in Sweden.
<P>
The issue of how to produce electrical power has long lasting implications on our environment and economy, thus being of profound interest for today's young Swedes. It is well known that young people and especially young women have a negative opinion of nuclear power production, and the purpose of this group of communicators is to focus on information and debate from a decidedly young perspective.
<P>
Receiving visitors at the company, giving talks at schools and organisations where young people are active, and taking an eager part in the puclic debate, the communicators will strive to relay their positive experiences from the nuclear power business and spread knowledge about nuclear power production.
<P>
The groups at the different companies involved will start out with local activities and from there draw on each other's experience to continue on a broader scale as the expected Swedish debate picks up pace during the fall of 1996.

<P>
OKG AB has placed an order with ABB Atom for the modernization of the internal reactor components in Oskarshamn 1.  The project includes the replacement of the core shroud including lid and core-spray system as well as the steam separator.
<P>
This is the first time that such extensive replacement work has been carried out on the internal components of a BWR reactor.  The project is part of OKG's long-term strategy in achieving its goal with regard to safety, reliability, economy and environment.  The work is scheduled during the annual overhaul shutdown in 1997.
<P>
For ABB Atom, this order represents an important reference on the international market, taking into consideration the problems with cracks found in the internals of foreign reactors.
<P>
"We have recently completed a comprehensive re-organization with the aim of creating the best possible prerequisites for meeting customer demands with regard to the modernization of plants", says Sverre Haukeland, the head of ABB Atoms Nuclear Systems Division.  "This order from OKG, as with the earlier order regarding the modernization of the Ringhals 1 reactor, demonstrates that customers view our organization and our products with confidence."

<FONT SIZE=4><B>Modernizing Nuclear Power Plants at Ringhals 1</B>
<P>ABB Atom has received an order from Vattenfall AB for the modernization of the primary systems of the reactor unit at Ringhals 1.  The order comprises a complete overhaul including the replacement of pipes, connectors, and components for the main circulation system and ancillary systems.  The order is worth approximately SEK 150 million.
<P>
The modernization project is aimed at maintaining and improving safety and reliability.  It will also make future inspection work easier, thereby reducing the amount of radiation received by personnel.
<P>
The work will be carried out during the annual shutdown period in 1997.  To minimize radiation dosage levels during the work,  ABB Atom has developed an advanced remote-operated machine based on ABB's robotics.
<P>
"The order was won against stiff international competitiion, and it reinforces ABB Atom's position as the major supplier to Ringhals 1", says Sverre Haukeland, the head of ABB Atom's Nuclear Systems Division.

<FONT SIZE=5><B>Rolf Halde, new managing director at ABB Tekniska R&ouml;ntgencentralen (TRC)</B></FONT><P>

<B>After only a few months as the head of Process Development at ABB Atom, Rolf Halde has now been appointed the new managing director of ABB TRC. He succeeds Per Brunzell, who decided to leave TRC at the end of 1995.</B>
<P>
<TABLE BORDER=2 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT><TR>
<TD><IMG SRC="rolfhald.gif"></TD>
</TR></TABLE>
<P>
Rolf Halde, in the last few years, has worked with German undertakings for the international operations of Vattenfall AB. He has a sound background in nuclear power, since he also held the position of Business Area Manager for nuclear power and technical development at Vattenfall Energisystem AB. In the mid-eighties, he headed the office for plant engineering at Forsmark, and, before that, he was a project engineer for OKG involved in the CLAB and Oskarshamn-3 projects. He came to ABB Atom on 1 September, 1995. Rolf Halde is 48 years old, with a post-graduate engineering degree from Chalmers University of Technology, where he also earned a Dr. Eng. degree, majoring in chemical engineering and plant technology, in 1976.
<P>
<B>What have you managed to do in such a short time at ABB Atom?</B><BR>
&#147I have had the advantage of working in an expanding business in which the primary task has been to build up resources for important design analysis projects. These will be of major importance to both ABB Atom and TRC. It has been an exciting and interesting time, and I&#146;ll miss the opportunity of following up the results on site.
<P>
<B>What do you want to accomplish at TRC?</B><BR>
&#147TRC has had great success in its sphere of operation, non-destructive testing. In a number of instances, it is a world leader. I believe, however, that it is possible to further develop the company into a spearhead enterprise, particularly in the area of performing measurements in difficult places. And, generally, we will also focus on developing our technology, so that the testing itself won&#146;t constitute encumbrances for the customer. It&#146;s a matter of being able to measure faster, get more reliable results and, last but not least, reduce radiation exposure on the part of personnel.&#148;
<P>
Rolf did not get time to move to V&auml;ster&aring;s. He can now remain in Stockholm. He is married to Helena, who is a member of the medical faculty at a university. The family has a great leisure-time interest: travel. This is led to many long trips, since they have no children to take care of.
<P>
Running marathons is Rolf&#146;s second big avocation. He has run through quite a few over the years, the latest being the Berlin marathon in 1995. His next goal is to run the Boston marathon in April of this year.</TD>

<P>
<B>The &#146;Young Generation&#146; in Sweden has been considered a well-established<BR>
organization, since back in May 1994 - one that involves the entire nuclear power industry in the country. The need to focus on young people in the rest of Europe is equally paramount. Perhaps, the Young Generation will soon be able to call itself Europe&#146;s biggest project for developing expertise.</B></TD>
</TR></TABLE></CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=0><TR>
<TD WIDTH=478>
The Young Generation (YG) in Sweden has been working on its second project, called YG2, since November of 1995. The YG2 project encompasses some 100 young delegates from all of Sweden&#146;s nuclear power interests and from TVO in Finland. Within the project are also a number of older &#146;mentors&#146;.
<P>
The purpose of the Young Generation program is to -<BR>

<UL>
<LI>Focus on the coming generation
<LI>Increase knowledge across a broad spectrum
<LI>Transfer expertise from one generation to another
<LI>Develop a personal network
</UL>
YG is guided by an ABB Atom committee in close collaboration with contact persons from other companies. Activities today are also coordinated with Nuclear Swedish Society and the European Nuclear Society (ENS).
<P>
The work to spread the YG concept out into the rest of Europe is being done through the ENS Young Generation Network (ENS YGN), which was founded in May of 1995. The ENS YGN consists of young employees from 12 European countries, with Lars Fredrikson, ABB Atom, as the present chairperson.
<P>
<B>European Nuclear Society</B><BR>
To emphasize the sizable support and interest of ENS for the Young Generation, the chairperson for ENS YGN occupies a chair on the ENS Steering Committee.
ENS YGN plans to start up YG projects across all of Europe. Several countries have already progressed quite far. An encyclopedia of nuclear-technology-training opportunities will be created on the Internet. Other tasks are to disseminate information and encourage other activities directed externally.
<P>
<B>The future</B><BR>
In Sweden, there is much talk of the national referendum on nuclear power, and about how the energy supply of the future is to be envisaged. The Young Generation in Sweden therefore expends substantial effort in persuading Swedish young people that there is an interesting and long-term future to be found in the nuclear power business.
<P>
In Sweden, and in other parts of Europe, it is also a matter of retaining the expertise that is threatening to dissipate, because the people who built today&#146;s nuclear power plants are now disappearing into retirement.
<P>
It is the responsibility of the nuclear power industry to ensure the future production of economical, environment-friendly and safe nuclear power - with the help of motivated and knowledgeable employees. The recruiting, training and retaining of competent employees is an important and ongoing part of this scenario, and the same continuity must also be found in the transfer of expertise to the next generation - the Young Generation.</TD>

--------------<P>
<FONT SIZE=4><B>German PWR fuel order received by ABB Atom</B>
<P>ABB Atom has received a strategic order covering uranium-fuel deliveries to the PreussenElektra operated nuclear power station Grohnde. The first delivery will take place at the end of 1997. The order's total worth is estimated at approximately SEK 200 million.
<P>
From 1992 to 1994, ABB Atom supplied Grohnde with demonstration quantities of 16x16 PWR fuel to become qualified as a reload supplier. The PWR plant, which is located about 50 kilometers south of Hannover, is owned by PreussenElektra AG and Gemeinschaftskraftwerk Weser GmbH.
<P>
&quot;The order was predated by many years of intense preparations&quot;, says Stefan Olsson, the President of ABB Atom. &quot;This is the first time that we have been entrusted with supplying reload fuel for this type of reactor in Germany, and we view the order as a strategic breakthrough. We feel ABB Atom has now further strengthened its position as an internationally successful supplier of nuclear fuel.&quot;
<P>
During the '80s, ABB Atom started to expand its export efforts in the field of nuclear fuel, and, in 1995 the export share constitutes almost 60 % of deliveries.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=+3>Designed for <BR>
a changing world</FONT><P>


The power industry is in the middle of a radical transformation process: Energy Suppliers are now becoming Energy Service Companies.<BR>
New challenges are being faced. Traditional conditions are no longer fully valid. Challenges imposed by the competitiveness of the energy markets, greater environmental concern, growing cost-awareness and the proliferation of open information systems call for new innovative solutions.<P>

<B>New times, new strategies</B><BR>
Energy's new context requires new or revised strategies to confirm your position as a competitive and service-oriented power company. This includes a new corporate information strategy.
<DD>A broader view on the Information Technology strategy becomes the key to a competitive advantage. Successful implementation of this strategy must include proper support to all business units within the company. Externally, it means that business objectives can be redefined, taking into account new, integrated solutions based on information systems. <P>

<B>Panorama meets the challenge</B><BR>
Panorama is the ABB Network Partner solution for efficient and reliable management of power networks. Panorama spans the needs of the power industry. It is based on ABB's total know-how in power systems and how internal processes can be rationalized. 
<DD>Combined with our thorough understanding of business strategies for the power industry, Panorama is the  information system to rely on when managing the new conditions in an open and competitive electricity market.<P>

<B>A solution for every need</B><BR>
Panorama offers solutions for all electricity markets, in all types of power industries. From power generation, transmission and distribution companies all the way to the end-consumers, both industrial and private electricity consumers.
<DD>Our offerings include a complete range of applications for power network management as well as advanced communication solutions. System-wide, on station level and on detailed bay or unit level.
<DD>All in all, Panorama may encompass several roles in a modern power company. It can be the web that allows separate parts of the organization to work together.  It can be a competitive weapon for efficiency and security, while at the same time enhancing customer service and adhering to rules governing an electricity market. <P>

<B>A partner concept</B><BR>
Panorama provides opportunities for partnerships with other suppliers in adjacent application areas; for integration of complementary systems, products and services.
<DD>Partnerships might include computer and microprocessor manufacturers, graphical information systems suppliers, joint developments in communications, transducer equipment, control room furniture - just to name a few.<P>

In short, Panorama brings it all together.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+3>Panorama is <BR>
intuitive</FONT><P>

Being in perfect control means a constant knowledge of what's happening in an everchanging environment. The Panorama user is ready to act and respond - in touch with reality. 
<DD>It also means focusing on the overall goal, concentrating on the right task. Perfect control requires communication and co-operation between all parties in order to guarantee a coordinated process - everything in harmony in a changing world.<P>

<B>The user-friendly Panorama</B><BR>
All products and systems encompassed by the Panorama concept are easy to use, no matter what level the users are working at. Whether they are specialists working in a control room or consumers reading a meter window. Everything is user-friendly right on down the line.
<DD>The user interface is homogeneous and consistent at every level. In the control center. In the office. At the substation. In the field. In the home. Just one more reason why communication is so easy.<P>

<B>Communication made easy</B><BR>
Since Panorama is based on client/server technology and since international and industry standards are used, there's no risk that your system will consist of isolated islands.
<DD>Panorama makes it easy to integrate user interfaces with external systems. No matter who supplied them. They only have to conform to standards. 
<DD>Regardless of where ABB manufactures Panorama user interfaces, they are the same all over the world. Naturally, we adapt them to various languages - we focus on the user! This reduces product cost and makes training easier.
<DD>Mechanical design of our products may of course vary from market to market. But behind the shell, the functionality and the interfaces are the same.<P>

<B>A versatile tool box</B><BR>
Data can be entered at any level in the Panorama hierarchy. That's because Panorama's tools for data engineering, calculations, control, etc are fully coordinated. The concept is the same whether you work in the control center or at a substation. A big advantage for every user, no duplication of work.<P>

<B>An open system with security built-in</B><BR>
In a completely open system like Panorama, questions of availability become a priority. Not just for security reasons, but also because an open structure means that a vast amount of accessible information  has to be adapted to each user's task.
<DD>Panorama offers security and secrecy on the highest level. This includes access security schemes that help you decide just who has access to what and when.</td>

All three Regional Control Centers and the National Control Center are affected by this upgrading, which will take place in stages over the next three years. The first Regional Control Center will be commissioned in June 1997. The new Control Centers are needed for the handling of the supervisory control and operation of the grid in the coming years. Several new submarine cable links between Norway and the European Continent will enter into operation after the turn of the century. This will impose greater demands on the operation of Norway&#146;s power system. At the same time, there is a growing need for an efficient supervisory control system to achieve a higher level of operational security.<P><B>Many innovations</B><BR>In the new system the Regional Control Centers will be linked to the National Control Center via a Wide Area Network (WAN) having a high data transmission capability (2 Mbit/s). The high-speed data transmission means above all that supervision and data maintenance will be more reliable and simpler in the future.<P>Another innovation is that it will be possible to simulate fault situations in a very realistic manner. The Control Centers can be connected to a simulator, where the operators under the guidance of an instructor can practice the handling of different scenarios to be better prepared when confronted by real faults.<P>Maintenance of the Control Centers will also undergo radical changes with the introduction of the new system. To reduce the operational and maintenance costs, a common maintenance database will be established for all four Control Centers. This means that the system maintenance can be more efficient. Independent of what center needs attending to, maintenance can be performed from any one of the four centers.<P><B>Information system for the operators</B><BR>A dedicated information system for the operators will be incorporated in the new system. This will contain functions for coordinating the maintenance of the grid, for operational security and for information of importance to the operation of the system.<P><B>Easily available statistics</B><BR>Data from the over 100,000 data nodes of the network will be accessible via Statnett&#146;s PC network and can be used for statistics, analyses and background information when making decisions in connection with, for example, future investments. Faults and disturbances will also be stored in order to be retrieved for analysis of causes as well as to prevent the repetition of the same types of faults.<P>ABB Kraft AS of Oslo, Norway has been awarded this contract. ABB Network Partner AB of V&auml;ster&aring;s Sweden is supplying the major part of the new Control Centers. ABB Systems Control of Santa Clara California, USA is supplying the Power Application Software.<P><P>&nbsp;<P><P><A NAME="uk"></A><HR><CODE><FONT SIZE=+2><P><B>Electricity Association in the UK</B><BR><B>approves ABBs distance protection</B><P></FONT> -- The Electricity Association (EA), London, has evaluated and approved the new line/distance protection terminal unit, REL 511, developed by ABB Network Partner AB. The approval means that the product has been accepted for use by all 14 power utilities in the UK and it is of strategic importance to the marketing of ABB's new microprocessor-based line protection terminal units in Europe.<P>ABB Power T&D Ltd., Telford, England, which is responsible for the marketing of these products in the UK, has already received orders for the REL 511 terminal units from Midlands Electricity plc and Scottish Power.

En nyckelf&auml;rdig anl&auml;ggning innefattar ofta dessutom diverse infrastruktur t ex kommunikationsutrustning, byggnader, avbrottsfri kraft och tj&auml;nster i form av utbildning och service. <br>Projektverksamheten ansvarar f&ouml;r levereranser av kundspecifika system f&ouml;r &ouml;vervakning och styrning av enstaka kraftobjekt, transformatorstationer eller hela kraftn&auml;t. Storleken p&aring; dessa projekt sp&auml;nner fr&aring;n 1 till 500 MSEK, eller lite annorlunda uttryckt fr&aring;n ett kvarts upp till 50 man&aring;rs insats.

  <TITLE>What is High Voltage Direct Current - HVDC?</TITLE>

<H2>
  What is HVDC?
</H2>
<H4>
  HVDC stands for High Voltage Direct Current and is today a well proven technology
  employed for power transmission all over the world. In total about 50,000
  MW HVDC transmission capacity is installed in some 60 projects. ABB has supplied
  the converter stations in more than 35 of these
  <A HREF="l13.htm">projects</A> with a total transmission capacity of about
  30,000 MW.
</H4>
<H4>
  There are three different cathegories of HVDC transmissions:
</H4>
<H3>
  <A HREF="l111.htm">1. Point to point transmissions</A><BR>
  <A HREF="l112.htm">2. Back-to-back stations</A><BR>
  <A HREF="l113.htm">3. Multi-terminal systems</A>
</H3>
<H4>
  The <A HREF="l114.htm">development of the HVDC technology</A> started in
  the late 1920s, and only after some 25 years of extensive development and
  pioneering work the first commercially operating scheme was commissioned
  in 1954. This was a link between the Swedish mainland and the island of Gotland
  in the Baltic sea. The power rating was 20 MW and the transmission voltage
  100 kV. At that time mercury arc valves were used for the conversion between
  AC and DC, and the control equipment was using vacuum tubes.
</H4>
<H4>
  A significant improvement of the HVDC technology came around 1970 when
  <A HREF="l1152.htm">thyristor valves</A> were introduced in place of the
  mercury arc valves. This reduced the size and complexity of HVDC converter
  stations substantially. The use of microcomputers in the control equipment
  in today's transmissions has also contributed to making HVDC the powerful
  alternative in power transmission that it is today.
</H4>
<H4>
  In 1995 ABB Power Systems announced a new generation of HVDC converter stations,
  <A HREF="l116.htm">HVDC 2000</A>, which will further improve the performance
  of HVDC transmissions.

  <TITLE>High Voltage Direct Current - Why HVDC?</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY BACKGROUND="paper.jpg">
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT BORDER=0 HEIGHT=30 SRC="abblog5.gif" alt="">

<H2>
  <A NAME="DDE_LINK2">Why HVDC?</A>
</H2>
<H4>
  The reasons behind a choice of HVDC instead of AC in a specific case are
  often numerous and complex. Each individual project will display its own
  set of reasons justifying the choice of HVDC, but the most common arguments
  favouring HVDC are:
</H4>
<H4>
  <A HREF="l121.htm">1. Lower investment cost</A><BR>
  <A HREF="l122.htm">2. Long distance water crossing</A><BR>
  <A HREF="l123.htm">3. Lower losses</A><BR>
  <A HREF="l124.htm">4. Asynchronous connection</A><BR>
  <A HREF="l125.htm">5. Controllability</A><BR>
  <A HREF="l126.htm">6. Low short circuit currents</A>
</H4>
<H4>
  Power stations generate alternating current, AC, and the power delivered
  to the consumers is in the form of AC. The vast majority of electric power
  transmissions therefore use three-phase alternating current. Why then is
  it sometimes more suitable to use direct current, DC, for transmitting electric
  power?
</H4>
<H4>
  In general terms the different reasons for using HVDC can be divided in two
  main groups, namely:
</H4>
<H4>
  1. HVDC results in a lower total investment and lower losses <BR>
  2. HVDC is necessary or desirable from the technical point of view.
</H4>
<H4>
  In many cases, projects are justified on a combination of benefits from the
  two groups. Today the <B>environmental aspects</B> are also becoming more
  important. HVDC is in that respect favourable in many cases, as the environmental
  impact is less than with AC. This is due to the fact that an HVDC transmission
  line is much smaller and needs less space than AC lines for the same power
  capacity.
</H4>
<H4>
  The system characteristics of an HVDC link differ a lot from AC transmissions.
  One of the most important differences is related to the possibility to accurately
  control the active power transmitted on a DC line. This is in contrast to
  AC lines, where the power flow can not be controlled in the same direct way.
  The controllability of the HVDC power is often used to improve the operating
  conditions of the AC networks where the converter stations are located.
</H4>
<H4>
  Another important property of an HVDC transmission is that it is asynchronous.
  This allows the interconnection of non-synchronous networks.

<H4>
  An <A HREF="l1151.htm">HVDC converter station</A> uses
  <A HREF="l1152.htm">thyristor valves</A> to perform the conversion from AC
  to DC and vice versa. The <U>12-pulse converter</U> valve bridge is connected
  to the AC system by means of <A HREF="l1154.htm">converter transformers</A>.
  The valves are normally placed in a building and the converter transformers
  are located just outside <A HREF="l1155.htm">(see drawing).</A>
</H4>
<H4>
  The converter produces current harmonics (11th, 13th, 23rd, 25th, 35th, 37th
  etc.) on the AC side. These harmonics are prevented from entering into the
  connected AC network by <A HREF="l1156.htm">AC filters</A>, i.e. resonant
  circuits comprising capacitors, inductances (reactors) and resistors. The
  filters also produce a part of the reactive power consumed by the converter.
</H4>
<H4>
  The converter also produces voltage harmonics on the DC side (12th, 24th,
  36th etc.). A large inductance <A HREF="l1157.htm">(smoothing reactor) </A>is
  always installed on the DC side to reduce the ripple in the direct current.
  In addition, a <A HREF="l1158.htm">DC filter </A>is also normally needed
  to reduce the level of harmonic currents in the DC overhead line. The harmonics
  may otherwise cause interference to telephone circuits in the vicinity of
  the DC line.
</H4>
<H4>
  The power transmitted over the HVDC transmission is controlled by means of
  a <A HREF="l1159.htm">control system </A>. It adjusts the triggering instants
  of the thyristor valves to obtain the desired combination of voltage and
  current in the DC system.
</H4>
<H4>
  Several other apparatus are needed in a converter station, such as circuit
  breakers, current and voltage transducers, surge arresters, etc.

<H4>
  ABB has taken a decisive lead in the HVDC field by introducing HVDC 2000,
  a new generation of converter stations for HVDC.
</H4>
<H2>
  <A HREF="l1161.htm">View HVDC 2000 station </A>
</H2>
<H4>
  HVDC 2000 offers the following advantages:
</H4>
<H2>
  Improved performance
</H2>
<H4>
  <UL>
    <LI>
      Significantly better stability, in particular when connected to AC networks
      with low short circuit capacity and in transmissions with long DC cables
    <LI>
      Dependable performance in the event of AC system disturbances, with reduced
      risk of commutation failures
    <LI>
      Lower load rejection overvoltages
    <LI>
      Improved AC and DC filtering with smaller filters
    <LI>
      No need to switch AC filters or shunt capacitor banks to compensate for converter
      reactive power consumption
  </UL>
</H4>
<H2>
  Reduced area requirements and construction time
</H2>
<H4>
  <UL>
    <LI>
      Less equipment in the converter station
    <LI>
      No need for large and complex valve buildings
    <LI>
      Reduced area requirements
    <LI>
      Reduced visual impact
    <LI>
      Less specialized engineering for each project
    <LI>
      Simplified interface between high voltage equipment and civil works
    <LI>
      Reduced delivery time
  </UL>
</H4>
<H2>
  The key elements
</H2>
<H4>
  The key feature of HVDC 2000 is the utilization of Capacitor Commutated
  Converters (CCC's), a wellknown circuit concept. The CCC is now an interesting
  solution due to ABB's development of automatically tuned AC filters (ConTune).
  These filters can be built to generate small quantities of reactive power
  but still provide good filtering. These properties match the characteristics
  of the CCC, which has a much reduced need for reactive power.
</H4>
<P>

  <IMG SRC="sk6547.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">

<H4>
  The above diagram shows a single-line diagram of monopolar converter with
  CCC and ConTune AC filters.
</H4>
<H4>
  The<U> </U><A HREF="l1162.htm">CCC</A> concept and
  <A HREF="l1163.htm">ConTune</A> provide the basis for HVDC 2000. But other
  recent ABB developments such as the items listed below are also important
  in exploiting the full range of advantages offered by HVDC 2000:

  <IMG SRC="grn_bull.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> the fully digital MACH control system
</H3>
<H2>
  Availability, reliability and life cycle cost
</H2>
<H4>
  Several of the newly developed features will improve availability and
  reliability. The same factors will also reduce costs for operation and
  maintenance. In short, smaller stations with less equipment, fewer outages
  and less need for maintenance will lead to reduced life cycle costs for the
  HVDC 2000 plants.

Transmission lines both generate and absorb reactive power. Since
the transmitted load varies considerably from one hour to another,
the reactive power balance of the line varies as well. A rapidly
operating Static Var Compensator (SVC) can continuously control
dynamic power swings under various system conditions.<BR>
The main reasons for incorporating SVC in transmission and distribution

<H4>
  The Power Quality issue is becoming increasingly important to electrical
  utilities as well as to industrial and domestic consumers.
</H4>
<H4>
  Energy conservation efforts and the need for continuous control of certain
  industrial processes have led to an increase of electrical / electronic equipment
  and motor drives. Process automation involving the extensive use of electronic
  and digital control systems is also becoming common in modern industrial
  plants. Poor voltage waveforms, due for instance to harmonics or transients,
  low voltage or overvoltage conditions and unbalance in the network can lead
  to unnecessary and costly disruptions in production.
</H4>
<H4>
  Reactive power compensation technology is an effective, reliable and economically
  attractive means of improving voltage quality, as well as mitigating voltage
  unbalance and the propagation of harmonic currents in the supply network.
  The ABB Static Var Compensators are well established in industrial networks.

<P>
Elkvalitet &auml;r att f&aring; ut en j&auml;mn sp&auml;nning
med regelbunden sinuskurva varhelst anslutningspunkten &auml;r.
Inga st&ouml;rningar i form av avbrott, &ouml;vertoner, transienter
eller blinkningar. D&aring;lig elkvalitet kostar varje &aring;r
mycket pengar genom driftst&ouml;rningar, slitage, maskinhaverier
och produktionsbortfall. Avregleringen av elmarknaden st&auml;ller
h&aring;rdare krav p&aring; alla akt&ouml;rer. Fr&aring;n elproducenter,
distribut&ouml;rer till konsumenter. <BR>
Vi p&aring; ABB Power Systems satsar p&aring; elkvalitet. Tillsammans
med ABB Kraft och ABB Capacitors driver vi elkvalitetsfr&aring;gorna
under begreppet <B>KVALITET I LEDNINGEN</B>. <HR>

<H4>St&auml;rk din konkurrenskraft!</H4>

<P>
P&aring; den nya konkurrensutsatta elmarknaden m&aring;ste alla
akt&ouml;rer anstr&auml;nga sig f&ouml;r att &ouml;verleva. Nyckeln
till framg&aring;ng &auml;r att optimera elkraftprocessen i alla
led. H&ouml;g och j&auml;mn elkvalitet inneb&auml;r mindre f&ouml;rluster,
s&auml;krare drift och h&ouml;gre produktivitet.<BR>
Att h&aring;lla h&ouml;g elkvalitet &auml;r viktigt f&ouml;r alla
akt&ouml;rer p&aring; elmarknaden. &Auml;ven om du inte sj&auml;lv
smutsar ned n&auml;tet, p&aring;verkas du av hur de lokala och
regionala akt&ouml;rerna hanterar n&auml;tst&ouml;rningar.
<H4>S&auml;tt elkvaliteten i system!</H4>

<P>
ISO 9000, medarbetarprogram, kortare cykeltider, just-in-time
leveranser..... Det l&auml;ggs ner mycket energi p&aring; att
&ouml;ka effektiviteten och uppr&auml;tth&aring;lla h&ouml;gsta
m&ouml;jliga kvalitet i moderna f&ouml;retag.<BR>
Att elkvalitetsfr&aring;gorna &auml;nnu inte tagits upp med samma
engagemang, kan bero p&aring; att &auml;mnet &auml;r sv&aring;rt

  The Bakun HVDC Transmission System
</H2>
<H4>
  The main part of the 2400 MW generated at the Bakun HEP will be transmitted
  by HVDC across Sarawak and the South China Sea to Peninsular Malaysia. The
  sea crossing of 670 km will be the longest in the world.
  <P>
  In this project, ABB Power Systems will deliver the converter stations and
  the telecommunication system. The size and other data for the converter stations
  lie well within the range of available experience.
  <P>
  Three DC poles, each rated at 710 MW, will be used for the power transmission.
  The transmission voltage will be 500 kV. This means that the world power
  and voltage records for HVDC cables currently held by the
  <A HREF="l131.htm">Baltic Cable </A>transmission will be exceeded. ABB High
  Voltage Cables in Karlskrona, Sweden has already tested a cable design meeting
  the requirements of the Bakun transmission. The total cable length of more
  than 2000 km will far exceed that of any previous project.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=5><B>The SVEA Concept</B></FONT></CENTER>
<UL><LI>The design of SVEA-96, with its enlarged water cross center, makes it the optimum fuel for BWRs of non-ABB Atom design. As indicated by the SVEA-96's designation, it has 96 fuel rods arranged in four sub-bundles. The multirod lattice introduced by ABB Atom in 1986 was based on the successful experience of the original SVEA-64 which was introduced in 1981. The new lattice marked a major step forward in increasing burnup and load capability - it is used in the 100-rod version, SVEA 100, for reactors of of ABB Atom design and has now been incorporated into SVEA-96.
<P>
<LI>The SVEA channel divides the fuel rods into four sub-bundles using a double-wall structure that forms an internal water cross. This design results in  a more uniform moderator distribution. This more uniform moderator distribution provides a favorable neutron flux distribution, which increases reactivity and gives a more uniform power and burnup distribution. As a result, the fuel concept gives significantly better fuel utilization.
</UL>
<BR>
<P>
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=5><B>The SVEA-96 Design</B></FONT></CENTER>
<UL><LI>The SVEA-96 assembly consists of four sub-bundles of fuel rods, the channel, and a removable top handle with springs. The water cross is welded to the channel shroud to form a structure ensuring exceptional dimensional stability with a minimum amount of material. Furthermore, the stainless steel bottom nozzle is rigidly connected to the Zirkaloy channel. This feature avoids creep deformation and uncontrolled leakage at the joint. The top handle, which includes the support structure at the top of the assembly, is redundantly attached to the channel but can readily be removed, e.g. for inspection of the sub-bundles.
<P>
<LI>Each sub-bundle is made up of 24 fuel rods supported by top and bottom tie plates and six spacer grids. The fuel rods have an advanced low corrosion cladding. The spacer design combines favorable physical and thermal-hydraulic properties. The sub-bundles are supported by the bottom nozzle and are free to grow independently during irradiation. This feature contributes to the very high burnup capability of SVEA-96 design.</UL></TD>

The removable top nozle has a unique snap-lock feature. This means that a minimum amount of force is required to separate the guide thimbles which, in turn, means easy access to the individual fuel rods. The removable bottom nozzle further simplifies fuel rod access.
<P>
<LI><FONT SIZE=4><B>Bulged joint for structural integrety</B></FONT><BR>
The top and mid grids have sleeves welded to the grids at each guide thimble location. The grid sleeves are bulged to the guide thimbles to provide a firm, secure connection.
<P>
<LI><FONT SIZE=4><B>Anti-snag grids for safer loading procedure</B></FONT><BR>
The bottom of the grids have anti-snag tabs between each rod. This facilities close passage by adjacent fuel assemblies during refueling. The bottom grid has anti-snag tabs on the top as well.
<P>
The grids also have improved corners to guard against snagging.
<P>
<LI><FONT SIZE=4><B>Debries catcher to prevent rod failure</B></FONT><BR>
Most rod failures are caused by debris fretting. A pattern of gull-wing shaped features in the debris catcher, below the active fuel, prevents debris from entering the fuel assembly. The debris catcher is integral with the lower part of the bottom grid and has no significant impact on the pressure drop.</UL></TD>

<DD>Within our company, we have the most advanced CAD/CAM tools available. Every engineer is connected to our company wide area network to speed up and secure development work. We even have one of the world's fastest real-time simulator for testing protection relays.

<DD>Our aim is not just to stay abreast of the change, but to lead it. That's why we strive for the best and most well-educated staff by continually developing their competence. In addition, we invest over 10% of our turnover into R&D. And we have access to the rest of the business area's efforts in research. <P>

<B>World class production and project management</B><BR>
Our modern production processes are built with IT in mind. This creates shorter delivery times and on-time deliveries. 

<DD>Experience from deliveries all over the world has led us to an effective and systematic project model. A model which helps us work together with our customers to reach joint delivery goals.<P>

<B>Support after the contract</B><BR>
Our involvement doesn't stop once the order is taken and the delivery made. 
We offer extensive resources for the training of the personnel who will be using our systems and products. Training in the classroom and in the field. Often, the end users will be part of the project team so that they can affect the final result.

<DD>We also provide support when it comes to maintenance, system expansion and of course system upgrades. We assist in the gradual upgrading of older systems to new techniques or functions. Panorama makes it possible to build individual modules thanks to modular thinking. Thus resulting in a life-cycle cost reduction.
<P>
That's why an investment in Panorama is always profitable.

Alla Statnetts tre regioncentraler och den nationella driftcentralen ber&ouml;rs av ombyggnaden, som kommer att p&aring;g&aring; i etapper under de n&auml;rmaste tre &aring;ren. Den f&ouml;rsta regioncentralen kommer att vara i drift i juni 1997.<P>De nya centralerna beh&ouml;vs f&ouml;r att kunna hantera fj&auml;rrstyrning och systemdrift i framtiden. Flera nya undervattenskablar kommer att tas i bruk mellan Norge och kontinenten efter sekelskiftet, och det st&auml;ller st&ouml;rre krav p&aring; driften av kraftsystemet. Samtidigt &ouml;kar behovet av ett effektivt kontrollsystem f&ouml;r att n&aring; h&ouml;gre drifts&auml;kerhet.<P><B>M&aring;nga nyheter i systemet</B><BR>I systemet kopplas de regionala centralerna samman med den nationella driftcentralen via ett Wide Area Network (WAN) med h&ouml;g &ouml;verf&ouml;ringskapacitet av data (2 Mbit/s). Den snabba data&ouml;verf&ouml;ringen inneb&auml;r framf&ouml;r allt att &ouml;vervakning och dataunderh&aring;ll i framtiden kommer att bli b&aring;de p&aring;litligare och enklare.<P>En annan nyhet &auml;r att man p&aring; ett mycket realistiskt s&auml;tt kommer att kunna simulera felsituationer.

F&ouml;r att minska kostnaderna f&ouml;r drift och underh&aring;ll, kommer en gemensam underh&aring;llsdatabas f&ouml;r samtliga fyra centraler att etableras. Det inneb&auml;r att systemunderh&aring;ll kan utf&ouml;ras effektivare. Arbetet kan g&ouml;ras fr&aring;n samtliga centraler oberoende av vilken central som skall underh&aring;llas.<P><B>Informationssystem f&ouml;r operat&ouml;rerna</B><BR>I det nya systemet kommer ett eget informationssytem f&ouml;r operat&ouml;rerna byggas in.

  Point to point HVDC transmissions
</H2>
<H4>
  Most HVDC transmissions are point to point transmissions using
  <A HREF="l1111.htm">overhead lines</A> or <A HREF="l1112.htm">submarine
  cables</A> or a combination of lines and cables. Many of the cable transmissions
  are<B> monopolar</B> with only one metallic conductor between the converter
  stations and using the ground as the return path for the current.
</H4>
<P>
<CENTER>
  <IMG SRC="monopole.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">
</CENTER>
<H4>
  Most overhead line transmissions are <B>bipolar</B>, i.e. they use two conductors
  of opposite polarity (one positive and one negative). A bipolar transmission
  is in fact a double circuit transmission, since one pole can continue to
  transmit power when the other pole is out of service.
</H4>
<P>
<CENTER>
  <IMG SRC="bipolex.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">
</CENTER>
<H4>
  The voltage of a point-to-point transmission is selected to give the lowest
  investment cost and cost of transmission losses for the converter stations
  and the line and/or cable. The highest voltage used today in any DC transmission
  is 600 kV (the <A HREF="l134.htm">Itaipu HVDC transmission </A>in Brazil).
  For submarine DC cables, the highest voltage is 450 kV (the
  <A HREF="l131.htm">Baltic Cable </A>transmission between Sweden and Germany).

	A multi-terminal HVDC transmission is an HVDC system with more than two converter
	stations. Such a system is more complex than an ordinary point-to-point
	transmission. In particular, the control system is more elaborate and the
	telecommunication requirements between the stations become larger.

</TABLE>
<H4>
  There is only one large scale multi-terminal HVDC system in operation in
  the world today. It is the 2000 MW <A HREF="l136.htm">Hydro Quebec - New
  England transmission </A>built by ABB between 1987 and 1992. The operating
  experience of this transmission is very good and has proved that from a technical
  point of view there are no problems to connect several converter stations
  to the same HVDC transmission line. A number of future multi-terminal HVDC
  transmissions are being actively considered at this time.

  The early HVDC development
</H2>
<H4>
  During the 1940s the Swedish State Power Board (now
  <A HREF="http://www.vattenfall.se/">Vattenfall AB</A>) was planning the long
  transmission system from the new Harspr&aring;nget hydroelectric power plant
  in the far north to the load centres in the southern part of the country.
  High-voltage direct current (HVDC) was considered for the Harspr&aring;nget
  transmission, but the system and component development work that was being
  made by ASEA (now ABB) had not yet advanced sufficiently for a practical
  application of the technique. Therefore it was decided to build a 400 kV
  AC transmission system. The first part of this system was energized in 1952
  and it was then the highest voltage used anywhere in the world.
</H4>
<H4>
  The key problem in the HVDC technique was the development of reliable and
  economic valves which could convert high-voltage alternating current into
  high-voltage direct current and vice versa. Experiments performed in different
  parts of the world on mechanical moving contact devices did not prove successful.
  On the other hand, the mercury-arc valve offered one possible line of
  development. From the end of 1920's, when ASEA embarked on the development
  and manufacture of static converters and mercury-arc valves for voltages
  up to about 1000 V, the possibilities of developing valves also for higher
  voltages were investigated.
</H4>
<H4>
  This necessitated the study of completely unknown fields, where earlier technical
  experience could only be applied to a limited degree. For a number of years
  it was indeed an open question whether there existed any solution at all
  to the problems. When the HVDC system finally proved to be a technical reality,
  there still remained uncertainty as to whether it could compete in practice
  and be economical. By then the already established power transmission systems
  had also made significant progress.
</H4>
<H4>
  While electrical machines, transformers, etc., can be designed with great
  precision with the aid of mathematically formulated physical laws, the design
  of the mercury-arc valve must be based to a large degree on empirically acquired
  knowledge. When trying out higher voltages, one is confronted by specific
  physical problems. In a power line or high-voltage apparatus raising the
  voltage is met by increasing the insulation clearances. In the mercury vapour
  atmosphere of the mercury-arc valves it does not help at all to increase
  the spacing between the electrodes.
</H4>
<H4>
  This problem was solved in 1929 by a proposal, which was subsequently patented
  and which in some ways can be considered as forming the cornerstone of the
  development work on the high-voltage mercury-arc valve. An experimental valve,
  tried out in 1933, confirmed the validity of this principle during its brief
  life. At the same time it was found there still remained major material problems
  to be solved. However, after continued development work it proved possible,
  in 1944, to operate a rectifier and an inverter in the laboratory at Ludvika
  with a DC. load of 2000 kW at a voltage up to 60 kV. The development work
  was lead by <A HREF="l1141.htm">Dr. Uno Lamm</A>, who has been named "The
  father of HVDC".
</H4>
<H4>
  The time was now ripe for service trials with larger powers than permitted
  by the resources at Ludvika. A <A HREF="l1142.htm">test station at
  Trollh&auml;ttan</A>, run jointly by the Swedish State Power Board and ASEA,
  was established in 1945, and a 50-km power line was made available for service
  trials. In 1950 the State Power Board placed an order with ASEA for equipment
  for the first HVDC transmission, between the island of Gotland and the Swedish
  mainland. In the following year a larger test station was taken into service
  at Trollh&auml;ttan, possessing adequate resources for the empirical development
  of large high-voltage mercury-arc valves. Accelerated development work resulted
  in the solving of the final problems in 1953, and the design of the most
  critical component, the mercury-arc valve, was fixed. <A HREF="l1143.htm">The
  Gotland transmission </A>with a rating of 20 MW, 200 A, 100 kV came into
  service in 1954. The accelerated work during the latter stages of the development
  project involved the tackling and solving of a series of problems at the
  same time as new problems and obstacles were discovered. Over one hundred
  modifications were systematically tried out. The number of possible development
  lines, which at the beginning appeared to be very large, gradually shrank.
  Finally, there remained only a few alternatives, and among these was found
  the way which led to the final solution.
</H4>
<H4>
  Design work on other components in the converter stations and transmission
  such as transformers, reactors, switchgear and protective and control equipment
  took place in parallel with the development work on mercury-arc valves. AC
  system technology, which had been built up over half a century by power
  specialists the world over, could only be partly applied to a DC system.
  This meant that a completely new system technique became necessary. However,
  this did not require empirical work as in the case of the mercury-arc valves.
  Advanced mathematical methods and <A HREF="l1144.htm">network models</A>
  (TNA) could be applied. With these aids, ASEA's specialists in Ludvika led
  by <B>Dr. Erich Uhlmann</B> tackled the comprehensive complex of problems
  and developed a system concept, that was applied in the Gotland transmission.
  This concept proved to be very successful, and has remained basically unchanged
  until today.
</H4>
<H4>
  At the beginning of the 1950's, the British and French power administrations
  planned a power transmission across the English Channel. A few weeks after
  the commissioning of the Gotland transmission, the study committee appointed
  for this purpose published its report, which recommended AC cables. The distance
  was sufficiently short for this to be possible. After lengthy deliberations
  and studies of the experiences from the Gotland transmission, the HVDC
  alternative was chosen instead and ASEA received their second order for
  transmission equipment.
</H4>
<H4>
  It was an extremely favourable circumstance for developments that a transmission
  project of such a moderate scope as the Gotland link happened to take place
  just at the time it did. No power administration would dare to embark on
  a completely unproven system for bulk power transmission. However, the foundation
  stones were laid with the Gotland project, even if there remained much work
  to do in the development of converters for twice the voltage and 10 to 20
  times higher power required by the subsequent installations.
</H4>
<H4>
  Following the English Channel project, several HVDC transmissions using mercury
  arc valves were built during the 1960s. These were
  <A HREF="l1145.htm">Konti-Skan (Sweden - Denmark)</A>, Sakuma (50/60 Hz frequency
  converter in Japan), the New Zealand transmission (linking the South and
  the North Islands) and the Italy - Sardinia link.
</H4>
<H4>
  The largest mercury arc valve transmission built by ASEA was the Pacific
  HVDC Intertie. This is a 1440 MW (later re-rated to 1600 MW) &#177;400 kV
  transmission from The Dalles, Oregon to Los Angeles, California. This project
  was undertaken by a joint venture formed by ASEA and the General Electric
  Co. The Pacific Intertie started operating in 1970. The southern converter
  station at Sylmar was however badly damaged in the 1971 Los Angeles earthquake.
  The station was rebuilt and the Intertie could resume operation in 1972.
  The Pacific HVDC Intertie has twice been further extended with modern technology
  during the 1980s. It now has a capacity of 3100 MW and a voltage of &#177;500
  kV.
</H4>
<H4>
  In view of ASEA's extensive activities in the semiconductor field, it was
  natural that the company also worked on the development of high-voltage thyristor
  valves as an alternative to mercury-arc valves. In the spring of 1967 one
  of the mercury-arc valves in the Gotland transmission was replaced by a thyristor
  valve, the first in the world to be taken into commercial operation for HVDC
  transmission. After about one year of trial operation, the Swedish State
  Power Board ordered a complete valve group for each converter station in
  order to increase the transmission capacity by 50 %. <A HREF="l1146.htm">The
  new valve group</A> was connected in series with the two existing mercury-arc
  valve groups, thus increasing the transmission voltage from 100 to 150 kV.
  This enlarged transmission was taken into service in the spring of 1970 -
  the Gotland transmission had once more become a world pioneer.
</H4>
<H4>
  Thyristor valves made it possible to simplify the converter stations, and
  they have been used in all subsequent HVDC transmissions. A number of large
  HVDC transmissions were built by ASEA and BBC (the predecessors of ABB) during
  the 1970s. These were the Cahora Bassa (Mozambique - South Africa), Skagerrak
  (Norway - Denmark), Inga-Shaba (Zaire), CU Project (USA) and Nelson River
  2 (Canada).
</H4>
<H4>
  The contract for the largest of all HVDC transmissions in the world, the
  6300 MW <A HREF="l134.htm">Itaipu </A>HVDC transmission in Brazil, was awarded
  to the ASEA-PROMON consortium in 1979. It went into operation in several
  stages between 1984 and 1987 and is an important element in the Brazilian
  power supply delivering a large portion of the electricity needs of the city
  of Sao Paulo.
