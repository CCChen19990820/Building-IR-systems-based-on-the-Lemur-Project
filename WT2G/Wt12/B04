The AP reports today that, according to the *New York Post*, callers to New
York Police Department headquarters for 12 hours ending 6am Tuesday [16 Apr
1996] heard a bogus recording that included the following: ``You have
reached the New York City Police Department. For any real emergencies, dial
119. Anyone else -- we're a little busy right now eating some donuts and
having coffee.'' It continued ``You can just hold the line. We'll get back
to you. We're a little slow, if you know what I mean. Thank you.'' The NYPD
had no immediate comment, but unnamed police sources believe hackers broke
access controls and changed the message.

U.S. District Judge Marilyn Hall Patel released a ruling on 16 Apr 1996 that
mathematician Daniel Bernstein could try to prove that the U.S. export
controls on encryption technology are too broad and violate his right to
communicate with other scientists and computer buffs -- a right protected by
freedom of speech.  (Bernstein's cryptographic programs are called Snuffle
and Unsnuffle.  The U.S. State Department decided in 1993 that Bernstein's
written article and programs required export licenses [because crypto
purveyors are considered as being international arms dealers under ITAR],
but later backed down on restricting the article; Bernstein then had sued
for release of the programs.)

David Banisar of the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) is quoted
in the news item: ``It's important to recognize that computerized
information has the same kind of legal protection that printed information
has.''

I saw a news item last night about a euthanasia law which will soon be
passed in the Northern Territory of Australia.  During the article they
showed the system by which patients could terminate their own lives.

An automated syringe full of a lethal substance was hooked up to a laptop.
The patient was asked a series of questions about whether or not they really
wanted to kill themselves.  At the end of the questions they click on a
button to activate the injection and they die within 30 seconds afterwards.

This would seem to be the ultimate in mission-critical applications, and one
assumes that it has been tested thoroughly (with out anyone attached).

I also noted that the laptop was a Mac.  I shudder to think of the risks of
running such a system under Windows 3.1.

Pete Grooby

[This is in today's papers here.  It would be difficult to do a complete
system test without a real person; all the components might work just fine
individually without being properly integrated.  Worse yet would be having
a specification that is concerned only with the system functioning
correctly when the final YES confirmation is input, without worrying about
accidental triggering, false positives, sneak paths, hazards, race
conditions, malicious reprogramming to change the defaults or even
have the program masquerade as a common icon such as file-delete instead
of person-delete that might trap unsuspecting victims who happened to use
the laptop, etc.  No jokes about poisoned apples, please.  PGN]

[from SF Examiner somewhere around 12-14 April 96]

"IRS Worker Took Peek at Celebrities' Records" [Associated Press]

Memphis - A former IRS employee who said boredom had led him to peek at
the tax records of President Clinton, Elvis Presley, and other famous
people has been acquitted of federal charges.  Robert Patterson, 38, said
it wasn't malicious - he was just trying to learn how to better use the
Internal Revenue Service computers.  "I was sitting there bored, so I
started punching up names," said Patterson.

Hmmm. _We_ do it, it's "malicious cracking/hacking" and they toss us in
the clink... _they_ do it, and it's "practice" (and they get acquitted).
And _these_ are the people who want to escrow _my_ keys? As IF!

Not only that, but also if the guy's so damn _bored_, why doesn't he spend
some time FIXING the damn computer systems at IRS (see current cover of
Information Week mag). Not that I particularly WANT them to fix the
infernal revenue suckers...

BTW, where do they _find_ these people? He's hacking around in Clinton's tax
records and he _doesn't_ expect Secret Service agents crawling up his
yin-yang within minutes? Obviously, "thinking too much" is _not_ this chap's
problem.

I was intrigued by the subject of an article in the *Seattle Times* business
section, 17 Apr 1996, which needs no further comment for RISKS readers:

[by Greg Heberlein, Seattle Times business reporter]

A Bellevue company's stock has tripled in value in
the past 12 trading sessions...

Data Dimensions is a service company whose sole mission --
since 1993 -- has been to help companies reconfigure their
computers so the years 2000 and beyond will not be recognized
as 1900s.  There is believed to be a multimillion-dollar
market for such a service.

And then, yesterday evening, I noticed a new book in the computer section of
my local technical bookstore:

Jerome T. Murray and Marilyn J. Murray
The Year 2000 Computing Crisis
A Millennium Date Conversion Plan
McGraw Hill, 1996
ISBN 0-07-912945-5

It was full of suggested code for patching legacy systems.

The most publicized risk associated with consumer commerce on the Internet
is that of one's credit card number being misappropriated. This risk pales
beside the one recently introduced by PC Flowers and Gifts, a joint venture
involving no-one less than IBM.

I attempted to use PC Flowers (<A HREF="http://www.pcgifts.ibm.com">http://www.pcgifts.ibm.com</A>) to order (a
fairly extravagant) floral arrangement to celebrate my mother's 75th
birthday. To my chagrin (and embarrassment) the flowers never arrived. After
_two_ e-mail messages over three days inquiring as to the state of my
(ostensibly) confirmed order, I received the following response:

&gt;Dear Mr. Wyman,
&gt;
&gt;Please accept our apology for the delay in messaging you back.
&gt;
&gt;PC Flowers &amp; Gifts recently moved our web site servers and we have been
&gt;experiencing some problems.  Unfortunately, we did not receive order number
&gt;100061.  Since we have no record of the order, your credit card was never
&gt;charged.  Our programmers are working on this matter and hopefully very soon
&gt;the problem will be corrected.
&gt;
&gt;We are very sorry for any inconvenience this has caused.  Belinda @ PC
&gt;Flowers &amp; Gifts
&gt;

I would have much preferred having my credit card stolen than having to
explain to my mom why she did not receive a gift on her 75th birthday.

Obviously, these folks leave a little bit to be desired when it comes to
testing the installation of new systems.

I expect you'll get a fair bit of "me too" follow up to Drew Dean's item on
margin losses in <A HREF="/Risks/18.04.html">RISKS-18.04</A> on the "joys of FAX machines". Here's mine.

I have seen a lot of this sort of thing from attempts to pass documents
between US and European offices. Because of the difference in paper sizes we
lose material from margins on the long edge (US-&gt;European) or the short edge
(European-&gt;US). The differences are small and the affected areas are usually
blank, but occasionally ...

I wish this were specific to FAX machines; it affects photocopying and, most
irritating, documents published as Postscript - these are cropped by the
printer. The latter is most irritating because it is easily avoided by the
"publisher" and difficult for the recipient to fix (or even to notice). Even
documents sent as word processor or markup files are not immune because the
printed versions do not correspond - readers thinking they have identical
documents can be confused and, in bad cases, cross references are incorrect.

Actually, Netscape has publically announced that "We are preparing to

(Source: &lt;URL:<A HREF="http://home.netscape.com/misc/DST_err.html">http://home.netscape.com/misc/DST_err.html</A>&gt;.)  They also give

I just read <A HREF="/Risks/18.04.html">RISKS-18.04</A> and found the piece on OS/2's TCP/IP Telnet security
worthwhile but somewhat outdated. IBM provides the user the ability to
replace the existing (default) Telnet Login.exe with another (loginunx.exe)
that supports multiple userids with unique passwords that are maintained in
a file that is encrypted. The password file (PASSWD) is maintained in the
same manner as the Unix password file - unfortunately IBM doesn't supply a
tool to manage this file but you can ftp from various OS/2 ftp sites a file
called PASSWD.ZIP which provides a tool to maintain that file. Thus the OS/2
user who enables Telnet to their workstation can provide a reasonably secure
interface to only trusted users.

Following up on the discussion begun in 18.02, here's another relevant
incident involving bad aliases (I think it was Microsoft Mail rather than
Exchange):

Just a few days ago, we suddenly started getting obviously internal,
confidential e-mail, from various members of some local law firm, addressed
to our Mailer-Daemon (which is forwarded to 3 responsible sysadmins here).

Repeated replies from me to the senders, warning them to stop including our
Mailer-Daemon in their internal replies, were unheeded. Finally, a day
later, I got a frantic phone call from one of them, who was taking on the
added volunteer duty of administering the Microsoft Mail system there. He
said that his colleagues were all asking what the hell was going on, why was
I replying to their internal confidential mail messages that they were
simply addressing to "All-Staff"?

Somehow he had literally added our Mailer-Daemon to an internal system-wide
MS-Mail "All-Staff" alias there. I assume that he, or someone else, had
previously tried to e-mail someone here, perhaps in our Law School, had made
a typo in the address, gotten a reply back from the infamous Mailer-Daemon,
and mistakenly pasted the Mailer-Daemon's address into their PERSONAL alias
book, and subsequently copied their PERSONAL aliases blindly into the SYSTEM
alias. (did I ever tell you about the fascinating love letters we get,
mistakenly addressed to the Mailer-Daemon? :-)

Their internal MS-Mail users would simply address their messages to
"All-Staff" and not even see the expansion of the alias, which is
reasonable (why should the users be bothered with the expansion for
every message to the whole staff?).

(in fact, the first of their puzzling messages leaked to us was from
this guy, saying "OK everyone, I've finally got the staff-wide alias
working! Fire away!" :-)

The problem is, no one was carefully auditing the results. Since no
one actually was paid to be a system administrator, no one bothered to
carefully examine the system-wide aliases. So their confidential mail,
about alternative possible strategies of argument before the judge in
a current pending case, were all forwarded to us!

Of course we offered to delete our copies for a very reasonable fee
:-) :-) (no, I'm kidding, we really did delete them, although perhaps
they made it onto a backup tape or two, maybe even a long-term
archival storage tape? hmm...)

Mark Stahlman, president of New Media Associates, predicts the death of the
Web this year:  "Advertisers will dump the Web, and businesses that depend
on ad support will become uneconomic.  But the cause won't be the poor
performance caused by `clogged pipes';...  it's more fundamental.  The Web
is a terrible place to manipulate people's unconscious fears, which is the
aim of consumer advertising...  Advertising on the Web has to be
information, not manipulation.  This is because the medium doesn't permit
the psychological games that `impact' a modern audience....  unless the Web
becomes television, as @Home and others hope.  If the Web could readily
deliver video-server-based moving images, then the manipulative techniques
of TV ads could also be Web-delivered.  But the bandwidth just isn't
available, and probably won't be for as long as 10 years...  But there's
still a chance something quite new could happen.  The Web is a medium for
information and education -- not unconscious mental manipulation.  What if
the Web's real capability is taken seriously and it becomes the world's
largest adult education system?"  (*Information Week*, 8 Apr 1996, p. 100)

It's April, which brings us Daylight Savings Time, tax returns, and big, fat
envelopes (or small, thin ones).  Now is the time that high-school seniors
[SEE NOTE 1, below] around the U.S. get responses from the college of their
choice and discover whether the feeling was mutual.

I am an alumna of a university that depends on volunteers to contact and
interview the applicants.  Let's call it Eastern Elitist University (EEU)
[SEE NOTE 2, below], as it is very selective (11%) and expensive.  The
interviews are useful for the students, who have questions about the school
or the admissions process, and to the admissions office, which gets a
personal assessment of the candidate.  The process is particularly important
for candidates who live too far away to schedule a visit to EEU (those
willing to travel usually do so after getting acceptances).

Anyway, I have interviewed a few candidates a year for several years.  This
year, the person in charge of my geographic area, Silicon Valley/South Bay,
handled a lot of the communications by e-mail for those of us who had
access.  All important communications were also sent by US Postal Service.
On Monday, April 8, I received an e-mail message with a list of admitted
candidates, and one of them was a student I had interviewed.  We were
instructed to contact our admits no earlier than Tuesday at 5 PM (to allow
for the accept/reject letter to have arrived first).  We were supposed to
encourage "our" candidates to attend local receptions, visit EEU, and we
were to answer any additional questions, with the goal of encouraging them
to accept the admission offer.

On Tuesday, April 9, I contacted the student, whom I will call "Walter
Williams."  I introduced myself and congratulated him on admission.  It
turned out that Walter had already received another call from someone else
who read the e-mail message, so he was not surprised to hear from me.  But
there was a problem: Walter had received a rejection letter from EEU.

A call to the South Bay chair unearthed where the process went awry: EEU
sent a printout, via Federal Express, of the area's admitted students to the
Northern California chair.  He communicated these results to each regional
chair by telephone.  Each of the regional folks had to contact the
interviewers.

One of the admitted students, who went to the same high school as Walter
Williams, was named "Warner Wilkins."  And somehow, both Warner and Walter
got on the South Bay chair's list.  Since the e-mail message had all the
information nicely formatted (candidate, high school, interviewer, status,
etc.), it made the information look official.  But it wasn't transmitted
that way.  And how did Walter get on the list?  Well, either Mr. Northern
California said the wrong name, or Mr. Silicon Valley heard it.  [See
NOTE 3, below.]

But I'd hate to be at the Walter Williams household that evening, dealing
with the rejection letter, two acceptance phone calls, and finally, two
abject apologies (from myself and Mr. Silicon Valley).

The RISKS?  What seemed like a modern, efficient way to distribute
information was really an old-fashioned game of telephone.  EEU sent the
data out as hard-copy, and the results were distributed as each level saw
fit.  The twist on this old problem was the high-tech delivery at the final
link.  If the whole process had been electronic, then the human error of
confusing "Walter Williams" and "Warner Wilkins" would not have occurred.
But we can't go all-electronic until all the volunteers are willing to, and
that's how we ended up with this "hybrid" data.

encourage those school seniors who are high all the time.

Current topics on risks and computer security will be covered at the
upcoming IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy to be held 6-8 May 1996 at
the Claremont Resort in Oakland, California.  Since 1980, the Symposium on
Security and Privacy has been the premier forum for presenting developments
in computer security and for bringing together researchers and practitioners
in the field.  This year topics will range from security flaws in Java and
HotJava, presented by Drew Dean, Ed Felten, and Dan S. Wallach from
Princeton University, to covert channels and to security standards for the

THE INSTITUTION OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERS
Savoy Place London WC2R 0BL
The Fifth Vacation School on Safety Critical Systems
Robinson College Cambridge 15 - 18 September 1996
(Co-sponsored by the British Computer Society)

Since 1992 the Institution of Electrical Engineers has organised an annual
vacation school aimed at providing participants with a broad understanding
of the principles of safety critical systems engineering, with particular
emphasis on the theory and practice of current techniques for defining and
managing the risk potential of computer-based systems.  The fifth in this
series of intensive short residential courses will be held this year at
Robinson College, Cambridge, from Sunday 15th September until Wednesday 18th
September.

The field of safety critical systems includes those processes, products,
and services where a breakdown or design fault is likely to result in death
or injury or damage to property.  Added emphasis is given to the problem of
protecting against such consequences by the development of new legal codes
of product liability.  It is likely to become increasingly difficult for
companies that have not employed explicit risk minimization and management
techniques to argue successfully that they have exercised proper legal care
for the safety of their products and services.

The structure of the vacation school is designed to provide a comprehensive
survey of the issues involved in safety critical systems engineering at a
professional but non-specialist level.  The goal is to provide a framework
of common understanding to link people working in the requirements capture,
architectural design, risk and hazard assessment, reliability, software,
quality assurance, human factors, and project management functions; and to
provide a good foundation for their future professional development.

The vacation school lecture programme is based on the "safety lifecycle"
concept embodied in International Standard IEC 1508, (Functional Safety of
Safety-Related Systems), supplemented by a closely coordinated case study to
provide learning reinforcement and a thematic linkage between the lecture
sessions.

For full details of the vacation school programme and a registration form,
please send e-mail to <A HREF="mailto:SEvans@iee.org.uk">SEvans@iee.org.uk</A> or write to Miss Sarah Evans at the
address given at the head of this announcement.

We have found a privacy/security bug in the Java implementation of the
Netscape Navigator. It is very easily possible for an applet to find out the
pathname of the directory in which the Netscape Navigator was started.  This
information could then be sent back to a CGI program for logging. Clearly
this information should not be available to an applet, as is indicated by
the fact that applets are prevented from reading the "user.home" and
"user.dir" system properties.

When the Netscape Navigator is run under the Windows 95 OS, the pathname
usually does not contain any critical information. However, when the
Navigator is run under a multi-user network OS, such as UNIX, the pathname
often contains the e-mail and/or login name of the user. In addition, the
pathname might reveal details about the topology of the user's network,
which an experienced hacker might be able to exploit.

There are two ways to protect yourself from this problem: Either start up
the Netscape Navigator in a directory whose pathname does not reveal any
critical information, or disable Java altogether (Options | Security
Preferences | General). A system administrator can protect his network by
configuring the HTTP proxy server not to retrieve Java ".class" files.

This bug is present in at least the following versions of the Navigator:

2.0
2.01
3.0b2
2.0GoldB1
2.01Gold

and in the implementations for at least the following platforms:

SunOS 4.1.2, 4.1.3, 4.1.4
SunOS 5.3, 5.4, 5.5
Windows 95, Windows NT
IRIX 5.2, 5.3
HP-UX A.0903, A.0905
Linux 1.2.10, 1.2.13
FreeBSD 2.1.0-RELEASE
OSF1 V3.2

We have not tested whether this bug also exists in Sun's HotJava browser.

We will release full details of the bug as soon as Sun and Netscape have
issued patches which fix the problem.

Full details have been sent to Sun and Netscape. This announcements has also
been posted to the "comp.lang.java" newsgroup and has been sent to CERT.

It is well known that numerous computer programs are so poorly designed and
implemented that they cannot handle special cases of people's names (e.g.,
the case of the person simply named "Smith", as in <A HREF="/Risks/18.05.html">RISKS-18.05</A>).  In some
other cases, there are real physical (and other) constraints that are hard
to code around, such as in the case of some colleagues whose long names risk
falling off the edge of their company badges.

Sometimes people just push things to far to the extreme.  The Guardian
Weekly reported (in the issue ending 21 Apr 1996, p.4) that "a Swedish court
has fined a couple $660 for breaking the law by naming their son
Brfxxxcccxxmnnpcccclllmmnprxxvvclmnckssqlbb11116--or Albin for short."

Does anyone know what law was broken, and can anyone decode the meaning or
origin, if any, of this choice of name?

Baltimore just finished creating a brand new technologically advanced
"central booking" building where police take people after they've been
arrested. Unfortunately, this heavily computerized system has become media
fodder lately as people get lost in the building and are not released for
days. I've seen one television news report that interviewed a woman who said
she spent five days in the building because of a minor warrant for an unpaid
fine. Bail was posted several times and lost.

The Thursday 18 Apr 1996 edition of the *Baltimore Sun* reports that the
system is now working faster after the police started overriding the
computers. For instance, there was an automated system by which prisoners
could be called up for their hearings.  The handheld computers that carried
these messages, however, didn't work and now the City has detailed five
extra officers to escort the prisoners instead.

Another woman complained that her 18-year-old retarded child was held a full
day after bail was set. She says that she was speaking with booking center
over the telephone when the child knocked at the door. The booking center
was telling her that her son could *not* be released until all of the
computer records were complete. I can only hope that the same glitch won't
let out a dangerous criminal.

The article ends by noting that the District Court Commissioner says that
"Anybody [who's] been in this building would be a damn fool to [go] back to
it."

I would like to bring your attention to some recent joint work by Advanced
Micro Devices, Inc., and Computational Logic, Inc., in which the ACL2
theorem prover was used to prove the correctness of an algorithm of
commercial interest.  In particular we proved the correctness of the kernel
of the floating-point division algorithm on the AMD5K86, the first
Pentium-class processor produced by AMD.  Roughly speaking, we proved that
the algorithm implements division on the double extended precision normal
and denormal numbers of the IEEE standard, in the sense that (under
appropriate hypotheses) it returns the floating-point number obtained by
rounding the ``infinitely precise'' quotient by the method and to the
precision specified by a given rounding mode.  The permitted rounding modes
include round to 0, round away from 0, round to nearest, round to positive
(or negative) infinity, and ``sticky'' rounding.  The proof is quite
interesting, involving as it does the formalization of a lot of
floating-point ``folklore'' and classical numerical analysis.

A Mechanically Checked Proof of the Correctness of the Kernel
of the AMD5K86 (tm) Floating-point Division Algorithm

ABSTRACT:

We describe a mechanically checked proof of the correctness of the kernel of
the floating-point division algorithm used on the AMD5K86 microprocessor.
The kernel is a non-restoring division algorithm that computes the
floating-point quotient of two double extended precision floating-point
numbers, p and d (d \= 0), with respect to a rounding mode, mode.  The
algorithm is defined in terms of floating-point addition and multiplication.
First, two Newton-Raphson iterations are used to compute a floating-point
approximation of the reciprocal of d.  The result is used to compute four
floating-point quotient digits in the 24,,17 format (24 bits of precision
and 17 bit exponents) which are then summed using appropriate rounding
modes.  We prove that if p and d are 64,,15 (possibly denormal)
floating-point numbers, d \= 0 and mode specifies one of six rounding
procedures and a desired precision 0 &lt; n &lt;= 64, then the output of the
algorithm is p/d rounded according to mode.  We prove that every
intermediate result is a floating-point number in the format required by the
resources allocated to it.  Our claims have been mechanically checked using
the ACL2 theorem prover.

Taking advantage of yet another incentive offer, I recently switched my long
distance carrier to MCI. They sent me the standard
yet-another-piece-of-plastic-to-stick-in-my-wallet calling cards. The way
these cards work is that you call an 1-800 number and type in your code
consisting of your phone number followed by your PIN (Personal
Identification Number) which happens to be printed on the card.

Enclosed with the cards was a piece of paper in which MCI wisely suggests
that you change your PIN to something other than what they assigned to you
and printed on the card:

Customizing your PIN

Choosing your own four-digit number is the best way to assure you'll
never forget your PIN. Make it the month and year of a loved one's
birthday or use the same password you have for your voice mail or
computer. We'll quickly replace the PIN we assigned you with any four
digits you choose - just call 1-800-476-7306

For some strange reason MCI is recommending you to do exactly the opposite
of what good security practices would proscribe! Not only do they suggest
that you use an easily-breakable password such as an important date, but
they recommend a practice that would weaken the security of potentially more
sensitive information in a voice-mail or computer system.

Of course, what probably prompted note from MCI was a desire to prevent
MCI's customer service department from being inundated with calls from
people who forgot their PINs. This alludes to the associated risk of
requiring people to remember Yet Another Password (YAP).

I find it necessary every few weeks to set the clock on my Unix box at home
because PCs are not generally known for incorporating accurate timekeeping
hardware.  Shortly before doing this recently, I ran across this notice on
the web page of the US Naval Observatory Directorate of Time, operates a
number of stratum-1 NTP servers, and is otherwise the official source of
time in the United States.

<A HREF="http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/phonecheck.html">http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/phonecheck.html</A>

On the morning of April 16, the Directorate of Time moved its
Master Clock #1 Hydrogen Maser to a new environmental chamber in
Washington, D.C. Timing operations were switched to Master Clock #2
Hydrogen Maser. All except our network time servers tick and tock,
which failed to switch over, and jumped back 744.126 seconds
between 12:32:58 UT and 14:23:46 UT, when the problem was corrected.

This jump was 10 million times the normal precision of these systems.

Presumably, other stratum 1 NTP servers operating from local clocks, WWV or
GPS broadcasts successfully made both changeovers and never noticed.  Many
protocols, kerberos for instance, would not take kindly to a ten-minute
drift.  While the close coupling of hosts "tick" and "tock" to the actual US
time standard make them appealing servers as far as nerdly bragging rights

<I>Tue, 23 Apr 96 20:26:16 +0400</I><PRE>

I have found a serious bug (feature?) in Windows 95. It does not properly
treat files that contain certain characters in their names.  These
characters include those with ASCII values of 255, 254, 249, 244, 23* and
some others, all above 127. I have not found a common rule (so I probably
failed the Microsoft IQ test :).

This problem was noted by Olcay Cirit in <A HREF="/Risks/17.64.html">RISKS-17.64</A> in regards to ASCII
229.  He wrote that if this character is the first in a filename, then the
file cannot be deleted, copied, renamed or executed.  Actually, *any* of
these characters at *any* place in the filename will spoil the file.  Such
files are visible in Explorer, with bad characters shown as underscores.
You can create shortcuts to them, view their properties or even try to
rename them.  But any serious operation has to be performed from the command
line.

A pecularity of my DOS file managing program is that it uses direct disk
access to delete files.  I could not do that under Windows 95 until
recently, so to deal with the "bad characters" I had to reboot into DOS
prompt.  Then I discovered the the "LOCK" command will allow DOS utilities
to access disk directly.  However, this is probably an undocumented command,
it's absent in the DOS help file, and it is not an executable file.

A note for those unfamiliar with the "funny" characters.  You can enter any
character at the DOS prompt by holding the Alt key and pressing the keys
with digits for the character at the numeric keypad.  For example, Alt+097
is 'a', and Alt+255 is one of the "bad characters".  So, to see the
described behaviour for yourself, create at the DOS prompt a new file that
has a "bad character" in its name, then try to do something with it in
Windows 95.

The RISKS? Aside from user confusion and possible pranks (which cannot do
much harm, because you can always go to the command line and fix the
things), there is another issue.  Usually filenames with "bad characters"
are not used.  However, here in Russia one way of russifying a PC is to
replace all those Greek, German and Swedish symbols that reside in the upper
part of the ASCII table with Russian letters.  So, if a Russian user had
many files with Russian names, and then switched to Windows 95... Surprise,
surprise!  You can't manage your old files there.

I have to confess that I do not know how Russian edition of Windows 95
works. I am using the US edition.

Bell Atlantic NYNEX Mobile has a web page at: <A HREF="http://www.banm.com">http://www.banm.com</A>

&gt;From that web page I got an e-mail address (<A HREF="mailto:ny@bam.com">ny@bam.com</A>) and sent a report
of a service difficulty.

I also identified my account and the dealer from which I signed up for
service.

Fortunately I did NOT post my PIN number in the message.

The dealer then called me to say that my message had gone "all over the
internet"!

I then e-mailed BANM again asking:
"Do private e-mail messages such as this wind up being spread all over
the internet by your site?

I was not aware of this. Why don't you warn people sending you e-mail
messages that this happens.

I would assume that some of your customers would feel that this is an
invasion of privacy and possibly litigatable.

BELL ATLANTIC NYNEX MOBILE has not replied yet.

I think that this should be a warning to people sending BANM what they THINK
to be private e-mail messages to be advised that they may wind being
published on their web page. So be sure not to put confidential information
in messages to BANM.

&gt;Anatoly Voronov, the director of Glasnet, an Internet service provider in
&gt;Russia, says:  "It is just incredible when I hear people talking about how
&gt;open the Web is.  It is the ultimate act of intellectual colonialism.  The
&gt;product comes from America so we either must adapt to English or stop using
&gt;it.  ...

Sigh.  As always clueless get most publicity.

Apparently Mr. Director of small but noisy local service provider is not
aware that Russia-language newsgroup traffic is second to English-language.
Apparently he's not aware that domestic ISPs in Russia offer quite a lot of
Russian-language material.  Apparently he does not even realize that
understanding of Internet technology in Russia is good enough that there
happened to be quite a few recent Russian immigrants taking senior positions
in U.S. telecom industry.

The prevalence of English is merely due to the need for some common
language.  A modern man cannot be considered educated if he cannot read it.
It's like Latin centuries ago.

How can anybody's head to be so screwed as to consider the only real advance
in destroying the inter-cultural communication barriers to be "the ultimate
act of intellectual colonialism" (ain't that an oxymoron?) is beyond my
comprehension.

Maybe French government should send him a job offer.

1) Nicholas (sp?) Negroponte of MIT's Media Lab begins his book
"Being Digital" by emphasizing the difference between transporting
bits and transporting atoms.  The Internet moves bits.  The Soviet
Union, in its heyday of real rather than intellectual colonialism,
moved atoms, i.e., people, in very large numbers, specifically natives
out of subordinated lands, Russians into them.

2) The "product", I thought, came largely from *CERN*: an *international*

I think one of the most frightening aspects of this was the penultimate
screen image.  There is an option "YES" (i.e., proceed) but none for "NO"
(i.e., I've changed my mind).

OK, the very last screen _does_ give you this choice, but ... how is the
intended patient to know that there's another screen coming up (unless they
go through a dress rehearsal)???  That screen yelled out at me from the
(I think it was last Tuesday's Australian newspaper but could have been
the Sun's) Computer Section page.

There was no obvious way to change one's mind.

This is the ultimate bad GUI design - no apparent option to cancel or go for
a "none of the above" decision.  Stupidity?  Criminal?  I don't know, but it
was downright frightening.

It reminds me of (and I don't mean to belittle the thread) dialog boxes
(or alerts) which used to notify you of a (serious) System Error on the Mac.
It gave you the "choice" of doing a restart (reboot) or a quit.  The trouble
was that the quit almost always never worked and the thing froze anyway.
Current Mac SW gives you the "choice" of restarting only (apart from those
that automatically quit to the Finder).

Perhaps the subtle differences between an Alert

Where you usually don't have a choice - e.g., "You are about to
die.. Press OK to continue"

and all other forms of dialog boxes

Where you _do_ have a choice (and even an escape hatch not covered
by those being solicited)..

need to be made more obvious.  The ornamentation (at least on the Mac) for both
types of displays (windows) are very similar.  The windows in question
(from memory) actually seemed more like web browser pages  with the YES/NO
options as links.

As for an escape hatch, there should always be one, regardless.  It should
never be out of view (ie, it should *never* be scrolled off the top).

Say, for example, a patient had a change of heart with that penultimate
window displayed.  OK, there's always the "quit" menu option, hitting the
power switch, etc, but how comfortable and certain is he/she that this
hasn't left the drip (or whatever) still in a primed state?  There is no
confirmation that equipment has been de-activated, especially if he/she hits
the power/restart switch.

Critical systems indeed.

&gt;Subject: More Microsoft Viruses (Edupage, 16 Apr 1996)
&gt;First there was the Word virus -- now there's a Word Prank Macro Virus,

Before Microsoft admitted it *was* a virus, their term for WordMacro.Concept
(the "original"), was the Word Prank Macro.  This isn't new at all.

&gt;located in a document on ActiveVRML, Microsoft's software tool for
&gt;developing 3-D Web sites.  But what's worse, is that Microsoft had to inform
&gt;the programmers who attended its Professional Developers Conference last
&gt;month that one of the CD-ROMs it distributed was infected.  A cure is posted

Concept is everywhere.  Of those who work in large corporations, the only
ones who *don't* regale me with stories of massive infestations are those
who do not know how to check for it.  Microsoft has been a repeat offender:
we are constantly hearing of new disks and CD-ROMs from MS that contain
infected documents.

&gt;on Microsoft's Web site &lt; <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/">http://www.microsoft.com/</A> &gt;  (*Investor's Business
&gt;Daily*, 15 Apr 1996, A8)

Microsoft's anti-WordMacro/Prank/Concept package is a Word macro itself.  It
takes a piecemeal approach, and has been updated several times as new macro
viruses have been discovered.  The protection provided has holes: it is best
not to rely on it.

Edupage has had a large number of erroneous virus reports over the past year.
No worse than the general press, of course (where their material is obtained),
but somewhat disturbing in the technical community they distribute to.

I have spoken to several people who have signed up for the new
toll-free US 888 numbers (addition to the older 800 numbers).  They are
seeing a precursor to the year 2000 problem - many systems don't recognize
888 numbers.
One story was told that a sales person called his 888 numbered voice
mail system from his hotel room.  When he went to check out, he had a bill
for over $60 in phone charges.  It seems that the local hotel did not
recognize the prefix 888, and so assumed it was a long distance call and
charged the highest toll rates.  Other stories tell of pay phones that will
not accept calls using 888, car phones that reject calls dialed with 888, as
well as a myriad of other system related glitches.
The change seems simple - just tell your system that 888 is a valid
toll free prefix.  However, as with the Y2K problem, it seems that plenty of
systems either were not ready for the change, or are incapable of accepting
it.  If this is any indication of the Y2K RISK, I'm moving to a remote
mountain top in 1999.

Adelyn Lee had won a $100K out-of-court settlement for wrongful termination
from Oracle in February 1995, claiming that she had been fired for refusing
to have sex with Oracle president Larry Ellison.  She had apparently used as
evidence a piece of e-mail from her boss VP Craig Ramsey to Ellison,
confirming that Lee had been terminated as per Ellison's request.  To make a
long story short, San Mateo County Deputy District Attorney Paul Wasserman
said that their investigation has now come to the conclusion that Ramsey
could not have sent the e-mail (because he was driving in his car at the time
according to cell-phone records) and that, as Ramsey's executive assistant,
Lee knew his passwords (and indeed had been responsible for changing them for
him periodically).  Lee has now been charged with felony perjury for lying
and sending false e-mail.  [Source: *San Francisco Chronicle*, 20 Apr 1996,
D1-2]

What are some of the conclusions for RISKS readers (not new)?

1. Don't believe e-mail FROM: headers accurately represent the sender.
2. Don't believe the content of e-mail, whether or not the headers
are correct.
3. Don't share your passwords overtly with anyone, or let someone else
be responsible for your passwords.
4. Don't use covertly compromisible reusable fixed passwords; how often
you change them is more or less irrelevant.
5. Use one-time nonreusable authentication tokens instead of fixed passwords.
6. Even if you use PEM, PGP, stronger-crypto e-mail, or whatever, you
cannot ensure authenticity, because of untrustworthy operating systems
and untrustworthy users.
7. Beware of trying to use e-mail as nonrepudiatable court evidence.
8. HOWEVER, don't believe that cell-phone records are valid as court
evidence; they too could be bogus or altered.  If someone drags you
into court, find someone who can demonstrate how easily those records
could have been altered!
9. Etc., etc., etc.

register with AOL.  He entered his name "Blackie" and his home town
"Scunthorpe", and found that AOL's (indecency-filtering) registration
program would not accept that combination.  After various discussions with
the AOL folks in Dublin, he discovered that he could register properly if
he entered the town as "Sconthorpe".  As a result of this curious situation,
AOL has announced that the name of the town will henceforth be known as
"Sconthorpe".  The entire saga is documented in the Scunthorpe Evening
Telegraph (final edition) of Tuesday, 9 Apr 1996, issue number 30111,

[The previous item contributed by Clive Feather touches on some further
serious issues relating to the effectiveness, propriety, and risks
involved in filters that attempt to censor on the basis of linguistic
strings; as other examples, side-effects of filtering "couples"
(<A HREF="/Risks/17.79.html">RISKS-17.79</A>) and "xxx" (SurfWatch, <A HREF="/Risks/17.81.html">RISKS-17.81</A>) have been noted in recent
RISKS postings.

Rob Kling is a member of the ACM Committee on Computers and Public Policy,
the umbrella organization in ACM for RISKS.  He had the following comments
upon seeing the above message; his comments address just a few of the RISKS
issues raised.  PGN]

There is a lot of info regarding Scunthorpe obtainable via Alta Vista.
This is a real city and its integrity deserves respect, even if it is
not exactly a place well-known to people in the US.  [For example, see
<A HREF="http://www.computerprint.co.uk/scunthorpe/travel.html">http://www.computerprint.co.uk/scunthorpe/travel.html</A> and
<A HREF="http://www.computerprint.co.uk/scunthorpe/history.html">http://www.computerprint.co.uk/scunthorpe/history.html</A> .]

I can imagine that there might even be some people with the last name of
Scunthorpe.  The willingness of AOL (or other services) to excise identities
in the name of "decency" raises big issues of genuine decency in my view.

The law in question states that parents should report the name they have
chosen for their children within a specified time after birth (three months
I think).  The authorities in their turn has a rule saying that they should
not allow registration of names that are likely to cause harassment or other
obvious drawbacks for the child, like giving a girl what is traditionally
exclusively a boy's name and vice versa.  Another recent case was when
parents were not allowed to name their girl Ikea (a constructed name for a
fairly well-known furniture company) and an older example was when another
girl could not be named Veranda (which means exactly the same in Swedish).

What has this got to do with computers and risks? The parent's choice of
name in this case is a protest against bureaucracy in general, one part of
which is that the authorities have indeed a limit on how many characters
that they register for each child.  (The row of letters is as impossible to
pronounce in Swedish as it is in English.  Albin is of course a perfectly
valid name here too.)

As for computers and real risks, this is an international question about
assumptions of name structure and their use in design of computer systems.
We often even can't handle our own in Sweden.  Swedes for example typically
have from one to three first names, and they choose themselves which one
that they use daily.  That choice is reported, but many computer systems do
not register it.  Normally it is the first "first name", but not
necessarily.  Which means that there are mix-ups, when for example a
computer sends a letter to George Thomas Smith addressed to "George Smith",
and that happens to be what the father is not called (he uses his second
name Thomas) but it also happens to be what the son (Andrew Charles George
Smith) actually is called.  This happened in my husband's family, and guess
how much trouble there was when the son tried to report that he was moving
to a new address...  As for myself, I sometimes give in and register my
second "first name" as "middle name" when travelling, so that passport
authorities do not complain that I do have a "middle name" and should fill
it in.  But if you come to Sweden and marry someone here, it is very likely
that you can not register that child's middle name, because it is
"offensive" as a first name, and we only register first and family names.

[Incidentally, Albin's would-be given name (noted in <A HREF="/Risks/18.06.html">RISKS-18.06</A>)
had one occurrence of the putatively heinous "xxx".  Perhaps we
will all someday have to be identified by multilingually and
transnationally filtered globally biunique identifiers -- to
accommodate our computer systems.   (Note that Internet addresses and
phone numbers are unique if globally qualified, but are not biunique
-- because they may be shared by multiple personalities).  PGN]

The law that was broken is the Swedish 'Name Law' (SFS 1982:670) and the
authority which deals with its implementation is the Swedish Patent &amp;
Registration Office.

Not having seen the detailed judgement in this case, I would guess that the
law was seen to have been broken in at least two ways. First a technical
reason: as your correspondent surmises, the name would have been regarded
as far too unmanageable for inclusion in the computerized Civic
Registration data held on all Swedish citizens. Secondly, and perhaps more
importantly, the law explicitly prohibits forenames "which can cause
offence, or may lead to any inconvenience for the bearer, or is for any
other reason obviously unsuitable as a forename".

As far as the meaning of the name 'Brfxxx...' is concerned, I would have
thought it is to be found precisely in its lack of meaning. And, whatever
one thinks of a law like the Swedish one, what about the poor kid himself?
Cases like this one tend to prove very little about the law itself, and much
more about the pretty warped attitude some people have towards their
offspring...

The Swedish name law, on which most other Nordic name laws are based, is
nonetheless unusually restrictive as far as choosing and changing names are
concerned. However, it should be pointed out that practically every other
country, with the exception of the UK and parts of the US, have *some* form
of restriction on names: e.g. Germans can't change their names to Hitler;
French forenames must be taken from saints and/or antiquity; etc. etc.

In Nov 1992, I wrote and presented a talk on BBC radio, "Names Never Hurt
You", which deals with the social and political aspects of name laws, with
particular emphasis on Sweden. If anyone would like a transcript, please
e-mail me.

A potentially earthshaking risk of using computers is currently being
discussed at the highest levels of the U. S. government.  The risk involves
human skill obsolescence, a growing wage gap between skilled and unskilled
workers, and possible social unrest.  The phenomenon may underlie the themes
of economic nationalism and protectionism that have surfaced during the
current Presidential campaign.

The *Wall Street Journal* devoted a front-page column to the topic on 22 Apr
1996.  It quoted Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan as saying,
"Human skills are subject to obsolescence at a rate perhaps unprecedented in
American history."  It went on to quote George David, chief executive officer
at United Technologies Corp., who believes that 18 million U.S.  workers are
"at risk" because their jobs are "prone to automation."

Upheaval in the nature of work--in manufacturing in the 1980's, and now in
the service sector--has been discussed for some time, usually under the
assumption that additional jobs would be created to replace the ones lost to
machines.  Increasingly, the question is arising as to just how much the new
jobs are going to pay.

The Gartner Group in Stamford, Connecticut, says the federal government will
spend about $30 billion to modify a massive number of computer programs in
which years were coded simply as two-digit numbers (without identifying the
century) and which will have to be fixed so that they can correctly calculate
things like benefits payments.  It is also estimated that by the time the
year 2000 comes around only 70% of government computer programs will have
been modified to deal with the problem.  (*Computerworld*, 22 Apr 1996 p1)

<ADDRESS>
CERT Advisory
&lt;<A HREF="mailto:cert-advisory@cert.org">cert-advisory@cert.org</A>&gt;
</ADDRESS>
<I>Wed, 24 Apr 1996 14:25:09 -0400</I><PRE>

The CERT Coordination Center has received reports of a vulnerability in
rpc.statd (rpc.statd is also known as statd on some systems). As of the
date of this advisory, we have received no reports of this vulnerability
being exploited.

If exploited, this vulnerability can be used to remove any file that the
root user can remove or to create any file that the root user can
create.

Section III and Appendix A contain information from vendors. Appendix B
contains an example of a possible workaround.

As we receive additional information relating to this advisory, we will
place it in

<A HREF="ftp://info.cert.org/pub/cert_advisories/CA-96.09.README">ftp://info.cert.org/pub/cert_advisories/CA-96.09.README</A>

We encourage you to check our README files regularly for updates on
advisories that relate to your site.

I.   Description

rpc.statd, also called statd, is the NFS file-locking status monitor. It
interacts with rpc.lockd, also called lockd, to provide the crash and
recovery functions for file locking across NFS.

NFS is stateless, which means that NFS clients and servers can be
rebooted without a loss of file integrity due to NFS. In contrast, NFS
file locking is stateful. To achieve this stateful nature in a stateless
environment, rpc.lockd must work with rpc.statd to add state to file
locking.

To understand what rpc.statd does, it is first necessary to understand
what rpc.lockd does. rpc.lockd processes lock requests that are sent
either locally by the kernel or remotely by another lock daemon.
rpc.lockd forwards lock requests for remote NFS files to the NFS server's
lock daemon using Remote Procedure Calls (RPC).

rpc.lockd then requests monitoring service from the status monitor
daemon, rpc.statd, running on the NFS server. Monitoring services are
needed because file locks are maintained in the NFS server kernel. In
the event of a system crash or reboot, all NFS locks would normally be
lost. It is rpc.statd that adds stateful file locking.

When an NFS server reboots, rpc.statd causes the previously held locks
to be recovered by notifying the NFS client lock daemons to resubmit
previously granted lock requests. If a lock daemon fails to secure a
previously granted lock on the NFS server, it sends SIGLOST to the
process that originally requested the file lock.

The vulnerability in rpc.statd is its lack of validation of the
information it receives from what is presumed to be the remote rpc.lockd.
Because rpc.statd normally runs as root and because it does not validate
this information, rpc.statd can be made to remove or create any file that
the root user can remove or create on the NFS server.

II.  Impact

Any file that root could remove can be removed by rpc.statd. Any file
that root could create can be created by rpc.statd, albeit with mode 200.

III. Solution

The general solution to this problem is to replace the rpc.statd daemon
with one that validates the information sent to it by the remote
rpc.lockd. We recommend that you install a patch from your vendor if
possible. If a patch is not available for your system, we recommend
contacting your vendor and requesting that a patch be developed as soon
as possible. In the meantime, consider whether the information in
Appendix B is applicable to your site.

In addition to the security bug found by Drew Dean, Ed Felten and Dan
Wallach in March, there is another way to run native code from a Java
applet, which will require a separate fix to the current versions of
Netscape (2.01 and Atlas PR2) and Sun's Java Development Kit (1.01).

Both this attack and the previous one rely on an applet being able to create
an instance of the same security-sensitive class, but each does so using an
independent hole in the bytecode verifier.

Once an applet is able to run native code, it can read, write, and execute
any local file, with the permissions of the browser.  These attacks do not
require any additional preconditions, other than viewing the attacker's web
page with Java enabled.  They can be done without the user's knowledge.

Disable Java (on all platforms except Windows 3.1x), and if possible
Javascript, using the Security Preferences dialogue in the Options menu.
Note that the section on security in the Netscape release notes is not
up-to-date.

Netscape (Atlas PR1, PR2):
As above, except that the options to disable Java and Javascript have
moved to the Languages tab in the Network Preferences dialogue.

Appletviewer (JDK beta*, 1.0, 1.01):
Do not use appletviewer to load applets from untrusted hosts.

HotJava (alpha*):
Sun no longer supports HotJava alpha, and does not not intend to fix
any of its security holes until a beta version is released.

There are many articles in RISKS wondering about various aspects of the
safety of increasing automation in aircraft. We should remember that
increased automation can also help to avoid accidents.

Nancy Leveson (<A HREF="/Risks/17.21.html">RISKS-17.21</A>) pointed out some incidents in which TCAS (the
Traffic Avoidance and Collision Alert System) seems to have helped avoid
collision accidents. In <A HREF="/Risks/17.89.html">RISKS-17.89</A>, I referred to a report that the US Navy
was speeding up acquisition of digital flight control systems for F-14s to
help avoid loss-of-control accidents.

There is another example in recent news.  From newspaper reports, it seems
as if the safety of flight IFOR 21, a US Air Force T-43A (a type of
B737-200) which crashed on approach to Dubrovnik, Croatia, could have been
enhanced by more modern navigation equipment. This flight carried US
Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown.

The USAF does not normally release results of its investigations to the
public. So I have summarised facts from a short *Washington Post* article,
two articles from *Flight International*, and a *New York Times Service*
feature article that appeared in the *International Herald Tribune* on
Monday 29 Apr 1996. I also include some of my own observations and (a link
to) the approach plate (map) for the Dubrovnik NDB Runway 12 approach that
the aircraft was in course of executing. This summary is available in the
Compendium `Computer-Related Incidents and Accidents...'  under my WWW home
page at <A HREF="http://www.techfak.uni-bielefeld.de/~ladkin/">http://www.techfak.uni-bielefeld.de/~ladkin/</A>

Citing cost overruns and schedule delays because of mismanagement, the
Federal Aviation Administration canceled a $475 million contract that was
intended to help the airlines get extremely precise navigational data from
satellites.  The FAA announced the contract in August with Wilcox Electric
Inc. of Kansas City, a subsidiary of Thomson-CSF SA of Paris.  The FAA said
the action was part of a new strategy of cutting losses early, rather than
struggling along for years with mounting delays and cost overruns.

I'm writing this up as a reminder re: the importance of not jumping to
conclusions, especially when computers are involved. My hope is that perhaps
this story will one day be recalled by a reader facing a similar situation,
and a better outcome will result.

Recently, one of our staff members found an incomplete outgoing message in
her e-mail that she did not write. The appearance was that another staff
member might have been forging an e-mail message from her machine, but been
interrupted. The creation date was several days before the message was
found, making it appear that the creation date had been faked; there were
two copies of the message in two locations, making it appear that the
message had been copied; the writing style was not that of the machine's
owner; the issue mentioned was one that had a bone of contention between the
staff members days earlier.

In my initial investigation, I reported that without full security and a
reliable audit trail it wasn't really possible to prove that such a forgery
had been done, but that this did look suspicious. Relationships within our
group had been strained, and this was enough to start accusations flying.
The climate in the office, already toxic, grew poisonous.

Yesterday, I put my finger on the actual smoking gun: I hadn't known it
initially, but the two staffers were using Macintosh file sharing and one
was mounting the entire hard disk of the other as a server volume using the
owner password, which gave complete read and write access to the entire
volume. This was counter to our written guidelines on safe file sharing.
The mail program in question, poorly-written, stores full path names to keep
track of the folder where it creates outgoing mail. One system's internal
hard disk had been renamed from the default "Macintosh HD" and the other had
not - I'm sure most readers know by now where this is going.

The mail program found its outgoing messages folder on the wrong machine and
the message in question was created there. I replicated this exact sequence
of events on two other machines yesterday while my supervisor watched. I
haven't explained the duplicate copies on the remote machine or why the
message was seen earlier, but this isn't necessary in order to convince me
that this "forgery" was really an accident.

Upon reflection, there was no clear motive, and everyone agrees now that if
the attempt had been to defame a fellow employee, a much more coherent and
effective job would have been done. Public apologies have been made. We're
switching e-mail clients and our staff members will be expected to follow
guidelines for safe file-sharing. I personally was far, far too willing to
blame a staff member before exhausting every technical possibility. Now
we've got to work at building a trusting work environment again, and hope
that this can be put behind us, but I don't think the accused staff member
will quickly forget being the target of an unfair accusation where the only
evidence existed on a computer, and my confidence in my own judgment has
been badly shaken.

The RISK is of attributing to malice what is easily attributable to
poorly-written software, incomplete understanding of the system your
co-workers use, and failure to follow good security practices. There is a
further risk that a pre-existing climate of suspiciousness can push an
investigation of an anomaly into a witch hunt. The last RISK is that it is
too easy for someone like myself, inexperienced at managing conflicts
between staff members, to lose his objectivity and start becoming more
suspicious of a person than of a computer. As a regular RISKS reader, I
should have known better.

I can't wait for AOL to try this with other languages.  The "am" in
"America" means the same in Turkish as what they're objecting to in
Scunthorpe.  Perhaps they need to transform themselves to "Omerica On-Line"!

The first time I ever saw the offending word in print, it was spelled with
an "o" anyway; this was in the early 60s in a script in _Plays and Players_,
a British magazine devoted to contemporary drama.  They presumably did that
to get by the English drama censor (the Lord Chamberlain, whose
idiosyncratic prohibitions provided the British intelligentsia of the time
with nearly as much amusement as their modern American counterparts get from
the CDA).

It seems somewhat ironic that AOL's substitution of an 'o' for a 'u' in the
name of Scunthorpe has just translated the problem -- turning an embedded
English vulgarity into a French one, the same one just to add to the fun
(what my dictionary refers to delicately as: "Vulg. Sexe de la femme.")

AOL, or any other organisation applying such a policy on a global basis,
runs the risk of altering a name to avoid a perceived English vulgarism and
creating as much, if not more, offense in the language and culture of
origin.  This is complicated by the fact that these second-order vulgarities
would likely be unrelated to the English obsession with body parts and
functions and thus be much harder for the censor to detect.

Fans of British humour will recall that "Norwich" encodes an indecent
suggestion. Perhaps AOL should be censoring that fine city's name also.

[Long message excerpted for RISKS ...] The real message is:

1) Use PGP.

2) If you receive PGP e-mail and find it to be offensive, and only
that, give up corresponding with the person in question.

3) (which is the crux of the matter) Does the e-mail contain a serious
threat or form of intimidation?, in which case it is covered by the
normal strictures against intimidation, does it contain slanders or
libels (N.B. English law doesn't consider a statement of fact to be a
slander or libel, so I don't in all honesty think this law counters
freedom of speech, even though its heavier users are Tory MPs)? and
finally is it in some other way criminal?, e.g., a chain letter to
deprive you of all your cash, which I admit I tend to dismiss as being
the "buyer"'s problem to worry about - AOL aren't protecting you from ANY
of these rather larger problems.

and the message to America On Line is that they should probably provide
something on the lines of PGP, however ropy and possible to crack, and stop
fooling around with people's e-mail and free speech. IBM must have had this
problem, because under VM it was possible to monitor only your own id, not
the id of someone you managed - a lesson I think Unix should probably have
learned too (as a result a VM manager could claim not to be responsible for
the nasty activities of the users).  [...]

The AOL censorship item in <A HREF="/Risks/18.07.html">RISKS-18.07</A> reminds me of Paul Hilfinger's story
about the time the Carnegie-Mellon University computer-center staff was
ordered by the CMU administration to change the name of the "finger" command
(despite it being an ARPAnet standard).  They changed "finger" to "where"
and also took it upon themselves to change Paul's name to "Paul Hilwhere"
(initially intending it to be temporary).  Paul actually approved of the
change (as a kind of gentle protest), and it remained that way for some

&gt; French forenames must be taken from saints and/or antiquity ...

Funny about how French mores are constantly misrepresented in the
Anglo-Saxon world - usually to present France as a kind of Soviet Union
where everything is government-regulated.

The informal guideline until a few years ago was that the name should either
be from antiquity or appear in some calendar. This includes religious
calendars (not only Catholic), but also e.g. the Revolutionary calendar,
where months appear with names like Nivose and Ventose, and days have names
like Cerise (cherry). I believe all the law said was something like local
authorities should exert proper care; the calendar approach was a pragmatic
way to resolve borderline cases. In last resort, of course, the courts would
decide.

In the past twenty years or so pragmatism has reigned, what with the large
immigrant populations (if you go to a playground you'll hear parents calling
"Leila" and "Tarik" all around - not typical Catholic saint names), the
influence of American movies (every other child seems to be called Jessica
or Gregory), and a general move towards more laxity in tolerating individual
tastes.  This clearly has some limits, and I don't think that `Brfxxx...'
would pass any more there than in Sweden.

The RISKS? Don't make assumptions about how your intended audience will view

9a. Don't believe that a person cannot have a batch job or

send e-mail to another address (with or without "fudged

of Costa Rica catching sailfish.

I think PGN forgets a very important one:

10. Never accept to handle the account of some other person or
having access to his/her computer.

The reason is obvious: should that person commit any crime s/he can always
argue that since you had access to his/her account you could have forged or
impersonated him/her. If that person is your boss and more powerful and
reputed than you are, chances are s/he will be believed and you will charge
with the responsibility for the crime.

Note: I'm not implying this could in any way whatsoever have happened in the
Oracle case. But with computers it is now so easy to deny the authenticity
of any document and imply it is a forgery that loading responsibilities on
someone else's shoulders is trivial.

Adelyn Lee having Larry Ellison's password is significant. If she had his
password, she may or may not have used it to send the e-mail. But as a RISKS
matter, the technological evidence is not conclusive, even beyond some of
the ways PGN mentioned.

For example, the cellphone records don't even have to be forged. Unless they
checked all possible cellphone numbers in the area that he could have used,
they can't rule out his having both his own cellphone and another line with
a cellular modem. Or having had the e-mail sent via an at job or other
automatic scheduled mechanism. Also, was the clock set to the same time for
their computer and the cellphone records?  Conceivably, he also could have
had someone else with access do it (but allegations of conspiracy, like talk
of black helicopters, don't do much to establish the credibility of a
particular line of argument).

Since the technical evidence is not conclusive, it comes down to a
credibility and bigger lawyers issue. I'm concerned about the precedent that
may be established if judges rule on an issue while the parties have not
explored all reasonable arguments about the technology. We'll see what
happens with the perjury charge. -S.

COORDINATION AND ADMINISTRATION OF THE INTERNET
Workshop Announcement and Call for Papers

This is a first announcement and call for papers and proposals for a
workshop to be held at the John F. Kennedy School of Government, Cambridge,
MA, USA, on September 8-10, 1996.  The workshop will address issues in the
international coordination and management of Internet operations.  We are
seeking papers which address the economic, organizational, legal and
technical issues in migrating to internationally sanctioned,
industry-supported processes and institutions.  What should a fully
internationalized Internet look like, and how do we get there from here?

Topics to be explored in the workshop and resulting publication include:

- policy and management issues concerning
network addresses
domain names
routing policy
settlements
interconnect points
intercontinental connectivity
quality of service standards

- legal and institutional structures for supporting core Internet functions

- institutions and policies needed to ensure the future scalability and
extensibility of the Internet

- technical and implementation issues presented by heterogeneous national
information policies

- the need for data in support of Internet planning, including issues of
how data should be collected and maintained

- coordination needed for the deployment of new technology

- international crisis management for the Internet

Although the Internet is already substantially privatized, certain essential
functions -- notably the domain name registry, network number assignment,
and the routing arbiter -- are still funded by the U.S. Government.  Unlike
the local telephone exchange, these integrative services are managed by
third parties, contributing to an open competitive environment which has
helped enable rapid growth of the Internet.  Rapid growth,
commercialization, and internationalization are putting stress on current
institutions and procedures -- which are neither self-sustaining nor
officially recognized at the international level.  The National Science
Foundation plans to phase out support for core administrative services and
for international connections, just as it has withdrawn support for
production-level backbone services.  Conflicts over tradenames and number
assignments suggest that international legitimacy is needed for domain name
and network number management.

Beyond support for essential functions, there are many practical and policy
issues where some greater degree of coordination or institutional leadership
may be desirable.  For example, how can the implementation of new technology
and protocols be expedited? What common definitions and guidelines should
exist to describe network performance?  Should the functions performed by
current Internet institutions (such as the Internic, RIPE, APNIC, and the
IANA) be brought into a more robust international infrastructure, and if so,
how?  To what extent are multilateral peering arrangements and settlements
needed to encourage continued growth and competition in the Internet access
industry?

The conference will engage scholars, practitioners and policy makers in
examining and discussing these issue.  It will bring together stake-holders,
academics and individual leaders within and beyond the Internet community to
help define the future institutional infrastructure of the Internet.

Workshop papers will be revised and edited following the workshop for
publication by MIT Press as part of the Harvard Information Infrastructure
Project series.  Potential participants are encouraged to submit papers that
can be developed and revised for publication (copyright assignment is not
required).  Please send an abstract by June 15, 1996, for review by the
program committee.

Please direct papers, proposals, and requests for future mailings to:

I'm unaware of whether this point has been raised: under Netscape 2.01 and
Atlas, there is a hole in Java vs. Javascript security that allows an Applet
to (amongst other things) contact a host other than that it was loaded from.
As Netscape allows use of "javascript:" URLs, it is possible to construct a
Javascript string in a Applet, then execute it by a call to showDocument().
This Javascript is *not* subject to the same security restrictions as the
Applet.

There are only three immediate risks I can think of:

1. People can end up reading pages they didn't expect or have any wish
to (though this is a risk with Javascript more than with Java, Java offers
an extra layer of concealment)

2. On a related note, people can end up running Applets they didn't
expect to, from different hosts, and these Applets may be able to
compromise security by communicating with each other.

3. Any Javascript security holes are also available to Java

It seems to me that no end is in sight to the security holes in
Java.  In addition, I have been hearing that Java (and net access in
general) will soon become more deeply integrated into desktop OSs.  Just
how bad could this get?  Is there a way that uncontrolled or malicious Java
applets could propagate themselves about the net?  Examples:

*  A Java applet that runs server code, propagating itself from its own server?
*  An applet that inserts copies of itself into a server on a machine that
is also used to run a browser?
*  An applet that runs compiler code, creating an application of the
author's choosing on the target machine?
*  An applet that attaches itself to Java-enabled applications or their
documents (a la Word macro virii), perhaps then using file sharing to
propagate itself?

I can think of other scenarios that are not specific to executable
applets, such as the exploitation of security holes on the net.  (The Morris
worm is an example of such).  Given how few users take security seriously
(or understand its implications), how likely is an event that causes massive
damage?

The folks that designed Java took all this and more into account,
but the continuing bugs show that the propagation of executables of this
type carries an inherent RISK.  The community is to be commended for
scrutinizing Java.

The following article was in Saturday 27th April (UK) Daily Mail newspaper:

Cambridge computer chaos as hacker hits secret files

A worldwide hunt has been launched for a computer hacker who accessed
sensitive research information at Cambridge University.  Confidential files
were broken into using the Internet. Now up to 10,000 academics and students
are being forced to alter their passwords as the university's computer
experts try to plug the leak.  Many of the files belong to top research
scientists and contain commercial, academic and medical information.
Richard Stibbs, Director of computer science studies at the university said:
"The hacker could come from anywhere in the world. The potential damage to
Cambridge University and beyond is enormous. Fortunately no files appeared
to have been tampered with, but we are asking everyone to check very
carefully."

The alarm was raised when a network security system which links universities
detected a rogue program in the Cambridge computer. The hacker is thought to
have gained access through the university's E-mail system, the Ethernet
[sic].  Experts are trying to trace when he broke into the system - which is
being replaced to prevent any similar lapses - and find out where the calls
came from. If caught, the culprit could face up to 5 years in jail.

&lt;End

The usual RISKS apply, plus the risk of a panic replacement of the e-mail
system. How do you know that the replacement is more secure...at least you
know the strengths and weaknesses of the old one, and could probably patch
it.

The other significant RISK is that of determining the location and identity
of the hacker. Speaking as an 'ex Cambridge man' I know the physical layout
and and structure of some of their systems. Until about 4 years ago I could
have walked into one of several sites and access the system. In the early
80s (ah, lost youth), several of my friends would use the Engineering Dept
terminals for all-night MUD sessions over JANET. I only say 'until recently'
because I have moved 100 miles away. The same RISK must apply to almost any
academic site, but somewhere like Cambridge, where the 'Town and Gown' are
inextricably linked, with University and College buildings spread right
across the city, make security a nightmare to enforce.

Under IRIX 5.3 (and perhaps other Unix variants), if someone 'chmod's a file
or directory to allow world access but to deny group access (i.e., 705),
then members of the user's group can't access the file.  I don't know why
this should be, but assuming it makes sense, I've found a way around it,
even though I only belong to one group and can't 'newgrp': I made a symbolic
link to the file and put it in my web directory.  Many 'httpd's (including
the one here) allow sym links to files/ directories outside the user's web
directory, and many httpd runs as user nobody or guest.  Presto!  Access to
the Mail directory of a friend who thought he was being quite clever.  Of
course, I immediately showed him what I had done, and warned him to use 700,
but I didn't have to. . .

[I suppose the only new risk here is that a court is seen to be believing
some rather flimsy evidence.]

`The Electronic Telegraph' [Web Edition of Major UK Newspaper],
by Robert Uhlig, 1 May 1996

In a ground-breaking case, lawyers have used the Net to enforce a British
court order overseas.

THE INTERNET has for the first time been used to serve a legal injunction
outside the UK, arguably establishing a precedent allowing the global
computer network to be used as a medium for distributing legal documents, in
the same manner as a fax machine.  The development could also spell an end
to the freedom of speech enjoyed in hundreds of specialist news groups on
the Internet, where users discuss a wide spectrum of matters ranging from
the complexities of rival computer operating systems to libellous
speculation on celebrities' sexual practices.

The media and entertainment law firm Schilling and Lom in London received
threats, via e-mail, from an individual in Europe who claimed he was
planning to disseminate libellous material about one of its clients over the
Internet.  "The e-mail contained the sender's two Internet addresses," said
Jonathan Coad, a libel partner at the firm.  "When an injunction was
obtained against him, we persuaded Mr Justice Newman to grant us leave ex
parte to serve an order via these e-mail addresses.  "We have to prove that
the defendant received the injunction, and used the 'return receipt'
capability of e-mail to prove that the defendant had seen the injunction on
his computer screen."  Mr Coad added that the defendant also acknowledged
separately that he had received the injunction.

[...another lawyer] pointed out that there was still doubt over which
nation's laws applied if someone made a libellous statement on a global
medium such as the Internet.  "Courts will have to move with the times and
there are a number of modern judges who are willing to make the move," he
said.

I just received e-mail with a header line I have never seen before,

&gt; X-Image-Url: <A HREF="ftp://ftp.somewhere.else/pub/images/face.tiff">ftp://ftp.somewhere.else/pub/images/face.tiff</A>

It appears to replace the 'X-Face' header as the URL was an image of the
sender's face.

The risks are similar to those of web browsers, but ones I hadn't
expected from an e-mail message.  Two are:

1) If the URL is accessed when I read my mail, by looking at the server
logs the sender knows many things, including when I read my mail and the
machine I use to do so.

Imagine if mail handled by an anonymous remailer did not strip out this
header.  The (supposedly) anonymous receiver checks e-mail, the mail reader
contacts the originator's site, and the sender knows at least the machine
the recipient uses, and probably has a good guess as to the identity.

2) Inappropriately designed mail readers might not offer a "Stop" button
to stop the transfer of large images.  If the mail message proper is
displayed after the image is downloaded, it might take a long time to
transfer the image, while the mail itself is just a few lines longs.

I was going to discuss this privately with the poster (basically, although
it is to some extent a valid point, the practice of assuming fixed-spacing
fonts for news - so that, for example, ^s come out right - is quite
widespread); however, I noticed where I would be sending it. I suspect this
is an address which works well internally, but would fail if I tried to use
it.

I'm sure it is an old RISK, but obviously still needs mentioning! {The
software I use at home [Turnpike] won't allow me to send to an address
without an @ sign, and at least one dot after it, which must be both
preceded and followed by at least one character, which would have stopped me
sending the reply - but of course doesn't help anyone actually wanting to
contact Andy.  [Perhaps that was the intention (-:!]}

at how many e-mail messages I cannot answer for this reason!  PGN]

[Plus, there are now more cases where there are large internal networks,
so people may be increasingly under the impression that it does work (as
they may spend some time e-mailing internally before venturing into the
big wide world outside, which maybe they didn't as much before).  JPG]

Last year I moved from Denmark to the United States, so I have just had the
"pleasure" of filing my tax returns in two countries.  This has made me
appreciate the efforts the Danish authorities have made in recent years to
make the process easier.  Basically, almost everything they need to know has
already been reported to the authorities by the employer(s), the bank etc.
Then they send you a tax return form with the relevant numbers printed on
them, and you are then supposed to check them, correct any wrong numbers
(unlikely) and add any info they do not have (more likely).

This year they have gone a step further: you can call a specific number and
use you touch tone phone to file, or you can file on the Web at
<A HREF="http://www.tastselv.toldskat.dk/">http://www.tastselv.toldskat.dk/</A> (in Danish).  To file you need your CPR
number (similar to the US social security number) and a 7-digit individual
security code printed on the form.  You can then fill out the form and
submit it.  If you make a mistake it can be corrected the same day, but if
you discover it later you have to contact the local tax authorities.  This
means that a manual override system is in place, IMHO a good thing.

I am not a lawyer, but there must be some legal RISKS here.  If I try to
cheat how are they going to prove that it was me?  And even if they know, is
filling a form on the Web has any legal value?  I don't sign anything, can
typing a code that presumably only I know be legally equivalent to signing a
document?

A more worrying RISK is that somebody actually do mess with other peoples
tax returns.  They don't use encrypted transfers, so sniffing the security
code should at least in theory be trivial.  It may be easier to get the code
by social engineering, especially if the victim has no experience with
computers and passwords ("Hello, it's the tax department.  Due to a computer
error some of our records have been lost, would you please tell us the
numbers printed on the front page of the tax return form we sent you?").

An even more scary situation is that someone actually breaks into the
machine running the web server.  The requirement that any corrections must
be made the same day may actually be an example of good risk management.  If
the info is transferred from the web server to another computer, and if that
other computer only accepts to amend a filed return on the same day the
original was filed, then the damage from a hacker will be limited to the
returns filed that day (although if that day is April 30, the last day to
file, the damage may still be considerable).

Finally, we should also consider the risk of typos.  Whom do you trust the
most to get the numbers right?  Yourself, who will be directly affected by
an error?  The OCR program "reading" your handwriting?  Or maybe the (tired)
clerk that has to manually type in the numbers on the forms where the
handwriting is too illegible?  This is (IMHO) a point in favor of the
type-it-yourself service.

A similar situation has occurred here in Western Australia.  New parents of
a baby boy were unable to give their child an ancestral name because of the
accents on some of the characters.  The name was not offensive or difficult
to pronounce.  The reason given was that the computer system of the Registry
of Births and Deaths could not accept the name because it was not a standard
ASCII character.

The solution was not as easy as removing the accents because that
substantially changes the pronunciation of the name.  The child remains
unnamed!

In <A HREF="/Risks/18.03.html">RISKS-18.03</A>, Rob Bailey writes that a human operator is an intrinsic part
of a system in which he or she operates.  Therefore, the human operator must
share the blame if the system fails.

This is true; Since the human is part of the system, the strengths and
weaknesses of the human must be taken into account in "good" system design,
just as must be done for any other system component.

In the original design of the manual typewriter, there was a problem with
the operator hitting the keys too fast; this caused mechanical jams.  The
problem was solved by the addition of the QWERTY keyboard encoding, which
slowed down the typist by alternating the key locations between his two
hands.  This is was an appropriate design for the human component, even if
it does not excuse us from still using QWERTY today.

We bristle when the media leaps to blame the operator; we must similarly
bristle if we leap to blame the machine.  The RISKS we seek are in the
combination of the two, when the interface with the machine confuses or
confounds the operator and encourages mistakes.

For example, an airplane that is willing to touch down without the landing
gear deployed is not necessarily a bad system design, since:

- the pilot has procedures to prevent this from happening, including
licensing to ensure that the pilot understands these procedures.

- the pilot may need to land the plane in this way in an emergency.

Conversely, an autopilot that automatically limits the pilots steering
requests to avoid damage to the airplane might indeed be a bad system
design.  The human component might correctly need to damage the airplane in
a sharp turn in order to save the lives of the passengers.

In the paragraph where I wrote:

&gt;I haven't explained the duplicate copies on the remote machine or why the
&gt;message was seen earlier, but this isn't necessary in order to convince me
&gt;that this "forgery" was really an accident.

the text should have read "why the message wasn't seen earlier."
^^^^^^

Since the mail program automatically opens windows holding unsent outgoing
mail when it is launched, the question was why the staff member did not see
the message the morning after it was written, when she fired up her computer
and launched the mail program.

There are lots of possible reasons: maybe she hadn't really shut down her
computer and didn't re-launch the mail program the next morning, or maybe
she simply didn't notice the mail message, or maybe the mail program didn't
open the window for some reason.

I jumped to the conclusion that perhaps the file's creation date had been
faked by resetting the Macintosh system clock, obviously failing to apply
Occam's razor to the various hypotheses. I'm confident that our moderator
can come up with an appropriate pun here, perhaps something about shooting
the mail-message(r) or a close shave that cuts both ways : )

CHILDREN ON THE INTERNET:  A FORUM FOR PARENTS AND EDUCATORS.
Saturday, May 18, 1996, 8:30 am-5:30 pm, at The John Marshall
Law School, 315 South Plymouth Court, Chicago, Illinois.

The purpose of The Forum is to explore the benefits of the Internet and
online services and to learn about risks as well, so that informed parents
and educators can cooperate with service providers so as to enjoy the
advantages of the Internet while avoiding the negatives.  Panelists will
demonstrate Internet resources available for children; will discuss the
potential for commercial manipulation of children, invasions of privacy,
access to objectionable materials, and other risks; and will suggest
appropriate roles and responsibilities of parents, educators, and
institutions in minimizing these risks.

The registration fee of $40 includes continental breakfast, lunch, and
conference materials.  Registration deadline: May 13, 1996.  Space is
limited.

For more information, call the Center for Informatics Law at (312) 987-1419,

PRIVACY DIGESTS:

* The PRIVACY Forum is run by Lauren Weinstein, with some support from the
ACM Committee on Computers and Public Policy.  He manages it as a rather
selectively moderated digest, somewhat akin to RISKS; it spans the full
range of both technological and non-technological privacy-related issues
(with an emphasis on the former).  For information regarding the PRIVACY
Forum, please send the exact line:

information privacy

as the first text in the BODY of a message to:

<A HREF="mailto:privacy-request@vortex.com">privacy-request@vortex.com</A>

You will receive a response from an automated listserv system.  To submit
contributions, send to "<A HREF="mailto:privacy@vortex.com">privacy@vortex.com</A>".

Information and materials relating to the PRIVACY Forum may also be
obtained from the PRIVACY Forum Archive via ftp to "ftp.vortex.com",
gopher at "gopher.vortex.com", and World Wide Web via:
"<A HREF="http://www.vortex.com">http://www.vortex.com</A>".  Full keyword searching of the PRIVACY
Forum Archive is available through the World Wide Web access address.

* The Computer PRIVACY Digest (CPD) (formerly the Telecom Privacy digest) is
run by Leonard P. Levine.  It is gatewayed to the USENET newsgroup
comp.society.privacy.  It is a relatively open (i.e., less tightly moderated)
forum, and was established to provide a forum for discussion on the
effect of technology on privacy.  All too often technology is way ahead of
the law and society as it presents us with new devices and applications.
Technology can enhance and detract from privacy.  Submissions should go to
<A HREF="mailto:comp-privacy@uwm.edu">comp-privacy@uwm.edu</A> and administrative requests to
<A HREF="mailto:comp-privacy-request@uwm.edu">comp-privacy-request@uwm.edu</A>.

On December 20, 1995, American Airlines flight 965 (AA965), a B757-223
serial number N651AA, crashed into mountains on approach to Cali, Colombia.
This was the first B757 fatal accident in a decade and a half of service,
and I believe the first jet accident for AA in about the same length of time.

On February 6, 1996, a B757 of Birgenair, registration TC-GEN, crashed
into the ocean off Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic, shortly after takeoff.
This was the second fatal B757 accident.

The US National Transportation Safety Board is `participating fully' in each
of the investigations. Statements and documents concerning the accidents
released by the Columbian and Dominican Republic agencies are available from
the NTSB. Statements on Cali were released on 28 Dec 1995 and Feb 15 1996,
and the `docket' (containing the factual reports of the `specialty groups'
of investigators) has been released recently. Statements on the Puerto Plata
accident were released Feb 7, Mar 1 and Mar 18 1996.  Final reports for
neither are yet available.

Contrary to the impression given by some recent articles in the
non-specialist press, neither findings nor causes nor causal factors have
yet been officially determined in either investigation. However, the factual
reports so far indicate to me that the human-computer interface could be
involved in both accident sequences.  These airplanes have a safety record
amongst the best of any type in regular airline use - many B757 and B767
aircraft have been flying for a decade and a half in the fleets of airlines
all over the world, and there have only been three fatal accidents (the
first, to a Lauda Air B767, is thought to have been due to an unrecoverable
technical failure alone).  After 16 years of exemplary safe use, one should
therefore not be too hasty to `blame the computer' or its interface.  Here
are some comments on both accidents.

Cali:

Happened on approach to the airport, which is aligned along a relatively
narrow valley with high mountains to either side. Because of benign weather
conditions, the pilots were offered a `straight in' approach (to land in the
direction they were flying) rather than to fly beyond, turn, and land in the
opposite direction (the more usual procedure). They were not familiar with
the `new' approach. During the approach procedures, the pilots were confused
about exactly where they were in relation to the arrival procedure charts.
They had passed a specific radio beacon (VOR) called Tulua, which is the
start of the arrival procedure. It seems that they were not aware that they
had done so, entered this fix into the Flight Management Computer (FMC), and
didn't immediately notice that the aircraft had begun to turn back to the
Tulua VOR. This turn began a quick sequence of events that led to impact
with a mountain (a CFIT, Controlled Flight Into Terrain accident) about
3,000ft below the summit. A Ground Proximity Warning System warning sounded
about 9 seconds before impact, initiated recovery procedures (full power,
maximum angle of climb, retract any draggy control surfaces that are
deployed).  The crew didn't retract the speed brakes (manually controlled),
which is a necessary part of the escape procedure.

The actual manoeuvers that led to impact were that of turning towards
a specified VOR, and turning towards a specified heading. Both were
initiated by the crew. The former was apparently accomplished with the
FMS, the latter with the autopilot.  Small airplanes such as my Piper
Archer have autopilots capable of such manoeuvers. The pilot flying
must command either, as happened at Cali. However, the more
sophisticated FMC requires more attention than a simple autopilot when
entering fixes, and investigators are paying attention to the role the
FMC-pilot interaction played.

The question that arises is what exactly played a causal role. There is a
known HCI phenomenon that when something is `not right', it takes more time
and attention to `debug' the situation when more sophisticated devices are
involved than when simpler ones are being used.  However, there were also
other, human, procedural problems. The December 28 statement noted that
there was no indication of descent checklist procedures being performed by
the crew, and no indication of an arrival or approach procedures briefing.
Also, it is a basic rule of flying that you know where you are at all times.
These pilots didn't, at a crucial phase of flight, even though they had
reputations for conscientiousness (see the Operational Factors/Human
Performance factual report).

Their confusion may have been aided also by some of the pilot-controller
discourse about the route for which they were cleared. (However, there
was no evidence of `language difficulty', as this is usually understood.)

Puerto Plata:

The captain's airspeed indicator (ASI) was observed to be failed on takeoff.
This is not an event that requires emergency handling.  The captain asked
the copilot to call out the significant airspeeds for takeoff (called V1 and
V2, also normal procedure) and took off as normal.  He then called for the
center autopilot to be switched on. His own airspeed indicator showed higher
and higher airspeeds as the aircraft climbed, even though the actual
airspeed of the aircraft (as recorded by ground radar) was much lower. The
first officer observed that his ASI showed marked decrease in airspeed, and
the pilots became confused over which ASIs were failed (the captain thought
at one point that they'd both failed). The aircraft apparently stalled and
the pilots did not succeed in recovering before hitting the ocean.

The DR/NTSB factual statement noted that the behavior of the aircraft was
consistent with the captain's pitot being blocked. The airplane had been
sitting on the ground for many days in the tropics without the pitots being
covered (there is no procedural requirement for this, but pilots and
mechanics all know that insects love pitots).  The pitot is a tube facing
into the airstream receiving air pressure facing in the direction of flight,
and a related static port receives (roughly) ambient air pressure. The
difference between the two is used to drive the ASIs in all aircraft. If the
pitot is blocked, then pitot pressure remains roughly constant and ambient
air pressure decreases as the aircraft climbs, leading to greater difference
between pitot pressure and static pressure, and thus to greater `indicated'
airspeed on the ASI.

The copilot has a separate pitot-static system. The pitot-static readings on
the B757 are fed into the left (for the captain's system) and right (for the
copilot's) Air Data Computers, and thence to the CRT display instruments for
the respective positions.  There is a third pitot-static system that is
purely mechanical (and therefore `traditional'). Normally, pilots of all
airplanes are also trained to use `alternative source' if a pitot-static
system fails. `Alternative source' on the B757 is to switch the displays so
that the captain's ASI reads from the right ADC and the first officer's from
the left ADC. Also, the `glass' ASIs should be checked against the
mechanical `backup'. There is no evidence that either `alternate source' was
used during the accident flight, or that either instrument was checked
against the backup, even when the captain falsely thought that both his and
the first officer's ASIs had failed.

David Learmount asserted in Flight International (27 Mar - 2 April) that the
central autopilot gets its data from `the' ADC. He must have meant to say
from the *left* (captain's) ADC. Supposing this is the case, the autopilot
would react to the (false) increasing airspeed indication by raising the
nose, to attempt to reduce `airspeed'.  Continuing to do so, since the false
`airspeed' continued to increase with increasing altitude, the airplane
would radically lose (real) airspeed, and eventually stall, which appears to
be what happened.  I have not yet been able to verify Learmount's (modified)
assertion with the NTSB or Boeing engineers. The question arises, why would
the captain switch on the center autopilot if his ASI had failed and he knew
it got its data from the same ADC?  Anecdotal information (a colleague with
access to a B757 operations manual, another who is a B757 pilot) suggests
that this might not be information that one could expect to be at the front
of every B757 pilot's mind.  These two situations (center AP gets data from
left ADC; this information not in the mental foreground when dealing with
ASI problems) may thus have played a causal role in the accident. (I
emphasise again that I have not yet confirmed either situation.) This could
be categorised as an HCI issue.  As at Cali, there were other apparent
procedural failures: failure to switch to `alternate source'; failure to
check against the standby mechanical instrument. Performance of either would
have avoided the accident: as Learmount says, the pilots lost control of a
flyable airplane.

Further Commentary:

Maybe one can see in these accidents two known and often-observed HCI
effects of automation, which I shall call Complacency and Complexity.  The
Complacency effect is that use of (normally reliable) automation can lead to
reduced awareness of the state of the system.  The Complexity effect is that
increased automation makes some straightforward tasks more complex and
interdependent. The effects are distinct, but both have the consequence that
it becomes harder to figure out what's going on when something is wrong. As
a discussion point, let me propose that the greater role at Cali seems to
have been played by the Complacency effect, with some Complexity effect; and
that at Puerto Plata by the Complexity effect alone.  For the answers, we'll
have to wait until the final reports.

Finally, I don't regard either accident as giving grounds for concern about
the role of automation in itself. But the reports might yield insights into
and improvements to the procedures for dealing with certain forms of
automation. One always hopes to learn from the tragedies.

The text of the official statements referred to above, as well as other
pertinent documents, may be found in the sections on these accidents in the

* Cutting: "Sunday Mail (Brisbane)", Sunday, the 14th April 1996, page 12:

A Brisbane bloke was stunned to discover on his latest phone bill an amount
of nearly $900 for a call of more than 10 hours duration to the Solomon
Islands.  The bloke _does_ occasionally call the Solomons and _does_ admit
to being a bit of a yakker [talk the doors off a barn].  But for 10 hours?
Query with Telstra [read as Bell Australia] brought the testy advice that he
must have forgotten to hang up his receiver.  The bloke pointed out that
this theory was flawed by Telstra's own bill that showed that he'd used the
same phone to call Melbourne (Australia) only 11 minutes after the start of
the call to the Solomons.

Letter-to-the-editor of *The New York Times* Magazine section, 5 May 1996,
quoted in full:

&gt; James Gleick's 'manual Labor' (Fast Forward, April 7) touched a
&gt; long-tender sore spot with me.  For example, the manual that came
&gt; with a car I bought not long ago contained no fewer than 31 Cautions,
&gt; 32 Warnings, 28 Do Nots and 2 Nevers.  (I never did discover the
&gt; difference between a Do Not and a Never).  My favorite was this:
&gt; `Do not open sun roof when car is covered with snow.'
&gt; Robert L. Wolke,  Pittsburgh"

So much stuff to remember, but so few reasons.  Wouldn't it be a lot easier
to remember (or forever dismiss) such advisories if we knew the reasons, and
had a structure to hang them on?  Suppose I'm wedged between two trucks, the
car is on fire, but there's still some snow on the roof.  Should I try to
get out through the sun roof?  Do I risk only the obvious (some snow down my
neck) -- or a death worse than by fire?  Maybe best to wait til the snow has
melted and hope that by then I'm not already fried?  After all, if they've
taken such pains to tell me something, then more than the obvious risk must
be involved -- because if it were only the obvious, it wouldn't need to have
been stated, right?

I heard on the radio today that a state legislator wondered why she was
getting literature aimed at single parents. Investigating, she discovered
that the state didn't record the marital status on birth records.  Instead,
they assumed that if the parents' last names were not the same, they were
both single!

And these are the kind of "statistics" on which we base public policy!

In thinking about the 30% of the California mothers who are thereby
supposedly single, I realize that the issue is deeper than bad methodology;
it is the reason why such numbers become important.  Much public policy is
driven by numbers.  The CPI (Consumer Price Index) is a more pervasive
example.  It reflects something or another but what is less important than
that there be a way to keep score.

Lest we blame the government, remember how much business policy is also "by
the numbers" -- numbers that aren't necessarily accurate.  In one case a
very large company assigned a programmer to assure consistency in the
numbers they had gathered from the field, which were the basis for billions
of dollars of corporate decision making.  He discovered that after
attempting to clean up the data that it was essentially pure noise by the
time it was massaged.

More obvious and more explicit are the "sweep" numbers used by television
stations.  Someone more involved in the specifics should provide the details
but apparently the advertising rates are set by tallying the viewing during
designated weeks.  The problem is that everyone knows which weeks they are
and therefore create special shows to cook the numbers.  Is there a better
system??  Perhaps not.

This is, of course, a risk of technology in that we have much better tools
to gather numbers than we did in the past.  But we also need some agreed to
rules even if they are perverse.  Interestingly, these numbers might assure
some degree of fairness by being so noisy that it is hard to predict their
outcome using inside knowledge.  But, maybe I'm just getting too cynical. Or
pragmatic?

Much as I dislike statistics about ``computer crimes'', this might at least
be worth noting for the RISKS archives.

Jon Swartz, writing in the *San Francisco Chronicle*, 7 May 1996, p. C1,
summarized the conclusions of a survey just released by the Computer
Security Institute and the FBI's International Computer Crime Squad.  41% of
the respondents admitted to electronic intrusions or unauthorized probes of
their systems by disgruntled employees or competitors in the past year, and
roughly half of those involved insiders.  The Internet has become a "prime
source" of such activities.  20% said they did not know whether they had
been invaded; and nearly 75% of those said they would not report incidents
because of fear of negative publicity.  Medical and financial institutions
were particularly prone to data manipulations.  (There were 428 respondents
out of almost 5000 queried.)

One of the biggest problems in justifying the need for computer security has
always been that many organizations and individuals appear not to have been
compromised.  The 75% figure is perhaps the most interesting.

This morning, I started to receive e-mails accusing me of forcing a Swedish
band called Ace of Base to leave Sweden for ever. The e-mails continue to
arrive - some are very abusive. I have never heard of Ace of Base! (AoB)

Some detective work later, I discover the story: Scandinavian Airlines (SAS)
have reviewed Ace of Base in their in-flight magazine (apparently) and said
that they prove that musical ability is not a requirement for Swedish bands
(I paraphrase).

An AoB fan has produced a Web page
(<A HREF="http://www.ultranet.com/~wurther/opmdv.htm">http://www.ultranet.com/~wurther/opmdv.htm</A>) that gives the story and
invites readers to send their views by e-mail to a "senior SAS official"; he
then gives *my* e-mail address!

Why does he do this? I'm guessing, but an Altavista search for my e-mail

I've mailed him and his webmaster, so far with no effect.

Another two risks demonstrated here are:

Summarisation of technical information by people who do not understand it
- a reporter in this case, but the risk probably applies elsewhere

Believing what newspapers print.

The story printed in the newspaper bears only a passing resemblance to the
real incident. What actually happened was that a packet sniffer was found
running on a machine on the subnet that connects the central Unix service,
mail server, and so on.  Everyone who uses these systems was required to
change passwords.  The e-mail system has not been replaced, and I've no idea
how this detail got into the article.

I don't know about any public announcement, but in Richard Feynman's "What
do you care what other people think?" there is an extended account of his
part in the investigation of the Challenger disaster, including quite a lot
about the odds quoted within NASA for various kinds of failure, and their
(often tenuous) relation to reality.

I'm afraid I don't remember any of the figures, but they were wildly
overoptimistic. One interesting thing was that when Feynman talked to the
engineers who actually worked on the shuttle components, they gave pretty
good estimates for things; but somehow, as information propagated up the
management structure, it got fudged. (Cf. the entry in the Jargon File under
"SNAFU principle".)

I have Volume I of the Report of the Presidential Commission on the Space
Shuttle Challenger Accident (U.S.  Gov't Printing Office, June 6th, 1986).
There are 5 volumes; Volume I is the summary and has 256 pages.  It is
well-written, easy-to-read, and remarkably free of technobabble.  Any large
library should have it; some of it is also online at &lt;A
HREF="<A HREF="http://www.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/missions/51-l/docs/">http://www.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/missions/51-l/docs/</A>
rogers-commission/table-of-contents.html"&gt;Rogers Commission Report &lt;/A&gt;.

Nowhere in this volume could I find a reference to the numerical odds
of a shuttle accident.  There are many statements that recognize that
there are risks that cannot be totally eliminated.  Conceivably, there
might be a calculation of the odds in one of the other volumes of the
report.  According to &lt;A HREF="<A HREF="http://spacelink.msfc.nasa.gov/">http://spacelink.msfc.nasa.gov/</A>
NASA.Projects/Human.Space.Flight/Shuttle/Shuttle.Program.Changes.
Since.1986"&gt;NASA Press Release&lt;/A&gt; there has been 1 failure in 74
flights (thru January 1996), for a reliability of 0.986.  (I asked a
web index tool to find references to "odds of a space shuttle
accident" to find these documents.)

Personally, I believe that every practicing engineer, and every manager in
an engineering organization, should read this report regularly.  It is both
enlightening and sobering on the difficulties of building reliable, complex
systems in the real world.

The accident was caused by "known problems" in a faulty design.  The
attempted resolution of the problems was poorly executed and poorly managed.
Safety concerns were not escalated up the management chain.  Known problems
were dismissed as "still within limits".  Launch constraints were waived at
the expense of safety.  Management reversed the position of its own
engineers.  All of this came out at the time, but perhaps some people who
were not around at the time have not heard about it.  I urge everyone to
read it.

I have not seen that report, but in the late 1980's, when I was working on
Shuttle-derived launch vehicle studies, we did an in-house assessment
assuming the fixes post-Challenger were made correctly.  We got a figure of
1 in 70 per launch of losing an Orbiter, and 1 in 100 per launch in losing
the crew.  The difference in the two figures is because you can have a
landing that the crew can walk away from, but the landing was hard enough to
overstress the Orbiter structure, so that you have to write off the vehicle.

According to the 9 May 1996 *Washington Post*, most traffic lights in
downtown Washington D.C. went onto their weekend pattern (typical: 15
seconds of green per light), rather than their rush hour pattern (typical:
50 seconds of green per light).  This occurred during the Wednesday (8 May)
morning rush hour.  The problem was reportedly caused by a new version of
software installed in the central system that controls all of the traffic
lights, providing timing (so lights turn green in sequence).  The result was
mile-long traffic jams.  One woman reported that her 35-minute commute
turned into 75 minutes, due to the overloaded streets.

By the afternoon rush hour, the software glitch had been "fixed".  It wasn't
clear whether that meant they reloaded the old software or fixed the bug.

Some might consider this a risk of computer controlled systems, and others
might consider it a substantial increase in the nation's productivity: think
of all the lawyers and congresscritters who couldn't get to work!

I thought this might be of interest not so much because it made a big splash
in the news recently here in the Phoenix area (both print and broadcast
media), but mainly because it brings back memories of the days when the
phrase "computer error" caught up with and overtook "dog ate my homework".
((When was that, some time in the 60's?))

THOUSANDS OF US West customers recently got an unpleasant surprise on
their telephone bills: an erroneous $5 charge for switching to new
long-distance carriers for certain in-state long-distance calls. The
billing mistakes were due to a computer error.

As I reactivated the Windows screensaver this morning after having turned it
off while ago, I suddenly realized that there is a problem with the way
Windows95 handles the reactivation.  Here is a scenario for what can happen:

The user--
1) Sets a password in any Windows95 screen saver.
2) Disables the screen saver for a while.
3) Forgets Windows95 screen-saver password.
4) Forgets that there even _was_ a password on your Windows95 screen saver.
5) Reactivates Windows95 screen saver.

The user has now reactivated the old, forgotten password and will be locked
out (at least temporarily) of Windows95 files) as soon as the user selects
the OK key.

Moral #1: Any software which allows a passworded function to be deactivated
and then reactivated should require that the password be verified before
allowing reactivation.

Moral #2: Before deactivating your Windows95 screen saver for an extended
period, disable the password.

An alternative: to have much the same effect as disabling the Windows95
screen saver, set its delay period to a longer time that is unlikely to
bother you during your normal work cycle (e.g., 15 minutes) rather than
disabling it altogether.

&gt;&gt; 1) Use PGP.
&gt;
&gt;This does not help.  What if the output of PGP encryption innocently
&gt;contains the byte sequence 0x63 0x75 0x6E 0x74?  Being gibberish, you didn't
&gt;check - but the computer may, and censor it.  There are similar problems
&gt;with uuencode, rot13, etc.  Sigh!

There is a public domain computer program known as "figlet."  What it
does is turn text into large letters made of ASCII characters,
.__  .__ __              __  .__    .__
|  | |__|  | __ ____   _/  |_|  |__ |__| ______
|  | |  |  |/ // __ \  \   __\  |  \|  |/  ___/
|  |_|  |    &lt;\  ___/   |  | |   Y  \  |\___ \
|____/__|__|_ \\___  &gt;  |__| |___|  /__/____  &gt; /\
\/    \/             \/        \/  \/
Normally, figlet is used only for aesthetic reasons, but certainly one
sees its potential for bypassing "decency filters."  Figlet fonts range
from the huge to the relatively tiny, and it is quite easy to see that a
figletized message will not contain any potentially indecent random strings.
Yet more proof that brute regular-expression searching is an ineffective
method of weeding out indecent speech.

Of course, aside from the obvious disadvantages of using big, tacky
letters, there is the problem that enough people writing in figlet will
alienate anyone whose online service software uses a proportional font.  I'm
not sure offhand if AOL's interface still does, but a couple years ago
some people on the anti-aol group "alt.aol-sucks" actually advocated piping
articles through figlet for just this reason!

I didn't want to get involved in the thread that involved NASA's
pre-Challenger risk estimates, but it's probably better to set the record
straight.  (The reason for reluctance is that people who think of risk as a
single probability are usually going to misuse the number they find,
whatever it is. There is more to risk than a probability. Especially when
that number has an uncertainty of more than a factor of ten.)

In the glory days of Apollo NASA had pretty good risk estimates available
(by the standards of those times), but tended to suppress them for reasons
like the one mentioned above. If you say that the risk of failure is one in
a hundred, give or take a factor of ten, your decision is likely to be
different for a chance in ten and for a chance in a thousand, so the people
who made the decisions found that the risk estimates didn't help them much.
And they didn't care about the social and scientific benefits of actually
knowing something.  (That's a pattern throughout the risk business, that
people cling to bottom-line numbers as if they were gospel, either not
caring about uncertainties or not understanding them.)

Anyway, NASA lost interest in risk analysis, but there were still a few
competent people toiling away and making the estimates. By the time of
Challenger there were decent (within a factor of ten or so) estimates
available at NASA HQ, but the upper management treated them like the
Apocrypha. And the attitude spread (largely because of the beneficial
politics) that space travel was now "safe," leading to the mindset that
Feynman found in the engineers he talked to after the accident. They really
believed (in part because they didn't understand probability) that risks of
a chance in 100,000 were about right, despite all the evidence in the world
that that was a fantasy.  (I also interviewed lots of NASA people after the
accident, and found the same syndrome.)

Through it all, there were people at HQ who had pretty good analysis.  There
were also lots of little things (like the hydrazine fire potential) in which
risk analysis revealed a hazard that top management talked its way around.
(Just a few months ago we found NASA management redefining the risk criteria
just to avoid holding up a launch---that's the sort of thing that led
directly to Challenger.)  People who spoke about risk at HQ were treated as
if they had leprosy (I tell you that from personal experience.) And out in
the field, people took their cues from HQ. I personally asked Jim Fletcher
(twice Administrator of NASA, including the period after the accident) to go
public with risk estimates, and he always said he'd consider it. You can't
sell that kind of promise for much in Washington.

Finally, after Jim had left NASA, he was asked at some public meeting what
the risk of a disaster was, and he actually answered. He said a chance in
seventy-two. There was indeed such a number available in an internal NASA
report, but with the usual admonition of real experts that it's probably
good to around a factor of ten. The author of that report, who is indeed a
real expert, was horrified that the bottom line had been mentioned without
the uncertainty. The same old reason---people will believe it to be TRUE,
and bad decisions will be made.

So this is a case in which, as Alexander Pope would have said, a little
knowledge is a dangerous thing. Some well-meaning people at NASA disliked
bottom lines because they were of little help in making the necessary
bottom-line decisions, while many of the engineers simply didn't understand
risk at all. Whenever anyone says that something is "safe' or "unsafe," they
don't understand risk. Through it all, decent analyses did exist, and were
available to, but ignored by, all the top management. It's still that way.

My judgment, not based on access to any recent analysis, is that the
probability of a disaster hasn't changed a great deal in recent years, but
that NASA management's complacency grows with each launch that is free of
disaster. Since the laws of probability never sleep, but people do, the
outcome is predictable. I once asked an astronaut (in connection with a
proposed change) whether he'd be willing to fly on top of that thing. His
answer (loosely quoted) was "Sure, because I'm an intrepid sort, but I
wouldn't want my best friends on the same flight." It's as wrong to let risk
paralyze you as it is to underestimate it. And it's a scam on the citizenry
to quote risk in terms of a single probability number. To say nothing of the
astronauts, who are a pretty good bunch. As Clint Eastwood would have said
if Dirty Harry had been an author, read my book.

&gt;I have Volume I of the Report of the Presidential Commission on the Space
&gt;Shuttle Challenger Accident (U.S.  Gov't Printing Office, June 6th, 1986).
&gt;Nowhere in this volume could I find a reference to the numerical odds
&gt;of a shuttle accident.

In Volume II of "Technical Report on Preliminary Risk Assessment for Nuclear
Waste Disposal in Space", (E.E.Rice, NASA CR 162029, 2/28/82) there is a
discussion of Shuttle failure probability from early in the Shuttle flight
era.  On P. 57, under "Standard (SRB) Space Shuttle":

"NASA does not publish or have in its possession 'official' reliability or
failure rate data for the space shuttle.... Plans are to continuously
upgrade problem areas as they are encountered on flights.  The failure rates
for the Shuttle are actually corollaries to ALARA (As Low As Reasonably
Achievable, as in nuclear radiation risk)"

So there was no "official" reliability estimate.  But the very next
paragraph says:

"Because of a NASA need to evaluate whether or not a destruct system on the
Shuttle during the early portion of the flight is worthwhile, NASA
contracted with Wiggins Company, Redondo Beach, CA, to perform a study
involving the hazards to the public of a failing Shuttle (Baeker, 1981).
Another Wiggins study (Hudson, 1979) has also been conducted for the later
portions of the flight profile to evaluate hazards when flying nuclear
payloads (e.g., Galileo).  The failure rates developed in these studies were
based upon data developed for hardware in WASH-1400 (US NRC, 1975) and upon
NASA committee reliability estimates for the SRB.  The analysis was
accomplished for only single-point failure modes, as have been identified in
[various NASA and Rockwell references].  The Wiggins data also includes
changes/modifications to failure rates resulting from an in-depth review by
NASA Space Shuttle engineers...."

There's a summary table of results from the Wiggins study, which I won't
reproduce in full, but a few of the entries are:

Failure mode                    Failure rates
mean            lower           upper
1. Tipover on pad               3.3E-5          1.6E-5          6.0E-5
2. Loss of control and Tumble           2.0E-3 to 2.0E-4
...
5. Corkscrew motion from
SRB TVC failure         4.2E-7          2.3E-7          7.4E-7
6. Ext. Tank Punctured
Liftoff to Staging      2.0E-7          8.4E-8          4.6E-7
...and so on

The dominant failure mode is Loss of Control and Tumble, at 1-in-500, which
has a footnote: "Engineering Judgement from NASA for man-rated solid
propellant boosters."

Interestingly, there's a second set of data for a modified Shuttle with
liquid-fuel boosters, for which the highest failure probability is Liquid
Booster Recontact at Separation, 1.3E-5.  So a Shuttle with liquid boosters
was estimated to be about 15 to 150 times safer than one with solids.

The appendix to this report has much more detailed breakdown of the risk
analysis, for the Shuttle itself and for other potential failure modes for
nuclear waste disposal.

Summary: "We ask all French ISPs and administrators of University networks
to close access to all Usenet newsgroups, such that no longer will even one
single Newsgroup will be accessible from French territory, at least until
French ISPs have a clear legal position within France."

&gt; Depuis 48h00 les deux dirigeants des societes FranceNet et WorldNet sont
en garde a vue pour avoir simplement fait leur metier consistant a fournir
l'acces a l'Internet...

Since about 48 hours, two directors of French companies, "FranceNet" and
"WorldNet" are &lt;translation?&gt; for having simply done their job, consisting
of providing access to the Internet...

&gt; En effet, la Section de Recherches de Paris de la gendarmerie Nationale a
procede lundi a leurs arrestations et a la saisie de leurs materiels, pour
avoir diffuse au travers des Newsgroups des images pedophiles.  Ces
Newsgroups et les images qu'ils abritent, sont tous produits a l'etranger et
rapatries comme le font la plupart des fournisseurs d'acces fran=C1ais via
les serveurs de News de Transpac, filiale de France Telecom.

The Research Section in Paris of the National Gendarmes started on Monday
their arrests and seizures of equipment, for having distributed pedophile
images through the Usenet newsgroups.  These Newsgroups and the images they
contained (?) are all originated abroad and brought into France as is done
by the majority of French access providers via the News servers of Transpac,
which is a subsidiary of France Telecom.

&gt; Alors que la justice, dans une affaire similaire mais liee cette fois a
des contenus racistes ou revisionnistes presents sur l'internet, ne s'est
pas encore prononces a l'encontre de neuf fournisseurs d'acces, alors que le
ministere des Postes et des Telecommunication, au travers de son ministre
Fran=C1ois Fillon assurait encore recemment qu'en aucun cas les fournisseurs
d'acces ne pouvaient =CDtre tenus pour responsables des contenus qu'ils ne
produisaient pas et qui circulaient sur l'internet, alors que le
lieutenant-colonel Browne, commandant la SR de Paris, reconnait lui meme que
les serveurs en question recevaient, stockaient et distribuaient (tout comme
Transpac) mais ne produisaient pas ces Newsgroups, deux hommes, deux chefs
d'entreprises sont aujourd'hui en prison simplement parce que les autorites
n'ont toujours rien compris a l'Internet et a son fonctionnement.

The [French] courts, in a similar case but this time based on racist or
revisionist contents present on the Internet, have not yet passed their
judgement regarding nine ISPs, although the Ministry of Post and
Telecommunications, through its minister Francois Fillon, stated again
recently that in no case can access providers be held responsible for
content that they do not produce and which circulates via the Internet, and
although Lieutenant-Colonel Browne, commander of the Research Section in
Pairs, admitted himself that the servers in question receive, store, and
distribute (the same as Transpac), but do not produce these Newsgroups, two
men, two company directors, are today in prison simply because the
authorities still haven't understood anything about the Internet and its
functioning.

&gt;La plupart des providers rapatrient de 6 a 8 000 Newsgroups chaque jour,
soit plusieurs centaines de milliers de messages, pouvant egalement contenir
des images. Parmi ces messages ils y a incontestablement des contenus
contraire a la loi fran=C1aise (sans doute moins de 5%), tout comme il peut
en circuler par la poste, ou dans les soutes a bagage d'Air France.  Il est
materiellement impossible pour un provider de controler l'ensemble du
contenu des messages des Newsgroups, il lui est eventuellement possible de
supprimer l'acces a ceux dont le titre est de fa=C1on evidente contraire a
la loi (ex.alt.binaries.pedophilia...), ce qui n'empechera pas le lendemain
de voir surgir un nouvel intitule pour remplacer le Newsgroup censure.
Depuis plusieurs mois deja les membres de l'AFPI (Association des
Professionnels de l'Internet) dont FranceNet est l'un des fondateurs, ont
spontanement decide de supprimer l'acces a une vingtaine de Newsgroups dont
le simple libelle ne laissait aucun doute quant au caractere illegal de
leurs contenus.

The majority of providers import from six to eight thousand Newsgroups each
day, therefore several hundred thousand messages, any of which could also
contain images.  Among these messages there are incontestably some contents
which are contrary to French law (no doubt less than 5%), just as they could
circulate through the mails, or in the baggage holds of Air France.  It is
materially impossible for a provider to check the contents of all Newsgroup
messages; it is possible to block access to those whose title is clearly
contrary to the law (e.g. alt.binaries.pedophilia...), which wouldn't
prevent the following day to see a new group appear to replace the censored
one.  Since several months already, the members of the AFPI (Association of
Internet Professionals), of which FranceNet is one of the founders, have
spontaneously decided to suppress the access of about twenty Newsgroups
whose title left no doubt as to the illegal character of their contents.

&gt; Aujourd'hui ce sont les Newsgroups qui sont vises, demain ce sera sans
doute le tour du Web. Si les fournisseurs d'acces, qui nous ne le
repeterons jamais assez, ne sont que de simples transporteurs facilitant
l'acces a un reseau, peuvent =CDtre emprisonnes, avec comme simple piece a
conviction un contenu produit au Canada ou en Australie, nous allons
assister purement et simplement a la mort de l'internet en France.

Today it is the Newsgroups which are wiped out, tomorrow it will be
doubtless the Web's turn.  If access providers, which we can never emphasize
enough, are but the simple transporters facilitating access to a network,
can be imprisoned, due to the singular cause of an item produced in Canada
or in Australia, we are going to see, purely and simply, the death of the
Internet in France.

&gt;En signe d'indignation, de protestation et de solidarite envers nos
confreres =46ranceNet et Worldnet, le fournisseur d'acces ImagiNet,
egalement membre fondateur de l'AFPI, a decide de fermer purement et
simplement l'acces a tous les Newsgroups. Nous demandons a l'ensemble des
providers fran=C1ais et des administrateurs des reseaux d'universites d'en
faire autant afin que plus un seul Newsgroup ne soit accessible du
territoire fran=C1ais, du moins tant que les fournisseurs d'acces n'auront
pas en France un statut clair.

As a symbol of indignation, of protest, and of solidarity with our brothers at
=46ranceNet and WorldNet, the access provider ImagiNet, also a founding
member of the AFPI, has decided to purely and simply close access to all
newsgroups.  We ask all French ISPs and administrators of University
networks to do the same, such that no longer will as much as a single
Newsgroup will be accessible from =46rench territory, at least until access
providers in France have a clear legal status.

&gt;Nous esperons sincerement que cet appel sera suivit par l'ensemble des
prestataires de connexion internet.

We sincerely hope that this call will be followed by all Internet access
providers.

&gt;Nous nous excusons aupres de nos abonnes pour la gene ainsi occasionnee par

"Software Pirates Loot Silicon Valley;
Hong Kong street vendors hawk hot software"

An article by Jeff Pelline in the *San Francisco Chronicle*, 14 May 1996,
p. C1 aptly summarizes some of the basic problems of software piracy:

* Two CD-ROMs with more than 100 programs (Windows 95, Windows NT,
AutoCad, LotusNotes, Xing's Mpeg, ...) valued at $50,000 go for
$70 from a Hong Kong street vendor (pushing something that looked
like a hot-dog cart).  These items (and many conventional CDs as well)
come from pirate operations in southern China [apparently turning out
legitimate products when the "inspectors" are around for an hour or so,
and hot stuff the rest of the time -- on a 24-hour production schedule].

* Pirated software costs an estimated $12 billion annually worldwide.

* "More than half of all software in existence today is lost to piracy."

* An estimated 98% of the software sold in China is pirated -- to the
tune of 200 million copies a year; in Brazil it is 95%, in Russia 94%.
Korea is at 78%, Japan at 67%, the U.S. at 35%, according to a chart
attributed to Glenco Engineering, Inc.

[No one seems to mention the devious opportunity for
Trojan horses being added inside the pirate shrinkwrap.]

[If it's a floppy, it might be a copy.
If it's a disk, you're also at risk.
If it's a pirate, the vendors are irate.
To avoid such frustration,
try: Free Software Foundation.
(Not enough BurmaShavian literature anymore?)]

[Considering the volume and issue, this item must be an 18.12 OVERTURE.  PGN]

Just fire up Ye Olde Web Browser, and open the URL
[URL withheld by Moderator's Standards.  PGN].
It'll show you a curvacious, scantily-clad female member of our species, ask
you for your phone number (including area code), and then a female with a
sexy voice will call you right back and say, um, "things" (ahem), to you.
Yes, that's right, a call-back phone-sex system on the Web.

But of course, it doesn't take much imagination to realize you don't have to
type in *your* phone number.  How about your boss's?  Or his wife?  Or your
not-so-favourite right-wing member of parliament/congress?  This could be
one of the best ways to get 'net censorship going: have these sexy voices
call up a random, powerful right-wing politician.  This is just a variation
of the old "order a large pizza with all the toppings to the house across
the street" trick we loved to do as teenagers.  Except the risks are
potentially more dangerous.

<H3><A NAME="subj3.1">Morphing Character 217 in Macintosh Geneva Font</A></H3>
<ADDRESS>
Paul Robinson
&lt;<A HREF="mailto:paul@TDR.COM">paul@TDR.COM</A>&gt;
</ADDRESS>
<I>Mon, 13 May 1996 08:09:13 EDT</I><PRE>

I discovered an unexpected condition when attempting to do some printing of
a document created on the Macintosh, in that the character code using ASCII
217 in the Geneva font does not appear onscreen the same way depending on
what size it is.

I suspect this is an issue with other characters and character sets.  I know
there is a feature to select a certain character, usually a "box" to display
in place of characters not defined for a certain font, in order to show that
something is there, not merely either a blank or nothing at all.  Since I
would expect that to be consistent, that is acceptable, and in fact, much
more desirable behavior, e.g. if the character is undefined in a particular
character set, a square is printed, to show that the character is
unprintable (undefined) in that set.

But *this* behavior is both unexpected and undesirable.

What I discovered is that a character in a specific font on the Macintosh
can be "amorphic", in that it can be a different appearance depending on
whether it is printed or displayed on screen, and depending on what size it
is displayed at.  Now, I'm not talking about the difference between the
appearance of, for example, the letter "S" when shown onscreen and when
printed with a 9-pin dot-matrix printer and the appearance when printed with
a 300dpi laser or inkjet. No, I'm talking about selecting, say, an character
containing the image of a Star of David, and printing out a Hammer and
Sickle!

Some characters on some sets produce some interesting effects, including
such symbols as the entire Zodiac; various stars, both circled and squared,
white and black; arrows going in 8 directions, various other symbols such as
icons of telephones, scissors, greek and mathematical symbols, and many
others.

These symbols can be useful for various enhancements to a document.  For
example, one could print a coupon, and use the scissor symbol on the dotted
line with the words "Cut Here" to make a much nicer looking image.

But when displaying some sets, what you see isn't always what you get!

Here is an exact explanation of what I did and what I discovered:

I created a macro using the Word Basic programming language that is included
as a part of Microsoft Word for the Macintosh.  This macro created every
character in the Ascii set from 0 to 255.  I deleted all the nonprinting
characters (0-31), and left the rest that did show.

I changed the default font, which happens to be Times, to various fonts in
the collection we have for the purpose of creating a display of all the
different symbols and special effects characters such as arrows, borders,
and indicators such as superscript and subscript characters.

In one case, When I changed the font Geneva from 12 to 20 point, I noticed
something odd.  The character I later determined to be ASCII 217, in Geneva
12 point, appeared as an image of a rabbit.  In 20 point, however, that
character metamorphicized into the image of a Macintosh computer!

It gets more interesting.  I tried the different font sizes available, and
this is what I saw:

Point  Character
8     Upper Case Y with two dots above
9     Image of a sheep
10    Image of a Macintosh
11    Upper Case Y with two dots above
12    Image of a rabbit
14    Image of a dog
16    Upper Case Y with two dots above
18    Image of a sheep
20    Image of a Macintosh
22    Upper Case Y with two dots above
24    Image of a rabbit
26,28,36,48,72   Upper Case Y with two dots above

The behavior appears to be consistent; the "special" images reappear at the
doubling of the character (except the "dog").  What is notable about this is
that when the character set is printed out on an Apple color inkjet printer,
what does appear - at the appropriate 8 to 72 point size as is used - is the
specific character, the upper case Y with two dots above.  (I can't yet
remember the exact name for that mark, I think it is called an umlaut.)

As for the risks, the example I gave above is pretty clear.  (Oh yes, the
Star of David and the Hammer and Sickle are available, but fortunately they
are different characters in different fonts!)

I am reporting this because I believe that if it happens in one font it can
happen in others.  Consider a font designed so that the $ appears as the
British pound sterling when printed, or the #, and it could cause
misunderstandings, perhaps even legal problems.  Especially if - and it is
possible - the printed output, having been checked several times in previous
revisions, is merely given a cursory glance when reprinted using a slightly
larger font.

It is well understood that Postscript is a programming language, and with
all the risks and benefits that implies.  But font files may or may not be,
depending on the system or the application, and that opens up a whole new
can of worms.

Unexpected behavior in a rarely-used symbol is, in-and-of-itself not a big
deal.  But in other contexts it could be, and thus I considered the issue to
be worth reporting.

Paul Robinson, General Manager, Tansin A. Darcos &amp; Company/TDR, Inc.

[I am curious about the upper-case Y-umlaut.  German, Turkish, and Swedish
(for example) use umlauts (as does English, for diaeresis), but I have
*never* seen an upper-case Y-umlaut.  I have seen Dutch names (Edsger
Dijkstra's, for example) in handwritten Dutch appear with the i and j run
together as if they formed a "y", with the dots over the i and j appearing
as a y-umlaut (in lower case only).  Perhaps this is one of the
Power(book) Morphin' Dangers?  PGN]

I ran into an interesting risk recently.  A computer is located where it is
hard to gain physical access.  This computer some times needs reseting.  To
this end a system to remotely turn the power off and back on was installed.
Recently it was decided that this computer must operate in the case of a
power failure.  As a result a UPS was installed.  You guessed it, we now
can't remotely reset the computer.

As part of the aftermath of the ValuJet Florida crash, the FAA announced
that they will be scrutinizing all of ValuJet's procedures, including flying
inspectors in the cockpit to watch the crew at work.  Exactly what they
expect to find doing this is cloudy to me, given the `observer effect'.
It's axiomatic that the crew will behave differently with an inspector
peering over their shoulder.

The RISK is that the FAA will waste a lot of time and energy looking at
something that won't give them useful information. Perhaps it's time for
video cameras in the cockpit?

I seem to recall hearing a CBC Radio report on a similar situation
developing in Germany in, if memory serves, January of this year.  The
target which they were attempting to quash was hate literature.
Surprisingly (because I'm Canadian), the report mentioned that most of the
hate literature on the Internet originates in Canada.  (This begs the
question of the source and reliability of this statistic.)

As I remember it, the German government was taking issue with this material,
and figured (similar to the case in France) that the best approach was to
hold the ISPs legally accountable.  The reaction on the part of the ISPs was
to cut off any newsgroup deemed to be inappropriate.

What surprises me is that nobody is fingering the telcos using the same
slippery-slope arguments, ie, providing the hardware and the bandwidth.

Perhaps someone with a better recollection of events than I could give this
story better clarity.

There have been similar reports to this from various places for some time.
However, one extra detail did catch my interest; France Telecom (the French
state-owned telephone service) recently launched its own Internet access
service under the name 'Wanadoo'. I wonder if it will also withdraw from
providing the News.

A discussion of the Rogers report from the perspective of organizational
psychology can be found in Chris Argyris, _Overcoming Organizational
Defences_ (Allyn &amp; Bacon, 1990). Inter alia, he says ".. the Rogers
Commission unwittingly strengthened the organizational routines that caused
the problems in the first place." I would commend Argyris' book to anyone

&gt;Nowhere in this volume could I find a reference to the numerical odds
&gt;of a shuttle accident.

A lot of what Feynman's personal conclusions are not in the volumes.
Perhaps you remember the minor flap about Feynman's addition of a separate
appendix.

However, Feynman did publish several other accounts (and some video
interviews) discussing these issues, including the probability of failure.
I don't remember the exact reference source but some places to look are:

1) Feynmen's "So what do you care what other people think?" (or some
similar title).

2) A Cover story article in Physics Today soon after the report was issued.

Both of these are good reads in and of themselves as well as being
excellent supplementary sources on the Challenger episode.

Feynman's role on the Roger's commission raises another issue that is
worthy of discussion here. Do we help or exacerbate risks with our methods
of ex-post facto accident investigations (Challenger, air-crashes, Exxon
Valdez, ...) ?

Feynman seemed to feel that some very important issues about the management
structure at NASA were not included in the Roger's report and that
consequently were not being addressed. This does not include items in the
report that have not been vigorously pursued (a debatable proposition in
and of itself).

Do investigations reveal problems and fix them or do they simply serve to
identify scapegoats? What's more, how do we define investigation ground
rules to favor the former over the latter?

These are the critical questions to ask in order to reduce the probability
of another challenger

Re: Getting Copies of "Discussion Drafts" of Med Privacy Bill Online

This is a sign-on letter to Senators Kassebaum and Warner, asking that the
Senate make copies of its "discussion drafts" of S. 1360, the Medical
Records Confidentiality Act, on the Internet.  The discussion drafts reflect
the current versions of the controversial legislation, after negotiations
between various Senators and lobbyists.

Currently these drafts are only distributed in paper, and are mostly
available to Washington DC lobbyists.  Senator Kassebaum controls access to
the discussion drafts, and Senator Warner is in charge of Senate rules on
topics such as public access to Senate documents.

The letter has been signed by Gary Ruskin, Director of the Congressional
Accountability Project, Lori Fena, Director of the Electronic Frontier
Foundation, James Love, Director of Consumer Project on Technology, and Jim
Warren, a well known computer journalist and information activist.  To add
your name, send a note to Gary Ruskin at <A HREF="mailto:gary@essential.org">gary@essential.org</A>.

The letter follows:

Senator Nancy Kassebaum, Chair
Committee on Labor and Human Resources
428 Dirksen Senate Office Bldg
Washington, DC 20510-6300

Senator John Warner, Chair
Committee on Rules and Administration
305 Russell Senate Office Bldg
Washington, DC 20510-6325

Dear Senators Kassebaum and Warner:

We are writing to express the frustrations of many American citizens who
cannot effectively monitor the actions of the U.S. Congress, because the
Senate does not give ordinary citizens the same access to key legislative
documents that it gives to interest groups that can afford full time
lobbyists.  Our immediate concern is the refusal of the Senate Labor
Committee to provide online access to a series of discussion drafts of S.
1360, the Medical Records Confidentiality Act.  This controversial
legislation seeks to pre-empt state laws in favor of a federal system
regulating access to personal medical records.  The legislation is
controversial and complex and the stake holders are many.  Privacy and
consumer groups say the legislation provides too much access and too little
privacy, while industry groups are pressing for even easier access to
identified medical records.

The legislation was introduced last October.  Beginning in April, the
Committee on Labor and Human Resources has prepared several "discussion
drafts" for a new chairman's mark.  These drafts have been given to
lobbyists, but the Committee staff has refused to make the text of the
drafts available on the Internet where they would be readily available to
the general public.  As a consequence, as Equifax, IBM, Dun &amp; Bradstreet,
TRW, Blue Cross, Aetna, and other groups with full-time lobbyists read each
and every new discussion draft, the general public mistakenly believes the
October 24, 1995 version of the bill represents the relevant text of the
legislation.

Why keep the discussion drafts from the general public?  The bill is very
long, and it is costly and difficult to distribute the bill in the paper
formats. Most citizens don't have any way of even knowing that the various
discussion drafts even exist.

With efforts to push for a rapid mark-up on S. 1360 it seems urgent to
resolve this issue soon.  More generally, however, the Senate should adopt
new rules about access to the various types of "unofficial" drafts of bills,
including committee prints, managers amendments, chairman's marks, and
widely disseminated discussion drafts, which are the real stuff of the
legislative process.  The text of these important documents should be placed
on the Internet for the benefit of the general public, as soon as they are
made available to Washington lobbyists.

The SEI Software Engineering Symposium
Achieving Maturity Through Technology Adoption
September 9 - 12, 1996
David L. Lawrence Convention Center
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania

The SEI Software Engineering Symposium is an annual event hosted by the SEI
to provide an opportunity for people to learn about practical solutions to
software-related problems and the role of the SEI in assisting the
development and adoption of those solutions.  The primary goal of the
symposium is to provide a forum to facilitate communication among the
various sectors of the software engineering community and to help
participants build collaborative relationships based on their shared
interests.

The format of the symposium will include plenary sessions, tutorials, panel
discussions, presentations, and birds-of-a-feather sessions on topics that
fall within three broad topic areas that promise significant sustained
impacts on the state of the practice in the coming decade.

Topic 1: Trustworthy Systems: Security, Reliability, Safety

As computer-intensive systems grow in scope, and as their information bases
grow ever richer, the users have corresponding concerns and increased needs
for confidence in these systems. Continued successful use of such systems
requires a high degree of reliability and security from harmful intrusions.
Presentations in this topic area will address aspects of systems that lead
them to be considered trustworthy or not. Such presentations will include
descriptions of systems specifically called "trustworthy systems," but will
also includes such related topics as system vulnerability, system
reliability, and information warfare.

Topic 2: Engineering of Software-Intensive Systems

In recent years, primary concepts of program design and program construction
have been influenced and even overturned by developments in such domains as
software reuse, by research in such topics as software architectures, and by
methodologies such as object-oriented construction. As these developments
mature and become ubiquitous, an emerging common thread is the notion of
composition of systems; this notion underlies technologies such as
architecture design languages as well as new system-oriented approaches such
as open systems. Presentations in this topic area will describe a number of
these developments, such as recent work in patterned architectures,
integration of heterogeneous commercial tools, and program understanding.

Topic 3: New Dimensions in Process and Risk

The Capability Maturity Model(SM) (CMMSM) has become the most widely used basis
for achieving process improvement in software engineering, and it has provided
a framework for the development of a number of other maturity models for
improvement efforts within other domains.  With the forthcoming release of the
CMM Version 2.0, this vital aspect of software engineering enters a new phase.
New developments, such as integration of measurement technologies with the
CMM, as well as extension of the model toward risk assessment, risk
management, and Personal Software Process (PSP), are extending the domain of
process improvement enormously. Presenters in this topic area will consider
practical and theoretical issues related to the CMM (e.g., CMM integration),
results of industrial-scale process improvement efforts, and issues
surrounding process-related technologies (e.g., current capabilities in
process enactment engines).

Plenary Sessions: Six keynote speakers representing the views of industry
and government will provide different yet complementary perspectives on
current concerns as well as issues forming just over the horizon. Invited
speakers include representatives from government and industry.

A view from DARPA, where tomorrow's technology is being explored today, will
highlight a number of important issues in software assurance.  Speakers from
the Department of Defense will address ways in which information is becoming
increasingly important both as an asset and as a potential threat.
Industrial perspectives on the trials and successes in day-to-day practice
will fill out the picture of the relationships among these various sectors
as we approach the millennium, and how those relationships are changing with
the times.

Who should attend?

To address the broad set of concerns represented by the software engineering
community, presentations will cover topics of interest to people with
differing levels of knowledge and technical expertise. A range of topical
sessions will be offered to discuss issues of concern to senior managers,
senior technical staff, and practitioners. The structure of the technical
program will focus on

1. fundamentals of a technology area for those new to the technology or those
who need to brush up on key concepts and developments
2. state-of-the-art or state-of-the-practice discussions to outline the best
industrial practices and the ways in which they improve the baseline on
practices
3. experience reports detailing the results of using particular technologies
or approaches to improvement
4. management issues and answers to some of the fundamental questions that
determine if and when to adopt a technology, such as return on investment
or other business-case analyses
5. transition plans for key technologies that are deemed "close to ready" for
transition into routine use and that offer nontrivial, measurable
improvements to adopters

Tutorials, Monday, September 9, 1996
____ Personal Software Process
____ Identifying Success Strategies for Software Process Automation
____ Planning the Cultural Dimensions of Improvement
____ Comprehensive Risk Management
____ How to Deploy Software Process Improvement
____ FODA for Pragmatists
____ Legacy System Reengineering
____ Goal-Driven Software Measurement

Plenary sessions, panel discussions, and presentations, are offered Tuesday,
September 10 through Thursday, September 12.

CMM and Capability Maturity Model are service marks of Carnegie Mellon
University.  The SEI is a federally funded research and development center
sponsored by the U.S. Department of Defense, and operated by CMU.

SECURITY FLAW IN NETSCAPE 2.02

We have discovered an attack that allows a Java applet running under
Netscape Navigator 2.02 to generate and execute arbitrary machine code.
The attack combines a new security bug found by Tom Cargill with some ideas
previously discovered by the Princeton team.  We have implemented a
demonstration applet that deletes a file.  We are not yet releasing
technical details.

For more information, contact Ed Felten (<A HREF="mailto:felten@cs.princeton.edu">felten@cs.princeton.edu</A>,

Practical UNIX and Internet Security, Second Edition
By Simson Garfinkel and Eugene Spafford
O'Reilly &amp; Associates, Inc., 1996
1004 pages.  ISBN: 1-56592-148-8.  $39.95

This book is an extraordinarily successful effort to cram into a mere
thousand pages (971+xxix+ORAads) almost everything you need to know about
Unix and Internet security.  It is a complete rewrite of the First Edition
of 1991, and contains much new material.  In terms of pages per dollar or
cents per page, or much more important, the amount of money it can save you
by keeping you away from a horrendous array of potential security problems,
it is an incredible bargain.  This is a keeper -- at least until the Third
Edition comes out, perhaps in 2001.  By then, the authors will be able to
write much more definitively about Java and web browsers, which are treated
only lightly in the Second Edition.  (Too much happening, too fast?)
Everything else, however, seems well covered and very nicely written.  This
is a very readable and very useful book, and deserves to be looked at by all
of you.

[Note: Coincidentally, the first two errors I found in *PUIS2* relate to
RISKS: (1) on p.897, the host name for the RISKS archive site (which has
been unix.sri.com since 1 Jan 1995) is listed as crvax (which lead me to
discover that the old crvax *still* exists, and is what AltaVista picks
up, but that it contains only issues through volume 16), and (2) on p.879,
a typo!  One of the great advantages of on-line books will be that errors
will disappear as rapidly as they are found.  For example, there are still
a few copies of the first printing of my Computer-Related Risks book
around with the crvax reference, whereas the third printing correctly has
unix.sri.com!  THIS PARAGRAPH IS FOR RISKS READERS.  Please truncate
if this minireview gets redistributed elsewhere.  PGN]

I was reading the home page of a subsidiary of a *very* high profile WWW
player.

On it was the phrase "bringing [top rated] ...... capabilities", where the
bracketed words were a hypertext link.  I followed the link to Stroud's
Consumate Winsock Applications (<A HREF="http://cws.wilmington.net">http://cws.wilmington.net</A>), directly
into the appropriate category, where I found that the original product is
*no longer top rated*!.  In fact it had disappeared from the list.  I was
glad this happened because I had not seen Stroud's site before, and the
updated list pointed me at several new products, which probably are better
than the original.

The obvious risk is that pointing to any data *not* on your web site
requires a commitment to a higher level of vigilance and on-going support,
or you may be surprised by the consequences.

PC Week's latest issue (I unfortunately don't have it to quote from)
stated that last year 1 out of every 14 notebooks (sold?) was stolen.

I wish I could quote the rest.

The risks would certainly include the importance of password security, file

An AP wire story reports that sociologist Lenore J. Weitzman has stated that
a widely publicized statistic in her study "The Divorce Revolution" was
incorrect.  (The statistic was that the standard of living for women's
households dropped 73% in the first year following a divorce, while men's
households rose 42%.)

According to the story, Weitzman "blames the loss of her original computer
data file, a weighting error or a mistake in the computer calculations
performed by a Stanford University research assistant."

Weitzman's data were examined by sociologist Richard R. Peterson, who
determined that the correct figures were 27% and 10%, respectively.

Without knowing more about the dataset and how it was processed, one can
only speculate as to exactly what sort of mistake was made.  The magnitude
of the error suggests, however, that in this case the error might have been
discovered with a rudimentary cross-check, e.g., a histogram of the data or
a manageable random subset.

As a hobby, I run a small ISP on Martha's Vineyard. We have about 350
customers and have a Usenet feed. However, we specifically block the
alt.binaries groups. The principle reason that we do this is to conserve our
bandwidth: receiving alt.binaries would require that we triple our
off-island throughput.

However, even if we did have the alt.binaries groups, I do not think that we
would take a few particular groups. These groups are
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.teen and
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.children.  From my point of view, these groups
exist solely for the carriage of child pornography.

US law says that possession of child pornography is a crime. Usenet, unlike
the web, places a copy of every message on your server's hard drive. Any
organization that has these newsgroups within the United States (including
AOL) is in violation of federal law.

I do not by the argument that censoring the
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.teen and
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.children newsgroups will make a provider
legally liable to any message that is sent over the Usenet because they are
now exercising some sort of editorial control. There is a big difference
between deleting individual messages for editorial purposes and the
wholesale deletion of groups.

It finally happened. The web finally got it's busy signal. No, not the web
server saying it's busy, since it's happily serving out other pages. User
home-page bandwidth ran out.  Is this a sign of metering to come? Or a
result of refusing to meter user traffic?

Internet Direct have a policy of cutting off a user's web pages when they
have exceeded a predetermined amount of web server bandwidth. This creates
a substantial risk when renting web server space from an ISP for providing
time sensitive, or critical support information.

I'm really disappointed at seeing this kind of interference from an ISP.

PGN in <A HREF="/Risks/18.12.html">RISKS-18.12</A> quoted San Francisco Chronicle's report that "Pirated
software costs an estimated $12 billion annually worldwide."  I do not
support piracy and such, but would like to point out the grossly exaggerated
nature of such reports.  Use China as an example.

Suppose there is a total ban of illegal sales of pirated software.  The net
result is not that the US companies (or others) will immediately make a lot
more money on these "sold" software.  Instead, not many copies will be sold
for the simple, economic reason.  A case in point.  The Microsoft Visual C++
I bought last year was US$400+.  This translates into about Chinese Yen
Y3600, which is a decent gross annual salary of a university professor in
China.  Now how many copies of this software can you sell?

In the long run, a total ban may actually help the Chinese software industry
to obtain a breathing space and to develop its own software
standard/platform and all.  This would be extremely bad news for companies
such as Microsoft.  A reasonable strategy (e.g., for the US software
industry) would be to sell at heavily discounted prices that the local
market can bear and wait for the purchasing power to grow.

Thus, instead of screaming the piracy nonsense, the US (and other countries)
should see the reality and view the current situation as an extended battle
to retain market share, with its typical associated cost in lost revenue.

I am amazed that this figure continues to be printed without anyone
challenging it. This figure assumes that every person who pirates or
purchases a pirate copy of program X would have instead bought the program.
Obviously false.

&gt; * Two CD-ROMs with more than 100 programs ... valued at $50,000

The industry counts this as $50,000 worth of losses. But in fact, I would
be very surprised if anybody who purchased this disk installed both Win95
and WinNT, let alone AutoCad, Notes, or Xing's Mpeg.

Interesting. CD's cost about $US3 each to manufacture, last I heard.
With such a markup, the people manufacturing the CD's must be making
a fortune. No wonder they're so hard to stop.

&gt; * Pirated software costs an estimated $12 billion annually worldwide.

You could also look at it like this: Businesses save about $12 billion
annually through flexible adherence to software license agreements.

&gt; * "More than half of all software in existence today is lost to piracy."

Where'd it disappear to? :-)

&gt; according to a chart attributed to Glenco Engineering, Inc.

Glenco Engineering, Inc. manufactures and sells copy protection devices.
See <A HREF="http://www.glenco.com/">http://www.glenco.com/</A> for details and the chart.

Not that I think their numbers are too high. In fact, it seems that in small
businesses in the US about 60% of all software is pirated. In large
corporations, compliance is probably well above 90%. For home users, I'd say
that maybe 90% has not been paid for. These are just my estimates from my
work as a consultant, having visited many businesses.

&gt;     [No one seems to mention the devious opportunity for
&gt;     Trojan horses being added inside the pirate shrinkwrap.]

Far be it from me to provide potential warning to software pirates, but
a person less honest and law-abiding than me might suggest that the greater
danger lies in being swindled by a hot-dog cart guy selling defective disks.

If you need it cheap / Don't buy from that creep.
If Hong Kong won't cut it / But it can't be legit

My experience (as an evaluator of nuclear power plant operators), is people
tend to quickly forget that an observer is present, if the observer just
watches and doesn't interrupt the operators as they carry out their tasks.
Even if they try to do things in a different manner than they normally do,
they also tend to lapse back into their normal operating mode after a while.
In addition, it is generally pretty obvious to a trained observer when a
crew is trying to "put on a show."

The RISK there is that they will make mistakes they normally wouldn't
because they are not operating like they are used to and that causes
communication and coordination problems and increases the chances of
making an error.

: The RISK is that the FAA will waste a lot of time and energy looking at
: something that won't give them useful information. Perhaps it's time for
: video cameras in the cockpit?

Video cameras, while a useful tool for review and debriefing, will often
miss crucial actions.  The RISK  (or RULE) is that they always point to
the wrong spot.

Paul Robinson reported the surprising behaviour of a Macintosh character
which appears as Y-umlaut in most fonts but as symbols which vary with the
font size in a few others.

The full range of these secret characters was documented in great detail in
Volume I, Issue 2 of _Macworld_ (May/June 1984), as a "treasure" that "only
luck and wild fingers on the keyboard would have unearthed."  The set of
characters in current Macintosh fonts is larger than in the ones that were
available in 1984 (so the special characters were not taking the spot
reserved for Y-umlaut, but were in a location that would otherwise be empty,
but happened to be typable with Option-Shift-Tilde) and, since all the fonts
were bitmapped rather than scalable, and the only output device, the
Imagewriter, matched the screen resolution exactly, there was no confusion
caused by rescaling the fonts to match different output devices.  So the
risk of accidentally misusing these characters didn't come into being when
they were placed into the fonts, but was instead when "legacy" fonts weren't
updated to match newer notions of what Mac fonts should contain.

For the record, here are all the special symbols hidden in the original Mac
fonts, not all of which are still shipped with current Macintosh software:

New York                Toronto               Chicago, London,
hearts: 9, 18pt         boxes: 9, 18pt      Monaco:
robots: 12, 24pt        vines: 12, 24pt       undefined
musical notes: 14pt     apples: 14pt

Geneva:                 all sizes:
sheep: 9, 18pt          Venice: chains
rabbits: 12, 24pt       San Francisco: cars
birds: 14pt             Athens: footprints

The risk that call-back phone-sex will bring censorship to the net seems
far-fetched.  For starters, I'd bet a big bottle of crisco that those sexy
voices won't be saying anything until they've got a credit card number.

Why would a politician receiving such a call, assuming he or she objects,
blame the internet?  The recipient doesn't know how the transaction to the
call-back service was initiated and, even if they do know, does it really
matter?  Any legal restrictions should be placed on the actual service, not
the ordering mechanism.

There were two things that happened in Germany.  In one case a local
prosecutor got CompuServe to censor a couple hundred newsgroups.

In the other case, Web Communication's entire web server has been censored
by Germany.  I think they use packet filters to drop packets with
www.webcom.com's IP address.  This was done because a Canadian customer of
Webcom's is a historical revisionist - his web page argues that the
Holocaust never happened, and promotes Nazi politics, etc.  Germany does not
have complete freedom of speech - promoting Nazism is illegal there.

Germany's effort largely backfired because a number of other sites
immediately provided mirrors for the Nazi.  Webcom's other customers, mostly
ordinary businesses, are blocked out from the whole nation of Germany.

Since my comment questioning the 80% figure attributed to hate literature
originating in Canada, I'd like to make some further comments in the hope of
stifling further e-mail.

Has nobody but me stopped to consider what 80% means?  To me, at least, this
implies that out of &lt;insert really big number&gt; people connected to the
Internet *worldwide*, Canada is implied to have the dubious honour of being
Number One in providing hate literature to Germany, with Number Two placing
a very distant second, whatever country that might be.  Does this make
sense?

Am I the only one wondering who took these stats, and what methodologies
they used to collect them?

I thought one of the fundamental mandates for this newsgroup was to question
the reliability of certain assumptions, especially if technology is
involved.  In fact, let me go so far as to say that one RISK in listening to
rhetoric is to take as gospel when one throws around figures like "80% of
Canadians," or "4 out of 5 dentists", when we pooh-pooh claims that use
phrases like "a lot".  Numbers and statistics somehow validate and ennoble
what we might otherwise question.  I had hoped that RISKS readers would be
familiar with this.

Approximately 800 customers of the First National Bank of Chicago were
surprised to see that their balances were $924 million more than they
expected last week. The cause was the traditional ``change in a computer
program''.

According to The American Bankers Association, the total of $763.9 billion
was the largest such error in US banking history. Do the RISKS Archives
agree?

$924,844,208.32.  More than 800 other folks had similar stories to tell.
The sum total for all accounts was $763.9 billion, more than six times the
total assets of First Chicago NBD Corp.  The problem was attributed to a
``computer glitch''.

I'm not sure how widely this was reported, but the head office of the Credit
Lyonnais (a bank) in Paris (8e, rue du Quatre Septembre) had a major fire a
few weeks ago.  I forget the date, but it was a Saturday and the fire burned
for quite a while.  The investigation is proceeding, but my source of
information has some things to say that may be interesting to RISKS readers:

1. The VMS machines in the building were part of a cluster that was
replicated remotely.

So far so good.

2. There appears to have been no sprinkler system or fire doors
in the building.  I've seen it, from the outside, and it's more
or less gutted.

Asking for trouble?

3. The UNIX machines were backed up daily, except for Fridays which
was done on Sunday.  These machines were backed up to tape and
it appears that the tapes stay in the machines until just before
the next backup is done.  Remember, the fire was on saturday.

24 hour operations are not that expensive.  Courier the tapes
offsite, after they've been written.  Offsite parallel operations?

4. On the Saturday the UNIX machines had the tapes for Thursday night
still loaded.  They had not yet been put in the fireproof safe and
the backup of Friday's data had not commenced.

Backup your data ASAP, preferably to a remote site across a
network.  If the tapes have to stay on site, put them in the safe.

5. In the middle of the _fire_ someone realised this small problem and
_while the fire was still burning_ the tapes were rescued from the
UNIX machines and from the fireproof safe.

I wonder who volunteered?

6. Apparently the fireproof safe was not deemed to be waterproof or
taking the tapes _during_ the fire was deemed a better choice than
maybe getting them later.

Water follows fire.

7. From the news reports it appeared that there was also some concern
over whether safe deposit boxes (in the basement?) were waterproof.

All of this is unconfirmed, but I think my source is ok.

BTW: I bank with the Societe Generale.

&gt;&gt;   BRISBANE, May 18 AAP - Computer thieves raided one the
&gt;&gt;Queensland government's most sensitive buildings today,
&gt;&gt;ransacking  three floors and dismantling around 55 computers,
&gt;&gt;police said.
&gt;&gt;  A spokesman for Premier Rob Borbidge said the
&gt;&gt;break-in at the  executive building annexe in George Street had
&gt;&gt;prompted a review of  security at all government buildings.

o	About 55 computers were taken apart and the HD and memory removed.

&gt;&gt;   The spokesman for Mr Borbidge said the break-in in the
&gt;&gt;sensitive  treasury area did not appear to be politically motivated.

I saw a demonstration of modern computer-voice-recognition s/w tied to modern
ideographic text-processing software.  It appeared to me to work pretty well
(given that I didn't understand the language involved).

Even a few years ago, it appeared that the "information age" was generating
forces which would push people away from ideographic writing systems.  Most
intellectual work would be supported by computerized systems running on
alphabetic text; ideographic processing when available was costly, awkward,
and slow.  Furthermore, hardly anyone could program his computer (in the
general sense) using ideograms.  Though people using different alphabets
could exchange information fairly easily, ideographic data was not very
portable.

These forces seemed progressive.  Alphabetic writing systems are much more
convenient for most purposes than ideographic ones.  Worse, cultures using
ideographic systems force their young to spend tremendous amounts of time and
effort memorizing ideograms--time which they could otherwise devote to
productive or entertaining activities.  Ideographic systems are bad for people
with poor visual memories; though they may be capable of intellectual work,
they find themselves crippled by their obdurate writing system.

But now computer advances (not unanticipated) will relieve some pressures
which worked to push people away from ideographic systems.  The tedium of
penmanship will go away.  Recognition of ideograms for programmatic purposes
will become widely available.  Most computer systems will become able to
process and display ideographic text.

I fear that the usual forces of reaction and inertia which operate to maintain
the cultural status quo may overpower the diminished forces of progress.
Even though ideographic writing systems are demonstrably counter-productive,
the slow-to-accrue benefits of abandoning them may never outweigh the
instantaneous costs of doing so in the minds of adult (already ideographized)
decision-makers.

Advances in computer systems will enable us to avoid advances in our "human
systems."  Heck, it's worse than "will enable us to avoid advances."  It's
more like "will actively retard us..."

Princeton Team Finds Bug In  Part Of Netscape Program
Dow Jones  5/20/96  6:02 AM

From The Wall Street Journal
&gt;&gt;  MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. -- Netscape Communications Corp. said a
&gt;&gt;team of Princeton University computer sleuths found another bug
&gt;&gt;in the company's popular Internet browser, but said the flaw
&gt;&gt;has been corrected and no information was lost or damaged.
&gt;&gt;Jeff Trehaft, Netscape's director of security, said the bug was
&gt;&gt;buried "deep in the source code" of its Navigator browser, and
&gt;&gt;that it was so esoteric that only experts searching for months
&gt;&gt;could find it. The bug was found in Navigator versions that
&gt;&gt;support Sun Microsystems Inc.'s Java computer language.

o	Third bug identified by the team.  This one found by Thomas Cargill, a
consultant.

o	Netscape delivered a fixed version within 24 hours.  Cargill still gets
the $1000 reward.

&gt;&gt;  Mr. Trehaft added that Navigator is safe. "This product has
&gt;&gt;been out almost a year and only a few bugs have been found, and
&gt;&gt;as far as we know there's been no damage," he said.

The 17 May 96 FORWARD (an American Jewish interest weekly newspaper),
page 5, has a brief article about a Jewish CD-ROM put out by the
Jewish Publications Society that had a Christian gospel screensaver
by mistake.

JPS is a large Jewish publisher.  But they had never done a CD-ROM
before, so they asked Logos Research Systems, a leader in Christian
software products, to do the scutwork.  Apparently the screensaver
was added in at the last minute, and since there were no instructions
regarding it, the generic Logos screensaver was packaged in, and
presumably nobody beta (beth?) tested it.

JPS and Logos are now splitting the cost of replacing hundreds of
CD-ROMs already sold, and are pulling off those on the shelves.

There are compelling reasons to consider "12 am" to mean noon,
as in the hour-by-hour sequence 10 am, 11 am, 12 am.  But just
as compelling is the minute-by-minute sequence 12:00 pm,
12:01 pm, 12:02 pm.  People generally duck (actually clarify) the
issue by saying "12 noon" and "12 midnight."  Another dodge is to
make rules and laws go into effect at such times as 12:01 am.  But
is there a more or less universally understood meaning of 'am' or
'pm' as applied to exactly 12?  If there isn't, what should it be?
The truly logical answer to this, of course (try to get this one
through Congress) is to replace 12 by 0:  there's no confusion about
what 0 am and 0 pm would mean.  Not to me anyway.

The pound sign `#' is often used as shorthand for the word `fracture'  by
medical staff from the UK and other countries. For example, "Mrs Smith has
a # radius and ulna".

Our hospital computer systems move data from one system to another.  If Mrs
Smith's diagnosis is entered as above on the administrative system and then
her information is called up from the pathology system the diagnosis appears
as "=A3 radius and ulna".

Of course, the same problem may occur in transmission of this message.  The
pound or hash sign is replaced by the stylised L used to designate the pound
sterling (currency).

RISK: the patient's arm may be more valuable to pathology than anyone else.

I'm watching CNN as background noise and they are touting the use of
Astrology for investing. The problem is just another illustration of how
difficult it is to get straight information to form ones one judgment. They
noncritically report that three successful predictions including the Gulf
war. There is not an iota of incredulousness -- not only does the reporter
not do fact checking (what is a prediction?) there isn't even the idea of
checking to see if there is any significance against the larger set of
predictions. Astrology is an obvious target but there is no reason to assume
any of the other reports are any better researched. Reminds me of the great
Dilbert strip where the Boss is determined to track down the miscreants
since a full 40% of the sick days were on Monday or Friday. But it's not
just innumeracy.

Lest we be smug (whoever "we" are) the same naivete appears in assuming that
one can simply design a system and deploy it without a continual learning and
refinement cycle. (formerly known by its denigrated name of "maintenance").

So I am seen by the world as "Scott Alastair" when Exchange puts its own
header at the top of mail messages I send. Despite many variations - of
increasing literary violence - of signature most (about 75%) of my Internet
email is addressed, "Dear Scott".

I am told that names are stored as &lt;last name&gt; &lt;first name&gt; because, for
example, the sender can type "Scott Al" and Exchange will match my name
automatically without the poor sender having to spell "Alastair" correctly.

A fix has been considered - storing the names as &lt;last name&gt;, &lt;first name&gt; -
but was rejected as too risky because people would forget the comma.

So I can't win! If an Alistair Scott (note the spelling, which is
actually more common than my spelling) joins,

A story in the 29 Apr 1996 issue of Web Week, a magazine devoted to the
World-Wide Web, describes new developments in the controversy between
Nielsen Media Research and a group of academics from Vanderbilt and North
Carolina, who criticized an earlier Nielsen study as overstating Internet
usage in the US and Canada.

The magazine quotes the following from David Harkness, senior VP of
Nielsen Media Research: "What doesn't matter now, in my opinion, is
how many users there were in August of last year, because the Internet
is growing so fast. The Internet is not being served by this debate".

The last comment may cause anyone who has forked out $5,000 - what the
magazine says it takes to buy a copy of the Nielsen report - to raise an
eyebrow or two. Are we to understand that the purpose of such a study is to
"serve the Internet", that is to say cheer up everyone in the Internet
industry by reporting good news, rather than provide a snapshot of the
reality?

But the most interesting part remains the first sentence in Mr. Harkness's
comment. If I understand properly: let's not quibble about minor differences
between the two studies (a mere 8 million people - or actually 20 million,
making the result more than 100% off target, if you compare Nielsen's
"Internet access" numbers with the academics' estimates of actual Internet
use!); we all know the Internet is expanding by leaps and bounds.


Which of course brings up the whole question of why we should trust
Nielsen's numbers any more than Mr. Harkness seems to. For example,
according to his study, 1.51 million people have used the Web to make
a purchase. Even if you bought the report, better double-check before
making a major policy decision based on such statistics.

Call for Participation
Software Engineering Institute (SEI) Conference on Risk Management:
acquisition, programs, projects, systems, and software

Managing Uncertainty in a Changing World
Hotel Cavalier
Virginia Beach, Virginia
April 7-9, 1997

In today's world of downsizing and reengineering, you're moving into
uncharted territory. You've been asked to acquire and develop systems with
less money, and said, "I can do that."  You've been asked to succeed with
shorter schedules, and said, "I can do that."  You've been asked to use fewer
people, and said, "I can do that."

So, how can you do that?

You need to improve your ability to acquire systems, to proactively manage
your resources, people, schedules, and budgets--to predict and avoid
problems before they occur. You must rapidly integrate, under controlled
conditions, the acquisition of complete systems providing end users with
predictable system performance. You need to determine which risks are more
critical to the success of your program to make effective use of scarce
resources. You need proven methods and techniques as well as suggestions for
advanced capabilities.

Acquisition practices and risk management are being implemented and improved
throughout the government and industry. To maintain your competitive edge in
this uncertain world, you need effective acquisition and risk management
practices. This conference is a way to find out what's going on and what's
applicable and useful to you.

The SEI Conference on Risk Management will provide a forum that brings
together the government, industry, and academic managers, practitioners,
change agents, and researchers using and exploring risk management and
acquisition. The conference will provide a unique forum for exchanging ideas
and experiences with experts and professionals who practice or study
acquisition and risk management. This is a tremendous opportunity to
increase your awareness and to advance your knowledge and skills by being
exposed to the latest methods, tools, and techniques, and some of best
practices in the field of system development and acquisitions. Managers will
find the means to improve their ability to make informed decisions and to
gain better control of their project's cost, schedule, and technical
contents. Practitioners will find the ways to increase awareness of risks
and their ability and skills to avoid or mitigate them. Both development and
acquisition professionals will gain insight from the experiences of leading
experts and professionals, learn about the latest developments and
technological issues, and learn how to manage uncertainty in a changing
world.

The SEI Conference on Risk Management will feature keynote speakers,
distinguished presenters, selected presentations from invited speakers,
panel discussions with experts and professionals, and exhibitors. It will
also provide learning opportunities with hands-on tutorials and
opportunities to accomplish work to advance the practices of acquisition and
risk management through mini-workshops. The conference will further provide
value for different audiences such as managers and practitioners, beginners
and advanced professionals, or development and acquisition professionals
through separate tracks for presentations and panels. Opportunities to
mingle with people who have similar interests will be provided through
birds-of-a-feather sessions.

The Hotel Cavalier in Virginia Beach provides beach-side accommodations. The
Virginia Beach area is convenient to Washington, D.C. and offers golfing,
deep-sea and freshwater fishing, tennis, hiking, historic dwellings, museums,
shops, and restaurants. The Norfolk International Airport serves the Virginia
Beach area with more than 200 flights daily to all major hubs and most major
cities. The oceanfront is a 20-minute drive from the airport.

The *Wall Street Journal* of 22 May 1996 (A18) reports that two Japanese
firms lost about 55 billion yen when criminals counterfeited the stored
money cards that they manufactured.  These cards are used to pay for
pachinko games, but you can get refunds wired to an account if you cash in a
card. If my memory serves me correctly, there is a certain amount of skill
involved. If you play well or are lucky, you might even add money to the
cards. But I'm not sure about this detail. In any case, the people with the
counterfeit cards could get refunds when they didn't pay for the original
card.

The Journal mentions three interesting details. First, the cards were pushed
by the police as a means to track the flow of cash and stop money
laundering. Obviously, there wouldn't be these losses if they could really
track the flow. Second, the convenience of the new cards initially boosted
profits because it was so much easier to play with the cards that
automatically kept track of your money. Finally, the Journal reported that
there are 18,244 pachinko parlors in Japan.

I serve on the Iowa Board of Examiners for Voting Machines and Electronic
Voting Systems, and last Monday, we met to examine a new modem feature added
to the already approved BRC Eagle mark-sense voting machine.

One question that came up immediately is that, given the fact that Iowa's
current voting law bases the official canvass of votes on hand-delivered
reports from each precinct, what value does a modem serve?  The answer is
trivial -- unofficial counts phoned in from the precincts are routinely used
to compute unofficial totals that are then released to the public and press
soon after the polls close.  Right now, these totals are usually phoned in
manually (or should I say, orally), but a modem in the voting machine can
easily serve the same purpose.

An aside: Why the big push for instant results?  Sure, the press wants fast
access to the totals, and counties compete to see who can get their totals
in first, but we'd probably be better off as a nation if there was a news
blackout on vote totals until the day after!

It seems likely that electronic reports will soon be used to formulate
the official canvass.  Currently, the canvass is done by reading the
tapes printed out by computerized voting machines and manually (or with
the aid of calculators and computers) tallying the votes; this introduces
a needless source of error.

Because of this, we decided to examine BRC's new modem feature with an eye
towards the possible incorporation of direct electronic vote total reporting
into the official canvass.  An obvious question that comes up in this
context is, how secure is the system.  BRC's written answer to this question
(one I submitted in writing in advance) boiled down to:

1) BRC uses a proprietary protocol
2) The central host, on receiving a report by modem, gives no feedback
until it receives the whole packet of vote totals.
3) The central host demands that each voting machine present the correct
8 digit ID code before it accepts a record of votes cast.
4) Each voting machine has a 4 digit ID code that is padded to 8 digits
to make the required ID code.
4) Failed connection attempts are logged and flagged on screen at the
central site.

Needless to say, the idea of a 4 digit PIN being sufficient didn't impress
me, nor did the idea of security through obscurity.  The lack of feedback
helps security, but in a jurisdiction with hundreds of voting machines,
the 4-digit code space will be pretty full.  As a result, we had an
interesting discussion of the security issue; this ended when Herb Deutsch
from BRC, said the following, almost in passing (quoted from memory):

"Oh, by the way, we also include a timestamp in the data and verify that
it is right.  It's the time the PROM customizing that particular voting
machine for that particular election was burned, and it's accurate to the
IBM PC clock precision.  I didn't even think of it as a security
feature, but I guess it is."

Not only hadn't he thought of this feature as being part of the security
of modem-based vote reporting, but he then went on to explain why the
software included a feature to allow a total with the wrong timestamp to
be accepted despite a timestamp mismatch error.  There was no similar way
to override a 4-digit PIN mismatch.

We approved the machine (Of course, we also tested other things, for
example, by injecting line noise on the phone line while totals from a
test election were being reported).  We also made the administrative
recommendation that, despite the fact that vote totals delivered by modem
are currently not official, central election workers should not override
timestamp mismatches or other overridable error conditions without
explaining why in the presence of witness from at least two political
parties (this is the usual precaution required for all manual vote
processing steps).

If electronically reported vote totals become part of the official
canvass, we concluded that we'd like to see some of the time spent
manually tallying the canvass spent auditing the machine computed
results.  Right now, in Iowa, no recounting of votes is allowed unless
there is a call for a recount.  As currently set up, this prevents
reasonable auditing steps such as recounting randomly selected
precincts or post-vote testing of randomly selected voting machines.
We concluded that these kinds of tests should be routine and should
be completed prior to the certification of an automatically computed
purely electronic canvass.

We also concluded that, someday soon, we'd like to see standards for
electronic vote reporting from machine to central counting location.
Security through obscurity isn't desirable, and cross-vendor compatability
is important!  Voting machines are expensive, and a standard would
significantly simplfy incremental replacement of old voting machines.

1) Election results.  The BBC operates a magnificently indulgent set of
computer graphics for predicting the various results of elections.  In an
interview on BBC News Extra on 3 May 1996, its presenter, Peter Snow, was
asked if there were ever problems.  "Oh yes", he replied.  "For example, in
the Dudley (a Midlands town) bye-election, the swing away from the (ruling)
Conservative government was so large that the entire screen went blank
because the programmers had not allowed for the Conservatives having no
seats (i.e. elected representatives)".

2) Airline entertainment systems.  During a single flight from Singapore to
London experienced by myself in April 1996, the Singapore Airlines inflight
entertainment system, "Krisworld", was rebooted twice in the first two
hours, numbered its video channels with the rather eccentric numbering
system, 1,2,3,4,5,6,48,8,... and then lost the numbers completely for a
while so the video channel had to be guessed.  This is a regular occurrence
according to my colleagues.

3) Taxation.  It was recently reported in the UK (April 1996 on
www.netaccountants.com) that "A VAT Tribunal has shown the Customs &amp; Excise
VAT computer was incorrectly calculating VAT surcharges for late filing of
returns.  Customs have estimated that about 90,000 default surcharges were
too high and have said that the way that the computer was programmed means
that Customs cannot identify the businesses that have been overcharged !"

This is about a discovery I made with Alta Vista the WWW search engine, and
its robot "scooter".

The system I hit on had a high port of 8000 and I accessed it via Netscape 1.1N
for the PC, through Alta Vista...

I can not believe what happened to me, and it has elicited a bit of interest
around the place.  I hope I never see it again!

Here is the article I posted:

Hello everyone.

I thought I might share with you an experience I had today while searching
the Internet for information on some programming topics.

I used Alta Vista to do a search on some programmers' libraries,
for my home UNIX network.

The software I wanted is actually commercial, and not freeware, and is
unavailable except by purchasing it.

Imagine my surprise when Alta Vista returned in its little search screen:

"Directory of /lib"

Hmmmm.....

I proceeded to follow this link, hoping I might have hit on a public
archive of software made available on the public domain, as the OS I
wanted it for is basically obsolete.

I was even more interested when I saw several system libraries scroll by
on my screen...

A quick check of the root home page of the system (i.e. just the domain
name without a path to files) brought back the following:

&gt; Index of /
&gt;     Name            Last modified     Size  Description
&gt;
&gt;     bin/            15-May-96 14:20      -
&gt;     boot            17-Nov-93 00:12   101K
[...]
&gt;33 files

To the uninitiated, this is the *root filesystem* of the UNIX host I was
visiting via netscape.

I changed directory to /etc and was amazed to see everything available to me.

I clicked on /etc/motd and that was enough to tell me I could have had the
password file had I wanted to.

I mailed the site's admin and postmaster telling them of the security breach.

The site is now offline since I checked tonight.

Now, people - that is what Alta Vista can do on an unsecured UNIX server.

Their whole machine - user private directories and everything - even files made
read by the system only were publically available for anyone to download.

Had I been malicious, I could have downloaded the password file,
cracked it with crack, logged in as root, and deleted the syslogs and no
one would have been the wiser to my presence, at least for a while anyway.

There is no moral to this story - if there was one it would be
something like:  "You Are Being Indexed" - if you do not take care.
Be careful of what you put on your computers.
If there is a hole, Alta Vista will find it.
And it is damn good at indexing Hard Disks.

The site was indexed by Alta Vista's robot more than a week ago...

Computer Security
By JIM ABRAMS,  Associated Press Writer
&gt;&gt;   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hackers infiltrate Pentagon computers
&gt;&gt;more than 160,000 times a year, threatening "catastrophic
&gt;&gt;damage," but the military rarely detects and seldom
&gt;&gt;investigates the interlopers, government investigators said
&gt;&gt;Wednesday.    "At a minimum, these attacks are a
&gt;&gt;multimillion-dollar nuisance to Defense. At worst, they are a
&gt;&gt;serious threat to national security," the General Accounting
&gt;&gt;Office said.

o	GAO repeated the DoD estimate of 250K attempts last year.  Testimony
highlighted it was an estimate, but also that in GAO's opinion it was
probably more accurate of an estimate than anyone else's.

[DMK: The article states 65% of these were successful, but that was not what
was in the testimony before the Senate.  I watched the testimony on CSPAN
last night (yes I do too have a life) and the testimony was that DoD
estimates 250K attempts, and _DoD's_own_testing_ had a success rate of about
65%.]

&gt;&gt;   The report, presented to the Senate Governmental Affairs
&gt;&gt;subcommittee on investigations, dealt with the more than 90
&gt;&gt;percent of Pentagon data that is unclassified. It nevertheless
&gt;&gt;could contain highly sensitive information on troop movements,
&gt;&gt;procurement and maintenance of weapons systems.

o	Testimony included 120 countries (identity classified) have or are
developing computer attack capabilities.

&gt;&gt;   The report quoted the Pentagon as accepting that the
&gt;&gt;document fairly represented the increasing threat of Internet
&gt;&gt;attacks. Officers attributed some of the problems to poorly
&gt;&gt;designed systems or to the use of off-the-shelf computer
&gt;&gt;products without inherent security safeguards.

o	Both the Senate testimony and the Pentagon spokeperson highlighted
the issue is unclassified information and that classified information was
secure.  [Well, not quite...  PGN]

&gt;&gt;   Pentagon spokeswoman Susan Hansen also stressed that the
&gt;&gt;report focused only on unclassified transmissions between the
&gt;&gt;department and the outside world.    Information on weapons
&gt;&gt;systems and other classified material was secure, she said. "We
&gt;&gt;have invested in those systems so they are not subject to those
&gt;&gt;attacks," she said, "but we are not taking lightly the
&gt;&gt;repetitive and constant attacks" on unclassified Pentagon
&gt;&gt;networks.

o	Testimony include the Griffiths AFB penetration by the hacker
Datastream Cowboy in early 1994:

&gt;&gt;   To avoid detection, the hackers went through international
&gt;&gt;telephone lines, passing ports in South America, Seattle and
&gt;&gt;New York to reach the Air Force computer. From there, they
&gt;&gt;broke into computer systems of NASA, Wright-Patterson Air Force
&gt;&gt;Base, defense contractors around the country and South Korea's
&gt;&gt;atomic energy center.
...
&gt;&gt;   The report noted that the Defense Information Systems Agency
&gt;&gt;has conducted 38,000 attacks on Defense computer systems via
&gt;&gt;the Internet to see how well they are protected. The agency
&gt;&gt;gained access 65 percent of the time.
&gt;&gt;   Of these successes, only 4 percent were detected by target
&gt;&gt;organizations, and in only 27 percent of those cases was the
&gt;&gt;detection reported to the systems agency.

Dave Kennedy [CISSP] Information Security Analyst, National Computer Security
Assoc.

[The report is available from the Government Accounting Office,
GAO/AIMD-96-84, Information Security: Computer Attacks at Department
of Defense Pose Increasing Risks.  Cliff Stoll, Bob Anderson of RAND,
and I were at the hearing, having been invited to testify.  However, our
testimony has been postponed because the Senate decided to do a blitz
voting on 40 issues at 10 minute intervals, so the hearing was cut short.

... I have three questions: a) how did they
go about collecting such statistics, b) if the systems had software good
enough to notice that they had been penetrated, why couldn't they have
stopped the penetration, and c) how many successful or unsuccessful attempts
were not detected?  (Not that I have any idea how one would go about getting
that number.)  I will grant, for instance, that if the attack is a password
attack where the search was done on another system on a copy of the password
file one might not detect it until considerably after the fact, but unless
the penetrators actually caused damage I would suspect any such successful
attacks wouldn't be noticed at all (who bothers to look at the "last login
time" notice, if there even is one?) -- the impression I have (but one must
also question here how one would validate this) is that most hackers don't
damage data, just look at it.  I will also grant that intrusion detection
systems (which can detect mosquito bites but not technically competent
attacks) might work slowly enough as not to be able to stop an attack in
progress, but I suspect that most of the systems involved (the stories said
something about mass-marketed computers) don't have any intrusion detection
installed.

I don't doubt the message (things are bad and getting worse); what I do
doubt is whether there is any scientific validity to the numbers.  The
RISKs? a) an unecessary amount of money will be spent on solving a
non-problem, or b) the problem actually is real, but the flawed nature of
the statistics will be questioned and the opposite will happen.

... The part that I found interesting was this quote (from the Pittsburgh
Post-Gazette, by Nolan Walters of the Knight-Ridder News Service):

"A 16-year-old kid from the United Kingdom, with the computer nickname
`Datastream Cowboy,' used a common 486 SX desktop computer, with *only a
170-megabyte hard drive,* to break into the Rome Laboratory sytem..."  (my
asterisks for emphasis - AT)

Is it just me??  "Only a 170-megabyte hard drive??"  Good thing he didn't
have one of those fancy-schmancy 2-Gig drives - think of what kind of
systems he could have broken into!!!!  Yet another example of the uninformed
writing for the uninformed.

RISKS readers are well aware the RISKS of frequently used (and thus easy to
guess) passwords. For the record (and for those of you who run sites where
German speakers have passwords), here is the "most popular passwords" list
for German, as obtained by a computer magazine's (PC Welt Extra) survey and
reproduced by AP in Sueddeutsche Zeitung, May 22nd 1996, p.12:

1. Passwort     ("password", could also be spelled &lt;HTML&gt;Pa&amp;szlig;wort&lt;/HTML&gt;)
2. Pass         (no translation)
3. Liebe        ("love")
4. Sex          (same)
5. Gott         ("God")
6. Genie        ("genius")
7. Hacker       (same)
8. Geheim       ("secret")

Next are names, of the users themselves as well as names of spouses and
children. I wonder if there is anybody willing to comment something on "German
character" due to the passwords Germans are choosing, or any similar lists
for other languages leaving room for (risky) "national character" studies :-)

There are risks associated with assuming you're smarter than the spammers.

Here the tactic is simple, regardless of whether auto-billing to originating
callers is possible: spam this number from pay phones.  They all dial 800
numbers (isn't it a regulatory requirement, like 911?), their users are
completely anonymous, and their operators would almost certainly not be held
liable for charge-backs under this scheme.

In Risks 18.13 (May 17, 1996) Simson L. Garfinkel said of his small ISP:
&gt;
&gt; ... we specifically block the alt.binaries groups. The principle reason
&gt; that we do this is to conserve our bandwidth: receiving alt.binaries
&gt; would require that we triple our off-island throughput.
^^^^^^
Now, skipping the moral and legal points noted by Mr. Garfinkel, with which
I mostly agree, my main observation was this: is this what the internet
=really= is all about? This and other stories, some on RISKS suggest that
the search for soft and hard core porn make up the majority of internet
traffic. This is a very disheartening to those of us who wish the net to
thrive and realize its potential. The net will not thrive if its main
purpose is the exchange of pornography. Eventually society will recognize
its non-productive nature and abandon it. Indeed the predictions of the
collapse of the net, widely reported recently, addressed this perception
that few real uses for the net had been found.

The risk? As more and more =quantitative= stories like Mr. Garfinkel's
come to light, the size and scope of the net's "dirty secret" becomes
apparent, commercial, scientific, and other interests will decide the net
is a bad neighborhood to hang out in. If more ISP's took Mr. Garfinkel's
stance, the =long term= interests of the net would be better served.

There is another risk here, partly computer-related, which is that of using
names for symbols which are not universally recognised. There was has recently
been a long discussion on comp.fonts about the proper name for the '#' symbol.
The concensus seemed to be that while US readers recognised the name 'pounds'
for this symbol, UK readers did not. They tended to know the symbol by the
names  'hash', 'square', or 'sharp'. This name by which this symbol is known
appears to be related to the context in which it is encountered; other names
included 'nittle' (apparently used in the building trade) and 'octothorpe'
(used by some phone companies).

We use symbols in computing which are not part of normal everyday life; the
risks are that as more non-technical people use computers, there will be
more mistakes and confusion stemming from the wrong symbols being used, or
symbols being used inappropriately.

One of the Swedish nuclear reactors, Ringhals 4, was automatically shut down
during a routine safety check. The last part of the instructions fed into
the computer was missing, and when the computer safety system noticed that
the instructions were incomplete, it shut down the reactor.

So far so good, but why were the instructions incomplete? The Xerox machine
used to copy the instruction sheet did not include the complete page, and no
one (except the computer) ever noticed that the instructions were incorrect.
(Source: TT)

The risk is obviously that no system is completely fool-proof.  I doubt
anyone ever thought about the correctness of the Xerox machines as part of
the nuclear power plant safety system. No matter how detailed you planned
the security system, there will always be some part that could fail. In this
case, nothing serious happened because the computer detected the error.
However, this -- or similar incidents -- could happen again, and next time
maybe the error would not be detected.

The NY ARTCC computer (7 years old) lost significant service capability
(`failed' said the NYT Service's Matthew Wald on 21 May 1996) twice on the
evening of Monday 20 May; the first time for 23 minutes, and the second time
for about an hour, one hour later. The NYTS reported (International Herald
Tribune, Thurs 23 May 1996 p2) that it was `running normally' Tuesday as
technicians tried to figure out the problem. The FAA is wondering about the
new software installed four days earlier.

`The office, the New York Air Route Traffic Control Center, handles
high-altitude and long-distance traffic over New York, Connecticut, New
Jersey, Pennsylvania and part of the Atlantic Ocean.' (Wald, NYTS, 21 May
1996)

There followed the usual: a fail-safe return to older, more inefficient air
traffic control procedures, leading to a lower traffic saturation limit and
thus mean delays in departures of about an hour at major airports in the
area; an increase in the work load of controllers; a deficit of
safety-related information, including `automatic conflict alert'.

I note that a deficit of safety-related info does not necessarily lead to
a reduction in safety: one increases safety margins and pays careful
attention (which might even increase safety for the short periods involved).
These older procedures worked tried and true for decades. Risks might
increase were an ARTCC system to suffer a service reduction at a time at
which there were more aircraft in the system than the saturation limit
for the reduced level of service. Aircraft in the air already under control
do not just go away, however one can delay entry into Center control by
delaying aircraft ready for departure and diverting flying traffic due
to enter Center control (but note the huge area NY ARTCC covers). I am
not aware that such a circumstance has ever occurred, but given the
projected growth in commercial air traffic, it is something to worry about
for the future.

Reuter reported on 29 May 1996 that U.S. prosecutors accuse Islamic militant
Ramzi Ahmed Yousef (a.k.a. Abdul-Basit Balochi) and two others of plotting
to bomb 12 U.S. jet planes in two days during 1995.  Some of the evidence is
based on a file found in Yousef's laptop computer, stating that the purpose
of the bombings was ``vengeance and retribution'' against the United States
for its financial, political and military support of Israel.  (Yousef will
be tried later this year for masterminding the 1993 World Trade Center
bombing that killed six and injured more than 1,000 people.  He is also
accused of placing a bomb on a Philippine Airlines flight from Manila to
Tokyo on 11 Dec 1994, which killed one passenger and injured 10 others.)

Responses to my 12 am/pm = noon/midnight? were mostly of these three forms:

1. 12 am is midnight, dummy;  don't bother me with this.
2. Either can mean either;  don't use these notations.
3. Tuesday goes from "12am Tues" to "midnight Tues" (and 12am = midnight)!

My conclusions:

1. Be careful in making assumptions about other people's assumptions.
2. I bet that somewhere in this world there's a routine that occasionally
time-stamps with the ASCII string "... 12:00 am" and a backup, restore
or merge routine that later misunderstands the date (misidentifying
the most recent version of a file, or whatever).

I think I can demonstrate how easy it is to make risky assumptions about
other people's assumptions, particularly regarding the phenomenon "don't
need this case -- it just couldn't get here."  We all know what scalene and
isosceles and equilateral triangles are, likewise we have crisp ideas about
squares, rhombuses, rectangles, parallelograms and trapezoids, yes?  I
invite you to demonstrate to yourselves your knowledge of
inclusion/intersection/exclusion relations among these objects by filling in
each of the following blanks with a 'No' or 'Some' or 'All'.  Use your own
self-assured knowledge here -- don't use a dictionary or other authority.
Please *don't* send me your answers unless you can fill in all the blanks

I would like to add some background as someone who has played in pachinko
parlors in Japan.  (The origin of the game of pachinko is rather vague.
Some say it is based on the ball game popular after the WW-II in U.S.A..
Anyway, it is a gambling business.)

The card in question acts as a kind of debit card inside the pachinko
parlors.  It was introduced a few years ago by an former police official,
with the expressed intention of keeping the money flow easy to track. (I
would say it was a ruse to make a few companies where the ex-police
officials can find jobs after retirement from the office. But I digress.)

The cards are sold to the pachinko parlors and the customers buy the cards
from the parlors, and obtain steel balls to play the game by inserting the
card into the slot next to the game machine.

Pachinko gambling works as follows.  When you win the game, the number of
steel balls in your possession increases and the customer can exchange the
balls with gifts.  (Therein lies a complication. Japanese law prohibits
gambling, and so exchanging the steel balls with real money is illegal.
*However*, first exchanging the balls with gifts, and then exchanging the
gifts with money at a third party outlet [which is quite likely to be
operated by the parlor owner] has been allowed by the police.) Speaking of
loophole! Some people do bring back the gifts to homes: depending on the
places, parlors carry game-boy cartridges, latest bestseller books, snack
food such as cookies, instant noodles, umbrella, purse, movie video tape,
music CD, to name a few as gifts. But if the customer wants to exchange
his/her win indirectly to money at the outlet, then he/she has to ask for
special gifts used essentially as money tokens by these establishments.
These are often a tiny gold/silver foil embedded in thin plastic slab, etc..
Each parlor/outlet pair uses different stuff. In my hometown, a special
brand of silk stocking was used as money token. This whole thing is a farce
in view of the anti-gambling law in Japan.)

Back to the card: the cards in question are used by two leading card
manufacturers. (There are another couple of late-entry companies whose cards
are not known to be attacked yet.) The card is based on the design done by
NTT Data.  NTT is the Japanese equivalent of old Ma Bell in the USA.  NTT
Data is a company that specializes in computer software integration,
communication and such.  I believe it designs the telephone card (debit card
used for pay-phone in Japan), too.

The pachinko card is the size of name card and plastic.  The details are not
published. To the best of my knowledge, I think there is a magnetic strip
that contains the card ID information such as its serial number and the
amount of debit money.

There were 10,000 yen, 5,000 yen, 3,000 yen, 2,000 yen, and 1,000 yen cards.
(I said "were" because 10,000 yen and 5,000 yen cards are no longer
available.)

Attack method:

&gt;From what I saw and read, the first card verification mechanism used by the
pachinko game machine was so primitive to defy rational explanation: each
time the card was used, a tiny hole was punched to indicate the amount left
in the card. As the customer uses the card, the position of the punched hole
on card shifts toward the zero position. Once there is a hole on the zero
position, the card is no longer usable.

The first simple attack as far as I can tell was to fill in the hole in the
card with tiny plastic (essentially the chaff produced when the hole is
punched was used to fill in the hole).  I am not sure if such simple attack
was possible, but it seemed possible really at the beginning with crude
modification of the magnetic data.

Then, of course, the magnetic information on the card was also modified in
more sophisticated ways when the card was used.

However, the bad people also learned and somebody stole the reader mechanism
and figure out the part of the magnetically-coded information: the result
was that bad people could buy the pristine 10,000 yen card and then uses up
to 2500 yen of the debit amount legally and then "re-fill" the card to 9500
yen worth, thus gaining 2000 yen for free again and again.  (Until 3000 yen
was used from the 10,000 yen card, the physical hole was not produced on the
card, and only the magnetic information was changed. Hence the mere
counterfeiting of the magnetic information was necessary to "revive" the
card. No physical re-filling of the card was necessary. Physically
re-filling the hole is easy to spot visually and was avoided by the bad
guys.)

[I have to confess that the exact amount involved in the counterfeiting
is a little uncertain. But the general idea still holds.]

Similar attack was possible with 5,000 yen card.

Presumably the gain by attacking 3,000 yen, 2,000 yen and 1,000 yen card was
small compared with the risk, the bad guys didn't attack these cards until
lately.

Now the situation is that of cats and mouse.  New counterfeiting
methods and counter-measures follow each other in rapid succession.

I believe that the cloning of the card was also done. But I don't know the
details.

Now, the card companies and pachinko parlors stopped issuing 10,000 yen and
5,000 yen cards because the damage was so large.

Also, they have installed special readers to verify the validity of the card
by incorporating more vigourous checking not available on the readers next
to the game machine: it used to be that the cards sold could by used by any
pachinko parlors in Japan. Now cards sold elsewhere have to be verified with
this machine before used at a local game parlor. Cards sold at the local
parlor can be used without such checking.

Already, there are reports of counterfeit-card usage:

- either the cards are so sophisticated that they can pass the enhanced
reader.
- Or the bad guys buy the cards locally and then use some of the
debit amount and then bring the cards to their factory to re-fill
and re-use it at the local store again and again.

The card companies have installed countermeasures in selected stores to the
cloning of the card by checking the serial number of the card and stopped
the operation of the whole game machines in the store if a card with the
serial number of the previously used (finished?) card is ever inserted into
the game machine.

Another simple method of fooling the reader was also reported about a month
ago. Essentially, it cuts out a long strip of the 3,000 yen card (now the
most expensive card after 10,000 yen and 5,000 yen card are gone) and
rotates the strip to invert its direction and then reassembles the card
again using cement or something. To my surprise, it was reported to be
deemed valid by some readers (!?). Apparently some readers only check for
the position of the hole on fixed position and fooled to believe the card is
valid if the hole is not in the expected position, etc.. Once not so
rigorous readers are distributed, it is very difficult to upgrade all of
them in Japan, I guess.

The problem is complicated in that the counterfeiting only damages the card
company. The parlors report the amount of debit money used in their shops
and then compensated for the amount (less the small surcharge by the card
company.)  This means that every time the counterfeit card is used the card
company alone loses money and the local parlor doesn't lose.

There have already been reports of the owners of the pachinko parlors
involved in the usage of the counterfeit cards.  These bad owners allowed
the bad guys to use the counterfeit cards in their parlors and pass the used
debit amount to the card company and getting compensated.

In these cases, the bad guys bring back the money (by simply exchanging the
phony debit money into the steel balls, and then without playing (they can
play if they wish), exchange the steel balls to the special gifts, and then
exchange the gifts with money. [Usually, buying the steel balls and then
exchanging them with gifts, and subsequently with money leaves you less
money than you started with. The house always wins. In this case, the bad
guys started out with counterfeit debit money and ends up with real money,
so it is OK for the bad guys.] The parlor also gets the money for the used
debit money. So they win, too.  Only the card companies lose.

Counterfeiting probably has existed since the first money (or equivalent)
was ever invented.  But, it surprised me that NTT Data approached the whole
scheme so naively, especially since there have been reports of telephone
card counterfeiting in Japan before.  Some of the counterfeiting methods
reported seemed so simple, and I have a doubt whether NTT Data was serious
enough to deter counterfeiting.

At least, I can safely say they have underestimated the ingenuity of the
counterfeiters badly and didn't learn from the counterfeiting of telephone
cards very well.

&gt; Hi, our names are XXXXX and XXXXX. We are in the 5th grade at the

&gt;
&gt; Please respond and then send this letter to anyone you communicate

I did NOT delete any original mail headers; the only headers
were those of some intermediate remailers who had forwarded only the
contents of the "original" note.

God help the ISP for tiac.net if this thing spreads as much as it seems
likely to do. I read this on a msgs board with hundreds of other readers,
which was only one of the many destination recipients of the intermediate
link in the chain who remailed this.

First of all, let's assume this is an honest, innocent post, not a hoax of
some sort. Let's note to begin with that as indicated by the mail cc's and
headers, those "2 letters" which were sent out have already been multiplied
a hundredfold across the internet by people who thought it was a cute idea.
Let's note further, to our horror, that there is no date on the note
indicating even when the "two weeks" is up. I'm very much afraid that this
may go on for decades (if it hasn't already :-O).

In fact, by asking around, I've found that at least one posting of this note
was sent out more than two weeks before the one I saw and copied here.

The general risks of the deliberate exploitation of wide e-mail distribution
are obvious and have been discussed many times, but more specifically we can
see a problem with an intended timed mailing for which the expiration date
was either lost, modified, or never provided in the first place (as in this
case).

There is an article in *The Boston Globe* 18 May 1996 entitled "AG to probe
access to psychiatric records". As usual, one has to guess what is really
going on and who is confused about what.

Apparently a local HMO has been including psychiatric records in its medical
history database. The first problem cited was the lack of effective access
control on that portion of the records. The HMO claims to have "..installed
software that limits access to the detailed notes ...".

The other problem is that, apparently, by placing the psychiatric history in
the medical record it becomes available to insurance agencies once the
patient has signed a release.

This seems to be a typical case of the computer forcing an issue that was
already lurking. Medical records are medical records. It seems that it was
an implicit (or even explicit) artifact of the paper system that the access
was controlled and, perhaps, the insurance companies did not get access. And
this was probably a good policy. But it might not have been legal if the
insurance companies have access to all records.

As an aside, I think that under Massachusetts law that patient has access to
all records which would presumably including the psychiatric transcripts. And
records mean any scribbles. Am I wrong on this?

Is this a matter of an issue being forced by the computerization? Does that
mean we must go back to shoeboxes so that records can be "lost" in order
protect privacy?

There is a risk that the rapid and competitive evolution of Smart Card
technology will result in a proliferation of data format standards that are
proprietary or national in nature. In particular, information categories
peripheral to financial transactions could suffer and the potential benefits
go unrealized in the immediate term. Medical data, particularly physician to
physician alerts and prescription medications and administration regimes are
an example. What principles should govern the programme to develop such
standards?: Keep it simple and extensible and end-use focused. Aim to keep
it international and spoken language independent. Build in configuration
management and downward compatibility as medicine and the delivery
technology evolve. Include communication protocols for further information.
Do not neglect promotion and training plans for practitioner's.

(From talking with a knowledgeable friend in the banking/ATM business:) The
First National Bank of Chicago/Cash Station 'glitch' was apparently the
result of a programming change intended to support the new out-of-area ATM
fees being proposed by various banking groups.  When the new transaction
messages were introduced to the network, some systems took the strange new
codes and transformed them into something they could understand: a posting
of a huge credit to one's account.

The RISKs here may be more serious than the traditional glitches in
electronic financial transactions.  What should transaction-based systems do
with unrecognizable or foreign input?

Part 1 (Computer as Goat):  Post-divorce wage gap statistic turns out to be
computer error

This is a rather old story and computer errors are the least of the problems
here.  Readers wishing a fuller well-documented account should see Susan
Faludi's book "Backlash" (1991), 1st edition, pages 19-25.

According to this account, Weitzman's book "The Divorce Revolution" was
published in 1985, contains the -73%:42% figures (for reduction and increase
in income after the 1st year of divorce), which are from a small sample size
(114 men; 114 women) of interviews from a low response rate of the divorcing
population in Los Angeles County.  The financial information is based on the
memory of those interviewed!  As early as 1986 the findings were questioned
by other divorce researchers whose own data indicated figures of
-30%:10%-15% (close to the recent -27%:10% figures for re-analysis of
Weitzman's data).  Requests for Weitzman's data, for re-analysis, remained
unfulfilled until late 1990 after appeals to the National Science
Foundation.

According to the 1996 AP article Weitzman still cannot identify the source
of the error ("She blames the loss of her original computer data file, a
weighting error or a mistake in the computer calculations performed by a
Stanford University research assistant."), and has left the re-analysis of
her data to other researchers (Richard Peterson in this case).

As Faludi's extensively-documented book points out the conclusions of poorly
conducted studies have real political and legal consequences.  In addition
they make "social science" more of an oxymoron, and hinder the efforts of
those researchers who do good, repeatable work in these fields.


Part 2:  Internet in danger (Nazi hate literature)

Jim Carroll seems to be misinterpreting the 80% statistic in several ways:

First, hate literature is likely a small fraction of all literature.
Therefore 80% of a small number is an even smaller number.

Second, he should find out "what 80% means?".  I have seen this figure in
the past, and I believe the context is regarding published Nazi hate
literature available by mail in Germany.  I am not sure that the figure even
includes e-mail or the Internet at all.

Third, the 80% of hate literature originating from Canada statistic does not
imply "80% of Canadians" at all.  Canada as a free-speech nation happens to
be a convenient safe point from which to send this stuff.  Furthermore this
probably does not imply that the literature was written or published in
Canada.  I would suspect that a good deal of it comes from my country, the
United States.

background.]

On Saturday, June 1, 1996, a commuter train operated by the Metro Atlanta
Regional Transit Authority (MARTA) had one car leave the track causing
injuries to 19 people and much embarrassment for the "Official Spectator
Transportation System" for the Olympic games.

According to local TV news and newspaper reports, the train had stopped
before a red signal apparently on automatic control.  The operator called
dispatch requesting permission to go to manual.  Permission was granted and
the operator proceeded *through the red signal* setting off alarms.  The
train was stopped and put into reverse.  As one of the middle cars passed
over a crossover switch some or all of its wheels were lifted and displaced.
The train stopped very suddenly tossing the operator and 18 passengers from
their seats.  MARTA does not consider this a derailment because no cars fell
on their sides.

A MARTA person interviewed on camera said there is no time that any train on
manual or automatic should pass a red signal.  The operator, the supervisor
on duty and the dispatcher have been suspended pending a review.

Personal opinion: this is a familiar scenario often repeated in RISKS but
apparently not yet learned by those responsible for critical safety systems.
Operator training and supervision must exceed the the capacity of a system
to cause harm to people.  Manual overrides must be designed to increase
safety not allow safety systems to be subverted.  In 47 days over a million
people will come to Atlanta.  There is no way MARTA can repair the public
relations damage caused by this incident in that time.

I ride the line on which this happened every day.  In the 4 years I have
been here I have found MARTA to be a safe and reliable system compared to
the alternative of driving through the daily carnage of the freeways.  I
will continue to use MARTA even though this incident has been a
disappointment to me.  Perhaps this will cause heightened vigilance and
improved supervision which may help prevent a larger disaster while every
news reporting organization in the world is in town.

Taipei's only subway line service was completely disrupted on Monday
morning, 3 June 1996, due to the simultaneous shutdown of both the main
computer and the backup system.  The control center ordered an emergency
shutdown of the entire system, which did not cause any train accidents or
casualties.

The subway company reported that at 9:27am on that morning, the main control
computer suddenly printed out 14 pages of extraneous program code.  Eight
minutes later, both the main control computer and the backup system went
down.  Maintenance engineers, with the help of a Matra engineer (the company
that supplied the control software), were unable to reboot either system.
Digital engineers (the company that supplied the hardware) arrived shortly
and discovered that one of the rebooting programs was missing.  They
reloaded the rebooting program from backup media and the subway line/system
returned to normal functions after four hours and thirty-four minutes.

The situation is complicated by the recent breakdown in contract
negotiations between the subway company and Matra for maintenance.  Matra
has taken back most of its maintenance personnel, but the subway company has
not fully acquired the capability for maintaining the entire system,
including the computing system, particularly the proprietary control
software written by Matra.

The subway company presumes the incident to be sabotage and has asked the
police authorities to investigate.  The police computer experts have
declared that it is difficult to investigate the control software consisting
of more than ten millions lines of code.  Furthermore, the police have not
ruled out the other possibilities such as operator error and software design
error.

In the public opinion section of the same newspaper, several readers
discussed the risks involved in this kind of incident.  The section title
was "The important question is: who should be responsible for computer
security", subtitle "who sabotaged the computer is secondary."

(Source: digest/translation of news from United Daily News, Taipei, 5 June
1996.)

[5 June?  Oh, yes, remember the International Date Line.  But if you
indulge in international dates in Taipei, be prepared for Matra-mony.
And note that MARTA and Matra are anagrams.  They seemed to belong
together.  PGN]

Cryptography is certainly not the only way to hide information, and in some
cases perhaps not even the best way.  For a delightful easy-to-read book on
a range of related topics with particular attention to steganography (for
example, hiding information so that it perfectly naturally looks like
something else, such as making your encrypted PGP message look like a .gif
file of the Mona Lisa), consider Peter Wayner's new book.  It is a gold mine
full of fascinating nuggets, and they all seem to fit together into a
brand-new golden oldie.

Rejecting Clinton Administration arguments that law enforcement efforts
would be hampered by cryptography technology now based on a "key escrow"
system allowing the government to decode any electronic communications after
obtaining a court order, a report prepared for the National Research Council
of the National Academy of Sciences says that unbreakable cryptography would
actually help prevent crime by preventing criminals from intercepting
legitimate business transactions.  The report recommends dropping steep
export controls currently placed by the government on products using the
56-bit key Data Encryption Standard, which offers significantly greater
communications security than the 40-bit-key code that may be freely
exported.  (*The New York Times*, 31 May 1996, p. C1; Edupage 2 June 1996)

Summary: Tricking pager owners to do the harassment for you

While trying to catch some Zs, my pager went off twice in quick succession.
The number was one I did not recognize, XXX-XXXX-911.  I called the number
and a limousine service answered.  Turns out that some guy had been
harassing the women there over the phone, and now he has gotten innocent
bystanders to help him unwittingly.  Apparently this guy obtained a list of
pager numbers (or found an exchange that is densely populated with pager
numbers) and is sending the limousine company's phone number out.  The
police are involved, but are having a difficult time tracking down the
culprit.  They believe he is using one or more pirated cellular telephones.

The following article appeared on the front page of the *Sunday Times*

headline 'City surrenders to 400m-pound gangs':

City of London financial institutions have paid huge sums to international
gangs of sophisticated "cyber terrorists" who have amassed up to 400m
worldwide by threatening to wipe out computer systems.  Banks, broking firms
and investment houses in America have also secretly paid ransoms to prevent
costly computer meltdown and a collapse in confidence among their customers,
according to sources in Whitehall and Washington.

An Insight investigation has established that British and American agencies
are examining more than 40 "attacks" on financial institutions in New York,
London and other European banking centres since 1993. Victims have paid up
to 13m a time after the blackmailers demonstrated their ability to bring
trading to a halt using advanced "information warfare" techniques learnt
from the military.

According to the American National Security Agency (NSA), they have
penetrated computer systems using "logic bombs" (coded devices that can be
remotely detonated) electromagnetic pulses and "high emission radio
frequency guns", which blow a devastating electronic "wind" through a
computer system.  They have also left encrypted threats at the highest
security levels, reading: "Now do you believe we can destroy your
computers?"

The authorities have been unable to stem the attacks, which are thought to
originate from the United States. In most cases, victim banks have failed to
notify the police. "They have given in to blackmail rather than risk a
collapse in confidence in their security systems," said a security director
at one blue-chip merchant bank in the City.  A senior detective in the City
of London police said: "We are aware of the extortion methods, but the
banking community has ways of dealing with it and rarely reports to the
police."

European and American police forces have set up special units to tackle the
cyber criminals who, Ministry of Defence sources believe, have netted
between 200m and 400m globally over the past three years. But law
enforcement agencies complain that senior financiers have closed ranks and
are hindering inquiries.

Experts in information warfare met in Brussels last month to discuss
defensive measures. Representatives included Captain Patrick Tyrrell,
assistant director of computer information strategy at the Ministry of
Defence; General James McCarthy, professor of national security at the US
Air Force Academy, General Jean Pichot-Duclos, director of the economic
intelligence department of the French Defence Council, and senior figures
from the civilian computer industries.

A separate closed meeting involving representatives from Whitehall and the
intelligence community was held to analyse the 40 attacks on British and
American financial centres since 1993. A further secret seminar took place
in Washington this weekend.

Kroll Associates, the international investigating firm, confirmed last week
that it had acted for financial institutions that have been blackmailed.
"One of the problems we face is that the potential embarrassment from loss
of face is very serious," said a spokesman in New York. Kroll had evidence
that firms in London and New York had been targeted.  "The problem for law
enforcement is that the crime is carried out globally, but law enforcement
stops at the frontier," he said.

Yesterday a Bank of England spokesman acknowledged the threat from
extortionists: "We are aware of this. It does exist. It is extortion and
fraud." But the spokesman also insisted: "It is not the biggest issue in the
banking market."

Scotland Yard is now taking part in a Europe-wide initiative to catch the
cyber criminals and has appointed a senior detective from it's computer
crime unit to take part in an operation codenamed Lathe Gambit. Such is the
secrecy that few details about the inquiry have emerged.

In America, the FBI has set up three separate units to investigate computer
extortion.  The NSA believes there are four cyber gangs and has evidence
that at least one is based in Russia. The agency is now examining four
examples of blackmail said to have occurred in London:

o January 6, 1993: Trading halted at a broking house after blackmail threat
and computer crash. Ransom of #10m paid to account in Zurich.

o January 14, 1993: a blue-chip bank paid #12.5m after blackmail threats.

o January 29, 1993: a broking house paid #10m in ransom after similar threats.

o March 17, 1995: a defence firm paid #10m in ransom.

In all four incidents, the gangs made threats to senior directors and
demonstrated that they had the capacity to crash a computer system. Each
victim conceded the blackmailer's demands within hours and transferred the
money to off-shore numbered accounts, from which it was removed by the gangs
within minutes.

The techniques have varied. In London, criminals posing as marketing firms
have gained detailed knowledge of a target's system by interviewing the
heads of information technology departments. In some cases, they have even
issued questionnaires to unsuspecting officials. Armed with this
information, they have been able to breach security and leave encrypted
messages warning of their capability.

The gangs are believed to have gained expertise in information warfare
techniques from the American military which is developing "weapons" that can
disable or destroy computer hardware. Some are also known to have infiltrated
banks simply by placing saboteurs on their payroll as temporary staff.

Little is yet known about the identities of the gangs, but, according to the
NSA, America is the main source of the attacks. It believes that at least
one other group originates from Russia and has followed the movement of
money to the former Soviet States.

A spokesman for the Metropolitan police said: "There is potential for
extortion from those purporting to know how to damage computer systems. "The
computer crime unit liaises where necessary with it's Euro counterparts to
discuss cross-frontier crimes."

One merchant bank director said yesterday: "You will never get a financial
institution to admit it has an extortion policy, let alone that it has paid
money to blackmailers."

Personally, I view this story with marked scepticism. I have no
doubt that it is true to a certain extent, but the idea of banks
forking out ten million pounds (circa $14m) to a blackmailer is
one I find slightly unrealistic.

In any case, I'm sure we'll hear more about this story in the
future.

A few days ago, a subscriber to Yacht-L (a sailing-related mailing list)
decided to post a few useful equations to the list.  Some of the equations
involved time/speed/distance conversions, with distance represented by "D".

Unfortunately, he used a MIME-enabled mailer to do the posting, and
MIME decided that the nasty old "equals" sign was a sufficiently weird
character that had best be encoded in hex.  It happens that the proper
hex is "3d", but MIME likes upper-case -- and to make matters really
bad, it introduces the hex code with an equals sign.

So the equation:

S = D / T

became:

S =3D D / T

to the great confusion of many list subscribers, who couldn't
understand why you would want to square and triple the distance in
such a simple equation.

The RISK?  When inventing a standard, one should consider the impact
on non-conforming systems.

It all started innocently enough.  Last night somebody sent a message to the
recreational mailing list "<A HREF="mailto:virtua-fighter@netcom.com">virtua-fighter@netcom.com</A>".  This is an
infrequently used mailing list for the discussion of the Virtua Fighter
family of SEGA arcade games.  Since the last time somebody had used the list
a Microsoft employee left the company -- perhaps he died -- and the mail
address is no longer valid.  Microsoft is a helpful company and informed the
list (automatically, of course) that the address is not valid.  Netcom is a
helpful list server and sent the message to all recipients of the list,
including the late, lamented employee of Microsoft.  And so it continued.
And continued.

It's now morning.  I'm receiving a message every two or so minutes, the
subject line has maxed out with "Undeliverable: Undeliverable: ...".
Members of the list have just begun arriving at their desks and discovering
over 150 messages from <A HREF="mailto:postmaster@microsoft.com">postmaster@microsoft.com</A> via the virtua-fighter
mailing list.  Naturally, they panic and rush to unsubscribe from the list.
Not knowing how to do that, they send an "unsubscribe" message to -- where
else -- "<A HREF="mailto:virtua-fighter@netcom.com">virtua-fighter@netcom.com</A>".  Which sends a message to the user at
Microsoft.  So far we've had five attempts to unsubscribe.

As I've been composing this mail, the frequency of new mail has increased to
more than one message per minute.

Oh no.  There's a bad address at dartmouth.edu.  It replied to the list too.
I suppose I can hope that it won't reply to its own replies.  But I'm sure
that Microsoft will.  And since the Dartmouth message is responding to a
Microsoft "Failed Mail" message, that part of the loop is working just fine.

Hmm, I just found out that our outgoing mail server isn't working, though our
incoming one is working just fine.

I love computers.

One final postscript: I just received a message (two hours after the above
portions were written) from the list maintainer -- the list is now dead.  I
also haven't received any new autoreply messages for an hour.  Seems that
the storm has passed.

I've just seen the announcement for a new Web server facility called
SiteShield(tm) (see <A HREF="http://maximized.com/products/siteshield/">http://maximized.com/products/siteshield/</A>)
&gt;From their marketing information:

: SiteShield is an exciting new concept in Web content protection.
: SiteShield permits content providers to place copyright-protected images
: on web pages without the fear that they can easily be stolen and
: re-used. Employing proprietary server-based technology, SiteShield
: allows webmasters to simply indicate which images need protection.
: Finally, webmasters can feel confident that the images they are placing
: on web sites are being protected.

What it appears to do is send an intentionally corrupted image if the
Referer: header indicates that the page from which the image was
referenced is not on the same site as the image itself.

There are a number of problems with this concept, but the most glaring
is that once the image has been displayed on the screen it can easily
be captured and saved to a file, thus completely defeating the entire
purpose of the product.

The Xanadu solution is to transcopyright the images, granting prior
permission for them to be referenced online providing a link back to
the original site is maintained.

THE RISKS?  Well, apart from the obvious risk that the product may
well fail since it can be so easily defeated, it probably also won't
work with older browsers that don't return the Referer: header and
is known to have problems (as you would expect) with caches.

Counting glitch delays final Cape Town result

Reuters Financial Report  6/1/96 10:34 AM

&gt;&gt;    CAPE TOWN, June 1 (Reuter) - A computer error forced
&gt;&gt;officials on Saturday to award South Africa's ANC an extra seat
&gt;&gt;in Cape Town's first post-apartheid city election and the
&gt;&gt;glitch will delay the final outcome until next week.
&gt;&gt;    Election officials said 2,000 ANC votes and one seat in the
&gt;&gt;city's Tygerberg area, which includes the black township
&gt;&gt;Khayelitsha where the party is strong, had wrongly been given
&gt;&gt;to a tiny religious party.  [...]

&gt;&gt;    Results were expected on Friday or shortly thereafter but
&gt;&gt;the formula under which the council is elected -- a mix of ward
&gt;&gt;seats and proportional representation -- will now have to be
&gt;&gt;put through computers again.  [...]

[DMK: To see if the glitch is reproducible?  The article is chiefly about SA
politics, with no specific description of the "glitch" and actions to
prevent it from reproducing.]

&gt;&gt;    ANC officials said they wanted a swift explanation from the
&gt;&gt;chief election officer about what went wrong and would consider
&gt;&gt;court action over the election results if he failed to respond.
&gt;&gt;    "If they could make that mistake in one ward, the chances
&gt;&gt;are that other mistakes have been made elsewhere," Western Cape
&gt;&gt;ANC leader Chris Nissen told Reuters.

Detroit Edison's residential electric bill has a section titled "Energy Use
Report."  This section reports incorrect numbers due to improper integer
roundoff.

One of the fields gives the average daily energy use for the month in
Kilowatt-hours, rounded to the nearest integer value.  Another field gives
the percent change against the same month for the previous year.

The percent change is calculated using the rounded value for energy use.
This can result in large errors.  For example, my February 1996 use was
11.68 KWh/day, compared to 11.21 the previous year.  After rounding this
becomes 12 compared to 11, and the change is reported on the bill as 9
percent (12/11 - 1) instead of the correct 4 percent (11.68/11.21 - 1).

I wrote to Detroit Edison about this.  Their only response was an offer to
"assist [you] in understanding how the percentage ... is calculated."  Since
I already know how it is calculated (incorrectly), I declined the offer.

One RISK would be to assume that the entire bill is correct just because
part of it (the billed amount) is subject to government regulation.

L-Vis (Live Video Insertion System) allows arbitrary images to be
superimposed on television pictures (for example, for advertising purposes)
but without those images appearing to live audiences or on instant replays.
The Princeton Video Image system "uses missile guidance technology and a
customized computer" to insert electronic billboards in the viewer-perceived
program.  The computer system recognizes familiar patterns (such as the wall
behind home plate in a baseball stadium) and automagically inserts the
desired logo or other graphic in the specified location.  The image is
logically removed whenever it would in the real world be physically obscured
from camera view (e.g., by a batter or umpire).  [Source: *San Francisco
Chronicle*, 6 Jun 1996, p. A1 and A13.]

Subliminal advertising was tried in movies back in the 1950s.  This is
perhaps more insidious, because you can no longer tell what is real and what
is virtual.  Added icons of virtual victuals depicting the sponsor's
products all over the ball park -- perhaps even on the pitched balls, with
adjustments for spin?  The label on the Cincinnati Reds' owner's favorite
beverage transformed into the sponsor's label, or Schottzie overlayed as a
pit bull?  Think how the TV producers could alter Chicago Bulls' Dennis
Rodman's appearance (pet bull?), dynamically color coordinating to adapt to
the arena surroundings.  Signs visible to the live audience (such as "Smoke
El Hempos") could be transformed appropriately (e.g., "DON'T Smoke El
Hempos") for the TV audience, to satisfy an emerging FCC broadcast
regulation against tobacco.  L-vis has absolutely glorious RISKS-related
possibilities, such as when the pattern recognizer indentifies something
that unexpectedly happens to match the given rules.  A contradictory message
might get added to the sponsor's message, or an obscenity might emerge as an
inadvertent juxtaposition of symbols.  Stay tuned for more excitement
appearing in RISKS on this one!  PGN

There is another serious security bug in the class loading code for all
currently available Java browsers:

Netscape up to versions 2.02 and 3.0beta4 (except Windows 3.x)
Oracle PowerBrowser for Win32
HotJava 1.0beta
'appletviewer' from the Java Development Kit up to version 1.0.2

Sun, Netscape, and Oracle have been sent details of the problem (which is
partly related to the ClassLoader attack found by Drew Dean, et al. in
March).  The attack works by exploiting a design flaw in the mechanism that
separates JVM classes into different namespaces.

Using this bug, an attacker can bypass all of Java's security restrictions.
This includes reading and writing files, and executing native code on the
client with the same permissions as the user of the browser.

The only way to avoid this problem at the moment is to disable Java. For
more details see
<A HREF="http://ferret.lmh.ox.ac.uk/~david/java/bugs/">http://ferret.lmh.ox.ac.uk/~david/java/bugs/</A>

Technical details will be posted when Sun, Netscape, and Oracle release
patches.

David Hopwood, a Java researcher in the UK, has uncovered a new security bug
in Java [<A HREF="/Risks/18.18.html">RISKS-18.18</A>].  In simple terms, he has been able to manipulate the
way objects are assigned and the way they collaborate, in order to undermine
the applet security manager.

Hopwood contacted JavaSoft directly re: the bug, and we have had a team
working on a fix for the past 72 hours.  In addition, we are applying
Hopwood's model to conduct a security review, to determine if there are
other bugs that may apply.

We are currently thoroughly testing the fix, and plan to release a patch as
soon as possible.  As we complete more testing of the fix, a more detailed
description of the bug and the fix will be added to the JavaSoft security
FAQ at <A HREF="http://java.sun.com/sfaq/">http://java.sun.com/sfaq/</A>.

JavaSoft is grateful for the internet security community's active interest
in reviewing our code and we welcome feedback that makes Java better
technology.

This is an old hat, but it still keeps coming up.

A co - worker of mine was doing experiments on a heat exchanger; he was also
modelling it with a FORTRAN (77) program that ran on a PC.

One dimensionless quantity used in heat-exchanger theory is the Nusselt
number, defined as

Nu = alpha * l / lambda

(alpha is the heat transfer coefficient, l a characteristic length, and
lambda the thermal conductivity).

The name of the variable he chose was NU; he did not declare this variable,
so the FORTRAN compiler implicitly typed it as an integer.  Since the range
of NU was between 10 and 200, this introduced a maximum error of 10% to 0.5%
in his calculations - small enough not to be noticed immediately.  I don't
want to make a bet on how many commercial heat-exchanger design codes make
the same error.

Related is the "5/9" problem (this expression silently evaluates to
0 in FORTRAN and C), which often bugs translations of formulas by
hand into FORTRAN, which makes a**(5/9) equal to 1.

Some tools (notably ftnchek for FORTRAN 77) recognize this, and issue
a warning.  Unfortunately, these tools are not in wide use in the
scientific community.

"A COMPUTER error swivelled the nozzles of Ariane 5's two
giant boosters, sending Europe's most powerful rocket off
course to its destruction, the European Space Agency said
yesterday.  [...]
"Investigators do not have to collect debris or hunt for a
black box. Final analysis of what confused the guidance
system will come from a study of the tapes that contain the
telemetry messages that constantly reported the status of
the launcher's computer and on-board systems. The data will
be fed into computer simulators, run by Aerospatiale and
CNES, the French space agency."

Given Aerospatiale's record with the Airbus, it'll be interesting to
see if they come up with "pilot error" as the cause! :-))

Faulty computer blamed in Ariane rocket failure

Experts studying the moments before the Ariane-5 rocket explosion
say faulty computer software may be to blame for the rocket veering
off course. Apparently, the rocket was misfed information that made
it think it was not following the right path. The rocket then
changed direction, causing the upper part to began to break apart.

After the European Space Agency's little problem this week and the reports
now filtering out that is was 'a computer error', it sounds more like a
sensor fault or a wiring fault.  (Apparently, the computer tried to correct
for what it thought was a disturbance to its trajectory and then set the
thrusters full over - one big disturbance or was it positive feedback).

Anyway, the ground controls hit the 'explode' button.

Why O why didn't the payload have a chute. After all it must have had
separator blasts. The 'abort and blow up' sequence could have consisted of a
'separate and chute' the payload stage followed by blow up the rest.

Didn't the early Apollo missions do this, or some other satellite launchers.

Is this complacency at work here.

What a risk - millions of (pounds, dollars, whatever - big in anyone's
currency) and all that work.

On 4 June 1996 the Ariane 5 prototype European space launcher veered off
course and was destroyed by its controllers 40 seconds after blast-off
(details from *The Guardian*, UK 5th June 1996). The launcher development
had cost UKP5bn (pounds sterling) and the explosion destroyed a UKP500M
four-satellite experiment to monitor the sun, and as the headline
says..."And It Wasn't Insured".

Leaving consideration of what went wrong until details emerge, it is worth
noting aspects that were successful or at least were not as poorly managed
as may appear. Firstly, there was no loss of life - the safety precautions
for destruction by ground control worked as planned (the TV pictures showed
the destruction happened within seconds of the off-course problems becoming
visible, suggesting that either data had already indicated problems or that
the controllers were remarkably responsive at pressing a pretty expensive
button). Secondly, the European Space Agency is in a risk taking business,
and the price of risk taking is occasional failure - Ariane 5 is the follow
on to existing Ariane rockets that bring the agency's commercial arm UKP666M
per year, with a waiting list valued at nearly UKP3.3bn. Thirdly, regarding
the financial losses, it is nigh on impossible to obtain insurance for test
flights, and the cargo was being flown for free (the scientists responsible
for the experiments didn't have the budget for a paying flight, so took the
risk of a prototype launch).

It is certain that there will be lessons from the investigation, but it is
worth noting that, but for some risk management at the high level, it could
have been much worse and that risks were recognised by the participants,
even if not adequately protected against.

Although the uninsured satellite was carried on a free flight with known
risks that it wouldn't work right first time, I think we now know that
there's no such thing as a free launch.

Personally I think they should bring back Blue Streak.

Actually, as readers of the Airbus thread will know, I have a bias in favour
of the European aircraft industry - whether I would travel in a capsule on
Ariane Five is another matter, but I remember the quote about what either
John Glenn or Alan Shepherd thought about when waiting to launch ("the
rocket contains 5 million parts, all made by the lowest bidder" ,
approximately) so I suppose launch vehicles will inevitably be either
unreliable, or Bad Value For Money - so make sure your satellites are all
reproducible by CAD/CAM. And perhaps there should be a few more CASE and
automatic testing systems around?.

So for a change the risk is, there might not be enough computerisation?

Although I sign this stating where I work, this is very definitely my
personal opinion, not RAL's!!!, however the destruction of the rocket when
it went off course and tried to attack French Guiana made the national news
here: I don't think my bad publicity will equal what Ariane has had from the
press. The satellite design computer was attacked by organised hackers via
Sweden a month or so ago - perhaps this was an indication of how the Eastern
Bloc intends to prop up its launcher industry?. In any case, it's worth
bearing in mind that this sort of"navigation error" could easily creep in if
a virus or a hacker gets onto the development computers. Computer security
that's worth money isn't only confined to banks.

Some of the readers of RISKS will recall that I reported an accidental
shooting down of an F-15 fighter plane by another F-15 during interception
training of the Japanese air force last December.

To refresh your memory, what happened was that
- Two F-15 airplanes took place in an interception training.
- One of the planes carried live missiles.
The reason given was that the airplanes were routinely engaged in
REAL interception missions and taking missiles off takes time.
(BAD decision: They ought to have unload the live missiles in
the first place.)
- The main fire unit was supposed to be off (by turning off main switch).
- However, somehow, it got turned on. (static electricity problem?)
- Despite the visual cue on the main firing display console,
which showed that the main firing system was ON and live,
the pilot triggered the firing button, and launched a sidewinder
missile against another F-15.
- The F-15 was hit and destroyed. The pilot escaped by parachute.

The defense agency released its investigation report on the the
accident.  (I think it was released last week.)  Some newspapers had
articles following the release of the report, but they are all
sketchy. My conclusion after reading articles is this.

- Yes, indeed, the main firing system was turned on. But, they could
not determine the cause of the malfunction(!).

- The report seemed to imply that the visual cue on the firing
console ought to have alerted the pilot that the system was live
and that the pilot should have taken notice and refrained from
triggering the missile.
(I think Japanese pilots have less live missile traing than, say,
U.S., or Israel pilots, and so pilots may have tough time figuring
out what the real operating modes are from complex computer
display alone. Well, this is the reason they need training in the
first place anyway, though.)

- (To my disbelief) It was suggested some type of plastic cap be
placed on the main trigger during future training missions to
prevent pilots from triggering(!?).

Frankly speaking, I was pretty much dismayed at the depth of of the
investigation.  It didn't really go to the bottom of the malfunction.

The same hardware/software problem might persist in other F-15s in Japan.
(It was not clear whether same type of problems are ever reported before in
the U.S.A.. My understanding is that F-15s used in Japan are licensed and
manufactured in Japanese factories. But computer firing systems are often
brought in as is from U.S.A. as black boxes.)

The last low-tech solution to the prevention of triggering the missile
was almost comical.

Some conspiracy theorists could argue that the air force might want to hide
some mistakes during the manufacturing of Japanese version of F-15 by
shifting blame on the pilot. But I digress..

Now that the Japanese naval boat shot down a U.S. airplane off Hawaii,
I am interested how far the investigation of *THIS* accident goes and
what way. I hope they nail down the cause this time around.

&gt;From the Roanoke Times (May 15th, 1996 edition):

&gt; A Virginia Tech official failed to see any humor when a student
&gt; newspaper erroneously listed her job title last month as "Director of
&gt; Butt Licking.  Sharon Yeagle was so unamused she filed an $850,000
&gt; defamation lawsuit...

&gt; ...[The paper's] editors say the phrase was part of a computer system
&gt; template never meant to be published.

The newspaper involved is the Collegiate Times, the student run paper of
Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University.  In an article on page
A6 of the April 30th edition, the paper ran an article about seven students
who were accepted into the Governor's Fellows Program.  In the center of the
article was a featured quote from Sharon Yeagle, an assistant to the vice
president of student affairs.

Unfortunately for the newspaper, the template used for the layout
contained a "humorous" title meant to be replaced.  Somehow the quote and
quotee were filled in but her title was never entered and the
placeholder, "Director of Butt Licking" was published instead.

And this is not the first time this has happened.  According to the
article in the Roanoke Times, in the Oct. 27th issue the phrase also
appeared.  However, that time an accurate quote was attributed to a false
name and a false title.

The risks?  If you're going to have a generic template, make it generic.
And if something bad happens once, it's going to happen again so fix it
after the first occurrence.  Personally, when I'm writing and need to
leave something to be completed later I always enter in a string of at
least five question marks.   It has become second nature for me to search
for that string before "committing" my writing.  And when I've forgotten,
it has resulted in some confusion but fortunately no lawsuits.

In <A HREF="/Risks/18.15.html">RISKS-18.15</A>, Bob Morrell takes an assertion (cited from <A HREF="/Risks/18.13.html">RISKS-18.13</A>) that
a particular ISP would triple its throughput if it accepted alt.binaries and
parlays that into a claim that the Internet is mainly about pornography.
Occam's Razor suggests a more general explanation: Images contain much more
information than text, regardless of content.

Here is an example.  I am writing a book.  A picture will fill the front
cover; a smaller picture will appear on the back cover.  The publisher sent
me a JPEG file representing the front cover; that file is 252,368 bytes.
The file with the back-cover picture is 54,070 bytes.  Total: slightly more
than 306,000 bytes.

The entire text of the book (400 pages) is just under 695,000 bytes
[that is, excluding the covers].

In this case, a picture is worth much more than a thousand words.

&gt;&gt;    Personally, I view this story with marked scepticism. I have no
&gt;&gt;    doubt that it is true to a certain extent, but the idea of banks
&gt;&gt;    forking out ten million pounds (circa $14m [sic]) to a
&gt;&gt;    blackmailer is one I find slightly unrealistic.

I have in the past done computer security work for several large banking
institutions which everyone has heard of.  In my opinion, with respect to
the business case of choosing to pay blackmail or fix the problem, it is
cheaper to make a few blackmail payments than to protect an entire
multinational (or even single-nation) banking organization with strong
information security (cryptography, of course).  This is probably true even
with five "cyber terrorist" organizations operating, but this obviously does
not scale well.

This is, of course, disappointing (especially speaking as someone who might
attempt to make all that money legitimately designing security systems).
However, I don't find it surprising at all.  One blackmail payment of this
level approximates the daily operating expenses of one of these
organizations.  Consider this loss alone, ignoring the lost profits and
public relations nightmare, and you might pay the blackmail, too.

What these banks are surely not considering is that there are many other
advantages to strong information security.  Some bans are considering this,
but not quickly enough, IMHO.

I've believed for a long time that the people who need security most won't
do anything until they personally feel some intense pain.  (This is
analogous to the multitude of people who didn't believe in regular backups
until one of their disks crashed.)  If there was another Barings which
folded due to inadequate security instead of financial mismanagement, maybe
then the banking industry would do something real, and stop complaining at
how painful security was.  An ounce of prevention, and all that.

Attorney General Janet Reno has told the FBI, CIA, and Commerce, Defense,
Energy, Transportation and Treasury Departments that she wants to create a
federal computer security emergency response unit to counter physical or
network attacks against the federal computer infrastructure (*Computer
Industry Daily*, 6 Jun 1996).  And some U.S. senators want to allow the FBI
to combine forces with the CIA and other intelligence agencies to deal with
international criminal and terrorist activity conducted on the Net.  Senator
Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) says that "if we're going to live in this kind of world,
we're going to have to link the intelligence world with law enforcement."
Vanderbilt business professor Donna L. Hoffman, whose work is focused on the
Internet, says: ''There are not dead bodies in the street.  It just doesn't

Flight International (5-11 June 1996, p8) reports that the crew of a
Martinair B767-300 registration PH-MCH `faced blank flight-instrument
displays' near the US coastline on a flight from Amsterdam to Orlando, FL on
28 May 1996. Apparently it had suffered an EFIS failure (EFIS is the
industry acronym for the system which displays the flight data on screens in
front of the pilots -- a feature of most modern transport aircraft.

The EFIS failure itself was not such a big issue. The plane continued on the
electro-mechanical standby instruments and diverted to Boston, where it
landed safely -- but very fast, with no flaps, spoilers, autobrake or
anti-skid. It burst 8 mainwheel tires and the brakes caught fire (neither
event unusual in a fast landing and heavy stop) and the fire was quickly
extinguished. Martinair said the crew employed `flaps one', which extends
leading-edge spoilers only, and that they had no reverse thrust.

Martinair said the aircraft had a partial DC-power failure, but an unnamed
767 captain apparently said that such an event would not cause an EFIS
failure.  Boeing said reports of a complete power failure are `not
confirmed'.

I recently installed Netscape 3.0b4, a beta version, to try out the new
(compared to 1.1N) features and see how well FreeBSD runs foreign binaries.

One of the new features, a security feature strangely categorized as a
'network' feature, queries the user before allowing "cookies" to be set.
Out of curiousity I set it so as to find out how often this feature was
invoked.  Cookies (discussed in earlier RISKS volumes, I seem to recall)
[YES: <A HREF="/Risks/14.36.html">RISKS-14.36</A>, 17.89.  PGN] are documented at
<A HREF="http://www.netscape.com/newsref/std/cookie_spec.html">http://www.netscape.com/newsref/std/cookie_spec.html</A> .

I was surprised to find that every night for the last two weeks after
enabling this I've been handed a "cookie" by a site I never knowingly
visited, at <A HREF="http://ad.doubleclick.net">http://ad.doubleclick.net</A> .

Upon visiting this site I discovered they engage in attempts to collect
various data about web users including their o/s.  Why they feel it
necessary to 'ping' me each night to set a cookie I do not know, but it
seems they are also collecting data about browser usage.  Such a statistic
regarding times online while in a browser would seem valuable from a
marketing standpoint.

While cookies may be useful when voluntary and insofar as they may be
helpful to the user (as I feel the cookie I'm handed that avoids an access
validator for a particular newspaper's site).  Cookies from marketing
companies benefit me not.

Categorize this as a risk to users of older netscapes lacking the
conditional-cookie setting?  Or to advertisers who will find their targets
are hidden behind "mini" HTTP firewalls that hide the users from cookies
along with advertisement filter such as the one being tested by a North
Carolina startup?

up limited computing resources for students and business folks.
Oregon State University's business school manager says, "I had
a problem with games," noting that some students spent hours
playing games while others were waiting their turn at the
keyboard to complete assignments.  UnGame scans the hard drive
for any of 4,600 games every time the computer is turned on or
logged on to the network.  The list of games is updated every
month.  More than 20 colleges and universities are using the
software now.  (*Chronicle of Higher Education*, 7 Jun 1996, A24)

see that the 250K+ file had shrunk to 1K. I downloaded the alleged FAQ and
found that it contained an article posted to alt.usage.english. The author
suggested that, because of its size, the FAQ should no longer be posted to
the newsgroup, since "it is available on the WEB, by e-mail, and by ftp".
The message subject line was, not surprisingly, "alt.usage.english FAQ":
apparently it was enough to fool the archiving program into assuming that
the article *was* the FAQ.

This would seem to open up interesting possibilities for anyone objecting to

The German newspaper *Tageszeitung* reports in its issue from 6 June 1996
(6/6/6!) that the software for the engine-controlling in Ariane 5 was made
by the French company Matra Corp.  This is the same company that made the
software for the Taipei subway system that crashed on 3 June 1996
(<A HREF="/Risks/18.17.html">RISKS-18.17</A>).

First statements from DASA, ESA and ArianeSpace say, that there were 37
seconds after the start an movement of all engines in one direction, causing
the Ariane 5 into an extreme flight position. This disrupted the main
structure of the vehicle and triggered an automated destruction mechanism.
Some seconds later the manual destruction from ground control was triggered
by the flight security officer for redundancy.  According to German press
agency Deutsche Presse Agentur, one manager of the French space agency CNES
stated that the computer has tried to compensate a nonexistent problem in
flight control by making this massive move.

So, for me there are two possible reasons for the crash:

* there was an sensor failure, transmitting false data about the external
conditions (wind, flight position) to the control system, or

* there was an real Software "glitch" causing the critical failure.

On the base of the information available now, I ask myself, why was there no
mechanism to avoid the control computers' attempt to go into this extreme
flight position?

David Wood suggested some form of parachute ejection and recovery system for
payloads.  The usual problems with this scheme are weight, cost, and
complexity.  Mercury and Apollo had launch escape systems to pull the
capsule off the top of the launch vehicle either on the pad or during early
flight.  These systems were jettisoned on the way up to improve flight
performance (get rid of the weight penalty.)

The Challenger disaster reminded us all of how useful such systems are for
saving crew.  Launch escape mechanisms to get the shuttle away from the
external tanks and solid boosters on the pad and in flight were scrapped
early due to the weight and complexity penalties, not to mention some valid
safety concerns.  (The Space Shuttle can actually abort during launch under
specific conditions and return to the landing strip at Kennedy, or go on to
a down-range site, or ditch in the ocean.  Had sensors been available to
tell the crew or ground controllers of the burn-through problem, one of
these abort modes might have been employed with the chance of saving the
crew if not the vehicle.)

To my knowledge, no launch vehicle intended to orbit an unmanned payload has
carried a launch-phase recovery system.  Ariane 5 is a heavy lift vehicle,
making a structure to hold the payload through a separation event, thrusting
away from the vehicle, chute deployment, and splashdown in the
Caribbean/Atlantic would be a marvel of a vehicle itself.  I am not
convinced parachutes could even be made to handle the weight of an Ariane 5
payload.  And individual recovery systems for the "n" individual satellite
payloads just multiplies the complexity by "n."

Adding launch-phase recovery systems to expendable launch vehicles would
further increase launch costs not only for the mechanisms but for the
down-range recovery personell and facilities that would be required for each
flight, just in case.  Launch costs are already so high as to stifle
commercial development of space.  Re-usable, robust launch vehicles like the
DC-X, X-33, etc. promise to reduce launch costs and offer some advantages in
these areas....  Witness the successful landing of the DC-X after an engine
explosion (my memory fails me as to when in the flight test program this
was).

Launch vehicle failures will occur, as do failures in any complex system.
Until someone finds a way to get into space other than by riding atop a
controlled explosion, there is only so much risk avoidance you can do.  And
from then on it's risk management. Taking a "free" ride on a new launch
vehicle is a higher risk than buying a ride on a "proven" launch vehicle.
But if you can't afford the ticket, you must decide if the risk of failure
is worth the scientific/commercial/political rewards of success.

On the other extreme, I remember NASA taking heat in the Apollo days for the
fact that the first Saturn launch carried a few tons of sand into orbit
rather than risk any useful payload on an unproven vehicle.

I'm not sure if they had a parachute did or not, but there was planning and
engineering work done to try to rescue the crew under certain failure modes,
although this did not help the Apollo 1 astronauts.

Apollo carried more valuable cargo than any commercial rocket.  Remember, it
was the apollo astronauts who forced NASA to design a window into the
capsule, at a very high cost.  The political and psychological costs of
losing anyone, especially highly, expensively trained astronaut-heroes, are
very high, and can therefore support safety features which would not make it
into an unmanned craft.

&gt;&gt; What a risk - millions of (pounds, dollars, whatever - big in anyone's
&gt;&gt; currency) and all that work.

Designing a "separate and chute" mechanism into the Ariane 5 would be a neat
engineering feat, but is it cost-effective?  All rocket cargo is insured
(and I'm sure the insurance is not cheap).  If there was an advantage to
this system, I expect either the insurance companies would fund it so they
would have to pay off less often, or the aerospace companies would fund it
to lower their premiums.  It all comes down to economics in situations like
this.

It is, as they say, only money, even if its quite a lot of it.

I'm not saying that they won't be able to perfect the system, but at the
moment, from the demo I saw on a news report about this system, it's _really
lame_.  The idea is fairly impressive -- presumably they're doing 3D
rotations and scaling of their advertizement in real time to then be shown
on the ad area.  The basic "how to get it on the screen" technology is
simply regular old green screen chroma key that has been around for a long
time.  The impressive part is, repeating myself, making sure the ad "looks
right" depending on the angle the camera is seeing it from.

Yet even with this, the ad placed in the green area was jittering all over
the place.  I was laughing at how cheezy it looked.  It just looked horribly
fake.  Technically, it was actually that the ad _wasn't_ jittering exactly
with the camera, so for example the logo wouldn't be completely centered (or
offset appropriately depending upon the angle) perfectly.  "Jittery" really
is the best word to describe it when you see the demo.  I could also see the
tell tale lines on the boundary showing it was chroma key. (They also showed
the wall without the ad.. definitely regular old green screen color.)

By the way, the idea that subliminal advertising actually works is a
pernicious urban legend.  Check out <A HREF="http://www.urbanlegends.com/products/">http://www.urbanlegends.com/products/</A>

With my mind always trying to find real uses for questionable technology, I
find myself wondering if a home version of this technology could be used in
reverse to delete those obnoxious logos that have done so much to cut down

finally exist.  Program it with every major corporate logo and most ads

This is merely an extension of a recent trend in digital photography.
Articles in Scientific American, and others, have shown that still pictures
can no longer be believed, since they are so easily altered.  Computer
technology now extends this to video (and live video, at that).

Now with digital camcorders, who will believe the next "Rodney King" video

I wouldn't quibble with his point that images contain more _data_. I do have
a problem with the proliferation of a popular confusion that I am surprised
to find coming from ATT. Claude Shannon long ago gave an excellent
definition for "information" that relates it to "surprise" or perhaps
"useful news". I submit that the average picture, especially on the Web, has
a great deal _less_ information than the accompanying text, in the sense
that the picture rarely contains anything a) worth much to the viewer or b)
not deducible from the text. In the case mentioned, with 695K (400 pages?)
of "text" versus 306K of image data, I find it truly astonishing that the
_author_ would state:

&gt; In this case, a picture is worth much more than a thousand words.

Does anybody really believe that someone would shell out the price of a very
nice dinner (assuming without real basis that this is a _technical_ book,
and thus priced in the neighborhood of 50 USD :-) for these two pictures?
"Worth" must be used in some sense with which I am unfamiliar. Although the
two pictures _cost_ as much about 51000 words, or about 25K words apiece,
they aren't _worth_ as much.

As for RISKs, when the technical community buys into popular misconceptions,
such as "data == information" or "No more could be done about the abysmal
reliability of commodity software", we are helping bring about the disasters
we read about. An informed populace will be vital in the shaping of
government response to the changes brought by computing. Repeating the
mistakes of the un-informed will not bring this about.

FORMAL METHODS EUROPE
FME'97
International Symposium and Tutorials

15--19 September 1997
The Technical University of Graz, Austria
Sponsored by the Commission of the European Communities

Call for Submissions

The Technical University of Graz will host the fourth FME Symposium from 15
to 19 September 1997. It is being organised by Formal Methods Europe which
is the advisory panel of the Commission of the European Communities. This
will be the successor of six previous VDM and FME symposia which have been
notably successful in bringing together users, researchers and developers of
precise mathematical methods for software development.

The theme of FME'97 is Formal Methods: Their Industrial Application and
Strengthened Foundations.

Symposium contributions will report advances in the field from developments
in applicable theory to experiences in commercial application. The
conference will also follow the previous successful pattern of offering
tutorials, tools demonstrations, reports of industry usage and research
papers.

Categories of Papers: three kinds of full-length paper are solicited:

1.  reports on industrial usage;
2.  research papers on existing methods (for instance: extensions,
innovative case studies);
3.  articles on stimulating theoretical research with clear
potential applicability.

Authors are requested to mention the category (1, 2, or 3) of their papers
when they submit.

TOPICS

The scope of the symposium includes, but is not limited to, the following
topics:

*  Practical use, case studies
*  Comparisons of existing formal methods, extensions, improvement
*  Theoretical foundations
*  Tool support
*  Specification and refinement techniques
*  Verification against specifications
*  Development process
*  Linking formal and informal methods
*  Concurrency, real-time and reactive systems
*  Secure or/and safety-critical systems
*  Object orientation
*  Education and technology transfer

Submissions are encouraged from the full range of application areas
including medical systems, aerospace and avionics, telecommunication,
traffic modelling and transportation systems, nuclear safety, process and
off-shore industries.

TUTORIALS

There will be eight Tutorials, each lasting a half-day. They will be
organised in two parallel tracks during 15 and 16 September.  Proposals for
tutorials are welcome.

TOOL DEMONSTRATIONS

Tool demonstrations will take place during the Symposium, with the
opportunity for presentations to be made about each tool (video
projectors will be available). Proposals for tool demonstrations are
welcome and should be made to the Organising Chair, with whom
provision of necessary computing facilities should be discussed.

In a ruling likely to have a significant impact on the future of the
Internet, a special three-judge federal court today declared the
Communications Decency Act unconstitutional on its face.  The landmark
decision came in a legal challenge initiated by the ACLU, EPIC and 18 other
plaintiffs.  EPIC is both a plaintiff and co-counsel in the litigation.  The
ACLU/EPIC case was consolidated with a subsequent action filed by the
American Library Association and a broad coalition of co-plaintiffs.

Today's lengthy ruling consists of separate opinions authored by the three
members of the federal court panel.  While the three judges differed in
their approaches to the legal issues raised in the case, they were unanimous
in their strong conclusions that the CDA constitutes a clear violation of
the First Amendment.

A complete copy of the opinion, as well as selected excerpts and related
news items, can be found at <A HREF="http://www.epic.org/">http://www.epic.org/</A>  .

A major computer chain recently tried to charge me an exorbitant price for
ZIP disks. The price was about 1.5 times what other stores are selling them
for and about the same amount higher than the price listed on the tag on the
shelf.

The manager was willing to sell me the disks at the shelf price but noted
that they would have to change that since the computer said it was higher.
I told her that their price tag was most likely to be right because of the
comparison to other chains but she insisted that the tag must be wrong
rather than the computer.

I wonder how many people paid $62.96 for the package instead of $45.96 or if
they simply don't sell as many as their competition. I also wonder if
computer stores are more or less likely than other stores to believe that
the computer is in error.

Fortunately in this case there is another chain right across the street...

The dust jacket copy for _Primary Colors_ promises that the book will tell
the truth in a way that only fiction can do. RISKS readers might enjoy a
friend Joe Finder's novel _Zero Hour_ for the same reason. The book is a
crisp thriller that revolves around a high-tech hold up. Many of the plot
twists are modern day extensions of deus ex machina. The characters assume
that technology will do the right thing only to discover that they missed
one fatal detail. Time and time again the plot zigs because of a topic that
would be ripe for comp.risks if the book was only factual. Given that many
fiction writers are often just rogues who wanted a presentable day job, we
might be better off learning these lessons before the less law-abiding
discover them and the twists become fact.

Think about the logical next step of combining L-Vis, Digital Cable, and
Direct Marketing. (It's the sort of thing you almost don't want to mention
because it just might come to pass... :-) In such a digital world,
micro-marketing is possible. For example, consider a can of soda in an
episode of the X-Files.  Scully's soda appears to be a can of SpiffyFizz
(tm) on my set ("Hey! My favorite!"), while my neighbor sees Diet Kumquat
Royale, and someone across town sees her drinking a can of Nietzsche Lite
Beer.

The possibilities are endless, of course. One effect could be the denial of
the (doctored?) video image as evidence in court, something that's been
predicted for quite some time now. Another could be the crumbling of the
public's faith in the media, something that's also been predicted for Quite
Some Time now.

As T Bone Burnett said, "I have a feeling that once something appears in the
paper, it ceases to be true."

These are societal risks, not technical ones. They certainly are gloomy
predictions, but this technology could provide some benefits as well.  For
example, a filmmaker could correct problems with a particular scene (a la
what was done for a scene with Brandon Lee in "The Crow"), obviating the
need for a reshoot.  The technology has great potential for abuse, but the
people who would abuse it are *people*, and the risk lies with them. It's
much like the arguments over the 'net: Is it a pit of doom, a pillar of
hope, or a useful tool?

There are many things that could go wrong, of course, and I'm sure the
denizens of RISKS will collect ample examples of L-VIS wipeouts, screw-ups,
and wacky unexpected behaviors.

In <A HREF="/Risks/18.19.html">RISKS-18.19</A>, Matt Ackeret says, of the electronic insertion of
advertisements into live video, that the system is "really lame" and
"jitters all over the place", and that it uses "regular old green screen
chroma key".  This is plainly not the same system that I saw a report on in
February on French TV.  In that report, they showed images from the Open Gaz
de France as broadcast in France and in Germany.  The French images were
untouched but in the German ones a French ad behind one of the players was
replaced by an equivalent German one.  The substitution was *absolutely
imperceptible*, and this even though the field being replaced was not a
simple green rectangle but an ad in black on white.

The report mentioned that the system had been developed by a French company,
so it is presumably not the same as the Princeton Video Image system
mentioned by PGN.  The image processing is done by a bank of equipment in a
small truck on site.  It may be that the TV standards (PAL and SECAM) used
in Europe lend themselves more easily to this kind of treatment than the US
standard.

Tampering with images has been done, I would suspect, ever since the
birth of photography: I can think, off the top of my head, of a number
of cases from well before the age of computer imaging:

(i) Retouching of facial features to make family members appear
villainous (1911);

(ii) Removal of Trotsky from a picture, plus many other similar
forgeries (1928);

(iii) Removal of Soviet astronauts from group photographs when they
fell out of favour (1950s and 1960s).

The first was part of a study by Goddard on the heredity of IQ and has
been exposed in Stephen Jay Gould's essays; the second is well-known (a
photo of Lenin haranguing a crowd from a lectern with Trotsky [not]
standing at the bottom of it); I wish I could get hold of the book
again in which I saw the third, where astronauts were replaced by
strategically-placed rose bushes, doors etc. etc.

This whole thread illustrates a common misattribution: evils attributed to
the baleful influence of computers were actually practiced well before
computers could help perpetuate them!

Come to think of it, the whole area of digital and "analogue" photographic
forgery is so interesting it almost demands to have a book written about it.

&gt; Now with digital camcorders, who will believe the next "Rodney King" video
&gt; clip?  Not enough cops?  Add some more!  It will probably boil down to the
&gt; integrity of the picture-taker.

Or the integrity of the camcorder.  Any digital camera -- certainly any
camera used for police work or journalism -- ought to sign its output with a
factory-installed private key.

(If the camera is not robustly tamper-proof, someone might extract the
private key by reverse engineering, or diddle the innards of the camera so
that the image is optically or digitally altered before being signed.
However, if each camera has a different private key, a court can check for
an unbroken seal on the one that purportedly shot and signed the picture.)

It appears that image tinkering to create lies is now considered to be a
mass-market product selling point.  In a national television commercial from
a *major* PC manufacturer that seems to have just started airing, a "nerd"
who finishes a marathon long after everyone else (in over 9 hours), upon
learning that someone is coming over to visit, immediately scans the photo
of himself and the marathon clock, changes the leading "9" to a "2", and
prints it out.  He then proceeds to burn his mouth on a piece of pizza.

--Lauren--

P.S.  The pizza lends an air of authenticity, but would the nerd have even
run the marathon in the first place?

&gt;  - (To my disbelief) It was suggested some type of plastic cap be
&gt;    placed on the main trigger during future training missions to
&gt;    prevent pilots from triggering(!?).
&gt;The last low-tech solution to the prevention of triggering the missile
&gt;was almost comical.

Comical and low-tech, perhaps, but it would _work_.  Sometimes a visible
physical barrier is superior to any number of invisible things which
_should_ have been done right...

THE MYSTERIES OF ARIANE'S CHAMBER, by Jean-Francois Augereau

Who [sic] caused the in-flight explosion of Ariane-5 on Tuesday, June 4?
After more than forty-eight hours of preliminary investigations, "witnesses"
are starting to talk. The propulsion system, which could have been
suspicious because of its novelty, has been cleared. The likely culprits are
elsewhere, "in the software or the hardware", that is to say the
computer-related parts. Only five of them are left, gathered in one "closed
room". [???]

According to Daniel Mugnier, head of the Launchers ("lanceurs") division at
the CNES (National Center for Aerospace Studies), the inquiry is focusing on
the "electrical and software system" which allows the various elements of
Ariane-5 to talk to each other. The launcher is loaded with sensors which
constantly monitor its moves and accelerations.

Our first suspect is an Inertial Reference System (IRS)*, the balancing
center of the launcher. The IRS, or its mate, is in charge of using these
data to compute the launcher's exact position, speed and acceleration. But
at this stage of the inquiry it seems that the sensors themselves have been
exonerated.

There is no alibi, however, for the IRS. Doubts remain, even though the
on-board computer and the backup unit show a record of having received
[litt. "claim to have received"] the same information. How could they have
failed at the same time and in the same way?

Hence the questions about the behavior of on-board computers. According to
Daniel Mugnier, "they ``claim'' to have received abnormal information from
the IRS. Whom [sic] should we believe? Daniel Mugnier is reluctant to
incriminate that component [i.e. the computers?].  Same thing with another
component, the "1553 bus". It is a kind of information highway [??!!]; all
navigation commands go through it. According to one of the investigators,
"it is a proven system, which has been used for a long time on all NATO
fighter planes".

This leaves two other suspects: the in-flight software program and the
coder.  Does the program, made of long lines [???] of computer writing,
include a "bug" or a fault? Did the converter**, which translates the
sensors' analog language into the computers' digital language, stutter? One
cannot exclude the possibility that the computer is denouncing errors that
it itself created.

The investigation continues. The report should be turned in by July 15.

An interesting feature of the Ariane 5 explosion, as seen on television, was
the commentary in French in the background.  As the fragments of the
destroyed rocket were coming down, the French voice was still saying the
equivalent of "All systems go", "All parameters normal" "course correct"
etc.  I suppose the risk of a commentator reading from a script describing
what *should* be happening is obvious. At least they could have given him a
window or a monitor to check that it loosely coincided with reality!

&gt; This would seem to open up interesting possibilities for anyone objecting
&gt; to the contents of a FAQ and wishing to have it removed from the archive.

I maintain another such FAQ article.  Most of the FAQ archive sites that I
know about will archive any article that comes by, if it (a) is crossposted
to news.answers and (b) contains the appropriate headers, such as the proper
Approved: line and Archive-Name: line.  Of course, these conditions are
trivially easy to forge for anyone familiar with the workings of netnews
transport software.  (In fact, the standard posting software most FAQ
authors use requires no special system privileges; you could say that we
*all* forge these headers.)  So far, there hasn't been any concerted attack
on FAQ archives, but I'm sure there will be one someday ... and that nothing
will be done to plug the security holes until an incident occurs :-(.  The
archive site Gianfranco describes seems to have laxer security than average,
but there isn't any trustworthy system in place.

My own FAQ is several posting cycles out of date in most of the FAQ archive
sites, and I think that Risks readers might be interested in the reasons
why.  I normally post my FAQ every other weekend.  Four weeks ago, the
posting got lost due to failure of the local netnews system at netcom.com.
Two weeks ago, it went out OK, but that weekend some self-appointed
vigilante decided to shut down the alt.binaries.* newsgroups by issuing
forged cancels for every article posted or crossposted to any alt.binaries.*
group.  My FAQ is crossposted to several .d (discussion) groups under
alt.binaries.*, and it got canceled before being archived at most sites.
The vigilante was toast a couple days later, of course, but the damage was
done.  The most recent posting is hung up in our outgoing news queue due to
another local news system failure.  Perhaps it will eventually get out, or
perhaps not.

Meanwhile, the single most popular FAQ archive site (ohio-state.edu's
WWW-accessible archive) has had ongoing reliability problems because
its volunteer founder and administrator left Ohio State over a year
ago, and everything is running on autopilot.  There are other regularly
posted FAQs that are more out of date in ohio-state's archive than mine.

The RISK: things you would think are bedrock Internet services may
actually be unfunded volunteer projects full of security holes.

Another example I've recently been reading about is that a couple of the
root DNS nameservers have been down for several days.  If they all go down,
the Internet as we know it comes to a stop.  Yet the administration of these
critical services is run on an ad-hoc, volunteer basis.  Sooner or later,
the net will have to grow up and take itself seriously.

CALL FOR PAPERS [abridged for RISKS]
The Internet Society Symposium on
Network and Distributed System Security

February 10-11, 1997, San Diego Princess Resort, San Diego, California
Submissions due: August 1, 1996

GOAL: The symposium will bring together people who are building hardware
and software to provide network and distributed system security services.
The symposium is intended for those interested in the practical aspects of
network and distributed system security, focusing on actual system design
and implementation, rather than theory.  We hope to foster the exchange of
technical information that will encourage and enable the Internet community
to apply, deploy, and advance the state of available security technology.
Symposium proceedings will be published by the IEEE Computer Society Press.
Topics for the symposium include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Design and implementation of communication security services:
authentication, integrity, confidentiality, authorization, non-repudiation,
and availability.
* Design and implementation of security mechanisms, services, and APIs to
support communication security services, key management and certification
infrastructures, audit, and intrusion detection.
* Requirements and designs for securing network information resources and
tools -- WorldWide Web (WWW), Gopher, archie, and WAIS.
* Requirements and designs for systems supporting electronic commerce --
payment services, fee-for-access, EDI, notary -- endorsement, licensing,
bonding, and other forms of assurance.
* Design and implementation of measures for controlling network communication
-- firewalls, packet filters, application gateways, and user/host
authentication schemes.
* Requirements and designs for telecommunications security especially for
emerging technologies -- very large systems like the Internet, high-speed
systems like the gigabit testbeds, wireless systems, and personal
communication systems.
* Special issues and problems in security architecture, such as interplay
between security goals and other goals -- efficiency, reliability,
interoperability, resource sharing, and cost.
* Integration of security services with system and application security
facilities, and application protocols -- including but not limited to
message handling, file transport, remote file access, directories, time
synchronization, data base management, routing, voice and video multicast,
network management, boot services, and mobile computing.

This site makes very interesting reading, as does an AltaVista search for
"ad.doubleclick.net", as does my ~/.netscape/cookies file, which contains
a reference to ad.doubleclick.net.

It appears that anyone can set up with "DoubleClick.net" (for a fee) so that
access to their own web pages goes through DC.net. DC.net then returns the
original web page, with targeted advertising added, based on the information
that some web browsers hand out on every fetch operation.

It's unclear exactly how the cookies come into this, but they undoubtedly
let DC.net try and target individual preferences, probably based on what
pages they read that go through DC.net.

The interesting thing is that this is all completely invisible, unless you
happen to notice having a cookie for ad.DC.net, or have a habit of reading
through HTML code and see an odd URL that points to ad.DC.net.  Most
people would never see these.

Thus does modern marketing come to the WWW. The risks here are enormous.
The solutions, to some extent, are simple -- no hidden cookies, and no
personal information getting sent out without approval. You can't very well
hide your domain, however, and that lets people guess all sorts of fun
things. The solution to that is not so simple.

You've been visiting commercially sponsored sites, haven't you.  Doubleclick
is responsible for the ads that you see on pages such as the DejaNews search
engine (<A HREF="http://www.dejanews.com">http://www.dejanews.com</A>) are linked via DoubleClick to the
destination site.

As far as privacy risks go, if I remember, the Netscape documentation about
the cookie file indicates that it is a file to be used to hold information
from one page to the next. . . i.e., one page writes the cookie, and another
page reads it.  This keeps from having long, convoluted URL lines which
contain all of the information you need to pass from page to page.

As far as gathering marketing information, I can't fault DejaNews,
Doubleclick, or any other company for gathering marketing information.  My
guess is that they'll use that information to tailor which ads are most
effective to display on a page like DejaNews.  I doubt that they'll use that
information to direct market you via e-mail.

DoubleClick is a Web advertising agency.  They buy space on Web sites (Yahoo,
Netscape, Travelocity, etc.) and sell impressions ("eyeballs") to advertisers.

While they may or may not actually care about your particulars (and your
browser/OS information is available to any Web site that cares to gather it,
regardless of cookies), it's much more likely they're just tagging you, like
a biologist tags wild birds.

Ideally, it's a trade-off, you see.  In exchange for free information (quid),
you give a little information on your Web usage (pro quo).  In a RISKy world,
the concern is that you give up too much for too little.  As a person who
cares about privacy, I have to applaud Netscape for putting a little alert
about cookies on the users screen.  As a Web site maintainer, I have to wonder
if this is going to affect my ability to deliver advanced forms of content.

FBI Files
By PETE YOST

Associated Press Writer
&gt;&gt;   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Whitewater prosecutors have questioned
&gt;&gt;before a grand jury the Army employee who led the White House
&gt;&gt;collection of FBI background files on a number of prominent
&gt;&gt;Republicans.  [...]

&gt;&gt;   FBI officials investigating how the White House obtained the
&gt;&gt;files have tentatively concluded that FBI procedures were not
&gt;&gt;adequate to prevent the improper disclosure of personnel
&gt;&gt;reports, The New York Times reported in today's editions,
&gt;&gt;quoting unnamed government officials.   [...]

&gt;&gt;   In addition, the newspaper quoted a senior career government
&gt;&gt;employee as saying the computer program the Secret Service used
&gt;&gt;in 1993 to track access to the White House was flawed,
&gt;&gt;producing an outdated list.  [...]

&gt;&gt;   "What is remarkable is that in this case an outdated list
&gt;&gt;was being used so unnecessary files were retrieved," said White
&gt;&gt;House spokesman Mark Fabiani.

[DMK: The computer did it!  It's not my fault!  (sigh)]

Dave Kennedy [CISSP] Information Security Analyst, National Computer Security
Assoc.

[Lengthy articles in the *NY Times* and the *Washington Post* over the
weekend noted the distinction between the "A" and "I" tags for active
and inactive names on the list.  A Secret Service spokesman was quoted
as saying that it was impossible for the I list to appear without the
tags, although a query that did not request that field would omit them
because it was indicated that both lists were in the same (relational?)
database.  As usual in such cases, the "blame" may be distributed much
more widely than folks like to admit, or alternatively may be attributed
to a lack of understanding of the technology.  Stay tuned.  PGN]

On 10th June, the UK government announced a document which describes
a key-escrow system. The document is available at:

<A HREF="http://www.coi.gov.uk/coi/depts/GTI/coi9303b.ok">http://www.coi.gov.uk/coi/depts/GTI/coi9303b.ok</A>

I'm not going to get into the usual arguments. I will quote the following,
however:

"2.  The policy, which has been decided upon after detailed discussion
between Government Departments, involves the licensing and regulation
of Trusted Third Parties (hereafter called TTPs) which will provide a
range of information security services to their clients, whether they
are corporate users or individual citizens. The provision of such
information security services will be welcomed by IT users"

Not by this one, they won't.

Korea's Internet War
By SANG-HUN CHOE, Associated Press Writer

&gt;&gt;  SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- For a Canadian university student,
&gt;&gt;creating an Internet site on North Korea was simply opening a
&gt;&gt;small library on the reclusive nation. For South Korean
&gt;&gt;authorities, it was threat to national security.
&gt;&gt;  Last week, South Korea declared David Burgess' World Wide Web
&gt;&gt;site subversive and ordered 14 local computer networks with
&gt;&gt;Internet links to block public access to it.

o	Government plans to punish those accessing PRNK web sites.
o	About 0.5M South Koreans are plugged in.

&gt;&gt;   "South Korea has hypocritically committed the same actions
&gt;&gt;it criticizes North Korea for -- non-promotion of democratic
&gt;&gt;values and open choices," Burgess said in an electronic mail
&gt;&gt;message to The Associated Press.

o	Burgess visited PRNK and picked up some pamphlets, which he's now
posted to his web server.

&gt;&gt;   North Korean pamphlets found on Burgess's home page are
&gt;&gt;sprinkled with references to the "Greatest Genius Mankind Has
&gt;&gt;Ever Known, Comrade Kim Jong Il," "U.S. imperialist warmaniacs"
&gt;&gt;and "South Korean puppet reactionaries."
&gt;&gt;   They might be laughed off as Cold War classics, but under
&gt;&gt;South Korea's strict national security law, it is a serious
&gt;&gt;crime to "manufacture, import, copy, possess or distribute data
&gt;&gt;that can benefit, eulogize or encourage the enemy."

o	ROK jams the PRNK's HF radio stations.
o	A ROK official admitted their regulations are not very effective and
that, "(w)e need a new approach."

&gt;&gt;   The government has its own web sites promoting its policies
&gt;&gt;and chronicling the doings of President Kim Young-sam. But it
&gt;&gt;maintains a sweeping ban on communist propaganda.
&gt;&gt;   About 340 people are in prison for breaking the law,
&gt;&gt;according to human rights groups. None were arrested in
&gt;&gt;connection with Burgess's home page.

(My rough translation and summary).

Workers using video display terminals in dusty and poorly cleaned offices
had increased risk for skin damage, as shown by a study by the Norwegian
"national work environment institute" (statens arbetsmilj=F6institut).
The study showed how dust particles in combination with static electricity
caused skin irritation in people working with computer displays. ...

By wiping the screens with a special ionic solution and, at the same time,
grounding the hard disk, the static electricity was led away from the
apparatus. The result was a noticeable lessening of skin irritation.  "There
were on average 20% fewer skin problems when the static electricity field
disappeared," said Dr. Knut Skulberg who, together with Dr. Knut Skyberg was
responsible for the project. In the control group where the ground lead was
not used, there was no noticable change.

A careful analysis of the indoor environment in the offices showed how a
number of additional factors were affected by static electricity.  -- If
there is a lot of dust, skin problems worsened. Less dust meant less skin
reaction.

The researchers also discovered that few displays had strong static
electricity fields directly in front of the screen. Instead, they
measured the greatest values along the side and above the displays.

Norwegian studies show that 16% of people who work frequently with computer
displays have had some form of skin irritation, primarily redness, itching,
and dry skin.

An article in the 12 June Wall Street Journal describes a major goof by
Warner Bros. in their new movie "Eraser."  In the movie, "Cyrex Corp." is
the major villain, which tries to kill the character played by Arnold
Schwarzenegger.

Unfortunately, the real-life "Cyrix Corp." was not amused, and threatened to
sue.  Warner Bros. is now busy deleting or changing all mentions of "Cyrex"
in the film.

How did this happen?  From the article:

So how could a major Hollywood studio make such an oversight?
"It wasn't an oversight," insisted a Warner Bros. spokesman.
"The names are spelled differently, and when we did a legal
search it didn't show up.  Sounding the same is a coincidence,
that's all."

Even a rudimentary spell checker should detect that "Cyrex" and
"Cyrix" are close enough to take a second look.  Anyone want to bet
that the "legal search" was nothing more than a 'grep Cyrex'?

Great World Internet Services has announced (in an off-topic posting to a
newsgroup I read, incidentally) that it is keeping an on-line database of
known child molesters at <A HREF="http://www.greatworld.com/public/--presumably">http://www.greatworld.com/public/--presumably</A> for
someone's information.  Apart from the fact that the alleged molesters are
organized by name and not by location, there is a rather alarming touch.
The site invites people to add their own molesters.  What a wonderful way of
anonymously slandering someone.

Great World's disclaimer states that "The responsibility for accuracy
relies entirely with the persons posting the information." In other words,
they come right out and say that their information cannot be trusted.

They also maintain a list of "crooked cops"--presumably also for someone's
information.  Given their information-gathering methods, however, both the
list of crooked cops and child molesters are highly suspect, to say nothing
of being serious privacy concerns.

I bought a Magellan 3000 GPS receiver at the weekend in London, after
reading up the doc I got from the Web, and some of the reasons I bought it
were because it's "rugged, durable and waterproof" and that it's housing is
a "waterproof construction".  Well, after it got dunked in a fountain for
about 20 seconds it was no longer "waterproof", but very wet.

I suspect there's a problem with the seal around the "scratchproof" LCD
display cover.  Several days later, it still hasn't dried out and the
construction prevents me from opening it (as does the warranty).

Risks:

As my mate Shand &lt;<A HREF="mailto:shand@pa.dec.com">shand@pa.dec.com</A>&gt; commented:  it
was better that I'd found out sooner than later and that at
least I was in Trafalgar Square and I knew where I was.

Admittedly, relying on one navigation instrument is fraught
with peril, but something "designed specifically for boating"
is going to get wet sooner or later.

Magellan have my fax (sent yesterday), but have so far not replied.
I shall be interested in their response.

I was reminded of the article on rounding errors on the electricity bill in
<A HREF="/Risks/18.17.html">RISKS-18.17</A> when I used the grammar checker built into by MS Word, which
produces statistics like average number of words per sentence after checking
the text. I was surprised to see that my document had an average of 0
sentences per paragraph. On closer inspection, I noticed that the program
counted 12 sentences and 17 paragraphs (do not ask me how), and must have
rounded 12/17 down to 0.

This just goes to show that it is dangerous to put too much faith in
anything produced by a grammar checker. My favourite is the suggestion that
one should use "eye's" or "eyes'" in the sentence "The smoke makes my eyes
water." The bigger risk is that someone may decide that such a grammar
checker is the standard of correct English which all documents produced by
the company must pass.

Jason Eisner suggests that digital cameras (at least those used for police
or journalism work) be equipped with a "tamper-proof" digital signature.
There may be merit to this idea in the former case, but the concept of
digital signatures in video, if applied too broadly, could have serious
privacy implications, leading to concerns over making important video
available for fear of retribution or similar negative consequences.  Nor is
it clear how much assurance could be placed in the integrity of the video
itself after editing and other processing even if the original source
material were "securely" tagged.

This is an area that would have to be approached very carefully
and definitely not in an ad hoc manner.

An article (AP newswire) on promotional product placement in the movies
relates a story about the movie _Demolition Man_ where in the North American
version of the movie, Sandra Bullock's character tells Sylvester Stallone's
character that only the Taco Bell franchise survived into the 2xth century.

But in versions of the movie released overseas, the franchise is
changed to Pizza Hut (while both chains owned by the same parent,
there are 4600 Taco Bell franchises in North America v.s. a few
overseas; there are 3300 Pizza Hut franchises overseas).

"For the movie's international release, special effects
experts digitally removed the Taco Bell logo from the film
added a new restaurant and re-recorded Bullock's dialog. Now,
when the movie is shown overseas, Taco Bell has
failed... there's only Pizza Hut."

David Wadsworth comments on the French commentary lagging behind events at
the Ariane-5 failure.  It may be remembered that exactly the same sort of
lag occurred at the Challenger explosion.  In both cases, the cause is
probably similar.  The person providing that running data commentary is
typically watching a telemetry readout, not looking out a window!  That
displayed telemetry tends to lag events by a significant amount, accounting
for the perceived effect.  It is extremely unlikely that David's assumption
that the "commentator" was "reading from a script" is the correct analysis
in this case.

Cockpit" from _Turn Signals Are the Facial Expressions of Automobiles_.
Norman lists the most common and effective cognitive aids in the cockpit.
Under "crew-provided devices" he lists "written notes, coffee cups, and
tape". He specifically mentions placing an empty coffee cup over a lever as

I believe something similar can also be seen in the film _Apollo 13_ with a

Paris, 14 June 1996--As I have so far seen no reports in the obvious
Usenet newsgroups of the recent police raids on leading French Internet
service-providers, and I can no longer post contributions to them myself, I
send you the following English translations from the French newspaper
"Liberation", which may inspire you to report them there. Note that Mr.
Francois Fillon have propose one Conseil Superieur de la Telematique
depending of the Bourges' CSA (Conseil Superieur de l' Audiovisuel) that
will rapidly act like a high telematics authority like the new French
Internet Society (ISOC).

------------

&gt;From the "Cahier Multimedia" of "Liberation", 3 May 1996

"Netiquette according to Mr Fillon" (La Netiquette de Fillon)

Lacking the power to police the Internet, France will invite its G7
partners (at Lyons in June) to consider the co-ordinated introduction of a
"code of good conduct". A sort of "modus vivendi" which, as Francois Fillon
explained to his colleagues at their recent meeting in Bologna, would
guarantee a minimum degree of protection to network users. For, as the
French Telecoms Minister pointed out, "if the Internet constitutes an
extraordinary valuable collective resource (...), nevertheless it conceals
as many risks for its users."  To attempt to keep it locked up on the basis
of national regulations alone would be pointless with such an inherently
transnational network.  Hence, according to Mr Fillon, the need to establish
coordination at a European (OECD) level, with the aim of drafting an
agreement [une convention]. Its signatories would establish the principles
for legal collaboration, and a certain number of rules on ethics and on the
legal responsibility common to on-line publishers and ISPs.  And, in the
event of a breach, the Minister also proposes to establish, once and for
all,that "by default, the principle that the rules of the originating
country, so far as the signatories are concerned, and [those] of the
receiving country are applicable. "

------------

But in "Liberation" of 8 May 1996:

"Police raid on the Internet" (Descente des gendarmes sur l'Internet)

Two Information Service Providers (ISPs) arrested for distributing
pornographic pictures of children, by Franck Johannes

The police are very proud of themselves, and say prudently that "as far
as they are aware" this is a world premiere: the first time that the police
have intervened in the Internet. Without perhaps realising what a storm they
have produced, if not in legal circles then on the Network. The chief
executives of two ISPs have been detained for questioning on allegations
that they have been distributing pornographic pictures of children.

"We keep hearing that there is a legal vacuum", explained
Lieutenant-Colonel Gerard Browne. "But that's not in fact the case;
distributing such pictures is prohibited by Art. 227-23 of the Penal Code,
that's all". The gendarmes, who are apparently unwilling to provide
background details, were tipped-off at the end of January 1996. It seems
that a regular Net-user came across the pictures in question via FranceNet
and World-Net, both of which claim to be the leading providers of access to
the Internet. (...)

The Parisian research service immediately began exploring the services
with the support of the informatics branch of the criminal research
institute of the national gendarmerie (IRCGN). They took copies of the
various newsgroups, in other words the thousands of messages giving
information on all sorts of themes, from fly-fishing to vegetable gardening,
ultimately arriving at that with the children.  This could scarcely be by
accident; it is necessary to look, for example, in a list which has the
advantage of being clear, for "alt.binary.pictures.erotic.pedophilia", to
find a prohibited picture. According to the police, some 5 to 10% of the
contents of the thousands of newsgroups accessible in this way every day are
illegal.

The dossier was transferred to the Parisian prosecuting authorities,
which in March opened an investigation entrusted to Christine Berkani, the
principal investigating magistrate in cases involving minors. On Monday [6
May] the police seized piles of floppy disks in the offices of the two ISPs,
and then the manager of WorldNet, Sebastian Sochard, and his counterpart
from FranceNet, Raffi Haladjian, were arrested and held in custody on
charges of "having distributed, fixed, recorded or transmitted a
pornographic picture of a minor", contrary to the provisions of Art. 227-23
of the Penal Code. They risk being sentenced to up to three years in prison
and fined up to half a million francs, because children under 15 years old
are involved.

At WorldNet, this came as "a bolt from the blue" and his colleagues were
astonished that Sebastian Socchard, 27, had been detained in custody on
Monday.  Last year, the young man had set up the SCT Sarl company (for
Security, Concept and Technology) before becoming active as an ISP at his
clients' request. Today, WorldNet has some 30 employees and claims 9000
clients, each of whom pay FF 99.00 monthly for access to the Internet.

"This affair merely illustrates the legal vacuum", protested Isabelle
Perichon of WorldNet. "We don't produce any pictures, we just store them.
Every day, we receive between 50,000 and 100,000 news-messages from the
University at Jussieu: Jussieu sends them to France Telecom, which forwards
them to us automatically."  Jussieu was slightly upset by this.
"France-Telecom doesn't normally get its data from us", explained an
engineer from the University. "We get our news from the United States, they
must be doing the same. In any case, there has never been anything like that
on our server. A lot of people are anxious to prevent the network from
degenerating, and if any of them found it they would let us know within a
couple of hours." The Gendarmes have plenty to keep them busy; the
investigators now have to identify the source of the pictures, which "come
from just about everywhere", sighed Lieutenant-Colonel Browne.

------------

Liberation, 9 Mai 1996: "Net: si on avait su, on aurait filtre" ("If we had
known, we would have filtered the Internet") - the director of WorldNet [Mr.
Sebastien Socchard, an old student of the well knowned EPITA computer school
in paris] under investigation, denies all responsibility

(report by Laurent Mauriac)

In their desire to comply with French law, the ISPs are cutting off their
noses in order to spite their faces. In reaction to the arrest of the
managers of WorldNet and FranceNet "for simply doing their job", the four
members of the French Association of Internet Professionals (AFPI) -
Calvacom, FranceNet, Imaginet and Internet-way - have announced that they
have cut off their subscribers' access to *all* Usenet newsgroups.

"That is the only way to apply the law", according to the director of
Imaginet, Patrick Robin, who claims it would be impossible to monitor
everything that is routed via his hard disks. Most ISPs carry more than 120
thousand messages every day, and any of them potentially contain pictures
among which a few might be prohibited by French law.

No doubt fewer than 5% of them, according to AFPI; the whole problem is
that of identifying this 5% within the great flow of continually-renewed
data.  That is why Patrick Robin is calling for the creation of a committee
"similar to the Press's Committee for the protection of youth" and having
the resources it would need to be able to inspect newsgroups regularly. The
AFPI is also calling for the status of ISPs to be defined clearly: as
carriers, not distributors.  Making the same distinction, World-Net's
director, Sebastian Socchard, commented as follows on his dealings with the
law-enforcement authorities:

You could have filtered out the "outlawed" newsgroups - why didn't you
do so?

[SS]: We could have removed certain newsgroups, but we didn't know
which ones, or how to filter their contents. If we had know that that kind
of thing was present, we would have acted.

Weren't you responsible for the distribution of the contents of everything
stored on your servers?

[SS]: No, and I'm not happy with the expression "stored"; it doesn't
correspond to the situation. Our equipment merely passes on pictures, it
doesn't really store them. They do indeed transit via our hard disks, but
that is merely part of our job of carrying them, a means to enable the users
to access them more quickly. We would be equally responsible if our users
obtained the pictures directly from other servers on the Web (whereas the
contents of newsgroups are stored temporarily on every ISP's server, Web
pages are generally stored only on one server, and accessed directly from it
when required by a user). I am not legally responsible for publishing the
contents of our server.

All the same, don't you have a duty to keep an eye on the data that can be
accessed through your servers? Is WorldNet responsible for everything that
can be found on the Internet?

[SS]: There are 6300 newsgroups, and it would take about an hour to inspect
the contents of one of them. So to check all of them in 24 hours you would
need 270 people. And if we had to do that for the newsgroups, why not do it
for the Web and e-mail too?

What do you think the solution is?

[SS]: I fully agree that whatever is forbidden in France ought to be
filtered out, things like racism and child-pornography, for example. But
it's not an easy thing to do. If one newsgroup is excluded, it can change
its name or put its contents into another one. We want the government to
define precisely what must be censored, as has been done for the Minitel and
audiovisual services.

A lot of legal experts are saying that there is no legal vacuum; all
that's needed is to apply the existing law...?

[SS]: They are assuming that the Internet is no different from other
transmission systems. In that case, we are a carrier like the rest of them,
and we should be treated as such.

Do you think that you are the victim of injustice?

[SS]: If we are deemed to be responsible, then so should France Telecom
or Transpac [its specialised network-operating subsidiary]. The pictures are
carried through France Telecom's lines, and it is Transpac that supplies
them to us automatically from its server. As the head of the Gendarmerie
admitted: by attacking the two main French ISPs, they hope that the other 98
will also stop whatever they are doing wrong.

What happened when you were taken in for investigation?

[SS]: The gendarmes arrived without warning. They were well-behaved; they
knew that we weren't gangsters. They said that they were simply carrying out
routine procedures. It was obvious that they knew nothing about the
Internet.  I didn't see any experts. I suspect that the Gendarmerie wanted a
high-profile operation to catch the media's attention, possibly to launch
the debate.  They could easily have sent us registered letters, but in that
case nobody would have heard about it. Even if all this is out of all
proportion for five miserable pictures, as operators we are quite happy that
the debate has now begun.

The *Los Angeles Times* recently completed a project to improve automatic
spelling-checking and hyphenation for news copy (work made necessary when
the paper dispensed, several years ago, with proofreaders).  The automatic
spelling checker previously used a both a dictionary and an algorithm that
tested words against a root and a (fairly) arbitrary arrangement of common
prefix and suffix strings.  The algorithmic check passed many invalid words.
Now it has been eliminated and only the dictionary--much expanded--is used.
It took more than a month of concentrated effort to expand the dictionary to
include common words previously covered by the algorithmic check.  To
improve dictionary-based hyphenation (the algorithmic hyphenator has also
been disabled) two people spent much time over months re-hyphenating 135,000
dictionary entries.  The system still makes no effort to detect words that
are in the dictionary but that do not belong in context.

About the American Hyphen Society

The American Hyphen Society is a community-based, not-for-profit,
grass-roots consciousness-raising/education-research alliance that
seeks to help effectuate the across-the-board self-empowerment of
wide-ranging culture-, nationality-, ethnicity-, creed-, gender-,
and sexual-orientation defined identity groups by excising all
multiculturally-less-than-sensitive terminology from the English
language, and replacing it with counter-hegemonic, cruelty-, gender-,
bias-, and, if necessary, content-free speech.  The society's motto
is "It became necessary to destroy the language in order to save it".
Its headquarters are in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania.

[Walla-Walla would do nicely for a west-coast mail-drop.

A true war story:

I used to work for the dearly departed Ingres, a relational database
company.  One day, the folks in Tech Support wandered up the stairs to
the floor I worked on.  They looked particularly ashen-faced.  Someone
finally asked them what the problem was.

Apparently, Edison Power and Light (the New Jersey equivalent of PG&amp;E)
had called our East Coast support office in Saddlebrook, NJ, a half-hour
earlier.  They used Ingres to keep track of the rods moving around in the
nuclear cores on a DEC VAX.  Somehow, the database had become corrupted.
If it didn't get fixed in four hours, when the next core rotation began,
a meltdown was likely.

Fortunately, (1) our Saddlebrook office was a half-hour from their site,
and (2) all VAXes had the ability to have remote hardware diagnosis
performed by their world-wide support center in Colorado Springs, CO,
through a piece of firmware built into every VAX.  Not surprisingly, the
folks at DEC gave this problem a rather high priority.  After about an
hour and a half, it was determined that a disk sector was corrupted.  It
was repaired, and life as we continue to know it went on.

Welcome to Product Land, folks!  It's got a different set of problems than
Academia taught us all.

Remind me to tell you about answering questions about how we at Ingres
said we would provide support during nuclear wars at a sales call to the
Strategic Air Command some time...

So I just get a "spam" complaint from an AOL postmaster threatening:

&gt;From: <A HREF="mailto:Postmaster@aol.com">Postmaster@aol.com</A>
&gt;To: <A HREF="mailto:netadmin@world.std.com">netadmin@world.std.com</A>, <A HREF="mailto:postmaster@world.std.com">postmaster@world.std.com</A>

&gt;Date: Thu, 12 Oct 1995 16:49:01 -0400

&gt; Repeated offenses of this nature will result in AOL taking action to
&gt; prevent further problems.

etc.

I look down at the message in question (they enclosed it) and it's just a
few mail bounces through a mailing list out of World to some customer (look
at the subject line above, some kind of cc:Mail lossage and unfortunately
cc:Mail bounces back to the From: address and ignores stuff like Errors-To:
and Replies-To:, constant nuisance), a list to which their customer is
explicitly subscribed and apparently has been for a while.

I guess the customer didn't like the bounce message, and I guess the AOL
postmaster has decided that bounce messages are "unsolicited mail". The
message from the postmaster also made the point that their customers have to
pay for all their e-mail so this is a problem (well, THEN *YOU* EDIT THEIR
MAIL -- YOU'RE GETTING THE @$%#^ MONEY, NOT ME!)

This is why we also have to be careful with this anti-spam crap, there are
people out there, some of whom work as postmasters for the largest online
services on the planet, who, are, well...you get my point, can't quite fog a
mirror, I guess is the expression.

I took the guy off the list and told the postmaster to tell him and tell him
that it's ok if he re-subscribes as far as I'm concerned but perhaps that
will remind him that HE SUBSCRIBED.

Morons. I may just mass unsub all AOL addresses from all lists here. I mean,
this is their postmaster threatening, not some random.

[I have a friend who went to work for AOL and she was wondering why
people picked on AOL all the time.  Sigh.  --spaf]

[Hugh Davies &lt;<A HREF="mailto:huge@axalotl.demon.co.uk">huge@axalotl.demon.co.uk</A>&gt; shared with me a marvelous

&gt;&gt; A new marking for all software products &lt;&lt;

Software quality is a fundamental challenge in our ever changing society, in
particular in the perspective of the use of computers and networks by all of
us and within all sectors of social and professional life.

Fully aware of what is at stake, the AFNOR (Association Francaise de
NORmalisation) General Executive Officer has just approved - in early May -
the publication of the rules of a new marking called "NF Logiciel".
("Logiciel" is French for "software".)  NF Logiciel is designed to be
applicable to any software, whatever its application domain, its
functionalities or its origin.

This adaptation of the general - and well known - NF marking is meant to be
an official statement of the actual quality of those software products being
marked.  This marking is both an alternative and a complement to more usual
quality system certification approaches:

- an alternative because it is not necessary to be certified
to get the NF Logiciel marking for one's products,

- a complement because the marking requirements are based on
those of quality system certification, which allows certified
companies to get rather easily the NF logo for their products.

Based on sound and recognized international standards (NF ISO/CEI 12119 &amp;
ISO 9001), the NF Logiciel is an unprecedented opportunity for software
providers to turn their investments in software quality into visible
evidence to the end user.

Several softwares are already undergoing an evaluation and
first formal markings are expected during next fall.

For more information, please contact <A HREF="mailto:stephane.geyres@psti.mipnet.fr">stephane.geyres@psti.mipnet.fr</A>

Another simple way to know much more is to send an e-mail message to our
server as follows: (Sorry, the documents are only in french so far...)

A year ago, I brought a cellular phone in my name for a friend, due to
his lack of proper documents.  A month later, my first bill reflected an
amount of $1300, as a result of a fraud.  I panicked and cancelled my
service right away.  I had to pay $250 for early termination fee (under
the contract) and an additional $400 for my cellular phone (to keep.)
AT&amp;T Wireless told me that they had put the case under investigation.
To make the story short, I received a letter from them (six months
later,) saying that the case was not a fraud.
In the statement, more than 950 calls were made to many areas in NYC,
Long Island and New Jersey.  There were calls billed twice within the
same time and date, made to the same number as well.  Calls were made up
to 14 hours in a row (, which was IMPOSSIBLE to achieve without a car)
because we have a 2 hour battery.  Furthermore, on the night that I had
cancelled the service a year ago, my whole family, the co-user, family
friends all sat by me as I cancelled the service.  I was told to
document everything.  Well, according to the bill, my unused cellular
phone, that sat by my side, beeped a person 3 minutes before I got off
the phone with the cellular representative...3 MINUTES BEFORE MY SERVICE
WAS OFFICIALLY TERMINATED!!!  I know for a fact that NO ONE used the
phone.  So who did?
This is the result of what is called cloning.  AT&amp;T refused to take my
word for what happened.  At this point, my case is transferred to a
collective agency and it is terminated.  They sent me a letter saying
that there was no fraud.  No signature was on the letter and the only
reason given for their decision was that I had a co-user.
The moral of the story is:
1.  DO NOT buy anything for anyone else, for no matter what
becomes of this, I AM RESPONSIBLE for the "debt".
2.  DO NOT trust cellular companies.  I was told many times that this
happens everyday.  I was unfortunate to get such a dramatic bill.
INVESTIGATION DOES NOT BRING JUSTICE.  I am now left with the option to
pay the money in full(with 20% off for God knows what reason,) or go to
court.  They warn me against it because it may cost me more...
If you have any suggestions, comments, questions or advice, please
e-mail me, Veronica, at <A HREF="mailto:vera@gnn.com">vera@gnn.com</A>.  I would appreciate it greatly.

After my _brand new_ Magellan 3000 spent about 20 seconds submerged under
water, causing it to fail, I bought a Magellan 2000, because I felt the need
to navigate for the Housbot Escapade at the weekend.

However, the 2000 has an intermittent in it.  It's some sort of mechanical
problem with the receiver which causes it not to boot, switch off, reset and
generally annoy you -- you have to nurse it like a baby.  Faced with this,
the level of confidence you place in it drops to zero -- a bad thing for a
navigation instrument.

Just how easy is it to trigger this intermittent?  Well, any mild shock
will do; placing it on a hard surface, putting in the pocket of my CWU-36P
[Jacket, Flyer's, 100% Polyamide], handing it to someone.  All sorts of
high-G manoeuvers like that.  Fixing it requires another mild shock :-)
and some persistence with the on/off button.

You could say I'm less than happy.  Where is their Quality Control?

&gt;From "News of the Weird," a syndicated column, published in the
Austin Chronicle on 14 June 1996:

In May, a federal judge in Beaumont, Texas, issued a permanent injunction
against the Quadro Corp. of Harleyville, S.C., which had been selling a
plastic box with an antenna on it to government agencies and schools for up
to $8,000 each as an illegal-drug finder.  FBI tests had found the device
merely a piece of plastic, utterly incapable of detecting drugs or anything
else.  However, several law enforcement officers and school principals swore
to the judge that the Quadro Tracker worked for them.

RISKS?  Where to begin?  Use of a device without any knowledge of its
workings.  Believing anything the sales guy tells you.  Failure to run
controlled tests on a device before placing it into service.  Believing that
a box with an antenna on it could possibly detect drugs in the first place.
Hiring credulous individuals as "police officers and school principals."
Placing near-dictatorial power in the hands of school principals.

Perhaps someone else has more detail.  I'm particularly interested in the
assertion that the Quadro Tracker "worked for them," and in the fate of
those whose supposed possession of illegal drugs was detected by the device.
Were the individuals searched?  Are those searches now deemed to have been
illegal?  Was action taken against anyone on the grounds of the Quadro
Tracker's results alone?  On what basis do the officials believe that the
Quadro Tracker worked?

[PGN, I'll preemptively note that the judge made the "illegal-drug
finder" an "illegal drug-finder."]

The official registries maintained by states (which can hurt you in much
more serious ways than a web site) use information sources which are just as
questionable.

As I recall, in Colorado therapists are required to report the name of any
patient reporting being a _victim_ of sexual child abuse, if the individual
is 27 or younger.  This stellar example of legislative reasoning was based
on the observation that many (most?) abusers were themselves abused.
Therefore "anyone who was a victim is likely to be an abuser and should be
tracked."  The cutoff age was apparently based on another statistic with
equally dubious pedigree.

This might not be so bad if the registry was well run, but it appears (from
the discussions in the local media) that once you're on the list there's no
distinction between people actually convicted of crimes and people who were
listed due to nasty divorce battles or therapy sessions.  Furthermore, it's
virtually impossible to remove your name from the list once it has been
added.  Cries of innocence are viewed with the same skepticism as we hear in
the cryptology debate -- if you have nothing to hide, why are you so
bothered?

&gt; ... In other words, they come right out and
&gt; say that their information cannot be trusted.

Worse still, the author realizes the possibility that listed people
may be upset and reports recent experience with false listings.
Nevertheless, according to the dispute resolution procedures at
<A HREF="http://www.greatworld.com/public/mdispute.htm">http://www.greatworld.com/public/mdispute.htm</A>
the only authentication required from an accuser is a valid e-mail address,
and if the poster claims to be a victim, relative of a victim, or friend of
a victim, a disputed listing will stand, even without a conviction.  He
claims that a posted rebuttal will provide "more than equal opportunity" for
defense.

I'm not a lawyer, but surely these policies leave the listings' proprietor
open to an incredible (and probably justified) libel suit, during which it
may be impossible to identify the original accuser.

I admit that placing plastic cap, or even a paper coffee cup(?)  is a great
way to remind pilots not to touch certain levers and/or buttons. I often do
something similar if I want nobody to touch certain computer keyboard while
some important tests are under way on the machine.

What bothered me in the shooting down of F-15 and its subsequent
investigation is that the investigation team didn't go down to the bottom of
the real cause of why the main firing system became active despite the main
switch being turned off. Static electricity was rumored to be the cause
initially, but in the final report, as far as I read in newspaper articles,
no clear culprit was mentioned.

This means that there might be, albeit with very small possibility given
that F-15s have been flying in the sky all over the world for so many years,
a rare bug such that the firing system may spontaneously fire missiles no
matter what the main switch position is and whether trigger button is
pressed or not.  (Am I getting paranoia these days?)

Placing a plastic cap may be useless if such rare (still possible) bug lurks
in the system, and I felt disappointed that the investigation team let the
bug go unnailed. It would indeed be comical if a poor pilot finds one day a
missile is launched while the plastic cap is firmly in place... Well, not so
comical, come to think of it.

BTW, I am eagerly waiting for the initial words regarding the cause of
shooting down of American plane by a Japanese navy boat.

&gt;Subject: Matra made software for Ariane5 AND Taipei subway system (R 18.17)

&gt;On the base of the information available now, I ask myself, why was there no
&gt;mechanism to avoid the control computers' attempt to go into this extreme
&gt;flight position?

Why would you want to?  The Control Computers *job* is to control the
position of the engines.  Redundant hard/software to correct for possible
errors in the primary computers costs horribly in terms of weight and
reliability, as well as being difficult to engineer and test.  In addition
is is extremely unlikely that a redundant system would detect a software
glitch in time to prevent such a failure.

Study the STS/Orbiter flight control systems for an object lesson in this.

No, the SRB's cannot be separated while burning.  The stresses would tear
the whole stack apart.  (Uncontrolled separation (the only kind available at
that point in flight) is what caused the Challenger to break up.)

All STS abort modes require that the SRB's be ridden to burnout, and the
that ET be nearly empty prior jettisoning it.

&gt;Apollo carried more valuable cargo than any commercial rocket.  Remember, it
&gt;was the apollo astronauts who forced NASA to design a window into the
&gt;capsule, at a very high cost.

This objection could only possibly be applied to the Mercury program, as a
window was required for the objectives of both the Gemini and Apollo programs.

In addition, the window proved its worth again and again during the Mercury
program as any cursory study of the flights will show.

Excerpt from ESA press release 22-96:

&gt; FLIGHT 501 FAILURE - VEHICLE EQUIPMENT BAY RECOVERED

&gt; Investigation of the flight 501 failure has been under way
&gt; since 4 June.  In particular, a large part of the equipment
&gt; contained in the vehicle equipment bay has been recovered
&gt; and inspected.  This has revealed the existence of a malfunction
&gt; relating to the inertial platforms in Ariane-5 operating mode.

&gt; [...]  (The Space Shuttle can actually abort during launch under
&gt; specific conditions and return to the landing strip at Kennedy, or go on to
&gt; a down-range site, or ditch in the ocean.  Had sensors been available to
&gt; tell the crew or ground controllers of the burn-through problem, one of
&gt; these abort modes might have been employed with the chance of saving the
&gt; crew if not the vehicle.)

There are two errors in the above paragraph. The first concerns the ditching
into the Atlantic. It has been said again and again that the Shuttle does
NOT have the ability to ditch into the ocean. The airframe is not sturdy
enough to withstand the impact and the external surface (mostly made of
fragile tiles) will disintegrate.

It is true that in the pre-Challenger era if the astronauts found themselves
in a position where ditching was the only alternative they were doomed.
Nowadays they will be able to bail out using the extensible pole and
parachutes while the Shuttle is kept on a level flight.

The second error concerns the survivability of the Challenger failure.
There was and there is no way to detach the Shuttle from the external tank
while the SRBs are firing. So abandoning the failing external tank was not
an option. What can be argued is that since the astronauts were not rendered
unconscious from the violent separation, if they were wearing pressure suits
instead of air packs they might be able to find their way out of the cabin
and bail out. While this cannot be ruled out it is unlikely because the
inside of the shuttle cabin is not exactly spacious and it must have been
tumbling. Next, at this stage we are not talking about the shuttle, but
about a part of the shuttle with bits hangling from it, no power and no way
to keep it stable. If the pilots had ejector seats (like they had for the
first test flights back in the early eighties) they could try ejecting, but
I just can imagine the Challenger crew finding their way out in time to
avoid the crash.

============

Now about the Ariane discussion. If the payload is irreplaceable, you don't
send it aboard the first test flight of a new rocket. You pay for a normal
flight which is also insurable (assuming the test flights are successful).
Insurance in the satellite business is a hedging of the risk.  If an
operational launcher blows up then the premiums paid for all subsequent
launches go up so that insurers can recoup their costs. So the launch
clients collectively pay for the failure anyway. Insuring is thus a way to
evenly spread the cost of failure.

Remember that the Ariane failure mode is not that common. In most cases it
is upper stages that fail, the satellites get placed in the wrong orbit or
simply disappear. Parachutes will not save them in these cases.  Also a
launch vehicle will either evolve to be unlikely to blow up during launch or
it will not be used. So putting parachutes will guard against an event that
will have a steadily decreasing probability of occurrence. So we have to
argue that we should put the ejection mechanism only on the first few
flights (the Shuttle approach). In this case we have to balance the cost of
developing the escape system against the cost of the cargo that will be
saved IF the launcher fails. To this we have to add the cost of the
replacement launcher and the cost of refurbishing the cargo after its
recovery and preparing it for the next launch. You don't just pick it up and
stick it back into the next Ariane.

Now the developers of the first Ariane 5 payload didn't have enough money
for buying space on a commercial launcher, so they wouldn't have money for
the escape system anyway. Maybe the falacy of the whole situation is that
they were allowed to spend $500 million without budgeting the $65 million
launch costs.

Netcom, Inc; one of the largest retail ISP's [450,000 subscribers,
230 POPs] went down for 14+ hours this week.

In what strikes me as "shades of Mariner II" Netcom President David
Garrison, appearing on KGO Radio said it was an extra "&amp;" in the "border
gateway protocol code" in the MAE-East router in DC area that killed the
system.

They had to bring down all 100+ routers &amp; flush each one to recover, he
reported.

The parallel to the Bell Atlantic STP bug of about five years back strikes
me. The routing nut has gotten so tough that the tools used on it can be
[VERY!] rapidly fatal.

An article by Peter H. Lewis in *The New York Times*, 24 Jun 1996, p. D1,
noted the Netcom problem ("for 12 hours") noted in <A HREF="/Risks/18.23.html">RISKS-18.23</A> by David
Lesher.  The article also noted these other problems:

* Microsoft shut down its nationwide network on Sunday (presumably 23
Jun 1996) for 10 hours as part of an intended backup power-supply
upgrade, but the upgrade failed and they will have to try again.

* America Online was out of service for an hour on 19 June "1996,
when a planned system software upgrade backfired."

* AT&amp;T will shut down its Internet access for up to 8 hours each week,
for maintenance.

Special note:  I work for the IRS and have a work-related vested interest
============   in _not_ having the Department of Defense involved in
contracting for IRS software and systems.  Therefore,
despite any claims of non-bias below, I am clearly
"interested" in the classical sense of the word.

That part out of the way, I'd like to say (as a private citizen, a
tax-and-spend liberal, and an almost-always defender of free speech and the
right of the citizen to privacy) that the present initiative by Congress to
have DoD become the contracting agent for IRS system and software
development is a clear and present danger to privacy in the Republic in
which we stand.

The initiative referred to above is in the "Subcommittee Mark" of the
proposed next year's budget.  It's just a House Subcommittee so it's not
law, but it's a bad idea in my mind, even to consider it seriously.  Is the
Department of Star Wars and the $700 toilet seat really so excellent a
contracting agency that they are the clear choice to handle IRS business?

Well, that's my biased opinion, and I'd like very much to hear from
others who may have a more valid claim to disinterest!

An entertaining part of Windows 95 is the time-zone chooser in its control
panel. As well as being able to select time zones like (GMT+01:00), users
who don't know or care about their meridan-relative time zone can just click
on a map of the world. The appropriate time zone is then highlighted and
-the cute bit- the whole world smooth scrolls round so that the user's
country is in the centre of the map.

In the latest beta of Windows NT 4.0, the map is still there but is
disabled: no mouse clicks are responded to and no highlights appear. The
smooth scrolling still works, but with timezone selection via a list it is
nowhere near as cute as it used to be.

What is interesting is the reason it doesn't work. It is not, as one would
expect, a technical problem, but a political one -and thus a lot harder to
fix:

&gt; borders that are not universally agreed upon.  In order to satisfy all
&gt; parties involved in these disputed areas we chose not to display any
&gt; borders at all.  We are aware it is a feature that many people miss.

Espionage Suit

By ANTHONY JEWELL, Associated Press Writer
&gt;&gt;   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Johnson &amp; Johnson's diabetes products
&gt;&gt;subsidiary encouraged workers to illegally spy on rivals and
&gt;&gt;gave "Inspector Clouseau" and "Columbo" awards for those who
&gt;&gt;got the most information, a competitor charged Wednesday.
&gt;&gt;   Boehringer Mannheim Corp., a German-owned drug and medical
&gt;&gt;device company, made the allegations in a federal court lawsuit
&gt;&gt;against J&amp;J and its LifeScan Inc. subsidiary. Boehringer has
&gt;&gt;U.S. offices in Indianapolis.   [...]

o	Suit asks for Lifespan to cease using Boehringer's trade secrets and
seeks unspecified damages.

o	J&amp;J says both companies did it but its LifeScan received no competitive
advantage from their activities.

o	Suit alleges that LifeScan used third parties as well as their own
employees to collect information about Boehringer.  And that LifeScan
"infiltrated" private meetings at Boehringer.

o	A former LifeScan employee broke the news in May 94.

&gt;&gt;   Boehringer's lawsuit said two LifeScan employees
&gt;&gt;"deliberately fostered an environment which made clandestine
&gt;&gt;and illegal activities directed at competitors ... both routine
&gt;&gt;and expected."
&gt;&gt;   Mannheim said David Van Avermaete and Daphne Flamer
&gt;&gt;initiated the "Inspector Clouseau Award," the "Columbo Award,"
&gt;&gt;and the "Mrs. Fletcher Award," after the lead character in the
&gt;&gt;TV series "Murder, She Wrote."
&gt;&gt;   The awards were allegedly "presented at meetings, with
&gt;&gt;prizes, to members of the sales force who obtained the best
&gt;&gt;information about competitors and their plans," the lawsuit
&gt;&gt;said.   [...]

&gt;&gt;   The suit claims a LifeScan employee stole a prototype of a
&gt;&gt;diabetes monitoring system known as Accutrend DM. Oldham said
&gt;&gt;the prototype was stolen in Europe, taken to a LifeScan
&gt;&gt;California lab and returned to Europe.  [...]

&gt;&gt;   Boehringer Mannheim, which had 1995 sales of more than $700
&gt;&gt;million, employs more than 3,500 people at facilities in
&gt;&gt;Fremont and Concord, Calif., and Gaithersburg, Md.

A colleague just got a handheld cellular telephone.  The device asks the
user to enter a 4-digit PIN before it will permit outbound calling.  The
vendor (local cell-phone duopoly carrier, not an independent) has set the
PIN to the last four digits of the assigned telephone number, which the
phone displays upon powerup BEFORE asking for the PIN.  This helps people
with poor memories and people with no authority equally.  The vendor's
service staff state that they have a fixed policy of configuring all 'phones
this way.  A longer (5 or 6 digit) "security code" enables users to change
the PIN, but the vendor refuses to supply that code to my colleague
(presumably to retard his ability to switch carriers for which that code is
also needed).  The vendor will allow my colleague to bring the 'phone to an
inconvenient location during limited hours at his own expense to have the
PIN changed; if he does this he must tell his PIN to the vendor's staff
(they already have the "security code," but he would be revealing his
PIN-choosing habits).  My colleague wonders why the phone has a PIN if it
offers zero security!

&gt;Somehow, the database had become corrupted.  If it didn't get fixed in
&gt;four hours, when the next core rotation began, a meltdown was likely.

This didn't make any sense to me from what I know about nuclear power plants
so I checked with a friend who is an engineer at one of the U.S. nuclear
power plants.  It's hard to reconstruct what really might have been the
case.  The computer could have been computing control rod movements and
printing them out for an operator to use to manually control the rods (this
is not done automatically) and there might have been no contingency plan or
the operators might not have been able to do the computation manually in the
time required.  Could that have caused a meltdown? No.  At worst, it might
have required the operator to reduce power or to shut down the reactor.

&gt; "A true war story:"

Just because someone says it, and others forward it does not make it true.
This must be an attempt to establish a new urban legend.  There are enough
misconceptions about commercial nuclear power plants already, so we need to
avoid creating fantasies that can be made into exciting movies.

First, there is no Edison Power and Light.  The two utilities operating
nuclear plants in New Jersey are Public Service Electric and Gas (PSE&amp;G) and
GPU Nuclear Corp., operating plants in Salem NJ and Forked River NJ,
respectively.  There is also Consolidated Edison of NY, which runs a nuclear
plant in Buchanan, NY.

Second, rods do not move around in a nuclear core and there is no next core
rotation.

Third, Ingres and DEC VAXes are not used in safety systems in nuclear power
plants, so neither could have any impact on whether a meltdown was likely.

&gt; Remind me to tell you about answering questions about how we at Ingres
&gt; said we would provide support during nuclear wars at a sales call to
&gt; the Strategic Air Command some time...

Another urban legend?...

My best guess is one of two possibilities:

(1) One of these plants was shut down for refueling, during which time they
remove spent fuel bundles and replace them with fresh fuel.  During this
process, they also move (rotate?)  other bundles to new locations for the
next year of operation.  The offline computers are used to maintain records
of the location of each bundle throughout its life in the core.  If that
database gets corrupted, the utility must revert to tracking everything by
hand -- a laborious and time-consuming process.  The four-hour window could
have been because the refueling is a critical-path item during an outage and
delays can cost millions of dollars in lost revenue.

(2) One of these plants was planning a control rod sequence exchange to
maintain a uniform fuel burnout throughout the core.  These rod patterns are
precalculated in DEC VAX computers and may involve an Ingres database.
Sometimes these exchanges are done at reduced power, so the four hour time
limit may have been the time at which they had to be back at full power or
they might have to shut down, again an economic decision that involves
millions of dollars.

In either case, there is no safety issue.

In fact, there are very few commercial nuclear plants in the US that use
computers or software in any safety system.  Upgrades to safety systems that
include digital technology is an ongoing area of development between the
industry, research groups, and the regulatory agency (Nuclear Regulatory
Commission).  There are also safety-critical discussion groups on the
Internet that exchange ideas.  Because of misconceptions of how safety
systems are defined and used in nuclear plants, I published a WEB page for
the safety-critical group that may help understand the context of safety in
nuclear power applications.  Anyone who posts nuclear power plant examples
should review that article at: <A HREF="http://www.netcom.com/~caprit/ctisafet.html">http://www.netcom.com/~caprit/ctisafet.html</A>.

The risk of this article is the rapid spread of misinformation!

I love war stories, but alas, the story from: "Rebholz, Chris"
&lt;<A HREF="mailto:crebholz@sjpubs01.sj.unisys.com">crebholz@sjpubs01.sj.unisys.com</A>&gt;, is not true.

As a resident of New Jersey, I am unaware of any Edison Power and Light.
There are also four nuclear power plants in New Jersey, and I have worked at
all four, in groups responsible for the process computers.

&gt;A true war story:

As the former Principal Engineer for Digital Systems at PSE&amp;G's
(California's equivalent of PG&amp;E) three nuclear plants, I assure you there
are no computer moving control rods.  There are computers used to compute
rod worth for future fuel loads, but no nuclear plant in this country
entrusts computers to move rods in such a way as to cause a meltdown.  Most
of the rod moving components and systems are old analog systems.  The
closest a computer comes to actual fuel movement is through a computer - a
"rod-worth minimizer" - that will stop an operator from pulling control rods
out of the prescribed, analyzed, approved "pull sheet."

The real problems with computers at nuclear plants are actually much more
interesting.  I'll submit an example I posted in another group a few months
ago if I can find it on my archive tape.  But for now, let's get real.

A lot of people beat up on AOL for good reasons. At least as many beat up on
AOL without knowing what they are talking about. I have no love for AOL, but
I see no reason to attack them for things they didn't do.

&gt; &gt;From: <A HREF="mailto:Postmaster@aol.com">Postmaster@aol.com</A>

This is suspicious to start with. I've corresponded with AOL admins on
numerous occasions, including David O'Donnell, who normally acts as AOL
postmaster. I've never received a message indicating it was from
<A HREF="mailto:postmaster@aol.com">postmaster@aol.com</A>. The admins all use their individual e-mail addresses. In
fact, AOL actively discourages e-mail to postmaster because it delays the
response while someone sifts through the volume of e-mail to forward it to
the responsible individual within AOL. They provide other addresses for
reporting abuse, etc.

&gt; message from the postmaster also made the point that their customers have to
&gt; pay for all their e-mail so this is a problem (well, THEN *YOU* EDIT THEIR
&gt; MAIL -- YOU'RE GETTING THE @$%#^ MONEY, NOT ME!)

This clinches it. AOL customers do not pay to receive e-mail and never
have. Many people make this mistake; it was Compuserve that once
charged to receive e-mail. The AOL postmaster would of course know this,
so the message is a clear and unmistakable forgery.

I suggest that the original recipient examine the message headers more
closely. Someone who can't even get the basic facts about AOL right
probably didn't forge the headers very well either.

&gt; This is why we also have to be careful with this anti-spam crap, there are
&gt; people out there, some of whom work as postmasters for the largest online
&gt; services on the planet, who, are, well...you get my point, can't quite fog a
&gt; mirror, I guess is the expression.

Yes, world.std.com is a large online service and someone who works
there can't detect an e-mail forgery ... well, you get my point.

&gt; Morons. I may just mass unsub all AOL addresses from all lists here. I mean,
&gt; this is their postmaster threatening, not some random.

On the contrary, it *is* some random.

On the other hand, the posting to comp.risks didn't show the full
headers of the message from <A HREF="mailto:bzs@world.std.com">bzs@world.std.com</A>, so maybe that was a
forgery too. Not to mention that I have no way of knowing whether bzs
actually works for world.std.com. I hope not; this posting is so rude
that I hate to attribute it to anyone working for any service provider.

I'd be *most* interested in seeing the ENTIRE original message from AOL.
I'm quite surprised to see mail bouncing off a server being called
"SPAM"...unless it's a junk mail list (replies to the junk mailers
usually bounce as a normal course of events).

In full disclosure, some time last month I had an e-mail conversation with
Mr Shein that ultimately ended in a stream of obscenities from him. We were
talking about the fact that "world.std.com" gives a home to DEMC, a major
junk mail outfit. They spam from throw-away accounts at ISPs, but point
replies back to their autoresponder firmly ensconced at DEMC.COM, which is
served by world.std.com. I sought to explain that by providing a stable
return address, he is aiding DEMC in its spamming activities.

In <A HREF="/Risks/18.22.html">RISKS-18.22</A>, Mark Seecof notes that spelling checkers that use prefix and
suffix tables can find nonwords.  I saw a paper by Doug McIlroy a number of
years ago that noted two such nonwords that have a good chance of appearing
in actual documents: thier and presenation.

After all, if you can derive flier from fly, you can derive thier from thy.
And if you can derive relation from relate, you can derive senation from
senate, hence presenation.

Incidentally, Doug noted that the most frequently misspelled word in his
sample was `accommodate,' which he found seven ways to misspell.

Martin's posting reminded me of something I found while researching health
risks associated with computers some time ago.  Please bear with me: the
original article was not a formal review of the study, and I haven't got a
reference for it.

Going strictly from memory, this involved an Australian company.  The data
entry/query clerks, almost universally, were suffering from facial skin
rashes and attributed it to radiation from the monitors.  A physician,
consulted about the problem, prescribed a barrier cream, and the skin rashes
disappeared.

Someone knew enough about physics to note that 1) monitors don't produce
that much radiation and 2) barrier creams wouldn't stop radiation anyway.
An investigation was launched into the real cause.

The work of the department involved looking up long columns of numbers.
The workers were in the habit of running their fingers down the screen in
order to pinpoint the item they needed.  Static attracted dust, make-up,
and other pollutants to the screen, and the fingers transferred these to
the workers' faces.  Hence the rash.

The barrier cream provided some protection against the pollutants.  More than
that, however, it was greasy.  Workers who ran their fingers down the screens
found they were making streaks on the monitor.  Therefore, they learned not to
touch the screen--and no longer picked up pollutants.

I took part in this study, and got some interesting information from the guy
from the Physics Department of Oslo University who did the field
measurements on my machines:

With modern low-emission crt displays, i.e. like the Nokia 21" MultiGraph
445X screens in my office, the keyboard can (and did, in my case) radiate
more than the crt! The crt was the predominant source of static electricity,
however.

The computer enclosure as well as crt and keyboard was grounded, not the hard disk.

KCRG, A local TV station in Cedar Rapids went into some detail on the story
because the local school district almost bought the widget, and another
local district did, and was satisfied with what they got.

The Tracker had an empty plastic "electronics box" you wore over your
shoulder, connected by a coiled telephone-style cord to a pistol grip.  The
antenna was hinged to the pistol grip so it could swing very freely from
side to side, and the operating instructions were to hold the grip so that
the axis of the hinge was exactly vertical.

As a result, like a classic dousing rod, very slight subconscious hand
movements can cause wild changes in where the antenna points.  The result,
in the hands of a skilled practitioner can be as gratifyingly accurate as a
dousing rod, but of course, what it's doing is uncovering subconscious
guesses on the part of the practicioner, not pointing at water or drugs.

Perhaps I should start selling forked birch sticks to police departments?

After a shutdown of 6 months during which the LEP vacuum system was opened
at many locations, the accelerator was started up on 14 June 1996.

After 5 days of machine studies it became clear that there was an obstacle
inside the LEP vacuum chamber close to Point 1. On the morning of 19 June
the vacuum system was opened and 2 empty beer bottles, some 5 metres apart,
were found inside the beam pipe.  This incident has caused a 5 day delay in
the setting up of the accelerator and will result in a reduction of about
10% of the time available for running LEP2 at the W pair production
threshold (161 GeV) in 1996.

According to the 24-30 June issue of *Space News* the 4 June 1996 explosion
of the Ariane 5 rocket was caused by software in the inertial guidance
system.  Apparently an inertial platform from the Ariane 4 was used aboard
the Ariane 5 without proper testing.  When subjected to the higher
accelerations produced by the Ariane 5 booster, the software (calibrated for
an Ariane 4) ordered an "abrupt turn 30 seconds after liftoff", causing the
airframe to fail.

The article notes that a request to test the inertial platform under
conditions similar to those produced by the Ariane 5 was "vetoed by CNES
for budgetary reasons."  Sextant Avionique, the builder of the inertial
platform, has since performed these tests and confirmed that it would
fail in an Ariane 5 launch.

We are again reminded that crashing a simulator is lots cheaper than
crashing a vehicle.

Subject:  The Millennium comes early to GPS

I have good news and I have bad news.
The good news is that GPS will not have a "Year 2000" problem.
The bad news is that GPS System Time will roll over at midnight
21-22 August 1999, 132 days before the turn of the millennium.
On 22 August 1999, unless repaired, many or all GPS receivers
will claim that it is 6 January 1980, 23 August will become 7
January, and so on.  I would expect that some manufacturers have
already solved the problem, but many have not.

The details:  Section 3.3.4(b) (page 33) of the ICD-GPS-200 rev B
(30 November 1987 issue) states that the GPS Week count starts at
midnight 5-6 January 1980 UTC (Julian Date 2,444,244.500), and
that the GPS Week field is modulo 1024.  This means that the week
count will roll over 1024/52= 19.69 years from then, or in
1980+19.7= 1999, only a few years from now.  Specifically, first
rollover will occur at Julian Date (2,444,244.5 + 7*1024)=
2,451,412.500, which is midnight 21-22 August 1999 UTC.

I could find no mention of any field in any GPS message that
would tell you which 1024-week cycle you were in.  In the July
1993 update of ICD-GPS-200, a note has been added (also on page
33) saying that the week number *will* roll over, and that users
must account for this, but no way to accomplish this is
mentioned.  I take this note as further evidence that there is no
way to tell, given only the signal-in-space definition as of July
1993.  I have gotten some e-mail traffic indicating that, just as
I had suspected, some manufacturers did realize that GPS would
soon roll over, and were keeping it to themselves in the hope
that the others would fall upon their swords.  Not pretty.

Our supplier was dumbfounded when I raised the issue, couldn't
stop thanking me for pointing it out years before rollover.  They
clearly feel that it could have been a life-threatening disaster
for them.  Every GPS-related product they had ever made would
have come back for repair, under warrantee, all at once.  Too
close for comfort.  And, discovered by luck.

The firmware in all older units will have to be replaced.  This
would involve replacement of PROMs; some are socketed, some are
soldered. New units presumably will know better than to claim
dates from before they were manufactured, and/or will allow the
user to directly or indirectly tell the firmware which 1024-week
cycle to assume, without requiring replacement of that firmware
at the second rollover, in 1980+(2*1024/52)= 2019 AD. Some of
this equipment will still be in use then, long after the
manufacturer has forgotten the product.

However, in spite of everything, not everybody will get the
message, so system software will forever have to have an
independent idea of what year it is, to know when to disbelieve a
receiver or receivers (they could all be wrong), and to handle
arguments between various GPS receivers (if only some are wrong).

Without a GPS Simulator, there is no way for users to test a GPS
receiver for this problem.  All most users can do is to ask their
manufacturer for a solution, and also to imbue the system
software with a suitable degree of skepticism about GPS receivers'
sense of time.

My intent in posting this note is to alert the entire industry to
the problem, allowing it to be solved with minimal disruption to
all.  As a technical matter, the solution is quite simple.  It's
the logistics that will take some years.

POLICE COMPUTER SNATCHED FROM DETECTIVE'S CAR

PA News  30 Jun 1996
Police Computer Stolen

By Tim Moynihan, PA News
&gt;&gt;   A police computer has been stolen from a senior officer's
&gt;&gt;car, it was confirmed today.
&gt;&gt;   Two youths snatched the laptop from a car being driven by
&gt;&gt;Detective Superintendent Brian Edwards, who investigates major
&gt;&gt;crimes in central London.
&gt;&gt;   Scotland Yard declined to comment on whether there was
&gt;&gt;sensitive material on the computer though they stressed it was
&gt;&gt;"security protected".

o	Taken by two youths when the car was stopped in traffic at about
1740 hrs Thursday June 27, 1996.

o	Police dismissed a report that the laptop contained information
about two current, notorious cases, the Lawrence stabbing and the death of
Member of Parliament Stephen Milligan, who was found naked except for
suspenders and stockings with a plastic bag over his head and a noose of
electrical cord around his---neck.

&gt;&gt;   Police advice to the public is not to put valuable items on
&gt;&gt;the back seat, but to keep them in the boot.

[DMK: Article makes no mention to the state of consciousness of the driver
of a police car stopped in traffic. TBFTGOGGI (there but for....)]

The online Sydney Morning Herald (*) of June 28, 1996 contains the
following phrases:
"arjpgicial turf" and
"The stereotypes Glover idenjpgied go like this"

Someone has obviously done a search-and-replace to convert "tif" to
"jpg" on the HTML source with the rather cryptic results above; I
suspect the culprit is a single missing backslash - they've searched for
'.tif' not '\.tif'

The risk? Looking foolish by publishing nonsense.

I still treasure the following response by MS Word's grammar checker.
When it came to the following fragment:

The School reviews applications by students . . .

The checker highlighted *School reviews*, and asked:

Is this a misspelling?  Is it the expression *Rigor mortis*?

he had trouble buying some ZIP disks because "the computer is always right",
even though it was wrong.

In the UK, we have a sales tax called VAT, which is levied on most things at
17.5% (It's a lot more complicated than that, but that's outside the scope
of this posting.) One of the things that it's not levied on are books, which
are zero-rated. Recently, I went into my local Ford dealer to buy a workshop
manual for my car. They wanted the price listed, plus VAT, since car parts
are liable to the tax. I pointed out that the workshop manual was a book,
and therefore zero rated, but they said that the computer had no provision
for selling zero rated items. Presumably, this is because car dealers are
unlikely to sell the most common zero rated items (food, children's
clothing, er, books).

In the end, they manually calculated what the price had to be such that the
price including VAT (which the computer insisted on adding) was the price
excluding VAT, and they charged me that. Of course, this makes their VAT
accounts wrong, which the Customs &amp; Excise (who administer VAT) take very
seriously. Afterwards, I called the Customs &amp; Excise to confirm my stance,
and they said that it sounded like this dealer could do with an audit ...

Taking Metro line 6 in Paris from Etoile yesterday at around 9 am I arrived
at Kleber and stood and watched while the station initiated departure signal
sounded several times while the train didn't move.  The train initiated
departure/door-closure signal sounded as well but we still didn't move.  Two
other trains arrived on the parallel track and then departed, ahead of us,
although we were on the 'primary' track.  They had been diverted to the
'secondary'.

I some fit of desperation I looked out from the first carriage and saw
the machiniste (driver/motorman) appear from this small cabin at the
head of the train with a cup of coffee (I presume).  He then entered
his compartment and the train departed.

I can only assume that he was counting on the automatic re-routing of
the subsequent trains.  Or perhaps he signaled some sort of problem,
while he made his coffee.  Trains leave Etoile about every minute or
less and then can be re-routed back to Etoile from Kleber to alleviate
congestion on the platform.

As I got off at Passy I remembered the story, reported in  RISKS, about
the Victoria line Tube train that departed without its driver.  If only
I'd been so lucky.

The HERF-against-banks-story from the Sunday Times 3 weeks ago was somewhat
overhyped and has a lack of facts..  I have collected some facts on real
blackmail attempts performed in Germany on a much lower, but maybe
comparable level.

Since February 1996 until last week a person named Markus S=F6hnke
Ungerb=FChler was calling German banks and corporations, claiming he was a
member of the Chaos Computer Club and has hacked the corporate computer
system. He claimed, that he has his hands on data that proves tax
manipulations and other illegal activities of this company. He also claimed
the hacking of several systems in main German press magazines like stern and
Spiegel.  Ungerb=FChler asked the banks and companies for paying him some
1000 Deutschmarks for giving them the data "back". Another scheme was to ask
for payment for removing allegedly planted negative-stories from the press
computers.  As known by now all of some dozen companies and banks paid in
panic reaction for avoiding any press coverage. Only a very, very small
minority of victims asked the police for help - after paying.  In several
cases Ungerb=FChler handed out some disks with the "data" in exchange for
the money. These disks were empty.

Mr. Ungerb=FChler has escaped in February from an psychiatric hospital,
where he was arrested cause of being an proven schizophrenic and
blackmailer. He started his activities two days after his getaway. He based
in London and operated via some Fax- and Voicemail boxes.  The investigation
of the case was difficult, cause none of the victims was willing to prove
the identity of the blackmailer for the police etc.  (Ungerb=FChler used to
show money couriers from the banks his authentic passport to prove he is the
right person to receive the money)

He is definitely not a member of the Chaos Computer Club and is, as far as
known by now, unable to hack into computer systems. He is simply a
confidence trickster.

The case shows, how fast and easy big companies pay, if they fear press
coverage of real or alleged problems. They pay to everyone who believable
claims to be _able_ to perform hacking or electronic attacks.

In the light of this case, I could imagine, that around 40 banks in London
City have paid for being not attacked by HERF - without the real prove, that
the blackmailers own such weapons. There is a real huge amount of
irrationality in computer security issues, especially in the financial
sector. It seems like no one trusts his security measures. As I have learned
in this case, these security-guys are thinking all the time in a worst-case
manner and if the worst case occurs they are unable to react rational. You
did not need Schwartau-style doomsday-weapons for getting lots of money - ou
only have to be eloquent and know the right buzzwords.  Finally the
Ungerb=FChler-case was mainly fixed cause of massive activities of an
well-known international security company paid by one of the victims, not
cause of so good cooperation between police and the victims.

&gt;Special note:  I work for the IRS and have a work-related vested interest
&gt;============   in _not_ having the Department of Defense involved in
&gt;               contracting for IRS software and systems.  Therefore,
&gt;	       despite any claims of non-bias below, I am clearly
&gt;	       "interested" in the classical sense of the word.

My special note:  I work for the Army as a civilian.

&gt;That part out of the way, I'd like to say (as a private citizen, a
&gt;tax-and-spend liberal, and an almost-always defender of free speech and the
&gt;right of the citizen to privacy) that the present initiative by Congress to
&gt;have DoD become the contracting agent for IRS system and software
&gt;development is a clear and present danger to privacy in the Republic in
&gt;which we stand.

I think it is funny that somebody from the IRS has the GALL to write
about privacy worries about the DoD.  This from a representative from an
agency that wants access to all financial data from all its citizens.
They want to know under criminal penalty about accounts outside the US
borders.  I don't even have to talk about the Social Security Number.

&gt;The initiative referred to above is in the "Subcommittee Mark" of the
&gt;proposed next year's budget.  It's just a House Subcommittee so it's not
&gt;law, but it's a bad idea in my mind, even to consider it seriously.  Is the
&gt;Department of Star Wars and the $700 toilet seat really so excellent a
&gt;contracting agency that they are the clear choice to handle IRS business?

Typical attack based upon ignorance.  First it is the Department of
Defense.  Second, he mentions the $700 toilet seat when in fact it was in
the $600 range.  For those who know about the $600 toilet seat, the cost is
defensible.  It was fabricated by an aircraft company at the request of the
Air Force (not DoD).  It was not mass produced and was made to AF specs.
The company did not even want to make it.  They produced it at cost.  When a
company produces a small amount of items they are expensive.

I don't know the full details of the proposal.  Is it the DoD, AF, or what
agency that will procure the system?  They do have separate procurement
departments.  They all operate under the FAR and Dod regulations but the AF
and Army also have additional procurement regulations.

&gt;Well, that's my biased opinion, and I'd like very much to hear from
&gt;others who may have a more valid claim to disinterest!

Well essentially there are no facts in this post.  The IRS has already
shown their incompetence in procuring ADP systems.  If it is not the DoD, it
might go to NASA or some other agency.

Where is the RISK?  The term "Department of Star Wars" shows a political
objection, not a technical one.  The "$700 toilet seat" outrages usually
turn out to be

(a) priced the same as comparable civilian items; eg. aircraft coffee
makers, emergency flashlights, or

(b) priced according to procurement regulations imposed by Congress;
$15 for the toilet seat, $685 for overhead

and in any case do not tell us much about software development.  True,
the history of software development in the DOD is not a happy one, but
then the IRS hasn't done very well in the past, either.  In terms of
privacy concerns, the IRS is *much* more threatening than the DOD.  That
threat is not changed if DOD contractors start writing IRS software.

Having DOD develop software for the IRS does not especially strike me as
one of the best ideas of the 1990s -- but where's the RISK?

As an ex-liberal and small-l libertarian, I submit that the true danger to
privacy in the Republic is the practice of gathering detailed financial
information from all (law-abiding) Americans under threat of asset
confiscation and jail terms, and then giving tens of thousands of government
employees access to this information in the course of their employment.  I
further submit that passing a few wimpy privacy laws and expecting them to
prevent this information from being used for personal and political purposes
is magical thinking.  It doesn't take a genius to surmise that IRS data is
used regularly for illegal purposes by everyone from the sitting President
(of either party) down to grudge-bearing neighbors and ex-spouses.  I
believe the IRS attempted to assess the depth of the problem in their
Southeastern Region (where my mother worked) at one time, and stopped at
well over 300 violations.  You or I would have ended up at Leavenworth, but
all but a few of the most egregious violators were simply warned not to do
it again.

You can take voluntary action to keep yourself out of the TRW/
Equifax/TransUnion food chain and off junk mail lists...but Federal law
requires you to remain in the IRS's gunsights for your entire productive
lifespan.  Neither party supports privacy when it means privacy from the
government; it is a Democratic president who is enthusiastically supporting
the FBI and NSA in their efforts to prevent American citizens from using
encryption that they can't break, and to require that every phone, fax, and
modem in the United States contain a chip that would allow government
agencies to tap in at will.  Do I need to add here that the very concept of
economic privacy is anathema to those who believe that a portion of
everything you earn, keep, spend, or invest belongs to them, and that not
handing over the fraction they demand is stealing from them?

&gt; Is the Department of Star Wars and the $700 toilet seat
&gt; really so excellent a contracting agency that they are the
&gt; clear choice to handle IRS business?

I don't expect the IRS to be abolished anytime soon...but letting the DoD
design its computer systems would be an acceptable second choice.  The DoD
may be expensive, but they're not very good.  My fondest hope is that with a
spanking new Government Issue computer system, the IRS that the GSA says
can't figure out where 60% of its own budget goes won't be able to find 60%
of mine.  I don't like paying for $700 toilet seats (or $320,000 spotted
owls) any more than you do.

The solution which provides the smallest RISK to privacy is not to gather
the data in the first place.  If tax compliance is truly voluntary, then the
IRS should trust that we are reading 21,000 pages of IRS rules and case law
and sending in the correct amount.

In Germany a new book has been published by Markus Gaulke that describes and
illustrates (by citing hundreds of precise and real computer mishaps) the
risks and dangers connected to the increasing use of information technology
in all parts of human life. The book is very interesting reading, easy to
understand and gives valuable insights. Unfortunately the book (344 pages) is
published only in German so far (original titel: "Digitale Abgruende - Was
die Computerbranche ihren Kunden verschweigt"; verlag moderne industrie,
ISBN: 3-478-91510-4), but the author offers a Web Page in English about the
contents of his book (<A HREF="http://members.aol.com/Secuinfo/welcome.html">http://members.aol.com/Secuinfo/welcome.html</A>).

More than a dozen states including California, Oregon, Washington, Utah,
Nevada, Wyoming, Arizona, reported power outages on 2 July 1996.  At least
11 separate power plants "inexplicably were knocked off line".  The problem
appears to have originated at a 1500-megawatt intertie at the
California-Oregon border.  Later in the day, plants in Rock Springs,
Wyoming, and along the Colorado river also went off line.  [Source: Reuters
item, *The Boston Globe*, 3 July 1996, p.3]

On the following day, parts of Idaho were again blacked out.  Perry Gruber,
spokesman for the Bonneville Power Administration in Portland, Oregon, said,
"We can rule out sabotage.  We can rule out UFOs.  I think we can rule out
computer hackers."  Utility officials said it may take as long as a week to
find the cause(s).  [Source: Associated Press item, *The Boston Globe*, 4
July 1996., p.4]

[Jerry Saltzer, who was in Idaho, remarked to me that what was most
striking was the sheer confusion in reports of what might have been the
cause.  "AP reported without comment that eleven generating plants shut down
simultaneously, with the apparent implication that some kind of widespread
conspiracy was involved.  Idaho Power said the problem originated in
California, but its system autoshut down completely and had to go through a
"Black Start".  Oregon's main power company said it was a problem on the
Pacific Northwest Intertie.  Colorado's power company said the problem
originated in their system but they didn't understand what it was.  Idaho
Power said it had nothing to do with the hot weather and unusual load from
air conditioning.  Oregon said it was caused by the hot weather and unusual
load from air conditioning.  Three days later they still didn't have any
consensus on what had happened.  Impressive disarray--one has the feeling
that they don't talk to one another.  With this much lack of communication,
I'm not sure they should be allowed to interconnect, either."  JHS]

[...] At least 1.5 million customers were affected by sporadic outages.
Apparently an instability in the power grid caused these problems.  (It is
interesting how sporadic these outages were.  In Berkeley, our power wasn't
interrupted, yet portions of the Bay Area subway system (BART) were without
power).

Other contributors can no doubt explain better then I can how such
instabilities occur, but I would rather address a more frightening thought:
Can such instabilities be deliberately introduced?  Could someone actively
sabotage the power-grid in this way?

This outage didn't cause much damage.  After all, it was during the day and
hot and miserable, so a few million people were simply made uncomfortable.
But what would happen to LA if a California wide blackout occurred at say,
11pm on Dec. 31st?

One might also wonder if other portions of our energy infrastructure
are similarly vulnerable to attack?

Philip Zimmermann, creator of Pretty Good Privacy encryption software,
testified before a Senate subcommittee that, based on a 1993 presentation by
Michael Wiener of Northern Telecom, it would be possible to build a machine
for $1 million that could crack a message encrypted with the Data Encryption
Standard and a 56-bit key in an average of 3.5 hours.  A more powerful
machine, costing about $10 million, could do it in 21 minutes, and a $100
million machine could bring the time down to two minutes.  Zimmermann's
testimony contradicted a recent statement by U.S. Attorney General Janet
Reno that even with a "top of the line supercomputer, decoding a 56-bit key
would take over a year and the evidence would be long gone."  At issue is
whether the U.S. should permit the general-license export of 56-bit
encryption products.  (BNA Daily Report for Executives 27 Jun 1996, A5, in

At twenty past two today, John Munden walked free from Bury Crown
Court. This resolved a serious miscarriage of justice, and ended an
ordeal for John and his family that has lasted almost four years.

In a judgment loaded with significance for the evidential value of
cryptography and secure systems generally, His Honour Justice John
Turner, sitting with two assessors, said that `when a case turns on
computers or similar equipment then, as a matter of common justice,
the defence must have access to test and see whether there is anything
making the computers fallible'. In the absence of such access, the
court would not allow any evidence emanating from computers.

As a result of this ruling, the prosecution was not in a position to
proceed, and John Munden was acquitted.

John was one of our local policemen, stationed at Bottisham in the
Cambridge fenland, with nineteen years' service and a number of
commendations. His ordeal started in September 1992 when he returned
from holiday in Greece and found his account at the Halifax empty. He
complained and was told that since the Halifax had confidence in the
security of its computer system, he must be mistaken or lying. When
he persisted, the Halifax reported him to the police complaints
authority for attempted fraud; and in a trial whose verdict caused
great surprise, he was convicted at Mildenhall Magistrates' Court on
the 12th February 1994.

I told the story of this trial in a post to comp.risks (see number
15.54 or get ftp.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/rja14/post.munden1). It turned out
that almost none of the Halifax's `unresolved' transactions were
investigated; they had no security manager or formal quality assurance
programme; they had never heard of ITSEC; PIN encryption was done in
software on their mainframe rather than using the industry-standard
encryption hardware, and their technical manager persisted in claiming
(despite being challenged) that their system programmers were unable
to get at the keys. Having heard all this, I closed my own account at
the Halifax forthwith and moved my money somewhere I hope is safer.

But their worships saw fit to convict John of attempted fraud - which
made the national papers.

An appeal was lodged, but just before it was due to be heard - in
December 1994 - the prosecution handed us a lengthy `expert' report by
the Halifax's accountants claiming that their systems were secure.
This was confused, even over basic cryptology, but it was a fat and
glossy book written by a `big six' firm with complete access to the
Halifax's systems - so it might have made an impression on the court.
We therefore applied for, and got, an adjournment and an order giving
me - as the defence expert witness - `access to the Halifax Building
Society's computer systems, records and operational procedures'.

We tried for nine months to enforce this but got nowhere. We complained,
and an order was made by the judge that all prosecution computer evidence
be barred from the appeal. The Crown Prosecution Service nonetheless
refused to throw in the towel, and they tried to present output such as
bank statements when the appeal was finally heard today.

However, the judge would have none of it.

Many thanks to all those who helped, and especially to guys like Brian
Randell, Chuck Pfleeger and John Bull who wrote in to the Chief Constable
and pointed out that the original judgment was patently absurd. It was
largely due to their letters that John was suspended from the force rather
than sacked.

For the computer security community, the moral is obvious: if you are
designing a system whose functions include providing evidence, it had better
be able to withstand hostile review. This is understood by designers of
forensic systems, and the value of hostile review is also well known to the
military and the utilities. But with one or two exceptions - such as SET -
the banks are just not on the same planet, and the risk to them should be
clear!

Just got this in from a friend at Microsoft:

DETROIT - General Motors Corp. said Tuesday it is recalling about 292,860
Pontiacs, Oldsmobiles and Buicks from the 1996 and 1997 model years
because of an engine software problem that could result in a fire.

The cars are the 1996 Pontiac Bonneville, Oldsmobile Ninety Eight and
Eighty Eight, Buick Park Avenue, LeSabre, Riviera and Regal, and some
1997 Buick Le Sabres.

GM said a faulty engine system sequence can cause a backfire during
start-up. That can result in a cracked intake manifold, which in some
instances could erupt in a fire.

With the proliferation of computer technology into automobiles, it had
to happen sooner or later...

My special note: I am also a tax-and-spend liberal, and in addition I
have a background in the rules of logic and am a native speaker of English.

&gt;&gt;The initiative referred to above is in the "Subcommittee Mark" of the
&gt;&gt;proposed next year's budget.  It's just a House Subcommittee so it's not
&gt;&gt;law, but it's a bad idea in my mind, even to consider it seriously.  Is the
&gt;&gt;Department of Star Wars and the $700 toilet seat really so excellent a
&gt;&gt;contracting agency that they are the clear choice to handle IRS business?

&gt;  Typical attack based upon ignorance.  First it is the Department of
&gt;Defense.

Are we really supposed to believe that the original poster was "ignorant"
of this point?  To me, the original poster was obviously employing
"rhetoric", a common argumentative technique that adds nothing to the
logical argument, merely makes a more forceful emotional appeal.  It
appears to have worked in this case.

&gt;  I don't know the full details of the proposal.

It is also a weak argument to accuse the poster of ignorance, then admit
your own ignorance.

Next we get 2 (somewhat conflicting) explanations of "the $700 toilet
seat", from 2 different posters, one of which explains that "in fact it
was in the $600 range." I'm sorry, but this makes little difference to
the weight of the argument.  At $600 a seat, it still needs explaining, a
point that the poster recognizes by offering an explanation.

The RISKS? Employing emotional, rhetorical arguments while condemming
them in the other side of the argument does little to help your side and
keeps the noise level high.

I maintain a mailing list using the old "listproc" package.  Unfortunately,
Microsoft Mail users cannot subscribe, unsubscribe, etc, except by manually
sending e-mail to me. Microsoft mail (at least the way they are using it)
inserts a blank line at the front of the message, then some special
microsoft mail headers, and only THEN includes the text being mailed.  The
trouble is the list processor sees the Microsoft mail fields as the start of
the message and aborts (since those aren't legal listproc commands) without
reading further.

Another mailing list I subscribe to has been repeatedly "mail bombed" by
microsoft mail. If a "microsoft mail server" in the path to a recipient goes
down, the list address gets bombarded with error messages.  The error
messages then get echoed back out to the entire list and create additional
error messages. The problem appears to be that "Microsoft mail" error
messages don't conform to the mail protocols the list processor expects to
see flagging error messages, and so are not rejected by the mailing list
software.

One other annoying incident occurred on the mailing list I maintain
(unrelated to microsoft mail this time!). Someone on the list decided to
edit their "name" to be extremely long, like so: From:
<A HREF="mailto:canadian_fellow@canadian">canadian_fellow@canadian</A>_university.ca (His name followed by a very long
diatribe against French nuclear testing in the Pacific here, all on one
line!)  The list processor software overflowed the field and truncated his
diatribe.  Most of the sites receiving the broadcast then barfed with
various nasty error messages because of the mismatched parenthesis, causing
a flood of error messages to come back to me as the list maintainer.

&gt;This clinches it. AOL customers do not pay to receive e-mail and never have

AOL customers have a monthly allotment of time in many areas, including MAIL
and newsgroups, and have to pay for connect time beyond their allotment. The
standard plan has a 5-hour monthly allotment with $2.95/hr beyond that.

The same is currently true for CompuServe, too.

Therefore lots of spamming _will_ cost AOL customers money if they reach
their 5-hour montly allotment.

In <A HREF="/Risks/17.75.html">RISKS-17.75</A>, Peter Wayner noted the computer study done by Professor
Donald Foster at Vassar College that attributed the writing style of the
anonymously authored novel ``Primary Colors'' to Joe Klein, a Newsweek
columnist and CBS commentator.  Recently, Maureen Casey Owens, past
president of the American Academy of Forensic Sciences, studied the
handwritten notes on the amended typescript pages for the novel and
concluded that the handwriting was most certainly that of Joe Klein.
[Source: an article by David Streitfeld in *The Washington Post*, 17 July
1996]  (An NPR program I heard at lunchtime on 17 Jul noted that other
investigators had turned up the fact that Klein had recently paid cash for
half of the price of his new house, seemingly having struck it rich in a
short period of time.)  On the same day, Random House finally admitted that
Klein was indeed the author.

Peter Wayner earlier had suggested in <A HREF="/Risks/17.75.html">RISKS-17.75</A> that if Joe Klein were
really trying to hide his identity, he would have disguised his writing
style more assiduously.  But we might suspect that Joe did not want to hide
his identity completely, because the suspense has undoubtedly increased
sales and paid for his house, and the having been identified will now
dramatically increase his name-recognition index.  On the other hand, Klein
is now taking a lot of flak relating to his integrity as a journalist,
because until now he has lied in denying authorship.  Is it really true that
all publicity is good publicity, even if it is bad publicity?

So, you may ask, where is the RISKS relevance in this case?

* RISKS readers are by now accustomed to being suspicious of purported
computer evidence.  Here, the winnowing out of Joe Klein's identity by
Professor Foster is in retrospect very impressive.  A case in which such
evidence turns out to be actually correct is certainly worth mentioning,
particularly because RISKS is sometimes criticized for including so many
negative computer-related cases (a situation that occurs largely because we
so seldom see real successes).  Thus, there can be risks in *doubting* that
digital evidence is truthful.  But, above all, there are always risks in
*believing* that digital evidence is truthful.

* There is the risk of believing that you can reliably hide your identity,
even in the presence of altered writing styles, veiled attacks on oneself
(the novel contains ``an unflattering portrait of a reporter who resembles
Klein, according to Streitfeld), various forms of steganography, spoofed
e-mail, and a trustworthy senior editor.  You must also beware of telephone
records, credit-card records, airplane reservation databases, library
records, nosy realtors, snoopy neighbors, coincidental encounters, etc.

* The art of lying is very difficult.  If you are going to attempt it, you
must be prepared to be absolutely consistent forever, because otherwise
inferences can be drawn that can smoke you out.  However, absolute
consistency is in general impossible, especially if the cover story is in
any way inconsistent with perceivable reality.  Cover stories with plausible
deniability are best when they are also legitimate.  However, with
webservers and cross-linked databases, it is increasingly difficult to hide
the rest of the story.  Also, covert activities in the intelligence world
are such that you must lie in denying the mere existence of a covert
operation (which, *by definition* "does not exist"), and in the name of
national security you must perjure yourself whenever you are challenged.
So, beware of what can be gleaned from computer-related inferences --
especially when some of the information is perfectly above-board but perhaps
not completely correct.

In this case, the Klein battle to remain anonymous may seem to have turned
inside out, but the situation is now really a Klein bottle in which secrecy
and full disclosure are both on the same surface and ethics have become
blurred with nonethics.  Stay tuned for the Klein re-buttle.  I'm not taking
bet-tles.

The only consistent course is clearly to avoid putting yourself in such a
position in the first place.  Although that might seem to preclude April
Fools' spoofs, note that in our most famous cases (for example, the
Chernenko and Spafford e-mail spoofs discussed in the RISKS archives and in
my RISKS book), the prankster has unabashedly 'fessed up when confronted
(Piet Beertema and Chuq von Rospach, respectively), and generally received
admiration for his cleverness.  (The negative responses that "Chernenko"
took are also worth noting.)  Similarly, Robert Morris never denied his
involvement in the Internet Worm experiment that went seriously awry.  So,
perhaps it would have been OK for Klein to publish anonymously if he had
admitted his authorship when first challenged?  However, to expect that he
could remain anonymous forever is totally unrealistic in our
information-laden world, and that realization may color [!] future authors
seeking similar subterfuges.  On the other hand, to retain anonymity in
order to further increase sales is either (1) morally reprehensible, or (2)
just consistent with the emerging American Way -- anything is OK as long as
you can get away with it, or (3) both 1 and 2.

[Peter Wayner found the following quote in Media Circus on-line,
referring to Maureen Casey Owens' analysis of the Klein typescript:

Says Joshua Sostrin, "The analyst later concluded that the Declaration
of Independence, as has long been suspected, was indeed penned by Bob
Dole."]

Musings on the ever-increasing complexity of everyday life, triggered by
the ever-increasing size of the "end-of-the-digest" announcement of the
RISKS Digest:

I am alternately amused and terrified by the ever-increasing complexity of
everyday life.  Technology provides more and more functions essential to our
life. More and more artifacts pervade our lives and make themselves
essential to our lifestyles. Many of the new technologies involve
communication networks that interconnect large numbers of systems. These
lead to an increase in the complexity of societal interactions and the sheer
number of contacts among people. As a result, the number of potential weak
points increase, and thereby the dangers. The ever-increasing amount of
interactions among people, institutions, and governments gives ever-more
opportunities for disaster, and the natural tendency of governments and
institutions is to tackle each known problem by instituting rules,
regulations, and laws to control the abuses. But these well-intentioned (and
sometimes not so well intentioned) efforts simply proliferate to add yet
more complexity to our lives.

Those in computer science know how difficult it is to disentangle the
interactions of a rule-based system.  What happens when the rules are those
of an institution or government, designed by multiple people over decades --
centuries? We have rules that interaction unplanned ways, rules that are
inconsistent. Rules that are vague and ambiguous. Rules that were relatively
clear and precise in the era they were developed, but become outmoded or
imprecise with the passage of time and the invention of new technologies.
We all know what the result is: unstable, unpredictable systems.

Even my own home grows rapidly in complexity. 8+ remote controls to operate
my home theatre/TV. An ever-increasing set of manuals for the
ever-increasing number of home appliances. A dozen or so electric clocks to
be reset when power fails and during the biannual summertime/regular time
switch over. Items to be lubricated, adjusted, dusted, tested. batteries to
be checked and replaced on a regular basis. Security precautions in the home
and at work: identification badges, more secure driver's license, more
secure $100 bills, and the ever proliferation of passwords --each to be
non-words, each to be changed at frequent intervals.

Even the RISKS Digest itself is not immune. Look at the end-of-the-digest
announcement.  Once this was a few lines, at the beginning of the digest.
Then, people like me had problems with the FTP instructions, so the
instructions were made more complete and precise -- but thereby longer.
Then people like me kept asking for permission to reprint, so the
announcement was modified to spell out the policy (which, of course,
required inventing a policy).  Soon, the number of items got so large that
the whole thing was put at the rear of the digest, where it now takes up
over a page of printed text. How long before it is two pages?  How long
before it rivals the size of the digest itself?  [SEE NEXT ITEM.  PGN]

What's the RISK?  Well, as life gets more and more complex, the number of
interactions increases (as N-squared? faster?).  The number of unexpected
interactions also increases, usually with unknown impact.  We have already
seen how the interconnectedness of the phone systems and the electric
utility systems means that single-point failures can sometimes bring down a
large region of the country.  I expect these instances to increase, both in
number and in magnitude, as the number of interconnections increase.

The real question is: are there alternatives or are we doomed to
ever-increasing complexity?

Don, I am really glad you raised this issue.  It is worthy of considerable
discussion in RISKS.

Not incidentally, a problem in the past is that RISKS gets distributed to
net-lame places that cannot use the web or FTP or much else, or in some
cases cannot even reply by e-mail.  The full risks.info message kept growing
in part to stave off all of the victims of noncompliant Internet service
providers and sites without webservers.  I too have been annoyed at the
increasing volume of the risks info message.  So, thanks to your urging,
from now on new subscribers will continue to get the full info page
initially when their subscription is acknowledged, and the regular
end-of-issue item will be BRIEF.  The full info message can be gotten by
e-mail to <A HREF="mailto:risks-request@CSL.sri.com">risks-request@CSL.sri.com</A> with the one line INFO, by ftp, and as a
web page, and the brief message (see the end of this issue) states that "All
contributors are assumed to have read the full info file."  I hope that
suffices.  MANY THANKS for the prompt.  PGN

&gt;&gt;  A computer buff who downloaded the Marks &amp; Spencer's security
&gt;&gt;file containing pin numbers when he visited a London store to
&gt;&gt;carry out maintenance, was ordered to complete 70 hours
&gt;&gt;community service work today.
&gt;&gt;   Former Olivetti computer engineer Edward Yearley, 29, of
&gt;&gt;Vicarage Lane, Bovingdon, Hemel Hempstead, Herts, was convicted
&gt;&gt;in June of gaining unauthorised access to computer material in
&gt;&gt;October 12 1994, under the Computer Misuse Act 1990.

o	Yearly posted the file to the "Gates of the Underworld" BBS where it
was noticed in November.  Police duly executed a search warrant on his
home, seizing his PC and disks.  Yearly denied belonging to the BBS, but his
computer showed where he had uploaded the file under the pseudonym "Mr. Ed."

&gt;&gt;   After reading pre-sentence reports magistrate Paul Clark
&gt;&gt;said: "There is an element of breach of trust here. It is fair
&gt;&gt;to say a certain amount of knowledge and expertise is needed to
&gt;&gt;commit an offence such as this."

[DMK: I don't know whether to sigh or barf.]

&gt;&gt;   He added: "I'm satisfied there was no question of personal
&gt;&gt;profit for you, no gain and no loss to Marks &amp; Spencer.  But
&gt;&gt;the scope for other people to misuse the information that was
&gt;&gt;downloaded is hard to judge."

o	Yearley was ordered to perform 70 hours of community service and pay
UKP170 in cour costs.  His computer will be returned to him.

&gt;&gt;   "Although your own personal computer was seized and evidence
&gt;&gt;gathered from it, your own computer was not used for committing
&gt;&gt;the offence or facilitating it."

[DMK: Stealing the data in the first place and violating the Parker
principle of Possession or posting it to the BBS and violating the principle
of Confidentiality?  Maybe I'll barf after all.]

An article in the 10 Jul 1996 *San Francisco Chronicle* (p. A13 of the East
Bay edition) describes a group of high-school students who broke into a
drink manufacturer's voice-mail system, erased information, changed
passwords, created new accounts for their own use, and eventually crashed
the system through overuse.  The article reports that the company had to
spend $40,000 to bring in an outside technician and upgrade their software.

A few questions remain.  Should superuser functions like the creation of new
users be allowed via the phone at all?  How was the infiltration so
pervasive that they couldn't just shut the system down, erase bogus
accounts, and chance privileged passwords?

I'm reminded of a similar, more limited, incident which occurred five or six
years ago when my high school set up a voice mail system to keep parents
informed of their children's homework assignments.  There was a system-wide
password to update the information, which was changed monthly for security
reasons -- in January, it was 1111, in February it was 2222, and in December
it was 1212.  After the system was broken into, its administrator decided
against changing the password.  Her reasoning: it was near the end of the
month, and the password would be changed soon, anyway.

18 July 1996

There is currently being circulated, to members of Congress and possibly
elsewhere, a four page document entitled ``Brute-Force Cryptanalytic
Attacks'' that calls into question some of the conclusions of the ``Minimum
Key Lengths for Symmetric Ciphers'' white paper [1].  The document bears no
author or organization attribution, but we are told that it originated from
NSA.

The NSA document argues that ``physical realities'' make parallel key search
much more expensive and time consuming than our white paper estimated.
However, the NSA document appears to have been written from the perspective
of general parallel processing or cryptanalysis rather than exhaustive key
search per se.  It ignores several elementary principles of parallel
processing that apply specifically to exhaustive key search machines of the
type that our white paper considered.

In particular, NSA argues that interconnections, heat dissipation,
input/output bandwidth, and interprocessor communication make it difficult
to ``scale up'' a key search machine by dividing the task among a large
number of small components.  While these factors do limit the scalability of
more general purpose multiprocessor computers (such as those made by Cray),
they do not apply at all to specialized exhaustive key search machines.  The
NSA argument ignores the most fundamental feature of brute-force key search:
the processors performing the search have no need to communicate with other
components of the system while they perform their share of the search, and
therefore the system has no need for any of the global interconnections that
limit scaling.  Indeed, there is no reason that all the components of a
parallel search machine must be located even within the same city, let alone
the same computer housing.  We note that one of our co-authors (Eric
Thompson, of Access Data, Inc.)  designs and builds medium-scale FPGA-based
key search machines with exactly this loosely-coupled structure, and
regularly uses them to recover keys for clients that include the FBI.

The NSA document also calls into question our cost estimates for ASIC
components, suggesting that ASIC chips of this type cost NSA approximately
$1000.00 each.  However, our $10.00 per chip estimate is based on an actual
price quote from a commercial chip fabrication vendor for a moderate-size
order for an exhaustive search ASIC designed in 1993 by Michael Wiener [2].
Perhaps NSA could reduce its own costs by changing vendors.

Finally, the NSA report offers estimates of the time required to
perform exhaustive search using a Cray model T3D supercomputer.  This
is a curious choice, for as our report notes, general-purpose
supercomputers of this type make poor (and uneconomical) key search
engines.  However, even the artificially low performance results for
this machine should give little comfort to the users of 56 bit keys.
According to NSA, 56 bit keys can be searched on such a machine in
less than 453 days.  ``Moore's law'' predicts that it will not be long
before relatively inexpensive general-purpose computers offer similar
computational capability.

BRUTE-FORCE CRYPTANALYTIC ATTACKS

Two published theoretical estimates of cost versus time to perform
brute-force hardware attacks on selected cryptography key lengths
differ between themselves and differ significantly from what we find
when we buy or build computers to carry out such attacks.

The differences lie in assumptions made in the theoretical estimates,
which are not fully spelled out by the authors, and in scaling up
hypothesized small machines to ever larger ones without accounting for
physical realities.

The factors not accounted for are:

o R&amp;D costs for the first machine, typically on the order of $10
million.

o As more and more chips are added to a machine, two effects occur:

o Interconnections increase and increase running time;
o Heat from the chips eventually limit [sic] the size of a
machine.

o Memory costs are not included.

o When get [sic] to the very fast processing speed estimates,
machines can become Input/Output bound; so [sic] it cannot achieve
the estimated speed.

o Assuming every algorithm can be tested in same amount of time and
key length is the only difference.

Table 1 are [sic] the average time estimates made for a given cost
done by Michael Wiener of Bell Norther Research in 1995.  These are
published in Bruce Schneier's Applied Cryptography book.

Note that these are average times, one-half of the total exhaust time.

Table 2 are [sic] the estimates for total exhaust times using Field
Programmmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) and Application Specific ICs (ASICs)
done for the Business Software Alliance by Blaze, Diffie, Rivest,
Schneier, Shimomura, Thompson, and Wiener in 1996.  In addition to the
above factors not accounted for they have assumed ASICs cost as low as
$10.  We find ASICs more typically cost $1000 and their capabilities
can vary considerably depending upon the specific task.

Table 3 are out estimates based on our experience with a Cray T3D
supercomputer with 1024 nodes.  This machine costs $30 million.

The "Edupage Editors" make a critical mistake of logic in an item in
<A HREF="/Risks/18.25.html">RISKS-18.25</A>.  The item reports on Philip Zimmermann's testimony before the
Senate.  In his testimony, Zimmermann discussed a well-known Michael Wiener
paper on the feasibility of building a DES cracking machine.

The RISKS item correctly states that a $100 million version of the machine
could (according to Wiener) crack a DES key in about two minutes.  Wiener's
hypothetical machine is composed of a parallel array of custom designed DES
cracking chips.  It is by no means a general purpose computer.  Still, the
RISKS item says, "Zimmermann's testimony contradicted a recent statement by
U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno that even with a 'top of the line
supercomputer, decoding a 56-bit key would take over a year and the evidence
would be long gone.'"

There is no contradiction at all.  One is a "machine" that may not even
qualify as a programmable computer.  A "top of the line supercomputer" should
not be expected to be anywhere near as effective a DES cracking engine as
would be a machine such as Wiener's, built for the task out of custom chips.

I love how politicians can find ways to say what they want people to believe
- actually both are right. It *would* take a supercomputer a year. However
as long time readers know neither I nor Michael have been suggesting
supercomputers, instead boolean sieves (could use DSPs) made up of
cascadable arrays of single bit processors were what I would use. Similar to
parallel processors but much simpler hence faster.

The state of the art today is about 300 million keys per second for a single
sieve. Of course for a few more dollars you can set up a parallel array of
sieves, as many as you wish (initial value can be distributed and once cranking
you need not be concerned about intercommunication, a single bit would do
for success).

Actually, the hard part is testing for success - of course if you have known
plaintext as most cryptographers always assume...(can think of several ways
to avoid that).

Other problem is that you also must know the exact algorithm being used -
DES of course is fixed (FIPS PUB 46(A|B|C)) but a DES machine would not work
- you would need a different one - for COAST. Not difficult, just different.
Of course if you knew the target were using ENTRUST...

Now I am just am amateur cryptographer just as I have not done any serious
digital design for years, still have a pretty good idea what sub-micron
lithography is capable of so know the numbers above are supportable. I do
disagree with the designated heros of the MIT 7 on one point, they got the
economics wrong - while their per-wafer price is possible, the total design
would cost a bit more and there would be overhead involved (maybe
governments do not worry about that but I do).

My current feeling is that 56-bit DES is OK today for a corporation so long
as every message is encrypted (including the trivial ones), each key is only
used once, and a good random key generator is used. Know that relying on
high volume to raise cost-to-break vs value-of-break above buying an
employee is "Security by Obscurity" but is real cost/benefit. More (64 bits)
is better and many of today's computers have granularities of 32 or 64 bits
(something I never see mentioned - design steps beyond 64 are 96 and then
128).

Padgett

P.S. I was confining my thoughts to symmetric message keys - asymmetric keys
and algorithms that may be used for key exchange are an entirely different
subject.  (Have seen the two confused. Often.).

My local grocery store recently installed a kiosk with the newest generation
of automatic teller machine from Wells Fargo Bank. This ATM has a high
resolution color graphic display, with a touchscreen and virtual keypad for
entering the PIN number.

I was standing in line about 6 feet behind the person currently using it
when I noticed that each time they entered a digit on the keypad, that digit
and only that digit lit up, so I could clearly make out each digit of their
PIN as they pressed it, as could anybody walking by.  Somehow I think this
negates the value of using a PIN, when anybody within a 10 foot radius can
read it without even meaning to.

<A HREF="http://www.eng.warwick.ac.uk/~neil/safebook.htm">http://www.eng.warwick.ac.uk/~neil/safebook.htm</A>

This is an introductory text covering all aspects of the development of
Safety-Critical Computer Systems. It is intended for undergraduate and
postgraduate students, and for engineers who use microcomputers within
real-time embedded systems. It assumes no prior knowledge of safety, or of
any specific computer hardware or programming language.

The book covers all phases of the life of a safety-critical system from its
conception and specification, through to its certification, installation,
service and decommissioning.  It provides information on how to assess the
safety implications of projects, and determine the measures necessary to
develop systems to meet safety needs.  It gives a thorough grounding in the
techniques available to investigate the safety aspects of computer-based
systems and the methods that may be used to enhance their dependability.

The book uses cases studies and worked examples from a wide range of
industrial sectors including the nuclear, aircraft, automotive and consumer
products industries.  The approach taken in equally suited to engineers who
consider computers from a hardware, software or systems viewpoint.

The "Info'96" IBM computer system designed to deliver instantaneous results
of Olympic competitions to the worldwide press is working for journalists in
Atlanta but not for the journalists worldwide who are supposed to be getting
information from the World Press Feed.  Some journalists are angrily
referring to the "Info'96" system as "Info'97."  An IBM spokesman said that
"we expect people to judge us from our performance over the long haul of the
games, instead of the first two days."  Results are available quickly over
the site maintained by IBM at &lt; <A HREF="http://www.atlanta.olympic.org">http://www.atlanta.olympic.org</A> &gt;.  (*Atlanta
Journal-Constitution*, Atlanta Games, p25) [presumably 22 July 1996]

[See also a fine article by Jerry Schwartz in *The New York Times*, 22 July
1996, C1 in the National edition.  This situation was attributed to
``start-up problems.''  Jerry's article noted that ``Olympic technology
officials were organizing a manual results system, part of which the ancient
Greeks might have appreciated.  Results are to be transmitted by facsimile
machines from outlying venues to a central office and distributed by
runners.''  The article also noted the 12-minute blackout at the Georgia
Dome during Saturday night's Dream Team appearance -- blamed on a technician
who pulled the wrong switch.  Transportation problems are also quite severe,
and cellular telephone systems were seriously overloaded at the opening
ceremonies.  I presume everything will be ironed out nicely just in time for
the final ceremonies.  PGN]

PGN makes excellent points about the difficulty of living a lie in his
report on Joe Klein being unmasked as the author of "Primary Colors."  But
as the editor of *The Washington Post* team that had a lot of fun and a lot
of pain reporting the "Primary Colors" story, allow me to cough a little
dryly about the positive spin you put on the role of computers in the
eventual success of our efforts.

For openers, the lesson I drew from my experience was that I would *never*
trust a computer text analysis again.  We ran a massive such effort
independent of Professor Foster and *New York* magazine, and ours turned up
results that at the time seemed fascinating, but in retrospect were
ludicrous.

Even Foster didn't trust his results enough to bet the ranch on it.  As
recently as the day we finally broke the story, he was saying he thought it
was Klein plus somebody else, and was still berating *New York* magazine for
editing into his copy the flat statement that Klein was the author.  Said
flat statement was inserted by an editor with no special computer
experience.  Klein, however, first achieved note as a political columnist
for the very same *New York* magazine.  I suspect, therefore, that human
intuition if not specific knowledge had more to do with that piece than the
computer did.

We at *The Post* *did* get a frightening amount of financial information on
Klein and his wife by computer, including the cost of his house, the amount
of his mortgage, his address, his previous address, everything there is to
know about his cars, and so forth.  And we did it in a startlingly short
period of time.  It's amazing what you can do when you have a person's
social security number and date of birth, and equally sobering how easy it
is to get that information.  Only our sense of journalistic propriety
prevented us from pursuing and using further information that was readily
available.  But again, the information so gathered ended up being largely
tangential to the final report.

I find it marvelous that what finally broke the case was good old-fashioned,
if imaginative, gumshoe reporting.  David Streitfeld, a Washington Post
reporter with eclectic literary interests, receives all sorts of snail-mail
catalogues from tiny second-hand bookstores.  He saw offered for sale a copy
of the manuscript...and the rest you can read in your newspapers.  The
handwriting analyst was an expert human.  No computers were significantly
involved.

Also, the reason Klein is in hot water today is that back when the *New
York* article ran, we had our junk-yard dog, my boss, David Von Drehle, put
him up against the wall by reminding him that credibility is the only asset
a journalist has.  Von Drehle than asked him to swear on his journalistic
credibility that he was not the author of "Primary Colors."  That's when he
most memorably lied, as Klein himself acknowledged at his press conference.

In short, we put an extraordinary amount of computer effort into this story,
including a passworded spreadsheet to keep track of all our reporting.  But
the cyberheroics ended up at best a sideshow if not a distraction, at least
in our experience.

It finally was cracked and developed by old-fashioned means.

[And in subsequent elections, Joe may now be saddled with Primary Collars.
Somehow, I am reminded of a quote from the cast party after the final
episode of an early TV serial, Peyton Place, in which one of the actors
who had been on the show longest was asked,

``To what do you owe your success in acting?''

The answer was this:

``Honesty.  Once you've learned how to fake that, you've got it made.''

A recent press release contained a good quote about the cause of Ariane 5
failure.  The key 2 sentences were these:

&gt; The failure of Ariane 501 was caused by the complete loss of guidance
&gt; and attitude information 37 seconds after start of the main engine
&gt; ignition sequence (30 seconds after lift-off). This loss of
&gt; information was due to specification and design errors in the software

The Logic of Failure:
Why things go wrong and what we can do to make them right
Metropolitan Books (Henry Holt), New York, 1996

[Auf deutsch war es vorher: Dietrich D\"{o}rner,
*Die Logik des Misslingens*, Rowohlt, 1989.]

This is a book that appeals to me very much because of its system-oriented
viewpoints.  ``Faced with problems that exceed our grasp, we pile small
error upon small error to arrive at spectacularly wrong conclusions.  We too
often ignore the big picture and seek refuge in what we know how to do --
fiddling while Rome burns.''  The problems under consideration are largely
not computer problems, but the lessons are all generally relevant to RISKS
readers.

Of some importance here is the logic of analysis, which in this case
includes some creative simulation studies of very diverse failures -- among
which are some that are familiar to RISKS readers.  The results are quite
far reaching.  The book provides a very interesting quasimathematical
approach.  The author is a distinguished German researcher, professor of
psychology at the University of Bamberg, and winner of the Leibniz prize.

I think increasingly complexity is an inevitable result of our nature as
tool builders and users. Most animals (non-domesticated type) have very
non-complex lives: find food, eat, find food, eat, sleep, procreate - kinda
like folks who retire to swinging retirement communities in Florida.

As humans developed tools, they found all kinds of things to do with the
tools: cook food, build shelter, develop polyester to construct leisure
suits to support the pursuit of procreation, etc. We could have simply used
the tools to increase sleep time, much the way computers were to increase
our leisure time, but our nature seems always to lead to the building of
things (or as George Carlin calls it, "stuff") which then demands the
maintenance of things. This feeds the complexity upward spiral, since the
old things never seem to go away and constantly interact with the new things
in odd ways. Witness voice mail.

&gt;From a Risks perspective, I think increased communications paths mitigates
many risks. In my experience on the system engineering side of software
development, most bugs occurred at interfaces, either between systems or
subsystems, or between people or organizations. While one approach might be
to eliminate interfaces, the end result is a lot more work inside each
element. My life would be less complicated without a telephone, but I would
spend a lot of time calculating what I could find out in one phone call. I'm
not sure which scenario is more complex or more error-prone.

Putting big pipes between elements and maximizing interconnections can
certainly lead to unpredictable results, but we can rarely predict the
future anyway, so outside of relatively small systems unpredictability is
not always bad. I think the United States melting pot model was an example
of a highly interconnected system that lead to many unpredictable results -
what war simulation would have predicted a recovery from Pearl Harbor? I
fear that as American society swings back towards a less interconnected set
of systems/cultures, many risks and interface errors will emerge with
serious consequences. Similarly, any business that tried to reduce, rather
than increase, its level of "connectiveness" would be a very risky investment.

In <A HREF="/Risks/18.25.html">RISKS-18.25</A>, I noted the Western power outages of 2-3 July 1996, and
Jerry Saltzer commented on the evident confusion among the differing
reports of what might have happened.

It took until 20 July 1996 -- 18 days later -- for the cause to be
identified officially: an Idaho transmission line that short-circuited when
electricity jumped to a tree that had grown too close.  The tree, which has
since been removed, caused a flashover in an area about 100 miles east of
the Kinport substation in southeastern Idaho.  The line carried 345
kilovolts.  [Source: Associated Press item in the *San Francisco Sunday
Examiner and Chronicle*, 21 July 1996, p.A-8.]

the one we experienced could happen, I highly recommend getting and reading
a copy of "Brittle Power" by Amory Lovins and Hunter Lovins.  I found it to

The United States has two major power grids. The Eastern and the Western,
split approximately along a line passing through the Nebraska,
Colorado/Wyoming border.  The Western grid is complicated by the population
pattern of the western U.S.  The grid there tends towards a large "donut".
The two grids are tied together by a few relatively small DC ties.

This is not the paltry amounts of electricity flowing through the wires in
your walls, or even down your neighborhood alleys.  This is the massive
amounts of POWER used by the entire sections of the U.S. each second. The
physics and engineering involved covers multiple college courses.

The power flows according to the laws of physics, not according to who is
selling how much to whom.  For any given load level, the grid systems have
many bottlenecks. Power companies go to great lengths to constantly balance
generation to minimize these problems.  Take a couple of lines out of the
grid (an overload, or a fallen tree, a local storm, or just plain equipment
failure), and if conditions are right, as the power attempts to get to the
load, remaining lines become overloaded, protection systems open circuit
breakers before the equipment can "burn down", which either causes outages
(relieving the load), or causes more overloads as the power instantly takes
other routes through the grid. As the outages mount, you have generators
creating massive amounts of power with no place for it to go. The generators
own protection systems knock them off line before they damage themselves and
the humans around them.  Enough generators trip off, and now you have load
not being served, so it attempts to flow from the remaining generators,
overloading more lines, etc.  (And you thought all those dominoes were
impressive.)  This energy is flowing at a significant portion of the speed
of light.  These "system disturbances" can occur in seconds, crossing the
boundaries of all interconnected utilities in 2 blinks of an eye.  A unit
trip in one part of the grid can cause problems in another part, without
affecting the intervening portion.

Now try and do a post-mortem on this.  You have hundreds of pieces of
electric power system equipment changing state, logged by multiple (several
hundred ?) computer systems at numerous utilities all using separate clocks
(you need to figure the sequence timed in fractions of a second).

Yes, utilities talk to each other, but even our computers can't talk that
fast or accurately.  Reliability costs money, and that has to come out of
the electric rates.  Nobody is willing to pay for us to have the constant,
instant type of communications necessary to be able to determine the cause
of a large outage such as this.  It also costs money to get all this
information and people from across the U.S. together to figure out what
happened. Is it worth it?  The initial reports are most likely each utility
trying to make a determination looking at it from their end of the pipe.

Utility rates have always been partly a balance of reliablity versus
economics. Now throw the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and
their brand new rules 888 and 889 into the mix.  This is driven entirely by
an idea to lower rates by increasing competition, with very little
consideration for the cost of reliability.  These rules are very lengthy and
complicated, but one of the many requirements is that it requires our
Transmission System Operators and our Energy Marketers (who buy and sell
bulk power, determining generation levels) to not have any contact with each
other except through computer bulletin boards called Open Access Same-Time
Information System (OASIS) .  They cannot even see each other at the coffee
machine.  Any contact between these people has to be reported on the OASIS
(this is not interpretation; it is in the rules).  In an area that is basic
to our reliablity operations, we can no longer talk to ourselves, much less
other utilities.  Also, we have to allow anyone with power to market (who
knows where they got it) equal access to our transmission systems.  The
transmission paths (even though you cannot herd electrons) are bought and
sold via the OASIS.  This is all driven by Independent Power Producers and
intermediate Power Brokers with the idea that more competition will lower
rates.  You may have read about "open access" in the newspapers.  To keep
the transmission system owners from giving preference to themselves or
anyone else (equated to "insider trading"), all information about our
transmission system capabilities has to be posted on the OASIS, including
any engineering studies used to determine those capabilities.  All using
``standard'' Internet methods with Internet connections.  Yes, the word
*Internet* is used in the rules.  These transmission paths do not go cheap.
We are talking about millions of dollars of transactions a day being done
over the Internet.

Volumes have been written and discussed in Internet Forums about the
possible repercussions to the electric power industry.  FERC is not to be
swayed.  They say they did it with the gas industry and the
telecommunications industry.  Gas can be stored and controlled with valves.
Telecommunciations is point to point.  Electric power is instantaneous, and
"pooled" into the grids.  They just don't seem to get it.  In some places
rates will drop.  In others where they are already low, they will rise.
Everywhere as utilities cut corners to "compete", reliability will go down.

It was asked if our energy infrastructure is vulnerable to attack?  Anyone
with a $US buck-three-ninety-eight to buy a power brokers license and a copy
of NetScape can surf the net and get access to the "OASIS" sights. With a
college minor in Electrical Engineering you can deduce the major power
bottlenecks in the power grids. Most of the transmission system lies in very
remote or rural areas.  [...]

Anybody see the 17 July 1996 issue of *USA TODAY*?  Page 2 has an article
talking about how the President of the U.S. is concerned about the security
of the infrastructure, including the Internet and the power grids.  It could
get a whole lot worse.

It has been said that my view is alarmist.  I've read the rules (I have to
write programs to help my company conform), and I have 20 years experience
with electric power companies.  Please, somebody prove to me I'm wrong.

Several articles in <A HREF="/Risks/18.26.html">RISKS-18.26</A> discussed the conclusion of a blue-ribbon
panel that DES's 56b key is vulnerable to brute-force attack.  This issue
is, to me, totally surreal; I am frightened by the way US policy decisions
are being made.

As I understand it, the panel's motive in making the argument that DES is
vulnerable to brute-force attack is *not* to encourage people to switch to
better ciphers.  Instead, it is to argue that DES should be exportable,
since NSA can easily and cheaply break it!

IMHO two key facts ignored by this argument are:

1) Everybody in the world already has access to DES.  Exporting it will give
no one any technology access they don't already have.

2) Two-key 3DES, with its near-112b effective keylength, is *way* outside
any brute-force attack I have ever heard of.  Anybody with unbundled DES
software or with 3 pieces of DES hardware can trivially use it to do 3DES.

NSA seems to fear that bundling DES in popular American software products
will encourage routine use of good cryptography both inside and outside the
US; this makes traffic analysis much harder for them, and thus requires them
to expend much more effort on decryption.  This is a legitimate concern, and
deserves analysis in its own right -- it's a much more a moral, social, and
political question than a technical one.

To phrase the debate in terms of details of the cost of specialized
brute-force DES attack hardware is, in my opinion, absurd.  As near as I can
tell, because of facts 1 and 2 above, such hardware is irrelevant to the
*real* argument, whether it costs $100M or $1.00.

comparator under a programmed mask), the problem is trivial.

Who should attend?

The workshop will deal with a number of topics that are regularly aired on
the RISKS forum, and should be of great interest to all readers of, and
contributors to, RISKS.

It is intended for researchers, requirements owners and system designers who
are concerned with issues of protecting people from the consequences of
faulty and unsuitable computer and information systems.

Workshop theme

In the talk about making the roads of information safe and secure, many
wider social issues are ignored in the focus on technical solutions to
technical problems (secure protocols, trustworthy authentication, encryption
of confidential data and so on). Examples include people who have had their
creditworthiness destroyed or been made bankrupt or rendered homeless by
misuse or misinterpretation of data, and many computer systems cannot adapt
to human failings and/or have no mechanisms for allowing human attempts to
correct inappropriate actions or inaccurate data. In order to deal with such
problems, recent European legislation has decreed that data can only be used
for the purposes for which it was collected. This is clearly in the data
subject's interests, but how can the subject be reassured that it is being
enforced?

These examples can all be seen as design issues. Can we anticipate bad
consequences in the human system which arise from the computer performing
according to its specification rather than according to what is intended?
And if we could, how would this affect the design process?

There are three components to the workshop. Firstly, a couple of invited
papers will set the scene for discussing how social and ethical issues can
be translated into design. Secondly, submitted papers have been chosen to
reflect how some of the process and design problems can be addressed by
system designers. Plenty of time has been allowed for discussion of the
papers. Finally, a couple of debates will be arranged to give participants a
chance to express their views on the extent to which social concerns demand
trade-offs against efficiency (both process and product efficiency) and on
how the designer strikes a balance between ethical considerations and the
achievement of organisational objectives.

Invited Speakers are:
John Nicholls, University of Oxford: 'Design for protecting the user'.
M. Cavanagh: 'Ethics and system design'.

Other papers are by leading researchers from Europe, USA, and Australia.
They are grouped into four Sessions:

1: The Requirements Process
2: Regulatory Issues
3: Safety-critical Issues
4: Social Issues
5: Privacy Issues

On 22 Jul 1996, the Johannesburg Stock Exchange's automated trading system,
JET, failed for the second time this month (*) (Source: *Johannesburg's
Business Day* newspaper of 23 July). Fully automated trading only started on
10 June.

After only forty minutes trading, the system failed as did the backup
system, and did not come up again that day. Only R56m worth of trade was
done, versus the average daily trade of R400m (R4.4 = US$1).

Brokers complained of three negative consequences of this:

- the loss of margins on trade (although that would be partially
offset by greater trades the next day)

- leaving many positions open for extended periods at a time of
great stock market volatility both nationally and internationally

- loss of foreign investment confidence in the JSE (**)

*Business Day* of 24 Jul 1996 quoted the president of the JSE as saying that
problems had been fixed and that there were no problems in trade on the
23rd. He described the error as an "an obscure network bug in the special
coding written for the decentralised SA network".(***)

Comment:

*  The first failure, on 1 July, was attributed to "human error".

** The article said that the system was supplied by the Chicago Stock
Exchange, and that it had been fixed by "technicians from the
Chicago Stock Exchange". I would have thought that this would
cause investors to worry more about the Chicago Stock Exchange.


*** I wonder what a non-obscure bug would be, if an
obscure one stops trading on a  large stock exchange
(13th by market capitalisation, I believe) for almost a full day.

Hopefully all of this will help our Dependable Computing group raise funds
from industry.

Devoted and casual RISKS readers will both want to dig up the 24 Jul 1996
edition of the *Wall Street Journal*, which has two very important stories
on the front page. The first is a followup to the digital cash heist where
about one half a billion dollars disappeared through counterfeit cards used
in Japanese Pachinko parlors. The story notes that the idea to use cards
could be traced to a CIA briefing that suggested that the North Korean
government was building nuclear weapons with money laundered through
pachinko parlors controlled by Koreans living in Japan.  The cards were
supposed to bring accountability and traceability. Instead billions of yen
disappeared. The article leaves the impression that the money ended up in
Korea, although no one can really be sure of anything except that it is gone
from the balance sheets of the corporations that developed the cards.

The second article describes how static electricity is beginning to be a
real problem. The opening image comes from a room where the votes on a new
tax levy were being tallied by computer. The first run of the computer
showed the new tax being rejected by the voters. OOOPS. A bit of anti-static
magic fluid was spread around the computer and the second run showed the new
tax passing much to the relief of the people in power. The article goes on
to say other interesting things about static, leaving RISKS readers hanging:
How do they *know*a which is the correct count?  I bet I can guess which
choice ended up being official.

An article in the Swedish newspaper, *Svenska Dagbladet* (23 Jul 1996,
<A HREF="http://www.svd.se/svd/ettan/X0006_Grnsvrden.html">http://www.svd.se/svd/ettan/X0006_Grnsvrden.html</A>) by Annika Carlsson notes
that Sweden will not establish limits for electrical and magnetic fields.
Instead, the government has agreed on a "policy of watchfulness"
(foersiktighetspolicy). The article notes that, when a choice is possible,
one should choose technical solutions that yield the lowest electrical and
magnetic fields.

Lars-Eric Paulson, researcher at SSI (The National Radiation Protection
Institute) stated: "We lack necessary research. When we started working two
years ago, we thought that research would yield limiting values, but this
couldn't be accomplished." Research did determine, however that, among the
approximately 70 Swedish children that get leukemia every year [out of a
population of about 9 million], one case is due to large electric power
transmission lines.  [Note: I'm unsure of the proper translation here. A
literal translation would use "depends on" where I wrote "is due to."  This
would seem to be a rather strong statement.]

Furthermore, about ten people per year get cancer because of "wandering
currents." I.e., electric currents that choose a path different than what is
intended, thus causing a doubled electric field: partially from the
wandering current and partially from the electric wiring.

The lack of a national policy has led to different approaches. For example,
Solna, a suburb of Stokholm, choose to run a major electric transmission
underground even though, as Lars-Eric Paulsson notes.  this wasn't
recommended on electric field suppression grounds.  However, Solna chose the
more expensive alternative because of social and psychological concern for
the residents in the transmission line's path.

According to SSI, no other country has set limits for electric and
magnetic fields. The value of 0.2 micro-Tesla has been used at times,
but there is no evidence that more intense fields are dangerous.

[Please excuse my clumsy translation.]

I don't know if this is true, but it sounds plausible.

&gt;&gt;"For several months, our nurses have been baffled to find a dead patient in
&gt;&gt;the same bed every Friday morning" a spokeswoman for the Pelonomi Hospital
&gt;&gt;(Free State, South Africa) told reporters. "There was no apparent cause for
&gt;&gt;any of the deaths, and extensive checks on the air conditioning system, and
&gt;&gt;a search for possible bacterial infection, failed to reveal any clues."
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;"However, further inquiries have now revealed the cause of these deaths.  It
&gt;&gt;seems that every Friday morning a cleaner would enter the ward, remove the
&gt;&gt;plug that powered the patient's life support system, plug her floor polisher
&gt;&gt;into the vacant socket, then go about her business. When she had finished
&gt;&gt;her chores, she would plug the life support machine back in and leave,
&gt;&gt;unaware that the patient was now dead. She could not, after all, hear the
&gt;&gt;screams and eventual death rattle over the whirring of her polisher.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;"We are sorry, and have sent a strong letter to the cleaner in question.
&gt;&gt;Further, the Free State Health and Welfare Department is arranging for an
&gt;&gt;electrician to fit an extra socket, so there should be no repetition of this
&gt;&gt;incident. The enquiry is now closed."

A security employee at the Hospital of St. Raphael in New Haven apparently
disclosed a security access code (password?) for telephone access to DMV
records, supposedly to be used only to check records following accidents or
car breakins on the hospital campus, but of course providing access to all
DMV records.  The access code should not have been disclosed, and the
employee's code and all other hospital codes have been cancelled, pending
review.  [Source: *Hartford Courant*, 25 July 1996, PGN Abstracting]

The following article was included in "The Globe and Mail", a Toronto,
Canada newspaper on Monday, July 22 (p.1, Section C):

&gt;From Neil A. Campbell of the Globe's Olympic staff: "In an effort to be on
the cutting edge of the Games, one of my $20 bills was exchanged last week
for a $20 VISA cash card.  The Olympics are being used to hype this new
product, which is basically an Interac card without the PIN number.  Just
about everybody in Atlanta is supposed to be accepting VISA cash cards but
the $20 card is unblemished because the only merchant who knew anything
about it had a machine that wasn't working.  Colleague Jan Wong was able to
buy two coffees with her $5 card.  But VISA cash can't be combined with real
cash, so she is currently wandering Atlanta searching for something that
costs $1.44, including tax, so she can kiss off VISA cash forever."

Among all problems that are embarrassing the ACOG, some are really funny, as
the *Toronto Globe and Mail* reports today:

Results were flowing faster yesterday, but the Info '96 database,
which is supposed to provide biographical information to journalists
and others, was still shaky. Biographies of many famous athletes,
including U.S. long jumper Carl Lewis, were unavailable, and
information on others was so poor as to call the whole system into
question. Lisa Neuberger, a sailor who carried the flag for the
Virgin Islands at the opening ceremonies, is listed as being 95
years old. Sule Olaleye of Nigeria is the 125th-ranked table-tennis
player in the world. It is no wonder he is so unaccomplished--the
computer insists he is only 17 centimetres tall.

The risks of depending on computers is that they tend to make you older,
shorter and probably fat and bald, too.

While I'm not an expert in encryption, I have been following the
on-going discussions on increasing standards.  It seems to me that there's a
broader risk that we're ignoring.  It really hit home the other night...
A friend and I were having dinner, and since he knows that I work with
computers for a living, he asked what I thought about taking customer orders
through his web site.  He had heard something about credit cards not being
secure and wanted to know what I thought.  I made the mistake of asking him
how he put handles computer security in general.
He says that he uses the internet to send new product designs and costs
to and from his manufacturers.  If he feels they are *really sensitive* he
uses a disk compression program with password protection.  Then, for large
files, he has his *computer person* copy the files to a directory on his web
site - and he e-mails the location and password to the intended recipient.
He *makes sure there's no link pointing to the file, so nobody can find it*
and then deletes it after the recipient has acknowledged receipt.
The risk here is obvious - the discussion of 100+ bit encryption is
lost on this guy - he uses little or no encryption for data protection.
Although maybe we can find a lesson here, that anonymity is still the best
policy.

Today (24 Jul 1996) here in Berlin, the local newspaper *Der Tagesspiegel*
published some facts from the final inquiry report about the Ariane-5
disaster on 4 Jun. This report was officially released on Tuesday, 23 Jul.

In accordance to the report the Ariane-5 crash was caused by a faulty
software.  37 secs after lift-off no information about present position and
course was available.  The data was to be delivered by a redundant set of
Inertial Reference Systems (IRS). But two of these platforms (subsystems)
failed. This failure was not(!) considered by the test software which ran
before the lift-off.

The official inquiry commission found out that the IRS was designed for the
preceding model, Ariane-4. That's why on 4 June 1996 a function was called
that was supposed to align the missing Inertial platforms.  But: This
function was not necessary for Ariane-5!  However, this alignment function
overloaded the computer, and as a result, the necessary data was not
delivered.

"This [design, JPM] fault could have been discovered", Mr. Wolfgang Kubbat
(Darmstadt U of Technology) as a member of the inquiry commission was cited.
The vice chairman of the commission, Mr. Lennart Luebeck, emphasized the
demand for better and more realistic tests.

The president of the European Space Agency (ESA), Mr. Luton, said that
there won't be a discussion on the system architecture [of Ariane-5,
JPM]. He estimates a total cost rise for the program of about 2 to 4
percent (current state: 37 billion FF/ 11 billion DEM).

The next launch of a Ariane-5 is considered for spring 1997.

&gt; The extensive reviews and tests carried out during the Ariane
&gt; 5 development programme did not include adequate analysis and
&gt; testing of the inertial reference system or of the complete flight
&gt; control system, which could have detected the potential failure.

&gt; Despite the series of tests and reviews carried out under the
&gt; programme, in the course of which thousands of corrections were
&gt; made, shortcomings in the system approach concerning the
&gt; software resulted in failure to detect the fault.  It is stressed that
&gt; alignment function of the inertial reference system, which served
&gt; a purpose only before lift-off (but remained operative afterwards),
&gt; was not taken into account in the simulations and that the
&gt; equipment and system tests were not sufficiently representative.

Tracy Pettit wrote an interesting piece in <A HREF="/Risks/18.27.html">RISKS-18.27</A> on the US power grid
and it vulnerabilities. I want to take issue with one point however, namely
that setting electricity rates in a market will lower reliability.  [...]

I think a market based approach might let us discover a better balance
between cost and reliability. The bond market is a good analogy, the cost of
US treasuries for a given rate is higher than corporate bonds since people
are willing to pay more for the reliability of government bonds (please, no
laughing). Similarly, many consumers of electricity (municipal distributors)
will probably be willing to pay a bit more for power from a utility that has
a good reliability record. Others might go after the cheapest power
possible, even with outages, to perform tasks that are not time critical
like pumping water into a reservoir or charging electric cars.  You might
get an increase in reliability if redundant networks of different grades of
power start to appear. The overall impact on reliability is difficult to
say, but it might actually improve.

The Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities is currently undergoing a
comment period regarding their proposed rulemaking on unbundling electric
producers from transmission companies.  If you act quickly you can get your
comments submitted in a timely fashion.

The brochure they had inserted in my electric bill says "The CPU will work
to ensure that the new system will be as safe and reliable as the current
structure." Where I live (fairly rural town), I estimate that the electric
service is about 99% reliable; i.e., about 8 hours downtime/year.  Not so
good.  While most outages are fairly short (~1 hour), each year we seem to
get a major outage (~6 hours).  Thus, I own a rather large generator, and I
do use it.  It is my understanding that most of our outages are
transmission-related and are due to weather or motor vehicle accidents.

The proposed rules are online at "<A HREF="http://www.magnet.state.ma.us/dpu/">http://www.magnet.state.ma.us/dpu/</A>".

The public comment period ends on August 2, 1996.  The E-mail address

&gt;The main emphasis is on the unintended side effects of human introduction
&gt;of items alien to the culture or environment

Keep this in perspective.  The complexity of everyday life in developed
countries is much simpler than the complexity of everyday life for Man in
the wild.  Without our technology, we would spend a lot of time fending off
our natural environment (including germs, lice, and predators) and feeding
ourselves (hope for global temps to rise to normal so there's more food and
more large animals to hunt).

RISKS of books about RISKS?

In <A HREF="/Risks/18.27.html">RISKS-18.27</A>, Don Norman recommends Edward Tenner's "Why Things Bite Back"
as a fine book on the unintended consequences of technology.  While I am
inclined to agree that it makes a diverting light read, I would not commend
it for serious perusal.

As Caitlin Burke's review of this book (which may be found at
<A HREF="http://www.thenetnet.com/">http://www.thenetnet.com/</A>) makes clear, Tenner is somewhat confused by his
subject matter, and is prone to undermining his own points through the
lightweight treatment he devotes to them.  [Caitlin Burke &lt;<A HREF="mailto:caitlinb@best.com">caitlinb@best.com</A>&gt;]

The most notable instance of this she cites is Tenner's coverage of
Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).  Tenner suggests that the improved
ability of the military to treat wounded soldiers and return them to service
was a major factor the high incidence of PTSD, making no mention of much
more important issues such as the nature of the training soldiers received,
their youth, or disapproval of the war "back home".

While Tenner's proclivity towards undermining the ironies he seeks to expose
through the introduction of unintended ironies of his own is unfortunate,
his book is an enjoyable, and largely (even studiously) uncontroversial,
romp.  One final caution is, however, in order: "Why Things Bite Back"
focuses much more on biological issues than on those relating to computers,
and as such may not provide substantial grist for the mills of RISKS
readers.

Echoing a decision made last month by federal judges in Philadelphia, a
three-person panel of federal judges in Manhattan rule the Communications
Decency Act (part of the Telecommunications Act of 1996) to be
unconstitutional.  The Act makes it a felony to transmit "indecent" or
"patently offensive" material over computer networks where children might
have access to it.  The law suit involved an Internet-based newsletter
opposed to legislation banning indecent but constitutionally protected
speech on the Internet.  The newsletter's author says it was "laced with
four-letter and multisyllabic obscenities familiar to anyone and, frankly,
the day I published that article, I had some very real fears of going to
prison.  But I felt so deeply that our rights were violated by the law, I
had an obligation to fight it."  The Justice Department is appealing the
Philadelphia decision to the U.S. Supreme Court.  (*The New York Times*, 30

RISKS has since its inception 11 years ago (1 Aug 1985) noted the importance
of up-front efforts in avoiding risks.  Having sound requirements and a
sound design tends to save great agonies further down the line.  A new book
provides a fascinating collection of chapters that present various different
approaches to software design:

Bringing Design to Software
Terry Winograd (editor)
Addison-Wesley (Reading, Massachusetts)
and ACM Press Books (New York)
1996

Although the topics are intentionally quite diverse, there seems to be
something useful for everybody.  Chapter contributors include Mitch Kapor,
David Liddle, Gillian Crampton Smith and Philip Tabor, John Rheinfrank and
Shelley Evenson, Paul Saffo, Peter Denning and Pamela Dargan, John Seely
Brown and Paul Duguid, David Kelley and Bradley Hartfield, Donald Schon and

Where Wizards Stay Up Late: The Origins of the Internet
Katie Hafner and Matthew Lyon
Simon and Schuster, New York, NY
1996
ISBN 0-684-81201-0

At first glance, this new book might not seem sufficiently risks related for
me to comment on it here.  However, one of the biggest risks involving many
people in computer-related fields seems to be a lack of a sense of history
-- except for a few old-timers such as me (but we forget!) and a few younger
folks who have assiduously tried to study the past (except that it is
usually not well documented).  The RISKS archives strongly suggest that the
same kinds of problems keep recurring, and that knowledge of the past can
help significantly to avoid those risks in the future.

This book will make fascinating reading for those of you who don't know the
early history of the ARPAnet.  It points out how only a very few people and
almost no corporations foresaw the incredible potential of the emerging
networking technology.  The book details how the network evolved
nevertheless -- primarily because of the tremendous energies and visions of
a few farsighted people.

Let me add an editorial note.  With its emphasis on advances in connectivity
(for example, packet switching, high availability, alternative routing, and
scalability), there was quite consciously very little emphasis on network
security in the early ARPAnet days -- and not enough emphasis on host-system
security.  You might think that is coming back to haunt us now, with all the
security flakiness relating to the Internet.  However, confidentiality can
be enforced by the use of end-to-end cryptography, and authentication is a
natural burden of the hosts anyway, so the burden falls more strongly on the
operating systems.  Nevertheless, prevention of denials of service is still
in part a networking problem -- although we certainly don't need attacks in
order to have performance degradations!  Recently, while in Massachusetts, I
had repeated serious problems with network reliability telnetting back to
California.  On one occasion, I discovered that two of the major
transcontinental nodes on which I had to depend were *each* dropping about
40% of their packets, over a prolonged period of time.  Perhaps the real
problem is that the wizards are no longer staying up late enough, or that
the new quasiwizards are not familiar enough with history and the sense of
accomplishment that prevailed in the ARPAnet days.  Mayhaps this book will
help.

To fight terrorism, the Clinton administration is proposing a number of
measures which civil libertarians say pose a serious threat to the freedoms
of innocent users of phones and computers.  A spokesman for the American
Civil Liberties Union says: 'The president is using the bombing in Atlanta
as a pretense to getting more wiretap authority.  The answer to terrorism
isn't to limit the freedoms of Americans. If we do that, the terrorists have
already won.''  (*San Jose Mercury News*, 30 Jul 96; Edupage 30 July 1996)

Before the bomb exploded at Centennial Olympic Park in Atlanta, there was a
call to the 911 emergency number warning of it.  But there was a 10 minute
lag between when the call was received and when a police officer was
dispatched.  Why?  According to the Associated Press, the dispatchers needed
a street address for the park because the computer system they're using
requires one in order to transmit the information.

replied that "there is no way to duplicate the totality of the Olympic

IBM stated that typically they need 30-60 (or 60-90, I forget which) days to
set up the type of networking systems used in Atlanta that journalists are
complaining about.  In many cases they had 2-3 days because of delays in the
committee deciding on venues.  I don't know who took the most foolish risk,
the games committee for giving so little time for such a complicated system,

Yet another example of our impending millenium change causing trouble.
This time ordinary people, rather than companies, are directly affected.

&gt;From the *Electronic Telegraph* of 30 Jul 1996:

&gt; PLANS to split the pensions of divorcing couples have been delayed
&gt; until the next century because of problems with the Department of Social
&gt; Security computer, the Government admitted yesterday. ...
&gt; Although the Government sees the need for a change in the law to give
&gt; partners equal rights to pensions, he said the new legislation would not
&gt; be implemented until after 2000 because a big shake-up of the database
&gt; of National Insurance numbers was now underway."

The RISK is: How many more government databases worldwide will be affected
by Y2K? And if more are, do they realise it and are they actively working on
fixing the problem?  They may not always be able to legislate around this
issue.

I heard an advertisement on the radio the other day which highlights one of
the difficulties we face in designing reliable, safe systems.  The announcer
touted a new feature on BMW automobiles which detects whether a passenger is
present.  This information is used to suppress deployment of the
passenger-side airbag in accidents when appropriate.  The reason for the
feature, and the point made by the ad, is that replacing an airbag costs
about $2500 (actually, they quoted the price for a competitor, not their own
car).  So why inflate the bag if there's nobody to be saved?

RISKS readers are probably shuddering at this concept.  A well-designed
failsafe system would err on the side of unnecessary deployment, not saving
a few dollars.  One would hope that the passenger sensor is designed to fail
into the "passenger present" mode, but it is difficult to imagine a
technology which could be guaranteed to do so in all cases.  The fundamental
problem is that the detection subsystem is designed to suppress a
safety-related behavior in the main system, rather than to redundantly
encourage it, all to save money.  This makes the entire system dependent on
the correct operation of the subsystem.

I cannot help suspecting that a few years from now, when the passenger
sensors and wiring begin to wear out, BMW will suffer some lawsuits
because passenger airbags should have deployed, but didn't.

I just went through an amusing process of trying to pay my son's college
tuition by credit card.  The university provided the authorization form by
which to do it, and it has worked in previous semesters.

However, I got a phone call from the university cashier, saying the charge
was declined by the bank.

I called the bank, and was told that the charge was declined because it was
over $5000.  As a security precaution, they expect the cashier to phone in
for a verbal authorization.  They marked my account with my verbal OK, and
said the cashier could phone them directly for a verbal authorization.

I called the cashier back.  She said she can't do anything unless her
computer calls her bank, her bank calls my bank, and my bank okays the
transaction.  I asked her if I could give her my bank's phone number so she
could call and find out what's going on.  She said sure.

She called back later and left a message saying the charge had been declined
again.  I called my bank to see if she had called them, and they said no, it
would have been noted on my account records.  They explained that the
cashier probably had no procedure for handling a verbal authorization; that
many places can no longer do it "the old-fashioned way".  But they would
call her themselves and try to make it happen.

They called the cashier, who had left for the day, but left a message with
another cashier giving the authorization code.

The next day the cashier called me again to tell me that the charge was
still being declined.  I asked if she had called my bank.  She said she had
given my bank's number to her bank, and they had promised to call.  They had
called her back to say that the charge had been declined.

I said, okay, let's split it into two transactions.  Please put the first
one through for $4999.  Okay, she said, that went through.  I said, okay,
now put through a second transaction for the balance.  Okay, she said, that
went through, too.

So much for security.

Every year we add to the "intelligence" of our electrical appliances,
notably computers but also more mundane items such as microwave ovens, air
conditioners, microwave (yup!)  clothes dryers, etc.  Requirements such as
power-factor correction accelerate this trend.  As a result, the electrical
distribution load net is slowly shifting from a constant-impedance line
(electric light) to a constant-power line (computer power supplies).

The RISK?  Constant-power loads exhibit negative resistance: as the voltage
drops, the current *increases*.  As a result, the old-fashioned 'brownout'
is a thing of the past.  The electrical distribution network is becoming
more and more unstable.  Currently it's only unstable at the low-voltage end
of the supply curve, but eventually the instability will reach normal
operating levels.

I got a taste of this in an industrial-automation system a while ago.  If
you think the Year 2000 problem is going to be fun, just *imagine* trying to
manage the power-distribution network in a few years.

I wonder where Mark lives to develop the model he is using. Living in the
west where we can see several problems with his model from the front door.

1. To use an economic model to describe a physical entity is at best unwise
and mostly worthless. The only legitimate comparison is that Government
agencies are involved in both and neither is well respected( which has
nothing to do with reliability).

2. He speaks of Redundant Networks of different grades of service. Two
issues:
A. In a world where it takes multiple organisations to build one grid,
Where do we find the organizations to build these additional grids?
B. In the WEST, where do we find the redundant paths for these grids
without destroying the environment that  many of us came west for?

3. In your competitive model, who fixes the following situation which is
necessary and too, too common. A young lady goes to visit a friend living in
a hillside home. After the visit, she loses control of her van and crashes
the power pole that supplies power to my house (among many others). Power to
our neighborhood is out for 17 hours. The pole must be replaced, crews work
all night, and service is finally restored. Who's going to do the job in
your model? This is real life, last Friday to be exact.

Mike Crawford submitted in <A HREF="/Risks/18.28.html">RISKS-18.28</A> an apparently doubly-forwarded item
about a cleaner in a South African hospital unplugging a life-support system
every Friday to plug in her floor polisher. I found the news item on the Web
site of the Cape Times. It was changed considerably by the time of its
appearance in RISKS: somewhere along the line, implausible bits about the
"screams and death rattle" of the victims and about a hospital spokesperson
"sending a strong letter to the cleaner" was added. The original said only
that a hospital spokesperson denied knowledge of the incident, and that only
one of the deaths (all of which happened two years ago) was under
investigation by the Free State Health and Welfare Department.

The item was also at an odd location in the Independent Online Webspace:

It has the ring of urban legend to me.  If a hospital was losing people
every Friday, don't you think they would fairly quickly set up a watch on
that bed?  Also, if the deaths had really happened and the mistake admitted
as readily as quoted, one suspects that there would be lots of news stories
about the subsequent lawsuits.

[...]

The launcher started to disintegrate at about H0 + 39 seconds because of
high aerodynamic loads due to an angle of attack of more than 20 degrees
that led to separation of the boosters from the main stage, in turn
triggering the self-destruct system of the launcher.

This angle of attack was caused by full nozzle deflections of the solid
boosters and the Vulcain main engine.

These nozzle deflections were commanded by the On-Board Computer (OBC)
software on the basis of data transmitted by the active Inertial
Reference System (SRI 2). Part of these data at that time did not
contain proper flight data, but
showed a diagnostic bit pattern of the computer of the SRI 2, which was
interpreted as flight data.

The reason why the active SRI 2 did not send correct attitude data was
that the unit had declared a failure due to a software exception.

The OBC could not switch to the back-up SRI 1 because that unit had
already ceased to function during the previous data cycle (72
milliseconds period) for the same reason as SRI 2.

The internal SRI software exception was caused during execution of a
data conversion from 64-bit floating point to 16-bit signed integer
value. The floating point number which was converted had a value greater
than what could be
represented by a 16-bit signed integer. This resulted in an Operand
Error. The data conversion instructions (in Ada code) were not protected
from causing an Operand Error, although other conversions of comparable
variables in the same place in the code were protected.  [...]

The inquiry board investigating the loss of the first Ariane 5 launcher has
presented its conclusions. I have not seen the actual report of the board,
but I have access to an official summary. Even the summary is a rather
lengthy document, so I have extracted the parts which directly concern the
sequence of events, and the causes of the failure. The extracts are
verbatim, except for my possible typos.

- During the launch preparations and the count-down no events occurred which
were related to the failure. The meteorological conditions were acceptable,
and no other external factors have been found to be of relevance.

- At 36.7 seconds after H0 (approx. 30 seconds after lift-off) the computer
within the back-up inertial reference system, which was working on stand-by
for guidance and attitude control, became inoperative. This was caused by an
internal variable related to the horizontal velocity of the launcher
exceeding a limit which existed in the software of this computer.

- Approx. 0.05 seconds later the active inertial reference system, identical
to the back-up system in hardware and software, failed for the same reason.
Since the back-up inertial system was already inoperative, correct guidance
and attitude information could no longer be obtained and loss of the mission
was inevitable.

- As a result of its failure, the active inertial reference system
transmitted essentially diagnostic information to the launcher's main
computer, where it was interpreted as flight data and used for flight
control calculations.

- On the basis of those calculations, the main computer commanded the
booster nozzles, and somewhat later the main engine nozzles also, to make a
large correction for an attitude deviation that had not occurred.

- A rapid change of attitude occurred which caused the launcher to
disintegrate at 39 seconds after H0 due to aerodynamic forces.

- Destruction was automatically initiated upon disintegration, as designed,
at an altitude of 4 km and a distance of 1 km from the launch pad.

- The inertial system of Ariane 5 is essentially common to a system which is
presently flying on Ariane 4. The part of the software which caused the
interruption in the inertial system computers is used before launch to align
the inertial reference system and, in Ariane 4, also to enable a rapid
realignment of the system in case of a late hold in the countdown. The
realignment function, which does not serve any purpose on Ariane 5, was
nevertheless retained for commonality reasons and allowed, as in Ariane 4,
to operate for approx. 40 seconds after lift-off.

- During design of the software of the inertial reference system used for
Ariane 4 and Ariane 5, a decision was taken that it was not necessary to
protect the inertial system computer from being made inoperative by an
excessive value of the variable related to the horizontal velocity, a
protection which was provided for several other variables of the alignment
software. When taking this design decision, it was not analyzed or fully
understood which values this particular variable might assume when the
alignment software was allowed to operate after lift-off.

- In Ariane 4 flights using the same type of inertial reference system there
has been no such failure because the trajectory during the first 40 seconds
of flight is such that the particular variable related to horizontal
velocity cannot reach, with an adequate operational margin, a value beyond
the limit present in the software.

- Ariane 5 has a high initial acceleration and a trajectory which leads to a
build-up of horizontal velocity which is five times more rapid than for
Ariane 4. The higher horizontal velocity of Ariane 5 generated, within the
40-second timeframe, the excessive value which caused the inertial system to
cease operation.

- The specification of the inertial reference system and the tests performed
at equipment level did not specifically include the Ariane 5 trajectory
data. Consequently the realignment function was not tested under simulated
Ariane 5 flight conditions, and the design error was not discovered.

- Post-flight simulations have been carried out on a computer with software
of the inertial reference system and with a simulated environment, including
the actual trajectory data from the Ariane 501 flight. These simulations
have faithfully reproduced the chain of events leading to the failure of the
inertial reference systems.

America Online's computer systems (near the Dulles Airport facility in
Virginia) went down at 4am EDT on 7 Aug 1996.  Service was reportedly
restored sporadically 19 hours later, around 11pm EDT.  The crash was caused
by new software installed during a scheduled maintenance update.  The 16
million people affected will apparently be given a free day of service
(hopefully in addition to yesterday!).  (AOL noted that this problem was
different from their one-hour outage on 19 June 1996.)

* ``It's another reminder of how close to the edge a lot of these
systems are,'' said Richard Zwetchkenbaum (International Data Corp)...
[No news to RISKS readers]

According to David Einstein (*San Francisco Chronicle*, 8 Aug 1996, p.A1),
AOL officials have bragged about the reliability of their system.  In fact,
earlier this week one representative told The Chronicle that AOL computers
are ``virtually immune'' to this kind of outage.  [Virtual immunity is no
virtue?]

The repercussions of this were felt a long way away from AOL.

One of my clients is a public organization which sends out tens of
thousands of messages a day advising people on the current status of
pending legislation.  People are encouraged to subscribe to this free
service to follow their favorite bills.

Yesterday morning, I got a call because their mail system was backing
up heavily.  It took a while to discover the cause, but it turned
out to be AOL.  Because AOL's incoming mail from the Internet runs on
relatively slow systems, and because they receive hundreds of thousands of
Internet messages a day, they have 30 systems to receive incoming mail, all
pointed at from the AOL.COM name.  That means that any mail system trying
to send mail to AOL would have to individually try all 30 addresses before
giving up.  Translate that to a 60 second (typical) wait for a connection
timeout, and you've got a 30 minute time-in-queue for an AOL message.

Well, this client was using multi-threaded mailers, but because of AOL's
massive presence on the Internet &amp; the large number of messages addressed
to them, AOL messages ended up clogging up all of the outgoing queue spots.
Hundreds of them.

The solution, unfortunately, is to treat AOL mail separately from other
Internet mail.  It now gets its own queue and is specifically segregated
away from other mail so that this doesn't impact other users.  The downside
of this is that ALL AOL mail is now operated (implicitly) at a lower
priority than other Internet mail, which means that AOL users have
effectively become second-class citizens.

The risk?  While growing so large (and having all your eggs in one basket)
offers tremendous economies of scale, it has other exogenous effects.  We
are already familiar with the implicit social reaction that AOL's marketing
strategy has brought on all their users from some corners of the Internet:
"oh you're from AOL, you must be clueless," a sort of techno-racism aimed at
the profile of the typical AOL user.  Now, AOL's size may cause their users
other discrimination of a more technical nature.

A recent posting in misc.transport.urban-transit cites a 3 Aug 1996 article
in *Newsday*, the major newspaper of Long Island, NY.

The Long Island Rail Road, a commuter railway connecting New York to the
Long Island suburbs, recently tested three level crossings after a train
passed one of them and its driver noticed that the gates did not operate.
The three crossings, all in a place called Sayville, each "use the same
microprocessor" and are the only ones on the LIRR to do so.  The failure
proved to be reproducible at two out of the three.

This would make me wonder about the third one, not to mention level
crossings on other railways where the same hardware may be in use.
(For instance, if the problem is a bug in the programming, it might well
be one that comes and goes quasi-randomly.  Of course, it might also be
a failure any of several other sorts.)  As a short-term measure, the
LIRR stationed their police at each of the three crossings.

The LIRR also suffered similar problems last year, but says that the two
cases are "apparently unconnected".

I don't know why the crossing gate needs a microprocessor.  One possible
reason would be if trains regularly travel on that part of the line at
widely differing speeds; then the crossing gates could be lowered at the
same time interval in front of a faster or a slower train.

by Nils-Olov Ollevik.

An incorrect comma [Sweden uses commas to separate integer and fraction,
where the USA uses a period] can cause problems, especially when dealing
with billing and accounting. The other day, a businessman was about to
send an invoice to one of its customers and, at the last minute, discovered
that the computer wrote an invoice for 1.5 million kroner instead of the
150,000 that he intended.

The analysis determined that the CD version of the Swedish postnumber
(zipcode) catalog contains a programming error -- a bug -- that can modify
certain programs that are already loaded into the computer.  This affects
the popular administrative programs from from Scandinavian PC Systems, SPCS,
in Vaxjo [Sweden].

"As far as I know, only the SPCS-programs are affected, but this is
unacceptable no matter how large or small the problem is" according to
product manager Jan Hultgren from the Swedish Post Office, who is
responsible for the catalog.  ... The error is in the way the CD program
handles installation in the Windows operating system. It would be strange if
only our program was affected.

According to Jonas Svensson of SPCS, the post office program automatically
changes Windows installations, such as the placement of commas together with
digits. "The error is easy to fix as long as you are aware of it," said
Svensson.

.. The Post Office sold about 100,000 copies of the CD-catalog.

QUADNET, 2 AUG 1996
RAZOR THEORY LEFT IN SHREDS

A Deakin University academic has cast new light on a basic philosophical and
scientific problem that has been subject to debate for more than 2000 years.
And this has thrown doubt on the accuracy of many data analysis techniques
commonly used in business computing.

"Occam's razor, a principle dating back at least as far as Aristotle,
suggests that we should accept the simplest explanation consistent with all
the known facts.  This previously untested principle is widely used in
current scientific practice," said Dr Geoff Webb, of Deakin's School of
Computing and Mathematics in Australia.

Dr Webb has put this principle to the test, and found it wanting.

Occam's razor is a guiding principle in computers known as machine learning
systems, a form of artificial intelligence.  Tasks commonly employed in
machine learning cover such diverse areas as medical diagnosis and
identification of glass fragments collected at the scene of an accident.

Dr Webb's research has found that when put into practice Occam's razor
doesn't work. "The results are clear cut: Occam's razor is worse than blunt,
it is truly disposable," he said.

To test the theory, Dr Webb modified a widely used machine learning system
that uses Occam's razor combined with a principle based on the assumption of
similarity. The modified version of the system abandoned Occam's razor and
relied solely on the principle of similarity.  The theories developed by the
modified system were more accurate than the version that used Occam's razor.

Among the many users of machine learning systems are a new wave of computer
scientists calling themselves "data miners". These scientists use machine
learning systems based on Occam's razor to extract information from vast
quantities of data.

Data miners are employed by retailers to identify new customers; the
taxation office to identify tax fraud; by banks to help decide who should
receive loans; by stock brokers to select investments; and recently by
astronomers to identify 16 new quasars.

"Data mining seeks to extract information from data.  By using Occam's
razor, data miners are potentially missing much of the information in the
data. That translates directly into missed business opportunities," Dr Webb
warns.

"Occam's razor guides the user to look for simple explanations.  But what
good are simple explanations of a complex world?" he said.

The following is taken from the *Sunday Times* (London, 4 Aug 1996):
American Intelligence agents have hacked into the computers of the European
parliament and European commission as part of an international espionage
campaign aimed at stealing economic and political secrets. The commission
has called in security expert to block further American government agents
spying on its workings.

Security officials have disclosed that they have discovered several
instances in which its communications systems have been compromised by
American hacking. The have also found evidence that the Americans have used
information obtained by hacking to help in trade negotiations last year on
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).

The CIA has already been accused by the Japanese and the French governments
if hacking into their communications networks in an attempt to obtain
confidential trade secrets.

The European parliament computer network links together more that 5,000
computers, and it is used to private medical, financial and official
government documents.

Missed Payments (By Catherine O'Brien, Associated Press Writer)

&gt;&gt;   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rep. John Dingell says the rent on his
&gt;&gt;district office was not paid one month. Rep. Ron Klink's phone service
&gt;&gt;was nearly shut off because the bill was not paid by the House.
&gt;&gt;   They and other House Democrats said Tuesday they were embarrassed
&gt;&gt;that the government has missed some payments to businesses in their
&gt;&gt;districts. And in this election year, they insisted that when
&gt;&gt;Democrats were in charge the checks went out on time.

&lt;&lt; DMK: Partisan sniping from both sides deleted &gt;&gt;

&gt;&gt;   In June, the House's chief administrative officer, Scott
&gt;&gt;Faulkner, switched to a financial management system that
&gt;&gt;included new computer software. Klink said the change was made
&gt;&gt;despite a warning from Price Waterhouse that it would take two
&gt;&gt;years or more to get the House up and running on the new system.

o	House members are each checking with their offices to see that various
accounts have been paid or are outstanding.

One of my colleagues circulates Risks Digest here and I like to look through
it. I was interested to read about the ever increasing complexity of life
and the proliferation of remote controls, manuals, batteries, and the like.
The risk here is not that the world will become overly complex and then
fail, leaving us lost, blind, and bewildered. The risk, rather, is that we
people will become overly dependent on external things and lose sight that
what we require is inside us.

BUT what if the electricity and telephones go kablooie at the SAME time??
We can try any of the time honored activities of all human beings: we can
tell stories, we can sing, we can dance, we can think, we can meditate, we
can talk to the people who share our houses or apartments or dorms, we can
light candles, we can build fires, and we can read books.  With so many new
tools and technologies it is easy to think that without the latest or our
favorite we can't thrive or succeed or have fun or be ambitious. But that is
fallacy. The best use of technology is to blend it with our human powers.

In the State of Oregon, it is legal to purchase Department of Motor Vehicle
Records from the state (RISK 1).  These records have been purchased, placed
on a CD and made available through a newspaper advertisement.  Now, on a
local ISP, someone has made these records available publicly via a data
base search based on the license plate (RISK 2).  After looking at the data
with some friends, we have found that some of the information is, in fact,
wrong or out-of-date (RISK 3).

RISK 1: The state of Oregon should NOT be allowed to make available this
information.  Among the type of information that will be displayed:
vehicle type, make, model, year and style
vehicle Identification Number (VIN)
vehicle title number
Plate expiration date
Owner name, address and Driver's License number (For ALL owners)
Security interest holder and their address.

RISK 2: The ease of access may cause this information to be used in a illegal
manner.  By hanging out at the long-term parking lot of an airport,
one would be able to identify the name and address a traveler making
that traveler's home vulnerable to thieves.  This information could
easily be used by stalkers and those who wish to have their privacy
protected.  An unlisted phone number and address in the phone book
is easily circumvented when that information is easily accessible
with just a license plate number.

Risk 3: A friend sold a car five months ago, yet in this database, he is
still identified as the owner.  Should the new owner do something
on the road that provokes "road rage" in another driver, a quick
search of the data via license plate number will find that my
friend is the owner and the potential for him becoming a "road
rage" victim increases,  through no fault of his own.

It strikes me that there are multiple parts of the problem that need to be
fixed.  The DMV should, by law, not be able to sell this information.
However, the one issue that I believe the internet/web has not come to
terms with yet is the one that has always plagued a free society--the limits
of that freedom.  While it may be legal to make this information available
in this manner, the moral and ethical implications of doing so need to be
carefully considered.

I thought I'd pass along something that has recently happened at my company.
This summer, we had a new phone system installed, with fancy phone features
of various kinds, voice-mail for each phone, callback, conference calls,
etc.

One of the features is Calling-Number Identification.  When a call is
received, the incoming phone number is display on our phones.  If the call
is from a company extension, that person's name (or some group function
name) is also displayed.  (So, the usual Caller-ID good/bad points are
raised.)

For some time, our company has had an anonymous Ombudsman phone number for
reporting suspected company ethics violations or other business policy
misconduct.  But with the new phone system, the Ombudsman phone had CNID!
Not-so-anonymous reporting.

To its credit, the company has installed a new phone line.

"Since the installation of the new ... telephone system, concern has been
expressed that employees can no longer make an anonymous report of a
violation or suspected violation.  A new phone line has been installed that
cannot display phone numbers of incoming calls.  Those wishing to remain
anonymous may call ..."

I haven't checked yet whether it is possible on our system to block CNID on
selected phone calls.

.. and why the service was so bad across the country, why both dropped 40%?

&gt; Perhaps the real problem is that the wizards are no longer staying up late
&gt; enough, or that the new quasiwizards are not familiar enough with history
&gt; and the sense of accomplishment that prevailed in the ARPAnet days.  [PGN]

The reason is not lack of sense of history.  My first computer/computer
communication project was done in summer 1967 for Larry as he moved from LL
to ARPA.  I can relate to your concern about that "lack of sense of
history").

The reason is that now someone must pay for the packets to travel.  It was
nice in the old days when Larry and Bob willingly paid for all our packets.
Now they don't.  No wonder that the existing charging mechanism pushes the
demand beyond the supply.  Larry, Bob, Vint, and others (in ARPA, NSF, DoE,
and NASA) took it upon themselves to always provide excess supply (at least
they tried to).

Most users believe that they have a constitutional right for free network
services since most scholars would agree that packet communication falls
under "the pursuit of happiness".  The present charging scheme encourages
exponential growth of the demand, limited only by the frustration caused by
the insufficient supply.  If you were willing to pay the real cost of that
Telnetting, the packet would have gone through.  This is what many
corporations do.  Phone calls go through because we (or someone else) pay
for each.  We, who are used to practically free rides suffer.

If you really want to help solve the problem you better introduce the
subject of "RISKS of not paying for what you get".  Sigh.

It used to be so nice when they paid for us...  Danny

In the subject posting, D.C. Sessions states that "Constant-power loads
exhibit negative resistance".  While they present a non-linear load, there
is no reasonable way to describe them as negative resistance.  He further
confounds his thesis by using the electric light as an example of constant
impedance.  The incandescent lamp is a highly non-linear impedance and more
closely resembles a constant-power load than it does a constant impedance
load.

End of summer... time for the floors to be buffed before the students come
back.  So the custodians bring out their heavy duty floor buffers and plug
'em in.  Given the old, out-of-date wiring in this building they blow a
circuit.  Instead of resetting the breaker however they just try another
outlet and keep going.  The result: the network bridge on that circuit is
put out and half the net is cut off from the other half.

Of course we had trained the custodian NOT to do this in the past, but that
particular custodian is off on sick-leave, and their replacement had not
been so briefed.  Fortunately someone remembered the previous time this
happened and found the problem.  But what happens if they go away too?

AOL's Blackout Eclipses Jump In Fourth-Quarter Profit
By Thomas E. Weber and Jared Sandberg, Staff Reporters of
The Wall Street Journal (Dow Jones, 9 August 1996)

&gt;&gt;  It wasn't until late yesterday that AOL provided a detailed
&gt;&gt;explanation for the outage to supplement Chairman Stephen M.
&gt;&gt;Case's on-line apology, which AOL posted late Wednesday night.
&gt;&gt;The company cited a "coincidental" series of events it said are
&gt;&gt;unlikely to recur. The problem centered on routers,
&gt;&gt;computerized switches that serve as traffic cops for
&gt;&gt;information on AOL's complex network.

&gt;&gt;  Computers at an AOL unit fed these switches with an erroneous
&gt;&gt;"roadmap" of the Internet just as engineers were upgrading
&gt;&gt;them. When problems cropped up, the engineers mistakenly
&gt;&gt;thought their upgrade was to blame -- not the roadmap. That
&gt;&gt;misunderstanding delayed discovery of the source of the
&gt;&gt;problem. Compounding the confusion, diagnostic software that
&gt;&gt;could have helped track down the problem had been turned off
&gt;&gt;during the upgrade, AOL said.

o     AOL is compensating customers with one free day's worth of connect time.

[DMK: I pay US$9.95/mo for AOL and get 300 min--&gt;10min/day or US$0.33/day.
Give me a break!]

o	In a letter to subscribers, Mr. Case said:

&gt;&gt;I would like to be able to tell you that this sort of thing
&gt;&gt;will never happen again, but frankly, I can't make that
&gt;&gt;commitment, as we are building a new medium and breaking new ground.

and

&gt;&gt;This was a very unfortunate occurrence and I don't want to make
&gt;&gt;light of that.  But it did have an interesting side effect:  it
&gt;&gt;reminded all of us how important AOL is becoming in our
&gt;&gt;everyday lives.

and closes with

&gt;&gt;Today's outage reminds us that despite the recent progress
&gt;&gt;we've made in expanding our AOLnet network and enhancing the
&gt;&gt;responsiveness of our Member Services team, we still have a
&gt;&gt;long way to go to make AOL as reliable as must-have utilities
&gt;&gt;such as electricity and the telephone.  But that's what we
&gt;&gt;intend to do.

AOL issued a statement early Wednesday saying service would be restored
Wednesday afternoon. In fact, it didn't go up until 11 pm.

Subscribers trying to log on received the following series of messages.

"The system is temporarily unavailable. Please try again in 15 minutes."

"The system is temporarily unavailable. Please try again in 30 minutes."

"The system is temporarily unavailable. Please try again in an hour."

"The system is temporarily unavailable. Please try again in 90 minutes."

This kind of thing is going to get AOL a reputation for dishonesty.  The
Wall Street Journal wrote, "AOL put out a puzzling press release claiming
that [newly-hired Chief Operating Officer] Razzouk had chosen to resign
largely because he didn't like 'the prospect of relocating his family to the
Washington, D.C. area.' Never mind," the Journal added, "that Mr. Razzouk
had, in truth, just sold his Memphis home -- and that he had already closed
on the purchase of a new $1.7 million showplace in McLean, Va."

But technical misstatements will always come back to haunt you.  Earlier
this week an AOL rep told the *San Francisco Chronicle* that AOL's computers
were "immune" to the kind of outage that occurred yesterday.  And days after
AOL told a content provider they'd fixed a security hole, hackers used it to
take the stage during an on-line celebrity appearance, taunting the regular
guest...

The day after they came back on-line, their system was automatically
displaying the worst possible messages. The mandatory-viewing ad pitching
more time on the system began, "We know that many of you have been reluctant
to fully explore the diverse offerings..."  The "Top News Story" in their
Reuters headline area turned out to be "AOL Apologizes for Massive Outage."
And the sign-off ad: "This week: 'Gravity Kills' ".

"We can't definitively state the root of the problem," AOL's Vice President
told Reuters that night.  The ultimate irony: just last month AOL took out
help-wanted classified ads saying "At America Online, we not only dominate
the programs we design...."

Joel Snyder writes of the widespread effects of the AOL outage on mail
systems throughout the Internet.

While I agree that there are some interesting risks in putting so many
user's eggs in the "@aol.com" mail basket, the severe consequences of an AOL
outage on (other) mail systems can be looked at as different sort of
inappropriate scaling risk - the inability of the majority of mail systems
in the net today to handle the large queues and outages that are the reality
of today's Internet.

The vast majority of mail systems in the Internet rely in one way or another
on mail transfer software that was never designed to scale well - often the
much maligned but mostly essential "sendmail" program.  Among sendmail's
well know faults are its handling of the backlog queue as a single batch,
and its lack of ability to schedule retries for unreachable hosts on any but
the most simple-minded basis.  In the event of an outage creating a large
queue this can effectively deliveries for everyone as the system tries and
tries to deliver undeliverable messages.

Fortunately for me, for the week prior to the AOL outage I had been running
the outbound mail from one of my mail servers through a system running
qmail, a mail transport system designed as ground-up replacement for
sendmail. (See <A HREF="http://pobox.com/~djb/qmail.html">http://pobox.com/~djb/qmail.html</A> for more information).  The
two features of qmail that kept the mail flowing for me during the AOL
outage are (1) delivery attempts are scheduled independently for each
message in the queue, and (2) delivery attempts are scheduled following a
backoff algorithm that prevents the retries from consuming the mail system
as the backlog grows.  So for my site, the AOL outage was a non-event.  The
backlog for AOL grew and grew but mail for other sites continued to flow
expeditiously and load on the server was nearly constant.  When AOL became
available again, there were no major load spikes delivering the backlog
because the delivery retries were well spread out in time.  I had to do
nothing extra to keep things going - a new experience for me!

So I don't see the risk(s) as necessarily one-sided.  AOL has some
whale-sized scaling problems to overcome to be sure, but sites that depend
on simple-minded mail delivery software should consider their own exposure,
and investigate software designed with modern conditions in mind if they
want to keep delivering the mail.  -- Jeff Hayward

it remind me strongly of an episode of "Connections" by James Burke which I
believe was entitled "Technology Trap." In light of the famous power east
coast power outage in the late 60's, he examines carefully what might really
happen if such a disaster occurred.

On the matter of Oregon DMV records being made available on the net, news
reports have indicated (I have not checked this personally) that the private
party who put them online has removed them, apparently after a very negative
reaction.

However, this of course does not prevent others from doing so, and the
information already out there on those CD-ROMs can never be recalled (though
the accuracy will of course fade over time).

Of more importance in the long run is the incredibly bad policy of making
that data easily available at all.  Now that use of SSNs for DMV records has
been mandated nationally, easy access to DMV information poses even more of
a risk.

Down here in California, access to DMV records is now severely limited,
prodded mainly by a number of celebrity stalking cases where DMV records
were involved.  Oregonians might consider looking to California for
leadership on this topic.

There has recently been a great deal of outrage about someone putting the
Oregon license plate database on the Internet.  That's not the problem --
the real problem is that the data is available at all.  Many states make
such data available, and there have long been people with complete files of
such things.  The only thing different here is that it was more easily
available to the general public, with a fee.

In fact, more comprehensive services are already on the Web.  It took about
10 minutes with AltaVista to find several similar services, though in some
cases it wasn't clear if they actually did business over the Net, or simply
used it for advertising.

The Web has become a microcosm of our society.  If it's out there, it's on
the Web -- and if it suddenly shows up on the Web, it's probably because it
was already out there, but you didn't know it.

While it may be a valid point that the Internet/WWW has not come to terms
with the limits of the freedom, I don't believe that issue can be linked
with the issue of the DMV making records available.

Simply, the DMV _should not_ have made this information available.  Whether
or not "the Internet" should have taken this information and distributed it
in such a manner is besides the point.

It is virtually inevitable that all information not strictly kept under
wraps will make it onto the WWW.  Blaming the WWW (or the Internet) for this
is senseless.

ObRisk: This sort of thought process (blaming the accessibility of information
on the medium used to transport, not the provider) is what leads to things
like the CDA: censorship too late &amp; targetted on the wrong thing.

Let me disagree:

1) There are important reasons (law enforcement, traffic accidents)
for making this information rapidly available to police officers
down to very low (small community) levels.  Once you do this, the
information is so easily compromised (I can overhear this kind of
information on a police scanner any evening) that it's better that
it be just plain public, and let everyone know that it is.

2) If RISKS 2 and 3 above are the best that can be cited for not
making such information available, they seem to me pretty negligible.
When my car is at the airport, several other people and two large
dogs are likely still at home -- if this thief drives the 30 minutes
to my house, he'll pretty disappointed.  "Road rage", especially
in combination with CD-ROM ownership, I suspect is statistically
insignificant, if not mostly an urban legend.

3) There are certainly other legitimate reasons for making this data
available.  If some clever inventor comes up with an add-on that
will lower the pollution and raise the mileage (currently 12 mpg)
of my beloved classic '67 Mustang, for example, I'd love to have
him scan the DMV database and send me a sales message.  One can
think of many other health and safety as well commercial reasons
for being able to find the owner of a car rapidly.

selling of DMV data, the Cyberspace-Law list indirectly makes a
number of interesting points:

Consider 4 cases:

(1) Your local supermarket offers a "No-coupon discount card" for
customers who fill out an application. On the application, you list your
name, your sex, your income, your employment, and the company gives you a
card. Using the card, you then make purchases for the next year.  The
supermarket then compiles the data about your purchases, and sells it to
marketers. You have not been notified that they intend to use the
information like this; nor have you explicitly consented to this use.

(2) Your credit card company has the same information about you -- you
supplied it when you got your credit card. Imagine it now collects the data
about your purchases, and then sells it to marketers.

(3) Your local video store keeps data about the videos you rent. It
then sells to marketers your name and address, along with list of films that
you have rented.

(4) A credit card company enters into an agreement with the IRS, to
report to the IRS people whose spending habits change dramatically. The IRS
then uses that data to help it decide which returns will be subject to
audit.

All four cases raise the problem of *informational privacy* -- the question
how much control, if any, does the law give you over the collection, and
dissemination, of information about you that you have willingly given over
to someone else. The answer in general is quite simple: Not much. American
law in the main gives individuals very little control over what others can
do with the information collected about them.

This lack of protection distinguishes American law from most European
democracies.  "Data protection" is an important part of European human
rights law. But with slight exceptions, it is not an important part of our
tradition. The exception is case (3): Because of the outrage over the
publication of Judge Robert Bork's video rentals when he was nominated for a
seat on the Supreme Court, Congress passed the Video Privacy Protection Act
of 1988, which makes it a crime to release individualized data about the
videos any individual may rent or buy.

At least that part of your "record" is protected: but not what books
you check out at the library, or what your purchases at the grocery store
are, or what movies you use your credit card to buy tickets for. These
remain unregulated by the law.

***
Consider 4 more cases:

(1) On a local university network, users can read USENET news stories
-- stories posted on the USENET bulletin boards by users from across the
world. The stories range from discussions of technical material about
computer operating systems, to highly controversial political discussions,
or to discussions about sexuality.  Imagine now that network users can use a
simple command to list all other users logged onto the system at that time,
as well as what those users are doing. If the users are reading news stories
from the USENET new server, then the command will report to the users what
news stories they are reading.

(2) An activist group is angry about pornography on the net. It decides
to attack the problem in a somewhat unique way. It opens up an erotic web
site, and then as individuals access the web site, the group collects the
information about who accessed the site. On a separate web site the group
then publishes a list: "Known consumers of pornography" and then lists the
information it has about people who have accessed its site. Or imagine the
same case, with slightly different facts: Imagine the activist group is an
anti-gay activist group, and it puts up a web site on resources for gay and
lesbians, and then publishes the lists of who accesses the site. Or an
anti-abortion group, that publishes information about access to abortion
clinics.

(3) Some World Wide Web browsers collect a list of the web sites that
you have accessed.  This list is kept on your machine. When you access a web
site, the software makes it possible for the web site to read the list of
web sites that you have previously accessed.  Imagine that a web site has
implemented a procedure to read your list of web sites, and then decides
whether to admit you based on what other places you've been. (In a sense,
the system is discriminating in granting access, but what is important for
our purposes is that it is making that discrimination by accessing "your"
information about where you have been.) For example, if it determines that
you don't frequent sufficiently "posh" places, it bumps you; or if it
surmises from your list that you are a Republican, it bumps you.

(4) As we explained in case (1), USENET is a cooperative that
distributes messages in the form of discussion threads, on wide range of
topics, to millions of people across the world. People can participate in
these discussions, simply by replying to a particular message. This reply
then gets published across the world, with the email address of the person
replying to the message attached to the reply. Ordinarily, these messages
disappear after a few weeks on the net.  [Not RISKS and many others...  PGN]
But imagine a company starts collecting these messages, and begins
organizing them in a data bank. This company then makes it possible for
anyone, through the Web, to search the database of USENET messages, for a
particular word, or phrase, or for the name of a particular user.  This
search then collects all messages that have that word, or phrase, or name,
and displays the list of messages, along with their senders. The user of
this service can then click on the name of the senders, and get a profile of
all the messages that person has sent. For example the user can discover
that the sender of a particular messages has regularly contributed to a
discussion of leftist politics, or a pro-life discussion group, and then
access all of the messages this sender has sent to these groups.

All four of these cases raise no legal problem at all, given the present
state of United States law. Examples (1), (3) and (4) already exist.
(Netscape would support a function like example (3); for example (4), check
out <A HREF="http://www.dejanews.com">http://www.dejanews.com</A>); we don't know of an example of case (2), but
there is nothing in the law to stop it. Again, as we indicated in our last
message, the law does very little to protect individuals against the use of
data that they make available to others. Each of these 4 cases is just an
example of this same point.

It is not hard to understand why the law has been so unprotective. For
the most part, historically, it has been relatively difficult to get access
to data like this.  Perhaps one could hire a spy to follow an individual
around and collect information about his habits, or purchases -- no doubt
some people did. But for the most part, people didn't pay much attention,
since it was very costly to pay attention. The dramatic change in data
technology has changed this. Now it is quite easy to collect a vast amount
of data about individuals. More importantly, now it is quite profitable to
collect such data. Cyberspace will only make this more so. We are living in
a time when the law has not caught up with the technology.  While the
inefficiency of technology provided some sort of protection before, now
nothing -- neither law nor inefficiency -- protects us today.

Do we want protection? Not clear. There are interests that pull the
other way: Some have argued that there is a first amendment right to report
to others true facts they have found out about you. Others have argued that
this information would be a real gain to the efficiency of the market:
Imagine, for example, advertising that was perfectly targeted to those, and
only those, who would be likely to buy a particular product.

**** Back to Kevin Johnsrude: Clearly the OR DMV is not doing anything
illegal under the law.  Your phone company does the same thing: when you pay
your US$0.25/month not to get telephone solicitations, you are, among other
things, recompensing your phone for not *selling on a list* your name, phone
number and address to telemarketers.  Your VISA company also does the same
thing and gives marketers your complete personal and financial profile.

We in the US desperately need better data privacy protection or we will
effectively not have any privacy at all.

We have found two Java security bugs recently, one in Microsoft Internet
Explorer 3.0beta3 and one in Netscape Navigator 3.0beta5.  Both bugs were
serious, allowing a malicious applet to gain at least full read/write access
to the victim's files.  Both bugs are fixed in current releases of the
browsers.

The Netscape bug was caused by incorrect handling of type definitions in the
Java internals.  Java uses special predefined names for its array types;
these special names are bound to the correct array types on demand.  We
discovered that under certain circumstances an applet could define a class
that had one of these special names.  The system detected this and threw an
exception, but the malicious definition was mistakenly left in one of the
system's internal tables.  The result was that an applet could redefine one
of Java's array types.  This was sufficient to break Java's type system and
hence to circumvent Java's security mechanisms.

The Microsoft bug allowed an applet to become a member of a
security-critical Java package (module) whose membership was supposed to be
limited to Java classes that are built-in to the browser.  Code belonging to
one of these packages can set certain security-critical variables such as
the access control lists that say which files the applet is allowed to read
and write.  An applet could exploit this bug to obtain full file system and
network access, among other things.

that was available at midnight PDT at the end of Monday evening (i.e.,
3AM EDT Tuesday 13 Aug).  RISKS suggests that serious users of either
browser pick up the new versions, and that people who consider themselves
only casual users get more serious.  PGN]

Power losses on 10 Aug 1996 (Saturday) affected at least 4 million customers
in 8 U.S. states from Canada to Mexico (including parts of Texas).  San
Francisco Airport was reduced to a mass of waiting humanity in the absence
of power other than air-traffic-control emergency power that permitted just
a few planes to take off.  Many landings were diverted and many flights
cancelled.

Outages were spotty.  For example, Palo Alto was down for 5 hours, while
neighboring Menlo Park seems to have been (mostly?) unscathed.  (Perhaps
SRI's cogeneration plant helped out!)  Some places were still out the next
day.

The Pacific Intertie between Oregon and California was reportedly involved
again, but according to a late report (CBS late TV news) only as the 26th in
a series of thus-far-identified problems that began with three line outages
(hot weather expanding power lines), a problem at the Washington-Idaho
boundary, and another problem at the McNary substation.  The CBS report
suggested chaos theory as an explanation, with many small causes combining
in unexpected ways to cause something that allegedly is not supposed to
happen.  Unusually hot weather in Washington and Oregon and heavy use of air
conditioners everywhere in the West contributed significantly.  (I suppose
Saturdays require much less commercial AC, but much more home AC.)  An
earlier theory that this new problem had been caused by a fire under some
transmission lines seems to have fallen by the wayside -- the fire
apparently occurred after the outage had been triggered.  Of course, the
computer controlled systems did exactly what they were supposed to do --
shut down when threatened with overload conditions that might be damaging to
the system.

The early July 1996 outages had very similar but less long-lasting effects.
(The 2 July outages spanning 12 Western states were apparently triggered by
a single tree in Idaho, as noted in <A HREF="/Risks/18.27.html">RISKS-18.27</A>, but also occurred during a
hot spell.)  It appears this might become a commonplace occurrence.  Some
power officials said that this was a really freak (i.e., very unlikely)
occurrence, while others perhaps more candidly said there is very little
they can do to prevent further recurrences.

An emergency meeting of utilities folks is taking place this week, to
consider what might be done differently.  I suppose they might recommend we
all wear lighter clothing and offer frequent-flier miles for recycled
perspiration.  But serious suggestions might include cutting down more
trees?  Shutting down more salmon ladders?  Perhaps instituting more rolling
brownouts?  How about more preventive maintenance?  More oversight?  Closer
local monitoring and more integrated/distributed system-wide monitoring?  In
the 11 Aug case, diagnostics apparently indicated that a massive problem was
imminent something like half an hour beforehand, but those warnings were
evidently not given sufficient priority.

And then Monday afternoon, 13 August, there were new outages.  South San
Jose -- which was partly spared on 11 August, including a Neil Diamond
concert -- was hit this time with some long outages; the Hicks substation
apparently had a transformer explosion, affecting 27,000 customers.  Palo
Alto (which has its own utility company, but depends on PG&amp;E) had a
45-minute outage that affected all 29,000 customers; the outage was blamed
on PG&amp;E having messed up by sending an erroneous control signal to Palo
Alto.

Please pardon any inaccuracies here.  There still seem to be a lot of
unknowns, and the reporting is itself spotty.  I hope when all the smoke
clears, we get some definitive analyses for RISKS.  This is clearly a very
important topic for us to contemplate, because we are increasingly dependent
on our power infrastructure for our computing/communication/transportation/
... infrastructure, which increasingly depends on our power infrastructure,
etc.  Also, the long-term weather prospects (including global warming, if
you care to believe in it) and dramatically increased usage demands seem to
to suggest more problems in the future.

A London commuter train carrying about 400 passengers from Euston Station
crashed into an empty train heading into Euston Station, killing one
passenger and injuring about 100 near Watford Junction in Hertfordshire, 20
miles north of London, in the afternoon rush-hour on 8 Aug 1996.  [Source:
*San Francisco Chronicle*, 9 Aug 1996, A12]

No cause was given, but of course the signalling system is supposed to
prevent that from happening.  (The RISKS archives include a bunch of
incidents on trains in and around London.)

False alarms on the Boeing 777 are apparently being triggered by unusual
humidity and temperature conditions in cargo holds.  For example, a
London-bound Emirates aircraft was diverted to Cyprus, due to
heavy-breathing mangos, and a Cathay aircraft was evacuated and the
fire-suppression system activated -- due to a combination of fruit and
frogs.  Apparently, tropical fruit (and especially durian fruit) generates
enough humidity to be detected as smoke -- thereby triggering the alarms.
[Source: *Aviation Daily*, 12 Aug 1996]

[I wonder what this could do to a computer system,
such as a spilled-pitcher-of-durian Cray?  Also,
smoking mangos can be hazardous to your health?  PGN]

Police prepare stunning end for high-speed car chases
BY GILES WHITTELL AND NIGEL HAWKES, The Times, London, 10 Aug 1996

It could be the end of the car chase as we know it. With the
automotive equivalent of a stun gun, science fiction is coming to the aid of
law enforcement.  A high-powered electrical device under development at the
Pentagon's Army Research Laboratory in Adelphi, Maryland, is to be tested by
police and border patrol agents and could be in use by next year.

The car stopper works by focusing an intense electromagnetic charge
on the electronic systems that manage most modern engines, disabling them
and paralysing the car. In the jargon of its inventors, the 150 kilovolt
charge is a nemp, or non-nuclear electromagnetic pulse.  Contractors are
bidding to produce a police version.

Very precisely directed beams are required, but even then there will
be problems. A pulse powerful enough to disable an engine at any reasonable
range would also be likely to disrupt communications, damage television and
radio sets, disable computers and even stop heart pacemakers. There is also
the danger of loss of control when a car is being driven at high speed.

Counter-measures would include using old-fashioned engines with no
electronics, or perhaps surrounding the most delicate components with
shielding. The best might be to get hold of one of the stun guns and use it
to disable pursuing police vehicles.

&gt;Subject:  PLGR Violent Venting at Ft Irwin, CA
&gt;
&gt;The following point paper describe[s] the PLGR venting issue.  Please
&gt;disseminate this message to the necessary people with your services.
&gt;
&gt;Issue:
&gt;
&gt;On 30 July 96 a PLGR explode[d] during operation at Fort Irwin, CA.
&gt;Apparently there was a violent venting vice a slow vent. In other words the
&gt;PLGR case did not contain the blast.
&gt;
&gt;Discussion:
&gt;
&gt;The incident involved the Commanding General of the 4th Infantry Division,
&gt;Major General Kern,  and his driver. The driver was injured by the blast.
&gt;His left eye was bruised, he did however make a full recovery and was
&gt;released from the hospital.

[DMK: Incident is under investigation. Rockwell has been notified.  This is the
first reported incident of this kind.  Over 55,000 units have been in the field
in the military for some time now.]  ...

&gt;Recommendation:
&gt;
&gt;This is initial report.  Don't have enough information to make a firm
&gt;recommendation  at this time.  Will send updates as the situation unfolds.
&gt;
&gt;                         JPO's Interim Measure
&gt;
&gt;As an interim measure, until the investigation is completed the JPO has
&gt;recommended that all BA-5800 batteries be removed from equipment when
&gt;connected to vehicle power.  HOWEVER, the removal of the BA-5800 when being
&gt;powered by another power source has operational considerations.  It
&gt;typically will cause faster use of the memory battery (estimated 3 months or
&gt;less usage versus 1 year) causing the memory battery to fall below the
&gt;adequate power level.  This results in the loss of COMSEC key.  Which in
&gt;turn cause a lost of almanac  and user waypoint data.  USERS SHOULD  ASSESS
&gt;THEIR OPERATIONAL IMPACT AND RISK BEFORE REMOVING THE BA-5800.  Further
&gt;guidance will be provided pending the results of the incident investigation.

Among the ramifications of the recently completed Olympics may be an
under-noted economic risk, and implications for other sorts of international
competition.  Retailers in this country claimed (and I believe some
statistics corroborated this claim) that because consumers were engrossed in
the TV coverage of the games they were not out buying stuff at their usual
rate.  Retail sales were thereby depressed.  If this is the case some
speculation on the economic role of entertainment culture might be in order.

What would have happened, for example, if the Olympics were twice as long?
or if they were twice as interesting?  Would the change in buying patterns
have been doubly noticeable?  Would economists have classified the blip as
serious?  What if TV was routinely so enthralling?  Would the economy
suffer?  In short, what is the likelihood of a recession caused by an
entertainment event?  (If the risk is measurable a related risk would be to
allow the Net to become too entertaining without _first_ establishing a
reliable e-payment system, so that collectively hypnotized consumers could
still shop.)

Of course, the Olympics are a commercial event and as such are about
creating demand for consumer goods as much as anything else.  They need
advertising dollars to make them run and therefore might safely be assumed
to cause an economic lull and surge of proportional size.  But when is
demand-creation decoupled from actual consumption?  How long can consumers
be frozen in front of demand-creating spectacles without some of that effort
going to waste?  Other events aren't as predictable as the quadrennial
games.  Conventional wars, for example, don't depend on ad money and have
proven to be a pretty good draw.  Would a lengthy, televised one disrupt the
domestic economy?  Speaking of wars, what are the strategic implications of
this sort of event-driven economic upheaval?  If indeed the production of
information goods and consumption of other sorts of products _can_ become so
absurdly linked, would the DoD develop entertainment programming designed to
economically paralyze a region?  A swords-into-sitcoms approach involving
the military redeployment of Bob Hope, who could so amuse the golf-loving
citizens of another country that the resulting economic collapse might bring
down a regime?

While Radios Marti, Moscow, and Free Europe, to say nothing of the larger
phenomenon of American cultural imperialism have caused similar effects for
years, I'm more interested in the perhaps-less-overtly-hostile act of waging
economic inactivity.  The theory, however, is the same -- if the radio can
make us (or "them") want more democracy, or sneakers, it can also make us
want to stay home and listen to the radio.  Perhaps more importantly, I
wonder if new technologies (the Net, again) might provide a real-time way to
remotely instigate collective and real-life events.

All of this bread-and-circusing is to say two things, both of which have
been said before.  First, the creation of demand can be dicey; as
post-Pavlovian humans we're capable of -- and perhaps inclined to --
salivating at the sound of the bell itself rather than the prospect of food.
Second, information warfare probably means more than propaganda and printer
viruses, and can likely be tuned to selectively affect all sorts of
complicated and contingent networks, including an economy.

*Information Week* (22 Jul 1996, page 12) reports that K&amp;T Communications of
Fort Worth, Texas has registered the phrases "I don't know", "I don't care",
"Whoever", and "It doesn't matter" as names of long-distance carriers in
Texas.

The risk? When you make an operator-assisted long-distance call from Texas
and the operator asks which long distance carrier you would like to use, it
is in your best interest to have a preference. K&amp;T charges "approximately
twice" that of the largest carriers.

Opening up the long-distance markets may help spur the growth of an
information infrastructure, but whether or not it helps lower prices for
consumers is an open question.

Paul Peters is technically correct but also misses a valid point.  D. C.
Sessions should have said "negative incremental resistance" rather than
simply "negative resistance."  The former term means that for some range of
voltage, the current increases as the voltage decreases.  This means that
the power company cannot (necessarily) reduce the power consumption by
reducing the line voltage, which has been the usual way of handling
temporary power overloads without dropping service entirely; in fact,
decreasing the voltage may now increase the power consumption, since line
losses increase as you go toward lower voltage and higher current.  What is
perhaps worse is that a power supply, a negative incremental resistance
device, and a few passive components can make an excellent oscillator; look
up the circuit for a tunnel diode oscillator.  In other words, the power
distribution system becomes dynamically unstable, perhaps with rather large
voltage and current excursions as all the passive and active components
interact.  Not something that I want to hook my house up to.  By the way,
"negative resistance" is frequently (if incorrectly) used as a synonym for
"negative incremental resistance," and in fact this is the meaning that I
assumed was meant in the original post.

Many people do not realize that most corporate phone systems have SMDR
(station message detail recording) which logs each call from each telephone.
So, even if CNID is disabled, it is very likely that a log exists of each
phone call.  It is a simple matter to search for calls to specific numbers.

I'd argue that police access is different than public access.  The police
have access to other forms of information the general public does not
have easy access to.

I don't buy arguments 2 and 3.  If you personally want your information to
be public for the sake of getting unsolicited advertising, then I have no
problem with a system that allows you to give permission to do that.

The problem is where do you stop this?  Using your first and last arguments,
why not make all credit information public so that the police can easily
detect credit card fraud and you can get targeted advertising based on
your buying habits?  Perhaps all educational and employment records should
be made public so we can check resumes for accuracy.  No thanks.  If people
want to make such information on themselves available, that's fine with me,
but I want control over my own personal information.

What's worse, some years ago the German RAF (Rote Armee Fraktion/Red Army
Fraction), the major terrorist group of that time, allegedly (i.e. it's too
long ago to remember my sources) used to somehow obtain access to the
registration data of some vehicle, fake the vehicle registration ID card
(Kraftfahrzeugschein), then steal a car of the same type and color and fake
the license plates.  Such a vehicle would pass any road block, even if every
vehicle passing the block would be checked against a vehicle registration
data base.  Handing out the necessary data sure makes life easier for some
folks.

Conclusions are left to the RISKS reader in general and the security
and intelligence folks hopefully reading this in particular.

effect that his name and e-mail address are not to be used in any way for

such disclaimers could be enforced, but perhaps RISKS should add one

[David, "dishonesty" sounds a little harsh.  How well can anyone

Exactly.  In fact, this is one of the oldest problems in our field ...  the
fact that we don't know how to predict how long it will take to do just
about anything useful (write new code, fix an old piece of code, etc.).

True honesty is all too rare in our discipline.  How often will you hear a
company say "We have a problem with our product.  We don't know what's
causing the problem, either.  We're working furiously on it to solve it, but
we can't predict whether it will take minutes or days to fix it."?  Consider
also the common practice of marketing "bug fixes" as "upgrades" ---
sometimes free, sometimes not.

You can't, and that's the point. When I tell my customers "Try again in 15
minutes", they'll assume that I have enough data to make a reasonable
guesstimate that the repair will take 15 minutes, more or less.

If, on the other hand, I haven't the faintest idea what's going on, then
"we've had a major system crash, please try again later" would (a) be more
honest and (b) would not annoy customers by raising unfulfillable
expectations.

The recent America Online blackout has spurred my thinking on the subject of
decreasing the risks of software upgrades for real-time systems. I want to
highlight for your readers some very significant techniques that I perceive
to be underutilized to date and, if developed and used widely in the future,
could hold great promise in drastically reducing the hazards of simple
software upgrades. They are inspired by a maddeningly familiar pattern in
software upgrades one might call "upgrade hell":

The fundamental difficulty we are observing in real-time software is that
the system is often only designed to run one version of the software at a
time. Designers are forced to bring "down" the system while they install new
software, which may or may not function correctly. Often they can only test
the full range of behavior or reliability of the new software by actually
installing it and running it "live". Then, if the software fails to work, a
process that in itself may be difficult to detect, they are forced to "down"
the system again, and reinstall the old version of the software, if such a
thing is even possible (in some cases the configuration of the new version
is such that an older version cannot be readily reverted to).

This story repeats itself endlessly in many diverse software applications,
from very large distributed systems down to individual PC upgrades.
In pondering this I came to some observations.

1. Many designers currently assume that new versions of software will be
"plug-and-play" compatible with older versions.

2. Systems are designed to run one version of software at a time.

3. A system has to be inactive during transitions between versions.

4. Upgrades are only occasional and the downtime due to them is acceptable.

These basic features of software and hardware interplay, despite their wide
adherence, are not in fact "carved in stone". Could we imagine a directly
contrasting system in which they are fundamentally different?

1. Let us assume that new software is not necessarily compatible with
previous versions even where it should be, despite our best attempts to
make it so. In fact let us assume that humans are notoriously fallible
in creating such a guarantee and that in fact such a guarantee cannot be
realistically achieved.

2. Let us imagine a system in which multiple versions of software (at least
two) can be running simultaneously.

3. Let us imagine a system that "stays running" even during software version
upgrades.

4. Let us assume upgrades are periodic, inevitable, and ideally the system
would "stay running" even throughout an upgrade.

The above assumptions lead to some attractive properties of the whole I will
describe. One feature is similar to the way drives can be configured to
"mirror" each other, such that if either fails the other will take over
seamlessly and the bad one "flagged" for replacement. Imagine now that
computations themselves are "mirrored" in the hardware such that two
versions of software are running concurrently, and the software checks
itself for mismatches between the results of the computations where they are
supposed to be compatible (this can be done at many different scales of
granularity at the decision of the designer). The software could
automatically flag situations in which the new code is not functioning
properly, even while running the old version.

What we have is a sort of "shadow computation" going on behind the scenes.
When a designer wants to run a new version of software, he could "shadow" it
behind the currently running software to test its reliability without
actually committing to running it.

Under this new system, software upgrades tend to blend together:

- There is a point where only the old version is running.
- Then the old and the new version are overlapping or the new "shadowing"
the old but the new not actually determining final results.
- Then reliability is actually measured, and continued to be
measured until gauged sufficient.
- Finally, the actual commitment to running the new version alone
can be made.
- Additionally, keeping around old versions that can be switched to
immediately in times of crisis would be a very powerful advantage--
losing some new functionality but preserving basic or core functions.

There would be vastly fewer "gotchas" in this system than those I outlined
above in the classic "upgrade hell" scenario. Once the concept of different
versions is embodied within in the software itself by the above principles,
rather than it being considered foreign or external to the system, we have
other very powerful techniques that can be applied:

A "divide and conquer" approach can be used to isolate bad new components.
Different new components, all part of the new upgrade, can be selectively
turned "on" or "off" (but still shadowed) to find the combination of new
components that creates bad results based on the "live" or "on-the-fly"
benchmarks of previous software. In fact, it may become possible to write
software that actually automates the process of upgrading in which new
versions of the components are switched on by the software itself based on
passing automated reliability tests.  The whole process of upgrading then
becomes streamlined and systematic and begins to transcend human
idiosyncracies.

These new assumptions could lead to radically different software and
hardware systems with some very nice properties, potentially achieving what
by today's standards seems elusive to the point of impossibility yet
immensely desirable to the point of necessity: robust fault tolerance and
continued, uninterrupted service even during software upgrades. Of course,
the above techniques are inherently more difficult to achieve in
implementation, but the cost-benefit ratio may be wholly acceptable and even
desirable in many mission-critical applications, such as utility-like
services like telecommunications, cyberspace, company transactions, etc.

One difficulty of implementing the new assumptions above relative to
software is that often such changes need to be made from the ground up,
starting with hardware. But the software and hardware industries have shown
themselves to be very adaptable to massive redesigns relative to new ideas
and philosophies if they are shown to be efficacious in the final analysis
despite some initial inconvenience, such as object oriented programming.  I
am not saying the above alterations are appropriate for all applications.
They can also be introduced to varying degrees in different situations,
ranging from a mere simplicity in switching between versions all the way to
fully concurrent and shadowed computation with multiple versions immediately
available.

Also, I am sure your astute readers can point out many situations in which
the ideas I am outlining already exist. I am not saying they are novel.
However the emphasis on them in a collection as a basic paradigm I have not
seen before. In the same way that many designers were using OOP principles
such as encapsulation, polymorphism, etc. before they were focused into a
unified paradigm, I believe the above ideas could benefit from such a
focused development, such as designing hardware, software, and languages
that explicitly embody them. Many of the ideas I outline are used in
software development pipelines and distinct QAQC divisions of companies--
but I am proposing incorporating them in the machines themselves, which to
my knowledge is a novel perspective.

Actually, the root concept behind these ideas is even more general than mere
application to software. It is the idea that "the system should continue to
function even as parts of it are replaced". We see that this basic premise
can be applied to both hardware and software. It is such a basic attribute
that we crave and demand of our increasingly critical electronic
infrastructures, yet so difficult to achieve in practice. Isolated parts of
our systems today have this property-- is it the case that it is gradually
spreading to the point it may eventually encompass entire systems?

Many of these ideas come to me in considering a new protocol I am devising
called the "directed information assembly line" (DIAL), a now-brief
theoretical construct that supports such features, which I can forward to
any interested correspondents who send me e-mail. Some of the key
assumptions I am reexamining are those given above. I believe that actually
changing our assumptions about the reliability of humans to be more lenient
can actually improve the reliability of our systems. Let us start from new
assumptions, including "humans are fallible", rather than "humans approach
the limit of virtual infallibility if put under enough pressure" (such as
that always associated with new versions and software upgrades).

In the 22 Jul 1996 issue of Fortune was an interesting look into the future
of automobile electronics, "Soon Your Dashboard Will Do Everything (Except
Steer)".  The topic of steering has already been discussed in this forum,
but what caught my eye was a review of the "OnStar" product from GM.
Besides being a navigation aid, it also contains "some anti-bonehead
features".  These include the ability for you to call GM's "control center"
for help if you lock your keys in the car, or forget where you parked it.
&gt;From the control center, they can "electronically reach into the car" to
unlock the doors, or honk the horn and flash its lights.

Since the article doesn't discuss how the control center will authenticate
that you really own the car you are asking them to unlock, or what measures
are used to prevent a would-be control center from gaining access, it's not
clear how the term "bone-head feature" should be applied...

Last weekend the national press here in the UK published extracts from the
police transcripts of the emergency traffic concerning the Atlanta bomb.

One thing that struck me was the operator's belief that the system's refusal
to accept Centennial Park as a valid location was her fault.  She even
queried with the Police dispatcher whether she had spelled Centennial
correctly.

I see two risks. Firstly, an overexpectation that a computerised system is
error-free, and that every problem is operator error.  Secondly, the
deskilling of the operator's job increases the first risk.

Aviation Week and Space Technology, 29 July 1996, pp36-37, contains the
article "Pilots, A300 Systems Cited in Nagoya Crash" by Eiichiro Sekigawa
and Michael Mecham, which summarises the final report of the Japanese
Aircraft Accident Investigation Committee into the tail-first crash of China
Air 140 into the runway at Nagoya on 26 April 1994, along with further
information on the history of the A300 flight-control design for
automatic/manual interactions.

Thus this accident has HCI aspects. It was discussed extensively in RISKS
editions 16.05 (Stalzer), 16.06 (Wittenberg), 16.07 (Ladkin), 16.09
(Yesberg), 16.13 (Terribile), 16.14 (Ladkin, Overy), 16.15 (Shafer, Dorsett,
Overy, Kaplow), and 16.16 (Dorsett, Ladkin, Kaplow, Mellor, Niland). The
final report contains no surprises.  Early rumors of a higher-than-expected
blood alcohol level in the pilots (there is normally some found in autopsy,
due to decomposition) and of an electrical power failure before the accident
did not finally figure.  All comments below within quotation marks "..." are
quotations from Aviation Week.

The final report said that the crash was the result of the pilots fighting
the autopilot.  It concluded that the pilots were inadequately trained in
the "use and operational characteristics" of the autopilot.  It also faulted
Airbus Industrie's cockpit design, specifically the position of the
autopilot's TOGA (takeoff/go-around) lever beneath the throttle; and
"unclear writing" in the Flight Crew Operations Manual (FCOM).

The sequence of events was as follows. The First Officer (FO) was flying the
approach to Nagoya, using the Flight Director (FD) and autothrottle, and
accidentally triggered the takeoff/go-around (TOGA) lever (at time T), which
is positioned just below the throttle levers. This caused the automatic
flight system to go into `go-around' (GA) mode: the FD issued `pitch-up'
commands. The captain noticed it, autothrottle was disengaged and thrust
manually increased. Autopilots 1 and 2 were engaged (it's not clear why,
perhaps in thinking to recapture the glideslope - the descent path - from
which the aircraft had now departed), which didn't help since the AFCS was
in GA mode. The aircraft was flying 18 degrees nose-up. The FO attempted for
20 seconds to force the nose down by pushing hard on the control column,
thus `fighting' the autopilot, which in response rolled in full nose-up trim
to keep the pitch up. Finally, at T+45, the autopilots were disengaged, the
captain took control. However, the alpha-floor protection triggered at T+50
from excessive angle-of-attack (that means that the aircraft was close to
stalling) and brought in maximum thrust. However, this increased the nose-up
attitude to over 52 degrees (since the wing was barely flying because the
airplane was by now so slow, the thrust generated a pitch-up moment about
the horizontal axis through the wings, which was uncountered by aerodynamics
at such a slow speed). The captain disengaged alpha-floor by retarding
thrust, but the airplane had slowed to 78 knots, stalled at 1,800ft above
the runway threshold, and crashed tail-first.

The cockpit voice recorder (CVR) shows the pilots were confused as to why
the aircraft was not responding to the heavy manual nose-down command,
despite C's recognising that GA mode had been engaged.  The autopilot on all
transport-category aircraft including this one can be manually disengaged by
pushing the red autopilot-disconnect button on the handgrip of the control
wheel.  There is also an on/off switch on the cockpit forward control panel
of A300/310 series aircraft which can be used to disconnect the autopilot.

The accident aircraft had automatic yoke-force disengagement of the
autopilot inhibited below 1,500 ft AGL to avoid accidental disengagement of
the autopilot during automatic landings.  Airbus had already issued service
bulletin SB A300-22-6021 recommending modification of the flight control
computer (FCC) to allow disengagement by significant control column force
above 400 ft AGL.  China Air had not modified the accident airplane to SB
A300-22-6021.  Airbus "resisted changing its autopilot software below 400
ft. [sic] out of concern that pilots would have insufficient time to recover
control if they inadvertently moved the yoke during an automatic blind
landing." However, in March 1996 Airbus modified the system to deactivate
below 400 ft. against yoke pressure of 45 lb. push and 100 lb. pull.

The Committee
o   said that alpha-floor combined with the unusual out-of-trim state in
fact generated a heavy pitch-up moment, the opposite of what would
be needed for stall recovery. It recommended that the BEA "study" this;
o   said that the captain misjudged the situation and should have taken over
flight control earlier;
o   noted that Boeing and McDonnell-Douglas aircraft would have
automatically disengaged the autopilot when heavy yoke forces were
applied. "Their autopilots are also less likely to trim against
pilot yoke inputs";
o   criticized Airbus for eliminating an audio alert for the
stabilizer-trim-in-motion condition when the THS is in autopilot
control. "Airbus should consider making the [..] sound in a
THS out-of-trim condition, or if the THS moves continuously,
regardless of autopilot engagement";
o   said Airbus needed "to study the function, mode-display and
warning/alert system"  in the current automatic flight-control
system to "consider" pilot reactions. It concluded that the present
system is too complicated in emergencies. "The BEA rejected
this criticism";
o   called for Airbus to "improve" the FCOM instructions for manual
override of the autopilot system, its disengagement in GA mode,
and recovery procedures from an out-of-trim condition.
o   "was critical of Airbus" for not making modification
SB A300-22-6021 mandatory in light of three similar incidents in
1985, 1989 and 1991;
o   recommended that manufacturers standardize specifications
of automatic flight systems to make pilot training easier.

The US National Transportation Safety Board has accepted the findings of the
report, as did Taiwan's Civil Aeronautics Administration (with only minor
reservations). But the opinion of the French Bureau Enqu`etes Accidents
differs in certain aspects, and the report includes a rebuttal of the BEA
view.

The captain had over 2,600 hours in B747 and over 1,600 hours in A300-600
airplanes, as well as over 4,800 hours air force flight service. The FO had
over 1,000 hours in the A300-600. Their behavior in fighting the autopilot,
rather than disconnecting it (notwithstanding the yoke-force-disconnect on
other airplanes); and in trying to force the airplane onto the ground
(rather than going around and landing on the next try), remains simply
incomprehensible to most pilots including this one.

and Accidents with Commercial Airplanes', accessible from

In <A HREF="/Risks/18.31.html">RISKS-18.31</A>, PGN added the footnote:-

&gt;&gt;   [David, "dishonesty" sounds a little harsh.  How well can anyone
&gt;&gt;   predict how long it is going to take to fix a problem that has not
&gt;&gt;   yet been identified and understood?  PGN]

In response, in RISKS DIGEST 18.32, "James K. Huggins"
&lt;<A HREF="mailto:huggins@eecs.umich.edu">huggins@eecs.umich.edu</A>&gt; writes:-

&gt; Exactly.  In fact, this is one of the oldest problems in our field ...  the
&gt; fact that we don't know how to predict how long it will take to do just
&gt; about anything useful (write new code, fix an old piece of code, etc.).

and <A HREF="mailto:smurf@noris.de">smurf@noris.de</A> (Matthias Urlichs) writes:-

&gt; You can't, and that's the point. ...

I disagree. This view seems to be unnecessarily defeatist. What we are
talking about here is measuring an attribute of a software-based system
which is usually referred to as "maintainability" and can be defined
quantitatively as "effort required to diagnose and fix a fault".

Software producers are in a position to measure this. (Whether they actually
do or not is another matter.) The procedure to be followed would be
something like the following:-

1. During the system trial (or beta-test), every failure is recorded
by the testers (or users) and reported to the design authority,
with all relevant data, such as symptoms and exception messages
observed at the time, memory dumps subsequently taken, etc.

2. The design authority then diagnoses the latent fault that was activated
and so gave rise to the failure. This would involve finding out:-

a) the location of the fault within the software,
b) the identity of the fault in terms of what exactly is wrong
with the code, the module specification, or whatever,
c) the "trigger" conditions which activate the fault, and
d) a classification of the fault according to its cause
(e.g., programming error, specification error, etc.) and
effect (e.g., system crash, files corrupted, etc.).

3. The DA then devises a "fix", which might be a "work-around" to
avoid the trigger conditions, or a modification to the software
to remove the fault permanently.

4. Regression testing is then required to ensure that the fix is
effective, and that it does not introduce any new faults.

5. The effort (person-hours), overhead costs (e.g., machine time
for regression testing), and elapsed time taken, are recorded for
each of these steps.

The result is a set of statistics (effort, cost and time to diagnose
and fix each fault reported) which can be used as the basis for
estimating effort, cost and time to deal with any fault reported
during live use of the system.

Obviously, the effort, cost and time will vary, but a statistical
analysis would yield useful figures such as mean time to repair (MTTR)
and standard deviation, or median time to repair (MeTTR) with percentiles
(and similar statistics for cost and effort). The analysis could
also break down the cost, effort and time by type, location, and
severity of the fault.

Armed with this information, the producer is now in a position to
make a sensible estimate of repair time, with confidence intervals,
based on past data.

OK, this makes it sound simple, and I am fairly sure that few software
producers actually compile such statistics. (I would be very interested to
hear from any who do!) The best I could get (many years ago, for a support
team debugging large mainframe operating systems) was a vague statement from
the support manager to the effect that "My staff get through about three a
week each."

However, if this seems odd, or unnecessarily onerous in terms of data
collection, bear in mind that it is quite normal for hardware equipment to
be sold with quoted mean time to failure (MTTF) and mean time to repair
(MTTR), with both of these statistics broken down to apply to particular
modes of failure. (In the hardware case, which widget has dropped off, and
how long does it take to find and fit a new one?)  The reliability (measured
by MTTF), availability (MTTF/(MTTF+MTTR)) and maintainability (measured by
MTTR) are known.

[In the software case, there is a slight complication. Since software faults
tend to be transient (remove the trigger conditions and the failure
condition goes away), the attribute "recoverability", measured in terms of
"time to restore service", is of equal interest to maintainability.
(Typically, you record and report the failure, reboot the system, and carry
on working while the diagnosis and repair takes place off-site.) ]

As long as software producers are unwilling to make the necessary
measurements, then software development and support will continue to remain
a "black art", and will not merit the term "software engineering" in the
same way that we talk about "mechanical engineering", "civil engineering",
etc.

&gt; ... Not something that I want to hook my house up to.

Sorry about that, but your house is hooked up to it.  Philadelphia Electric
used to be pretty good about reserve capacity. (I haven't lived there for
years, so I don't currently know.)  However, what do you think caused the
Great Northeast Power Blackout?  What was obviously the real cause of the
recent western blackouts?  The interconnect grids are great if demand stays
within bounds, but when heavily stressed they become amplifiers.

In the recent past politicians and financial analysts alike have been
encouraging utilities to reduce their on-line excess capacity, and to shut
down plants when not required for the current demand level.  But excess
capacity on-line is necessary to have a stable interconnect system.  The
difference in stability between 10 plants at running at of 81% capacity and
9 plants at 90% is dramatic.  (If one facility has a glitch the network goes
wild.  It has just been thrown from stable operation into instantaneous
overload, and at the best of times it will take the network hundreds of
milliseconds--a dozen or so cycles--to stabilize.  If transients cause
generation facilities or transmission lines kick out before substations, the
system is gone before any humans can react.)

The Northeast Blackout was caused by a coil failing in a relay in Niagara
Falls.  The relay had a backup coil which was energized immediately, and the
main contacts never completely opened.  In other words, the failover met
specification.  By the time the (amplified) voltage transient reached New
York City, the result was spectacular, did damage in the tens to hundreds of
millions of dollars, and killed a number of people.  Some of you just saw a
similar demonstration.  Trying to figure out whether a fire in Idaho or a
breaker tripped in California started the electric dominos toppling is
detail.  The important lesson is that if you run a grid too near the edge it
amplifies fluctuations and imbalances.  One glitch and we all reap the
whirlwind.

I'd like to correct an oft-repeated misstatement; that California DMV
records have been secured.  In fact, quite minor procedural barriers to
access by unsophisticated people at DMV counters have been instituted, but
only slightly more savvy people can still get info, and the DMV continues to
sell mass data extractions to reusers.  Also, DMV has taken no steps at all
to secure data or systems against misuse by DMV staff or others (e.g.,
police) with privileged access.

What happened was that a train from Euston to Milton Keynes with about 400
passengers on board was travelling North at about 60mph. Another empty
train, which should have been waiting at a red signal just outside Watford
Junction, started moving slowly South and crossed over a set of points onto
the North-bound fast line straight into the path of the fast train. The fast
train driver saw what was happening and sounded his horn but could not avoid
a collision. I believe that both drivers managed to jump clear before the
crash and were not badly injured.

"Black boxes" were recovered from both crashed trains, and showed that
signalling and train systems were working properly just before the crash.
These black boxes, I understand, are a recent innovation and are not fitted
to all trains.

It turned out that the crashed trains were both fairly new (about 10 years
old) and had well-designed carriages which dissipated the force of the
impact; also, that the collision was glancing and not head-on.

Newspaper photographs showed track torn up and the front carriages of both
trains at crazy angles; one was hanging over an embankment. The other
carriages of both trains were derailed but had not been thrown over. The
line was closed for about 2 days while the carriages were removed and track
repaired.

It was a huge stroke of luck that the collision involved new rolling stock:
on some other lines carriages are 30 or 40 years old and are of an antique
"slam-door" design which concertinas in the event of a crash.  I have read
that, of about 70 deaths on the United Kingdom railways in the past 10
years, all but one have occurred in these older carriages.

There are four separate enquiries going on at the moment - by Railtrack (who
own the track), North London Trains (who own the trains), British Transport
Police and the UK Government's Health and Safety Executive - so I presume
the reason for the supposedly stationary train moving will come out in due
course.

A number of risks have emerged from the recent crash. The first concerns
Automatic Train Protection, ATP. This system is claimed to stop any train
which passes a red signal. It is not used on the British railway network,
though it is deployed on other European railways. [Apologies to any
trainspotters for any simplification I've made.] The UK railway companies
say that ATP is too expensive - it costs too much for each life it saves,
though how they work that out is beyond me. (Another risk?) They claim that
the money required for ATP would be better spent on other safety measures
like modern, stronger passenger carriages. So, rather than prevent trains
crashing into each other, they think the best strategy is to let them crash,
but make the rolling stock safer. (Yet another risk?)

The next risk is the absurd way in which Britain's railways are now run
after privatisation. One company - Railtrack - owns the stations, track and
signalling systems. It seems more interested in property development and
turning stations into shopping malls than the rail infrastructure. This
company would have to install ATP, which would make a big dent in their
balance sheet. So, it's hardly surprising that they are not enthusiastic for
ATP, even though they have some responsibility for safety. Railtrack charges
train companies for the use of its stations and track. The train companies
operate the services, but they don't own the rolling stock. These belong to
leasing companies who hire them to the rail operators.

Aside from the bureaucracy and ticketing nightmares, there are serious
safety risks in this setup. Safety of the trains is the responsibility of
the leasing companies who own them and the operating companies who use them
and presumably the companies who maintain them. Where the boundaries are is
anybody's guess. Railtrack have responsibility for the safety of the track
and signalling systems. However, if they were to deploy ATP, the leasing and
operating companies would have to pay for the extra kit in the trains. Where
the boundaries of responsibility lie between Railtrack and the leasing and
operating companies is yet unknown. There was a recent report that a small
fire was put out by staff throwing dirt and sand at the junction box. The
box belonged to Railtrack, the staff worked for an operating company.  They
feared being disciplined if they used company property - their company's
fire extinguishers - to help another company.

Sitting on top of this is a government agency, the Health and Safety
Executive which is responsible for safety in the workplace amongst other
things. Where their responsibility kicks in is yet another unknown. With no
single body responsible for train safety, it's hard to apportion blame for
crashes or establish better procedures and communications protocols to make
them less likely in future. The companies and agencies involved end up
shrugging their shoulders and pointing at each other.

An added problem is that none of these companies has safety as a prime
objective. They all want to cut costs to boost their profits. For Railtrack,
money spent of safety measures comes straight off their bottom line,
reducing dividends for shareholders and profitability bonuses for
management. For the leasing companies, repainting old trains is more cost
effective than buying new ones which presumably have better safety features.
For the operating companies, the cost of leasing is one of the few costs
they can control. [They can also work their drivers harder, but that will be
another safety risk.] Thus, they prefer to run old, less safe, trains
because they are cheaper to lease than new ones.

&gt; Apparently they pass on the information you entered to another service and
&gt; presumably if you don't show up you don't get to download the software.

That's quite interesting. Now what happens if I telnet into my other service
provider (in California) and enter a perfectly valid name, US address and
phone number.

Not that I would do it of course, it seems an unnecessarily convoluted
way of achieving a fairly simple objective.

Risks readers might like to ponder a Catch 22 situation I found myself in
some years ago. Working for a UK company selling high-tech equipment (68000
processors) I wasn't permitted to supply anyone on a blacklist. I could have
been extradited and jailed for doing that. Of course I wasn't permitted to
actually see the blacklist either.

And on another subject entirely...

&gt; The final report said that the crash was the result of the pilots fighting
&gt; the autopilot.

I've just heard a report of a crash that happened here two days ago.
It was a result of the two pilots fighting each other. As a result a
business jet crashed on one of Europe's busiest roads. Four injuries,
no fatalities.

The author is right. This is not a novel idea. The Ericsson AXE exchange has
had the functionality to upgrade software in a running system from the first
system delivered more than ten years ago. This was a deliberate design
decision due to the harsh demands on "uptime" in telecommunication systems.

Kurt Fredriksson

[Peter Denning reminds us that the Newcastle work on Recovery Blocks
-- Brian Randell et al. -- is relevant here, and certainly worthy of
mention.  It goes way back to the mid 1970s.  It was an extremely well
thought-out effort, with a language, a run-time system, and a supporting
hardware architecture for dealing with concurrent processes running
different versions of an algorithm (alternat[iv]e blocks), such that the
collection of processes would not terminate until at least one of them
passed an acceptance test.  Their system include automatic checkpointing
so that you could back up properly to the last known state that passed an
acceptance test.  Thanks to PJD for the reminiscence.  PGN]

"Vladimir Z. Nuri" &lt;<A HREF="mailto:vznuri@netcom.com">vznuri@netcom.com</A>&gt; writes about the possibility of
running new software as a "shadow" of currently running software and
(perhaps automatically) testing its reliability before switching it to
"actively" controlling the system.

This method may be fine for bug fixes, but it has a fundamental
limitation because it ignores a fundamental issue of software upgrades:
that the new software may have new functionality which is unavailable
in the old version, and thus will never be tested while the old
software is the only one that is "active".

For example, Bell Canada recently introduced phone mail to residences
that previously only had "call answer".  Since phone mail has
fundamentally new functionality over call answer, the phone mail can
not be tested under real-world conditions until its functionality is
activated and actually used by the users.  And if it fails, it will be
difficult to reliably fall back to call answer alone, because then any
phone mail messages left in the queue may be lost or left dangling.

I believe that the venerable Multics system supported this to some degree.
Also, IBM's AIX system has gotten quite good at update-on-the-fly (although
it's not *quite* up to full 24x7 yet), mostly due to the fact that most of
the operating system kernel is loaded on the fly.  There's still some
gotchas, most notably in trying to reload a device driver after applying
maintenance...

&gt;What we have is a sort of "shadow computation" going on behind the scenes...

Unfortunately, if you have a system that's running at 85% capacity, you will
require just about twice as much processor.  Also, you introduce new failure
modes.  I believe the Space Shuttle uses a 5-way redundant system, with 4
systems made and programmed by one contractor, and the 5th a different
design and programming from a separate contractor.

More than once, a shuttle launch has been scrubbed because the voting
mechanism itself broke down.

On the other hand, I seem to remember that when the great long-distance
telephone collapses happened a few years ago, a telco official was asked why
they just don't reboot the switch, and he replied that this implied that the
switches were booted a first time - apparently, some of them had been
upgraded from mechanical rotaries through to several generations of more
electronic and computerized designs, without ever actually going down..

Anybody have more info on how the telcos do software upgrades?  They seem to
have quite the good record on it (barring a few historical botches ;)

An nice analogy for fault-tolerant system upgrades struck me after I wrote
the earlier article. When highways are being resurfaced, they are rarely
barricaded entirely; instead traffic is diverted during off-peak periods and
run at less-than-peak efficiency. I am trying to spur designers to think of
the flow of data through programs as exactly the same kind of situation:
ideally data could be easily rerouted through different parts of a system
even as it is being upgraded. Of course, roads do not have the complexity of
software-- the pavers do not have to worry about it not working properly
once installed.

Kurt Fredrikson remarks that the "Ericsson AXE exchange" has the
functionality to upgrade software on-the-fly. I am not familiar with it but
I wonder if it has all the key properties I mentioned or if it subtly relies
on any of the hidden "gotchas" such as assuming designers will infallibly
carry over functionality between versions (i.e. no regressions).  It is easy
to claim that software can be instantly switched to a new version (or back
to an old one), but such a mechanism is not entirely desirable without other
features such as the ability to seamlessly compare the compatibility results
of new versions with earlier ones.

In other words, one of my basic assertions in the essay is that regressions
in software, where bugs in existing functionality are introduced in new
versions, can be caught through more systematic methods than are generally
being employed today. Wayne Hayes writes in a response that the system I
propose cannot handle "new functionality". In the short essay I could not
include this obvious caveat although it is quite apparent and a significant
limitation. Actually, the essence of the mini-essay focuses on an elegant
and graceful way of avoiding "regressions", and obviously one cannot have a
regression when the functionality did not previously exist.

But Mr. Hayes also brings up an excellent related point about situations
where new functionality conflicts with old functionality. In such cases
designers could actually write code that "bridges" the two versions, such
that they have fallback algorithms when the new code fails to function. In
other words, they write a bit of additional code that tries to gracefully
fall back or rearrange the system so that one can run the earlier version.
Of course, that could have bugs too, and we tend to run into issues of
infinite regress in some of these ideas. (Nevertheless, often companies have
to assume that many of their software versions are running simultaneously.)

In fact there is a whole array of issues that readers can immediately spot--
this is exactly the kind of development and attention I suggest be channeled
into creating computer languages and hardware systems that take into account
all the various scenarios.

I want to highlight this point of Mr. Hayes'-- the system I am describing
for graceful system upgrades is not designed to guarantee that new
functionality is correct, only that old functionality is not "clobbered" in
an upgrade, and no system downtime in the process.  Of course the process of
testing new functionality is an entire art form in itself.  However, because
"seamless software upgrading" does not guarantee the correctness of new
functionality does not mean it is not superior to the systems we have now,
which frequently do not even guarantee old functionality in practice
(although the designers would insist they do in theory-- a perception gap I
am explicitly challenging).  If a new feature does not work correctly but
the system is still running, that's highly desireable. Designers would be
elated to be able to test new features without fear of breaking the overall
system.

One nice way of thinking about this is the following: every software package
is a core of functions, say A = X + Z. X is the core code that should remain
compatible into the future. Z is code identified as obsolete and "to be
deleted" in a future version.  A new version, A', adds some new
functionality Y, so that A' = A + Y - Z = X + Y. A "regression" happens
whenever something in X fails to function in the new version, something I am
suggesting can be better dealt with by a change in designer's perceptions
and tools relative to the inherent evolutionary aspect of software (in
contrast to the perception of inertness that holds today).

To summarize the above points in this framework, Mr. Hayes quite rightfully
points out that if you don't have any prior information on Y, the concept of
"regression" is not applicable. But also in his example, the problem of
isolating exactly what Y is relative to X is apparent. Trying to draw the
line between the two would be very difficult in some situations such as the
case he gives, where new functionality is not merely an addition on old
functionality but a replacement of aspects of it. However, merely placing
attention onto the problem improves its chances for solution, and the
designer is forced to explicitly answer the question, "how can I gracefully
add this new feature and possibly revert to the old one if it doesn't work?"

Mr. Kletnieks mentions another demand of graceful software upgrading, that
if our system is running at anywhere over 50% capacity you would have to add
capacity to mirror it if it is a real-time system.  But to me this is
essentially like describing mirrored disk drives to someone, and them
saying, "but you have to have twice as many disk drives as you now have".
That's the basic part of the cost/benefit tradeoff.  Also, I think that many
of the ideas can be used in non-realtime systems which would not require an
upgrade in capacity but would instead imply slower running times. Of course
there is additional overhead in introducing such ideas, just as for example
in OOP the inherent overhead to function calls is increased due to the
indirection. Of course, the power derived is inherent to this sacrifice.

The use of voting software in the space shuttle is one example of
a system that is similar to what I am proposing. What he describes is
essentially the idea of using shadowed computation on a single process
to guarantee reliability, but the area of *upgrading* that I
am focusing on is not as apparent in that example. Mr. Kletnieks' example
makes a good point, however: the code designed to deal with multiple versions
may itself have bugs in it. Again, the infinite regress-- what code will
check the checker code? I suggest this will be less of a problem when the
checker code is intrinsic to the language, so that this would be like
asking the question, "what if the compiler has bugs in it"?

I would also like to point out that it ought to be up to the end-user to
determine actual compatibility of versions. Today we have a system in which
the companies that create the software give the assurance that it is or is
not compatible, and the end-user often cannot determine whether this is so
without committing to the new version, with the "upgrade hell" scenario
frequently ensuing despite everyone's best intentions. In contrast, with a
suitably flexible and powerful computation environment like I describe, it
would be less relevant what the company promises, and the end-user could
have ultimate control over testing and switching versions to match his own
demands.  How can a company guarantee it has a rigor in its testing
environment that exceeds that of all its customers? History generally
suggests they can't, and I suggest that systems be designed with this in
mind, which give greater control to the end user in arbitrarily and
seamlessly testing and switching between versions.

Based on responses, I am struck that the ideas I was highlighting in my
original essay were explored somewhat thoroughly in the 70's, yet they
apparently haven't made it into widespread use in software or hardware.  I
suggest they could be applied in varying degrees into areas outside of the
incredibly demanding environments of telecommunications and space
exploration with fruitful results (I would also like to hear more about how
telecommunication software is upgraded from RISKS readers-- the infamous
AT&amp;T switching disaster of a few years ago shows that it was even "recently"
subject to catastrophic human miscalculations).

The graceful-upgrade paradigm seems to have failed to have made the
difficult leap from theoretical curiosity to widespread use and awareness by
"Joe Codehead". Again I think the analogy to OOP is relevant.  It took a
massive paradigm shift in consciousness for OOP to "trickle down" throughout
the software industry.  I suspect that the ideas for seamless software
upgrades are roughly as significant and valuable and am writing partly in
the hope others can take up this ideology for research and implementation
beyond my own limited and minimal elucidations.

Of course the traditional car-stopping alternatives are a fusillade of
gunfire, or a highly hazardous high speed pursuit, ramming of the fleeing
vehicle, and, all too frequently, a "spirited arrest" by the pursuing
officers.  Except for the risk of turning pacemakers "up", "down", or "off",
this non-lethal tool might be worth the collateral damage.

Regarding the power outage that hit several Western US states last Saturday,
I had an interesting experience.  I was in Las Vegas that weekend, and
arrived at the Hilton hotel/casino where I was staying shortly after the
power outage started.  At the time, I was unaware of the outage, and things
appeared more or less normal inside, since the casino was on generator
power.  However, when I got to the front of the check-in line, I was told
that I could not be issued a key to my room, since all of the machines that
make the room keys (in this case, plastic cards with mag stripes) were
"down."  At first, they were sending new guests to their rooms accompanied
by security, who would let them in with a master key.  However, this quickly
became overwhelming for them as the outage progressed, so they told us just
to check back every 30 minutes until they got the card key machines working
again.

With nothing better to do, I settled down in the bar :-), where I leared
about the power outage.  At this point, it was really interesting to see
what Hilton considered essential enough to have on the backup generators,
and what was "unessential" and therefore could be dark during the power
outage.  It was no surprise to see that *everything* on the casino floor was
considered essential, right down to the chandeliers.  Reportedly, everything
went dark for a few seconds when the outage began and while the generators
spun up.  After that, whatever was on the backup system came back on.  The
slot machines remembered how many credits each player had, so at least that
part of them must be on some sort of UPS.

In the bar, most of the lights were out, but the lights behind the bar, as
well as all of the equipment needed to keep it open (beer and soft drink
taps, cash registers, etc.) were on.

It was interesting that at the front desk, all of the computers were up, so
they could check guests in and out, but the card key machines were not.  The
risk here is that even when you have a backup generator, your operations can
still be crippled if you have a poorly thought out strategy of what you place
on the backup system.

The problem with this is that although it gives you a nice-looking set
of graphs, it probably doesn't help you make any predictions until
*after* you find and categorize the problem.  All it *really* tells
you is how long it takes to code various types of fixes.

When the system goes belly up, you probably can't right off the bat
say "oh, that's a one-line error causing a memory overlay, 20 minutes
to fix" or "We know what that is, it's a major design flaw that will
take 4 man-weeks".

I once had to find a memory overlay in ISODE 8.0 (which is on the
order of 500K lines of code). The error would only trip after about 6
million calls to the malloc() memory allocator, once about 120M of
data had been allocated on the fly. Took me about 20 seconds to figure
out "overlay".  I then spent 3 80-hour weeks chasing it (we had a
deadline to meet).  Towards the end of the second week, I was becoming
thoroughly convinced that the entire memory management system was
trash and needed to be overhauled.

Final fix was 3 lines of C code, to repair where a programmer had forgotten
to deal with one boundary condition.

I'm sure anybody who's been doing systems admin/support in the trenches for
more than a few years has a whole collection of horror stories where the
initial diagnosis had absolutely no relationship to the actual problem....

Pete Mellor claims (in <A HREF="/Risks/18.33.html">RISKS-18.33</A>) that if software producers/ maintainers
keep better records, they'll become Real Engineers and be just as able to
accurately predict the "effort required to diagnose and fix a fault" as
other kinds of Real Engineers.

While I wouldn't remotely suggest that better measurements couldn't improve
predictability, truly accurate estimates of time to fix a bug that's not yet
understood will always be an unachievable goal.  The metaphor of hardware
design, although tempting because software designers tend to work closely
with hardware designers, is so weak as to be downright disingenuous.
Software *is* different from hardware in some very relevant ways, but the
most critical for this discussion is the fact that every bug is different.
You can measure mean-time-to-failure for a light bulb quite accurately, but
that's because every light bulb failure is the same.  Every software
problem, however, is unique.  [to paraphrase Tolstoy] Once a software bug is
fixed, it shouldn't occur again in the (repaired) code base.

You can make predictions of service intervals extremely precise by
collecting enough data about previous problems.  However, they will be no
more accurate than the similarity between the problems.  The RISK, as usual,
is that the world will unexpectedly be more complicated than our model of
it.  [The key word being "unexpectedly."  Of *course* the world will be more
complicated than the model.  That's the *purpose* of making a model.]

This reminded me of a true situation that I remember reading about a while
back (1980's?).  In some city in the Mideast (Beirut?), there was fighting
in the streets every night.  But one night a week there was peace, because
everyone stayed home to watch two episodes of Kojak broadcast one after the
other by two different TV stations.  The locals named the phenomenon "double
Kojak".

The FBI pulled out of an investigation concerning glued switches discovered
in a backup control room at FPL's Hutchinson Island (near Ft Pierce,
Florida) nuclear facility, so reports the AP in an item carried in 16
August's _Florida Today_.

A security alert was issued Wednesday when glue was discovered in three
locked switches in the backup control room, a facility used in case the
primary control room is unusable.  An FBI spokesman is quoted as justifying
pulling out of the investigation because the FBI lacked "jurisdiction...it
really came down to an act of vandalism or tampering."

The piece fails to mention the plant features that would have been affected
by the glued switches.

Investigation is reportedly focused on employees.  The article implies
a link between the vandalism and complaints about a November round of
job cuts at the facility.

My company recently got ripped off by a competitor.  We build Websites and
thus had constructed a site detailing our products and services.

A rival Website constructor (!) copied practically the entire site,
changing the background color, changing our name into theirs, and making
other slight changes like alignment, add and delete a word or phrase
here and there...

I complained about it, not only to them directly, but also on a local
USENET newsgroup (we're both located in Belgium, so the newsgroup was
be.providers).

On the phone they just laughed at me and admitted to copying, but on
USENET they claimed I had copied their site!

There's nothing I can do to prove them wrong, even though we both know
what happened.

The risk: if you put your materials on the Internet, where they can be
freely copied, make sure you have some way to prove you made them yourself,
and when you did it.

My sister in Israel recently joined the Internet.  She had a certain amount
of trouble getting her PC configured correctly to hook to the service
provider, in part because (I'm told) the name of the semicolon in Hebrew is
(translated) "period comma".  So when she was told over the phone to put in
a "period comma" in a configuration file, she did that (.,) rather than the
required semicolon (;).  Needless to say, the software didn't find the two
interchangeable.

I think the risk is that we computer-types assume that everyone will
understand the ambiguous meaning of terms.  The fact that this happened to
be in another language just makes the point a bit clearer.

When my father was nine, his Uncle Will, who was fond of practical jokes,
gave him a magnetic compass--and said "Why don't you take it apart and see
how it works?"

Technical education rests on intuitive understanding gained through
unsupervised, unstructured exploration in childhood. Before I went to MIT,
I was crushing vacuum tubes in vises, and connecting automobile spark
coils to a big antenna to see whether my friend with the shortwave radio
could pick up the resulting RFI.  [...]

Thirty years ago, a lot of our technology was accessible to direct
exploration.  You could "take it apart to see how it works." You could see
the grooves in a phonograph record, put it under a microscope and see the
wiggles, and experiment by putting fingernails or sharp objects into the
grooves.  You could smash a vacuum tube and see the little grid wire inside
it.  You could overload a vacuum tube and see the anode get red hot.  (My
real learning took place in the basement, not the science fair).

What is the effect on our society as more and more of our technology
vanishes inside the chip?  The behavior of engineered objects depends less
and less on physical and mechanical relationships, and more and more on
arbitrary behavior designed into firmware.  I fear that the engineers of the
future will lack a certain kind of gut intuition that comes from direct
tactile contact with "the works."  We know what is being gained, but are we
sure we know what is being lost?

As did many organizations, the National Institutes of Health received
several bomb threats on Monday, July 29, in the wake of the bombing in
Atlanta, GA. Several buildings were evacuated and searched but no bombs were
found. While the NIH campus is extensively networked, the use of e-mail as a
general nofication mechanism was found to be wanting:

[excerpted from a memo from the NIH Director]
"In addition to notification of all staff through usual administrative
channels, an attempt was made soon after the threats were received to
utilize our e-mail system to inform all NIH staff of the threats. The
delivery of this notification was delayed in many cases because an
equipment failure over the weekend created a backlog of messages on Monday
morning  and because our current list-serv system was unable to deliver
24,000 messages in a timely fashion."

This incident serves to underline the oft-stated (and oft-ignored) risk in
relying on systems that were (a) not designed to do the job required of them
and (b) never subjected to realistic testing to see if they *could* do it
anyway.

[The following transcript of the Olympic 911 bomb call and the ensuing
conversation suggests that many of our nontechnological risks are not

<A HREF="http://www.cnn.com/US/9608/09/olympics.bomb.911/911.transcript.wir/transcript.html">http://www.cnn.com/US/9608/09/olympics.bomb.911/911.transcript.wir/transcript.html</A>

Excerpts from a transcript released Thursday by the Atlanta Police
Department regarding the bomb threat telephoned to 911 on July 27. Times
have been converted from military time to standard notation, and punctuation
and spelling have been edited.  Parenthetical notes are part of the police
transcript except where labeled as an editor's note.

The transcript refers to these police terms: Code 73, bomb threat; and
Zone 5, a police precinct near Centennial Olympic Park.

The transcript did not explain the Zone 5 dispatcher's references to Code
17 and Code 8, which apparently were unrelated to the bomb call.

12:58:28 a.m.:  [Call to 911]

12:58:32 a.m.:  Atlanta Police Department 911 Operator: "Atlanta 911."
Caller:         "There is a bomb in Centennial Park, you have 30 minutes."
12:58:45 a.m.:  Caller hangs up.

1:01:20 a.m.:   911 operator calls APD Agency Command Center (all lines busy).
....

1:01:30 a.m.:   911 operator calls Zone 5 and notifies Zone 5 of Signal 73 and
requests address of Centennial Park -- unable to get street
address.

Dispatcher:     "Zone 5."
911 Operator:   "You know the address to Centennial Olympic Park?"
Dispatcher:     "Girl, don't ask me to lie to you."
911 Operator:   "I tried to call ACC but ain't nobody answering the phone ...
but I just got this man called talking about there's a
bomb set to go off in 30 minutes in Centennial Park."
Dispatcher:     "Oh Lord, child. One minute, one minute. I copy Code 17. OK,
all DUI units are Code 8 and will not be able to
assist on the freeway.
Oh Lord, child. Uh, OK, wait a minute, Centennial
Park, you put it in and it won't go in?"
911 Operator:   "No, unless I'm spelling Centennial wrong. How are we spelling
Centennial?"
Dispatcher:     "C-E-N-T-E-N-N-I -- how do you spell Centennial?"
911 Operator:   "I'm spelling it right, it ain't taking."
Dispatcher:     "Yeah."
911 Operator:   "Centennial Park is not going. Maybe if I take 'park' out,
maybe that will take. Let me try that."
Dispatcher:     "Wait a minute, that's the regular Olympic Stadium right?"
911 Operator:   "Olympic Stadium is like Zone 3, though. Centennial Park."
Dispatcher:     "That's the Centennial Park?"
911 Operator:   "It's near the Coca Cola Plaza, I think."
Dispatcher:     "In 5?"
911 Operator:   "Uh huh."
Dispatcher:     "Uh, hold on. Sonya, you don't know the address to the

2nd Dispatcher (in background): "Downtown."
911 Operator:   "Male, about 30."
Dispatcher:     "1546, Code 17, 23."
911 Operator:   "White."
Dispatcher:     "Uh, you know what? Ask one of the supervisors."
911 Operator:   "No, Lord help me, you know they don't know."
Dispatcher:     "I know, but it gets it off you."
911 Operator:   "Alrighty then, bye."
Dispatcher:     "Bye."

1:02:40 a.m.:   911 operator calls APD ACC for address (telephone line problem;
operators cannot hear each other.) ...

1:02:50 a.m.:   911 operator calls APD ACC again and requests address for
Centennial Park and is given the telephone number.

ACC:            "Atlanta Police, Agency Command Center."
911 Operator:   "Hey, can you hear me now?"
ACC:            "Uh huh."
911 Operator:   "OK, can you give me the address of the Centennial Park?"
ACC:            "I ain't got no address to Centennial Park, what y'all
think I am?"
911 Operator:   "Can you help me find the address to Centennial Park?"
ACC:            "I can give you the telephone number of Centennial Park."
911 Operator:   "I need to get this bomb threat over there to y'all."
ACC:            "Well."
911 Operator:   "But I need the address of Centennial Park. It's not taking,
the system is not taking Centennial Park, that's not
where it came from, but you know the system is not
taking Centennial Park, that's where he said the bomb was."
ACC:            "No particular street or what?"
911 Operator:   "He just said there's a bomb set to go off in 30 minutes in
Centennial Park."
ACC:            "Ooh, it's going to be gone off by the time we find the
address."
911 Operator:   "Are you kiddin'? Give me that, give me that."
ACC:            "I mean I don't have an address, I just have phone
numbers."
911 Operator:   "Give me the phone number."
...

1:05:10 a.m.:   911 operator calls Centennial Park for street address and
is placed on hold. Receives address at 1:07:10 a.m.

Centennial Park: "Centennial Park, this is Operator Morgan."
911 Operator:   "Hi, can you give me the address to Centennial Park?"
Cen Park:       "The address?"
911 Operator:   "Uh huh."
Cen Park:       "Uh, hold on a second."

1:06:30 a.m.:   911 operator notifies Communications Supervisor, Sgt.
Montgomery.

911 Operator:   "Does anybody -- Sgt. Montgomery, do you know the address of
Centennial Park? Do you know the address to Centennial Park.
Well, I need to get the address of Centennial Park 'cause, I
mean I don't mean to upset nobody, but we got a bomb threat
over there."

(Editor's note: The transcript does not further indicate whether this
comment about a bomb threat was directed only to Sgt. Montgomery in the
911 center or to Centennial Park's Operator Morgan, who is shown to come
back on the line just after the comment.)

Cen Park:       "Ma'am."
911 Operator:   "Yes."
Cen Park:       "OK, it's 145 International Boulevard."
911 Operator:   "145 International Boulevard."
Cen Park:       "Uh huh."
911 Operator:   "OK."
Cen Park:       "All right, uh huh."
911 Operator:   "Thank you. Bye bye."

1:08:35 a.m.:   911 operator sent call to dispatch.

1:11:10 a.m.:
Dispatcher:     "1591. Radio raising 1594."
Unit 1594:      "1594. You call?"

1:11:20 a.m.:
Dispatcher:     "1594, that's affirmative, got a Signal 73 at 145
International Boulevard. It came from the pay phone at
the Days Inn.  The caller is advising that he has one set
to go off in 30 minutes at Centennial Park. Sounded like
a white male."

(Editor's note: The same information is then given to Unit 1593 and the
dispatcher calls Unit1546.)

1:12:30 a.m.:
Dispatcher:     "Did you copy?"

1:12:40 a.m.:
Unit 1546:      "1546. I copy. Advise the state police, they police that park.
I'll go the Days Inn and see if I can locate the caller."
Dispatcher:     "OK, that's affirmative."


(Editor's note: There are sporadic entries over the next seven minutes.
Another officer,  designated Unit 1593, also instructs the dispatcher at
1:18:50 a.m. to "contact the state police supervisor." The transcript
contains no indication, however, that state police were notified.)

1:20:00 a.m.:
Unit 2924:      "2924 to Radio, be advised that something just blew up at
Olympic Park."

Bruce Sterling provides a very interesting summary of how the telephone
companies take care of software upgrades to switching systems in his book
_The Hacker Crackdown_.

The basic process is this: start with all of the switching stations with the
old software.  Outfit one station with the new software.  Watch it run for a
while and see what happens.  If it's broken, only a few (!)  people will be
out of phone power.  When it seems like it's working OK, add another
station.  When that one seems like it's working, add another station.  And
so on until all of the switches are outfitted with the new software.

The legendary Crash of 1990 happened when AT&amp;T had approximately 75%
of stations outfitted with new software, and the bug that caused the
crash could only cause a crash when a critical mass of stations had
the new software (and the new bug).

The recent discussion of seamless upgrades, and the idea that telephone
switches might never have been "booted" to begin with (having been
seamlessly upgraded over the years from their original mechanical
incarnations) reminded me of a similar situation.

This was when I worked for a large mainframe manufacturer (the adjective
applies to both the company and their products) in the mid-1980s.  I was
working with the folks who wrote the operating systems for these mainframes,
and we had roughly half a dozen machines used by various software
development projects (OS, compilers, databases, tools, etc.).  Many of these
machines were running early beta test versions of the operating system.
These machines could either be "cold booted", where a fresh operating system
image was loaded from tape to disk and various data structures on the disk
re-initialized, or "warm booted", where the current operating system image
was used, with the data structures as they were when the machine was
stopped.  Patches could be (and frequently were) applied to the operating
system image on disk, followed by a warm boot.

It turned out that no one was cold-booting the machines, because it took too
much time and effort.  It was discovered that some machines hadn't been
cold-booted for many months!  Typically, in that time, dozens of patches had
been installed, some of which might affect the cold-boot process.
Management announced that all machines would henceforth be cold-booted
weekly, to verify that they still could be.

The risk of a system that almost never needs to be taken down is that when
it does need to be taken down, it might be hard to bring it back up!  Or,
practice makes perfect?

1.  Upgrading a program is usually pretty easy -- the hard part is upgrading
the database it operates on.  It's amazing that 'program development
environments' spend all this effort on the program portion, and virtually
none on the database portion.  Common Lisp Object System (CLOS) is one of
the few systems that actually provides a smooth 'upgrade' mechanism in which
multiple versions of objects can simultaneously coexist, along with a 'lazy
upgrade' ability -- older objects can be automatically upgraded 'on sight'.

2.  Without rehashing all of the arguments for/against N-version again, I
just want to point out a few key ones against.  There are occasions where
_any_ decision is better than _no_ decision -- e.g., which side of an
obstacle to detour around; it usually doesn't matter, but you are guaranteed
to crash if you don't choose one.  Apparently, at least one crash (or
near-crash) of an experimental, statically-unstable NASA airplane occurred
when two different systems proposed two different answers, and the
supervisor system concluded that both subsystems must have malfunctioned,
thus causing the big red light on the pilot's console to come on ("total
computer system malfunction") (heresay from a conference lunch
conversation).  Another problem from the multiple language N-version efforts
(C/Fortran/Ada): a _good_ answer from -- e.g. -- the Ada implementation can
be outvoted by a _bad_ answer from -- e.g. -- the C and Fortran
implementations.

Several people have made the point that you can't classify bugs in advance
of fixing them and therefore can't make much in the way of useful
predictions of how long it will take to fix them.

This is quite true (although some very vague generalizations can be made.)

It would be more interesting, however, to measure the time it takes to fix
bugs in particular programs. Some programs are better designed than others.
Some of the time this translates into some programs being more debuggable
than others. (And sometimes it doesn't.) There are thousands of other
factors involved, but I suspect most of them are reasonably uniform for the
lifetime of a single project at a single company.

Thus you might be able to make some vague predictions for the time it takes
for the average bug in a specific program (well, code base, probably) to be
fixed.

Admittedly this is not especially useful for telephone companies and the
like, but it might work for an operating systems vendor. Or for customers
choosing software, if vendors could be convinced to disclose the data.

One would have to get some actual data to see if any statistically useful
conclusions can be drawn.

Last spring, I asked readers of RISKS for suggestions on alternatives to
Social Security numbers in organizations with large data bases of
information about individuals.  Many such organizations find they do not
need to use SSNs, and avoid privacy problems associated with using them.
For a copy of all of the responses, send a request to us and specify whether
you want hard copy or electronic edition of our August issue, and provide
postal address or e-mail address.

Excerpts from the suggestions follow:

* FROM WASHINGTON, D.C.: Maryland uses Soundex (of name and birth date
concatenated [linked in a chain]) both for driver and vehicle registrations.

* FROM CAMBRIDGE, MASS.: "Against Universal Health-Care Identifiers" in the
JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION 1:316-319, 1994, by
Dr. Peter Szolovits of MIT and Dr. Isaac Kohane of Children's Hospital in
Boston, discusses a number of ways in which cryptography- based health care
identifiers can be used to preserve privacy while remaining manageable for
typical medical purposes.  This is publication #49 (in Postscript format) at
<A HREF="http://medg.lcs.mit.edu/people/psz/publications.html">http://medg.lcs.mit.edu/people/psz/publications.html</A>.

* FROM YARDLEY, PA.: One way is to use a simple scheme like three letters
from last name, the first initial, and some digits; another is just to use
sequential numbers.  Another is an MD5 hash of the full-name string [a
one-way mathematical function as a stand-in for the name that makes
translation back to the original name impossible].  This is always unique
for a unique string, so you might need to add some numbers.

* FROM MADISON, WISC.: When I was working on the development of the
Wisconsin Student Data Handbook - we tried to develop
what we called an "SSN surrogate," also of nine bytes per
individual.  It involved an algorithm which combined year,
month, and date of birth with sex and two consonants each
extracted from the first and middle names.

* FROM CYBERSPACE: I worked with a banking software company that set up
employee records simply by exact hire date and time.  Since they never hired
anyone at exactly the same time, it gave each person a unique number.  You
could do the same for any data base in which records are added gradually one
at a time - just number them based on exact date and time added.

* FROM PALO ALTO, CAL.: At Stanford University we made a decision long ago
not to use SSN for identification except where required by law (payroll
taxes, for example).  We use a unique Stanford University ID (SUID), which
is a lifetime number and applies to all students, alumni, faculty, staff,
and patients.  It serves all the same purposes that the SSN would do if it
were used.

Johnsrude writes:

&gt;   This lack of protection distinguishes American law from most European
&gt;   democracies.  "Data protection" is an important part of European human
&gt;   rights law.

A very important point. In Germany, this was actually derived, in the
context of a census, from the constitutional right to freedom from injury by
the Bundesverfassungsgericht (sort-of-analogue of the US Supreme Court). The
laws that were made in response to this decision actually strive to handle
the problem at the correct point, IMO, namely when the data in question is
created.  And there is a distributed system of "watch dogs" whose annual
reports are widely discussed (if not always read).

However, I think the bulk of Johnsrude's contribution and the further
discussion in this thread misses a major point. The DMV database is quite
different from, say, VISA's or your favourite retailer's, in that the DMV
occupies a monopoly, and a publicly mandated one at that. If you don't like
the data handling procedures of whoever offers you a service, in general
there will be a competitor who might have better practices regarding your
objections.  Or you can make a purchase explicitly contingent on data
concerning it not being made available to others, and in the case of
infraction sue for breach of contract (of course, this entails other barrels
of worms, but that's a separate discussion). In the case of the DMV, there
is no alternative, because the DMV itself, as an issuer of drivers'
licenses, serves a public watchdog function, and the service it offers is
not in any practical sense optional, especially in wide parts of the United
States. Putting severe restrictions on the DMV's use of the data entrusted
to it is sensible, for any number of reasons; the technical problems in
distributing data to those that need to know (e.g., police officers) come up
in other situations as well and have well known solutions.

One of the root problems here is that, IMHO, the way legislative
responsibility has been divided in the USA is just crazy. The (I assume)
federally mandated inclusion of the SSN in state controlled DMV records,
without any clauses on how to protect this data, is a case in point; I
suppose this was foisted on the states in a similar way the drunk driving
rules were (according to urban legend, by making federal subsidies for the
interstates contingent on such legislation). Thus, responsibility is divided
- in a similar way later noted as being the result of the privatization of
the British rail network.

Not to hammer this point, but if DMV records are going to be readily and
speedily available to law enforcement agencies at the lowest level, e.g.,
deputy sheriffs and dispatchers in the smallest communities, as seems
necessary to me for rational police work, then as a practical matter these
records are not secure at all, at least not to any intruder with a modicum
of intelligence..

The RISK of thinking that DMV records are secure when in fact they're not
then seems worse to me than the benefits, if any, of thinking they are
secure.

We have discovered a security flaw in the current version (3.0) of
Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser running under Windows 95.  An attacker
could exploit the flaw to run any DOS command on the machine of an Explorer
user who visits the attacker's page.  For example, the attacker could read,
modify, or delete the victim's files, or insert a virus or backdoor entrance
into the victim's machine.  We have verified our discovery by creating a Web
page that deletes a file on the machine of any Explorer user who visits the
page.

The core of the attack is a technique for delivering a document to the
victim's browser while bypassing the security checks that would normally be
applied to the document.  If the document is, for example, a Microsoft Word
template, it could contain a macro that executes any DOS command.

Normally, before Explorer downloads a dangerous file like a Word document,
it displays a dialog box warning that the file might contain a virus or
other dangerous content, and asking the user whether to abort the download
or to proceed with the download anyway.  This gives the user a chance to
avoid the risk of a malicious document.  However, our technique allows an
attacker to deliver a document without triggering the dialog box.

Microsoft has been notified and they are working on fixing the problem.
Until a remedy is widely available, we will not disclose further details
about the flaw.

An AP dispatch out of Washington reported that IBM has won a government
contract to build the world's most powerful computer -- an
ultrasupercomputer that is 300 times faster than any machine now in use.
Energy Department officials, who announced the $94 million contract, said
the computer will be used to simulate nuclear explosions so the government
can test atomic bombs without actually blowing them up.  Energy Secretary
Hazel O'Leary said the new computer will be a "dramatic leapfrog" over
currently available technology.

I guess eliminating an actual explosion, or "rapid disassembly" as the Air
Force labels it, would reduce a lot of risks, wouldn't it?  Hmmmm.

I suspect we would soon be building weapons that would never work when the
real trigger was actually squeezed.

I also suppose the next logical step for the government would be to use the
new computer to test nuclear devices without actually building them.  Just
think how much safer the world would be.  It could also be used to compare
military forces of the world to determine which country wins a war without
actually fighting the war.  WoW, just think of all the lives that would
save.  Secretary O'Leary sure has my vote.  uh-huh!

Friends of mine have a remote-controlled gas fireplace in their new home.
It allows them to turn the gas fire on and off from across the room.
Special logs are used for a gas fire, but the fireplace is designed to burn
real logs, too.

One day, they came home to their empty house and found the fire was ON, but
the flue, which had to be manually controlled, was closed.  Since the flue
was closed, the smoke and flames from the real logs went into the house.
They were lucky -- just some localized fire and smoke damage -- but if the
fire had burned much longer, their home would be ashes.

The store says there have been similar incidents in the area.  Apparently,
some romote controlled toys operate on the same frequency.

A summary of some additional points on this topic brought up by
correspondents, identified by their initials, follows.

I mentioned several very useful capabilities that are not yet widespread or
going under common terminology. These are ranked below in order of
abstraction, complexity, cost, and degree of penetration. (With increasing
abstraction, greater cost and complexity, and fewer instances of its
implementation.) Note that complexity and cost are issues that relate to
both the design on one hand and use on the other.

1. Ease and seamlessness of switching between versions of code-- either
forward during an upgrade or backward when incompatibilities or bugs arise.
2. "Shadowing" new code so that it is run and checked against old code
before put on live.
3. Computer control over code versions based on automated reliability
measurements-- software that actually controls when new versions are
added after reliability tests are passed or failed.

DCB mentions that old Multics and ARPA systems both "did real-time updates
and rolled both forward and back between releases of components", with a
lecture given on the subject once by Paul Stachour. This appears to be an
instance of (1) and (3).

JWB complains of the cost and complexity of the above and suggests
implementing any of these features may actually make software more buggy in
the long run, and that trying to get to previously stable states may
actually be more difficult.

SK says that (1) is apparent in disk controller hardware and calls it "hot
swapping" of code.

HT says that "everything you describe [1-3] is regular practice in telephony
hardware and software" with the caveat that "you have to build systems from
the hardware up for this kind of [reliability]".  He describes a system by
Nortel: "essentially, yes, the system runs in shadow mode all the time,
often shadowing a release with a duplicate of itself, but sometimes
shadowing on a different release."  "Duplicated systems are complex and hard
to do right - they're also the bread-and-butter of telephony companies
everywhere.  Unfortunately, we don't blow our own horn as much as we
should."

MS says that NASA is investigating on an ongoing basis modular hardware and
software "hot swapping". Chorus Systems (France) is working with the
European Space Agency and all components are "hot swappable".

AF says "You have some great ideas here. I agree that a fundamental shift in
the way we think has merit. I have personally designed a software system
that is designed with field upgrade in mind from the ground up". He mentions
that in "closed loop system" however, it is far more difficult to directly
compare to versions of software because their results are supposed to be
divergent. I pointed out in a reply that software to measure whether this
divergence is moving in the "correct direction" (via shadowing) would also
tend to minimize upgrade glitches (in cases where the upgrade actually
degrades performance).

SR writes that the real problem we are trying to solve is "incorrect
software" and describes ways of improving software reliability before
installing it. I am obviously in favor of doing that to the greatest extent
possible, but feel that there is a point of diminishing marginal returns in
which exponential labor is spent in trying to remove the so-called "last
bug".  It is this view I was generally rejecting in the essay, by starting
from the idea that even well-intentioned designers who have done all the
reasonable testing possible cannot catch every bug. In fact I think the
terms "correctness" and "bugfree" are highly misleading as a black-and-white
view of a gray situation.  Is there a "correct" instance of a complex piece
of software anywhere in existence?

"Professionally, I feel that we need to ensure that software going out
is as correct as possible" sounds as compelling to me as a politician
stating, "I'm in favor of families." The major point of my essay was
that even the best of engineers make mistakes that cannot be detected
except in live use ("bugs happen"?), and paradoxically
when we finally learn to accept that, instead of constantly
pointing the finger at the engineer who made the mistake, we might begin to
create systems that work in spite of them.  I am increasingly skeptical
of the claim applied to every bug, "the designers didn't test thoroughly
enough"-- often it's too trivial an answer for too complex a situation.
In other words, sometimes the best solution is building a better mousetrap,
and other times it's figuring out how to make the existence of mice
less catastrophic.

The case I was focusing on my essay was the situation where software
*previously* works, and then *fails* to work in the same way
because of an upgrade. In this situation, *regardless* of designer
fault, ideally the end-user would have enough control to fall back to prior
base functionality gracefully. However, SR makes some very good points
about methods of improving reliability prior to delivery, including
considering the debugging and test code as an intrinsic part of the
delivery, something I strongly advocate. In fact if clients increasingly
began to ask prior to signing a contract, "what are you going to include
in the system itself to catch errant behavior" instead of focusing on
the resumes of the designers, we may all tend to be better off in
the long run.

WC mentions Ericsson's Erlang language containing some of these
ideas, designed to support high-availability systems like telephony:
<A HREF="http://www.ericsson.se/cslab/erlang/">http://www.ericsson.se/cslab/erlang/</A>


In general, from responses I would conclude large Internet and cyberspace
vendors may benefit significantly from studying techniques used in telephony
to ensure continued and stable operation even during upgrades. Also,
internet protocol designers may begin to look at telephony techniques for
advancement in the bulging-at-the-seams internet network traffic. In fact
the internet telephone software designers may eventually have to confront
the same issues that telephone designers did many decades ago.  Maybe future
conference organizers in both areas might consider this aspect of promising
cross-pollination.

In fact we appear to be in the beginning stages of the heralded
"convergence" in which telephony and internetworking are in the early pangs
of learning from each other prior to a merge into a unified cyberspace, with
AOL and others realizing they are becoming more and more like utility
services.  With everyone's hard work, hopefully in the end we'll get the
best of both worlds (reliability of telephony, flexibility of the internet)
instead of the worst of both (flexibility of telephony, reliability of the
internet)!

I am struck by the apparent lack of a single definitive reference on this
critical subject.  These techniques are spread out in aerospace, military,
telephony, and other niche and proprietary areas and would benefit immensely
from a systematic treatment by someone with a broad perspective. How about,
"Creating Fault Tolerant Systems". It would be a great Yin to the Yang of
the recent Risks book on the shelves by PGN. Any takers?

[Wouldn't it be great if someone wrote a journal that contained instances
of software and hardware etc. that correctly handled a very difficult
problem or catastrophic situation due to the ingenuity of the code?
studying it might actually improve the world even more than RISKS.  VZN]

I don't want to turn Risks Digest into a platform for political discussion
on the privatisation of the British railway (BR) system, but there are
background points worth making to put recent contributions in context.

The original item (<A HREF="/Risks/18.32.html">RISKS-18.32</A>) was based on a thin US newspaper report and
the contributor commented that Risks Digest had a number of examples of rail
incidents in London.  This comment needs to be put into context.  These
incidents involved three separate systems: British Rail (BR), what we think
of in the UK as "the railways", London Underground - London's subway system
- and Docklands Light Railway, DLR, a new, small, overhead system serving
redeveloped dock areas in East London whose teething problems with systems
and software have attracted perhaps excessive attention.  BR, the national
railway sstem has not had all that many accidents/incidents in the London
area.  Of the ones explicitly identified with London there was one major
one, some years ago now, the Clapham (sic - it was actually nowhere near
Clapham) rail disaster due essentially to faulty wiring in a signal display.
This was entirely relevant to Risks Digest.  But I don't remember many/any
other system related incidents on the BR network in or near London.  There
have been mechanical failure incidents, eg brake failures, with one death.

Alastair Scott's contribution (18.34) seems to be a fair summary of what is
currently known about the train crash outside Watford.  The comments on the
apparently greater safety of the modern rolling stock design are interesting.
There seems little doubt that, given the "black boxes", the survival of the
drivers and the Health and Safety Executive enquiry (required by law in the
case of any fatal rail crash, I believe) we should get reasonably reliable,
and quick, conclusions about what went wrong.

But I thought Jim Reid's contribution less helpful.  I'm a rail traveller
and share his scepticism about the privatisation of Britain's railway system
and the incredibly complex structure of franchises, leases, service
companies and operating companies and leasing companies which it has
spawned.  But that is no reason to suspend ordinary principles of
objectivity.  There was no indication from anyone, and no serious
allegation, that any factor in the latest crash resulted from or was
exacerbated by the privatisation of the British Rail system or doubts or
uncertainties about responsibilities or boundaries between the various
companies involved. There were lots of transient problems of that sort as
new structures were put into place (I remember, in 1994, days of frustrating
buck passing betwen station operators and train operators as I simply tried
to find out who was responsible for property lost on one particular train -
I never did get back that CCTA digest on writing information system
strategies) but they were transient.  There are still some issues of concern
but I hear of few serious doubts that safety operations are not
co-ordinated.  Jim Reid's points, except for one unreferenced anecdote about
how very junior staff handled a small fire, are simply assertions and
expressions of opinion about what is happening and how the companies
involved are behaving.  The role of the Health and Safety Executive, which
enquires into accidents, is clearly defined in statute.

Non UK readers may also get the impression from Jim Reid that the absence of
ATP is a consequence of cost-paring decisions by private companies.
Clearly, decisions not to install ATP after privatisation are theirs, but
they follow a long history of low investment in the state owned system.
Given the system they bought it is not unreasonable that the new owners
should, in making safety related investments, go for the best value.  If the
statistic quoted by Alastair Scott is valid then new rolling stock might
well be a better investment, both in safety terms and commercially, than
ATP.  Again, Jim Reid's comments on the investment strategies of the new
privatised system are as yet predictions, not descriptions.

Finally, Jim Reid's comments on the ATP/rolling stock choice appear to query
the concept that investment in risk avoidance can reasonably use cost
benefit comparisons.  Well, surely, that is what risk management is all
about?  We all do it individually, and qualitatively, in our decisions on
safety in our homes and cars.  Some people have formal risk management
responsibilities: eg transport operators of all sorts, highway designers,
power operators, air traffic control organisations.  They have limited
investment budgets and are constantly having to balance safety and
commercial considerations in making their choices. They do this
quantitatively and formally and, in the public sector usually on the record
- and have done for decades. Assigning a value to lives potentially saved is
part of this process.  Risk elimination is ideal - but seldom affordable.

There were two long items in RISKS about this crash. Both, I am afraid,
present a distortion of the facts.

&gt;What happened was that a train from Euston to Milton Keynes with about 400
&gt;passengers on board was travelling North at about 60mph. Another empty
&gt;train, which should have been waiting at a red signal just outside Watford
&gt;Junction, started moving slowly South and crossed over a set of points onto
&gt;the North-bound fast line straight into the path of the fast train.

Given the layout of track here, *if* the signalling was operating
correctly, then this cannot be a correct explanation. The actual layout
is roughly:

&gt;-----------------------*--------------------------------&gt; NB fast
\
&lt;====================*----*---*--------------------------&lt; SB fast
\    A   \
&gt;----########&gt;+S+++++++*=+=*++++*++++++++++++++++++++++++&gt; NB slow
Passenger              \
&lt;----------------------------*========T=&lt;########--------&lt; SB slow
A            Empty

The intended route of the passenger train is shown as ++++, and that of
the empty one as ====.

The important point (sorry) is the pair of points labelled A. These always
move together. If these points were set correctly for the passenger train
and the empty train had passed signal T at Danger, then it would have run
along the slow line and no accident would have occurred. But clearly AA
(which is where the collision happened) was set for the empty train, and the
passenger train passed signal S at Danger.

*IF* the signals were working correctly, then the facts tell us that the
route was set for the empty train, and the passenger train passed a
Danger signal. It is still possible that the empty also passed a Danger
signal, but we can't tell that from the evidence presented so far.

&gt;"Black boxes" were recovered from both crashed trains, and showed that
&gt;signalling and train systems were working properly just before the crash.

In which case the passenger train driver is primarily at fault.

&gt;It was a huge stroke of luck that the collision involved new rolling stock:
&gt;on some other lines carriages are 30 or 40 years old and are of an antique
&gt;"slam-door" design which concertinas in the event of a crash.

Concertinaing, as a problem, was largely eliminated in the 1950s and
1960s. While it is true that these were slam door trains, that is not
relevant to the issues.

&gt;  I have read
&gt;that, of about 70 deaths on the United Kingdom railways in the past 10
&gt;years, all but one have occurred in these older carriages.

Yes. But over half these numbers are due to a *single* event - the double
collision near Clapham Junction. And there it was not concertinaing that
caused the deaths, but the speed of the first collision followed by another
train ploughing through the wreckage. And a good number of those left are
due to people falling out of open doors.  In other words, this statistic
says nothing about the crashworthiness of these trains.

[Regarding Clapham, please recall an item in <A HREF="/Risks/8.01.html">RISKS-8.01</A> from Clive via
Mark Brader, and another later one in <A HREF="/Risks/8.85.html">RISKS-8.85</A> from Jon Jacky.  PGN]

&gt;A number of risks have emerged from the recent crash. The first concerns
&gt;Automatic Train Protection, ATP. This system is claimed to stop any train
&gt;which passes a red signal. It is not used on the British railway network,
&gt;though it is deployed on other European railways. [Apologies to any
&gt;trainspotters for any simplification I've made.] The UK railway companies
&gt;say that ATP is too expensive - it costs too much for each life it saves,
&gt;though how they work that out is beyond me. (Another risk?)

This is actually fairly simple to determine. The costs of complete ATP
installation are known. A record is kept of all accidents and their
causes, and so it is simple to determine how many lives and injuries
would not have happened in (say) the last 20 years if ATP had been
installed at each place. Divide.

&gt; They claim that
&gt;the money required for ATP would be better spent on other safety measures
&gt;like modern, stronger passenger carriages. So, rather than prevent trains
&gt;crashing into each other, they think the best strategy is to let them crash,
&gt;but make the rolling stock safer. (Yet another risk?)

Not all accidents would be prevented by ATP - apart from anything else,
ATP failure is an extra possible *cause* of accidents. The calculation
is more like this (numbers are illustrative, not exact):

ATP installation costs 400 million pounds and saves 10 lives.
Anticlimber installation costs 30 million pounds and saves 15 lives.

Which is the better spend ? Especially given that the government has
reneged on its promise to fund ATP.

&gt;The next risk is the absurd way in which Britain's railways are now run
&gt;after privatisation.

Unfortunately all too true.

&gt;For the leasing companies, repainting old trains is more cost
&gt;effective than buying new ones which presumably have better safety features.
&gt;For the operating companies, the cost of leasing is one of the few costs
&gt;they can control. [They can also work their drivers harder, but that will be
&gt;another safety risk.] Thus, they prefer to run old, less safe, trains
&gt;because they are cheaper to lease than new ones.

Not necessarily the case. In particular, the leasing prices were set so
that the cost of old trains was the same as that of new ones; it is
claimed that this will encourage investment in new trains, as operators
will prefer them.

There is one piece of information which does not seem to have made
it into general circulation regarding the crash.

The northbound train (with the passengers) was the 17:04 which left on time.
The preceding northbound train (16:54) was delayed by over 6 minutes which
meant the southbound (empty) train would have been delayed by at least that
in crossing over onto the other line.

Given the relative scarcity of knowledge about data and communications
security, it seems rather odd to find a security book which comes right out,
first thing, and say that it is not intended to be tutorial.  However,
Oppliger does not spend much time on the basics.  (There is a general
introduction to security terminology and techniques, but only one chapter.)
The emphasis of the book is on the explanation, review, and comparison of
various systems for ensuring the security of communications within a network
over which the security of physical links may be in doubt.

The systems covered include Kerberos, NetSP (Network Security Program), SPX
(Sphinx), TESS (The Exponential Security System), SESAME (Secure European
System for Applications in a Multivendor Environment), and OSF DCE (Open
Software Foundation's Distributed Computing Environment).  Kerberos get the
most space, probably since most of the rest are variously expansions or
refinements of the basic Kerberos concepts.  The examinations are detailed,
although not to the level necessary for implementation, and the overview
looks into individual strengths and weaknesses.  A final chapter does a side
by side comparison of the systems in terms of functions, cryptographic
techniques, standardization, availability, and exportability.

An unusual kind of Internet chess game will be held next week in Finland,
sponsored by Telecom Finland.  Anatoly Karpov will be pitted against the
consensus of a collection of on-line participants, estimated to be around
50,000 in number, where after each of Karpov's moves the wannabes get 10
minutes of real time to think, and a Telecom computer will pick the most
popular move.  Check out <A HREF="http://www.tele.fi/karpov">http://www.tele.fi/karpov</A> for details.

What are the risks?

1. What if 100,000 opponents show up and overwhelm the website?

2. Will a dumbed-down consensus result?  Can a few master-level players
have any impact over a horde of average players?

3. How can any coherent strategy emerge from such a consensus strategy?

4. Could the resulting somewhat randomized strategy actually be more
effective than a more coherent strategy?  (Garry Kasparov had an
interesting time figuring out IBM's Deep Blue strategy, and beat it
with a less coherent approach than he might normally have taken.
See <A HREF="/Risks/17.79.html">RISKS-17.79</A>.)

5. Could Kasparov hack his way into tele.fi and reprogram the software
so that only HIS move was tabulated?  Certainly the organizers could
do that, but it would spoil the fun.

6. Could Karpov use a Finnish anonymizer and then, if he lost, repudiate
the results by claiming it was really Kasparov who was playing?

I received a press call this morning asking about Social Security Numbers
and database privacy in general, from a journalist covering a story that
should have happened years ago.

A US Congressman running for Governor of New Hampshire was found to have
two SSNs by local journalists, who ran a story on it. (It's illegal to
obtain 2 SSNs in most circumstances, so one supposes this seemed newsworthy).
After the story ran, it turned out that the other SSN belonged to a teenager,
and that the legislator had been assigned the number (presumably in some
marketing or DMV or other error-prone database) by mistake. Despite the
situation not being the legislator's fault, his chances for election to
the Governor post have been damaged by the bad reportage, possibly ruined.

At this point, I don't have the name of the legislator, nor of the paper
and journalist(s) who reported on this.


Many obvious RISKs that have come up before plenty of times in RISKS:

1) SSNs are not a good system - they are neither truly unique
identifiers, nor is the system even close to immune from errors or fraud.

2) Even "minor" data entry errors in databases of personally identifiable
information can ruin careers and otherwise wreck people's lives, but there's
not really any easy way to detect these errors or to fix them until they
cause a personal, or sometimes far broader, catastrophe.

3) There is no real accountability, even aside from privacy issues. State
laws are scattershot and disparate, affording little privacy protection
and even less recourse when negligence wreaks havoc. They are so
different from state to state that even an industry-generated code of
conduct doesn't arise. At the federal level, it's even worse.

4) Reporting on technical topics, like information held in databases, can
be rapidly screwed up if the reporters do not take care to get the facts,
but simply report what seems obvious on the surface. (C.f. Time's
"Cyberporn" cover story for another infamous example.)

5) Blind trust in technology - "the computer is always right" - can lead to
quite harmful mistakes. It appears that the reporters who jumped on this
story accepted it as a given that the legislator had obtained two SSNs
for some nefarious purpose, and missed the far more likely possibility:
data entry error by a third party.

[This is based on what I've been told about these events and the
reportage of them. I have yet to see the original articles, though I
expect to get them shortly.  So, some of this criticism is best considered
hypothetical, until I do have the articles.  I cannot, of course, be
certain of the accuracy of the characterization by one journalist of
another and his/her work.]

As for why I say this should have happened a long time ago, this is the
first time I've heard of something like this happening to a policymaker.
Hopefully the nature of the problem will sink in and we'll see some action
to establish accountability and privacy-protection requirements.  At very
least, the dismal failure of the SSN may become more apparent to Congress,
who have simply not appeared to grasp the nature of the problems to date.
The new crypto-awareness on the Hill could use a strong booster shot of
general privacy awareness.

Subject: Warning from Family Circle Magazine

Got this amusing/disturbing press release from *Family Circle Magazine*,
apparently to promote an upcoming article. It reads:

&gt;CERTAIN COMPUTER FILE LETTERS INDICATE PORNOGRAPHY: POLICE CHIEF
&gt;
&gt;New York -- Parents can safeguard their children against pornography on
&gt;the internet by watching for files stored on a computer's hard drive or
&gt;diskettes that end in the letters -PCX, -GIF, -GL, TIF, or -JPG, according
&gt;to the current (September 17) issue of Family Circle.  "Those are the
&gt;graphic image files that may be pornographic, and parents should know what
&gt;they illustrate," says Police Chief Alfred Olsen, who monitors online
&gt;predators in Pennsylvania.

I'm surprise that TXT was left out, which of course is the format used to
distribute sexually explicit words as well.

Two items from the recent news:

1) The August 7th edition of the WSJ has a front page story on the divorce
of cellular phone king, Craig McCaw. Here's the salient phrase, "... Mr.
McCaw says in an interview via a wire-line phone to which he entrusts all
sensitive conversations because he is leery of eavesdropping on his cellular
calls." Given that the call was at least partly on the record, I wonder how
he handles his truly sensitive calls.

2) The August 20th edition of the NYT describes the effects of the recent
settlement between NASDAQ and the SEC. The NASDAQ marketplace is essentially
a computer network that links a group of dealers who use the system to make
announcements like "I want to buy Microsoft for 92 dollars/share." A
brokerage firm will often make a profit on the difference and not pass it on
to their customers. If someone breaks the spread, all of the brokers suffer
but the customers generally gain a small advantage. The SEC now has audio
tapes of some dealers using collusion and social pressure to keep the
spreads up between the price the shares are offered to buy and sell.

There is also another market ran by Reuters known as "Instinet" and it is
anonymous. No one knows who is offering to buy and sell shares. If someone
breaks from the pack and starts offering slightly more money for a
particular issue, there is no easy way for the dealers to retaliate. It's
all anonymous. The article suggests that prices are often fairer for the
people who use Instinet. Of course it is only open to big folks like
institutional investors. Presumably it is not truly anonymous and the SEC
could unwind the trades if it wanted to investigate, say, insider trading.

&gt;We have discovered a security flaw in the current version (3.0) of
&gt;Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser running under Windows 95.  An
&gt;attacker could exploit the flaw to run any DOS command on the machine
&gt;of an Explorer user who visits the attacker's page.

We now post the virus warning dialog on local files (file: urls).  We have
always posted it on remote files (http: urls).  Note that the root of the
problem is not Java or the browser, but in macro-enabled applications.  IE3
has a mechanism to warn users about safety of documents when used with
common macro-enabled applications.  We are have updated Microsoft Word such
that by default it will not run macros embedded in documents.

People can't tinker with software either these days ... for example,
there is no programming language supplied with Windows 95.

&gt;From this, a RISK is that a program of any degree of triviality may be seen
by a lay person as miraculous. I wrote a Word for Windows macro to generate
chess board positions out of sheer necessity - I needed pictures for a
magazine article I was writing and no software I had could generate them
easily. I then realised that my macro might be useful to other people. So I
uploaded it to an archive site - and the response was phenomenal, with
emails coming in by the dozen praising what I have done. Yet the macro is
made up of about fifty lines of code, there are no devious tricks and the
algorithm used to generate the chess board from user input is relatively
simple. I am a software engineer; if I was incapable of writing such a macro
I would wonder whether I was fit to be called a software engineer.

Who was it who wrote that "any sufficiently advanced technology is
indistinguishable from magic"? They are right, and they are becoming more
than right.

Frank Ferguson &lt;<A HREF="mailto:ferguson@dmapub.dma.org">ferguson@dmapub.dma.org</A>&gt; notes in RISKS DIGEST 18.36 that
the U.S. Department Of Energy has signed a US$94M deal with IBM to develop
a new supercomputer designed specifically to simulate nuclear explosions.
Frank's conclusions, however, don't follow.

The U.S. DOE is almost certainly the worlds' largest consumer of high-speed
computers used for simulation, and has in fact been instrumental in the
funding and development of these computers.  Richard Rhodes' books on
the development and construction of the first A and H bombs makes this
abundantly clear, as do many other books on the subject, and others on
other subjects (e.g., Richard Feynman's book that mentions his activities
during WWII).  Many U.S. DOE atomic labs already have large supercomputer
centers devoted to simulation.

While the purpose of the computers is to simulate nuclear events, their
intended purpose is not generally to eliminate all nuclear tests.  The
computer codes are worth discussion.  They are, as a former chairman of
CDC noted in a speech many years ago, the human race's best understanding
of nuclear events.  As a result, these codes are highly classified.  A
great many complex, coupled, and inter-related phenomena occur during an
explosion.  Among them are radiative, particle, and shock phenomena.  The
need for models of these phenomena was probably first determined by Hans
Bethe, several years before the first A bomb explosion, and it was also
he who first developed the idea of Monte Carlo (probabalistic) simulation.

While the physics of each individual aspect of a detonation is well
understood, their coupling is very complex.  E.g., radiative opacity
is determined in part by temperature, which is affected by radiative
and particle absorption.  Many of the constants affecting these
phenomena and their couplings cannot be determined accurately by
a priori computation, and must be measured or approximated.

As a result, the computer models are the only way, other than actually
detonating a device, of accurately estimating the yield and efficiency
of a new design.  In complementary fashion, the only way of reliably
improving the accuracy of the simulation codes is fashioning devices
and measurement equipment and testing them.  This is in fact done.

Indeed, I have been given to understand by several knowledgeable people
that the purpose of nuclear tests is most often to verify improvements to
the computer models.  It is a deep-rooted need of humans to understand
the universe.  The codes modeling the detonation of nuclear devices would
appear to be monuments to this (cold-war fear, too, I imagine).  The rapid
development of the neutron bomb (er, "enhanced radiation device") would
appear to be a testament to the reliability and accuracy of these codes.
Certainly, the current efficiency of nuclear devices is such that extinction
of the human race can be safely assured, if such a goal is considered
desirable.  It becomes perhaps questionable, then, what additional
sophistication in the simulation and design of nuclear devices is intended
to accomplish, beyond satisfying this curiosity.

The risk is slight that the U.S. will design, build, and deploy nuclear
devices that fail to work due to failures of the computer models.  Fear
that physical/computer models might not be reliable was definitely
responsible for tests of cruder-than-necessary bombs (e.g., the USSR's
first A and H bombs, and several early U.S. devices (see Rhodes' books)).

The risk seems many orders of magnitude greater that, due to test bans,
the U.S. will spend large sums of money simulating and designing nuclear
devices that it cannot test, manufacture, or deploy.  In the absence of
test ban treaties, the risk is that the U.S. will detonate additional
devices to verify the more complex models that the faster computers will
allow (highly probable).

In <A HREF="/Risks/18.36.html">RISKS-18.36</A> Frank C. Ferguson &lt;<A HREF="mailto:ferguson@dmapub.dma.org">ferguson@dmapub.dma.org</A>&gt; takes some
issue with the idea of relying on computers to design nuclear weapons.
He writes in part:
&gt;I guess eliminating an actual explosion, or "rapid disassembly" as the Air
&gt;Force labels it, would reduce a lot of risks, wouldn't it?  Hmmmm.
&gt;
&gt;I suspect we would soon be building weapons that would never work when the
&gt;real trigger was actually squeezed.

Computers are useful for many simulations related to nuclear weapons
other than designing clever little devices that rapidly disassemble in
spectacular ways. A few examples are:

a. predicting the destructiveness of a particular device with known
characteristics (determined by testing) when used in a particular area.
b. predicting the fallout in various geographic areas and weather conditions.
c. finding out what happens if a device is accidentally smashed, eg.
is unintentionally dropped from a plane (this has happened many times!),
does it blow up or is the bomb stuff contained?
d. performing fusion energy experiments prior to building the apparatus.
e. refining existing designs and exploring completely new concepts.

Many tasks involve taking known weapons and exploring their behavior in
situations where real testing is impossible. Even if the US stopped all
weapons design, there would have to be a lot of simulation just to
explore the capabilities, limitations, and safety related issues of the
current stockpile.

I recently pointed out how the plot of the movie _The Running Man_ was
the same as a something suggested here in RISKS.  So I cannot avoid
mentioning:

&gt;&gt; to use the new computer ... to determine which country wins a war without
&gt;&gt; actually fighting the war.

The original Star Trek episode "A Taste of Armaggedon" was based on exactly
this premise.  There is nothing new under the sun...

[In response to Jonathan Kamens noting Star Trek was 30 years ago.]

Actually I think the ancient Chinese were the first.  They simply assembled
opposing armies on opposite hilltops while the intermediaries met in the
valley.  They decided which army was most likely to win and then they all
returned home.

Further to David Holland's comments...

Here (at Siemens Nixdorf Informationssysteme) incoming bug-reports
are classified 1 through 4 in severity level as perceived by the user.
They are also classified according the department responsible for the
code (1 through N). For each of these 4*N classes we have the historical
statistical distributions of (inter alia) bug fix times and bug densities
as well as improvement trends (and some other correlations ;-)

Inasmuch as one is able to predict the future statistically from the past,
we are able to say something like "There is a (50/90/99%) chance that this
bug will be fixed within time T".

I don't think you can do much better than this in the long run. I tried
training a neural net last year, but the prediction accuracy doesn't seem to
be much better (usual statistical test).

We have had a request from a client to rerun the training course on how to
start a system we delivered to them. It hasn't stopped for 18 months and
they have lost confidence that they can restart it if they need to do so.

So, it isn't only systems that get patched and warm-booted that lose the
ability to be cold-booted.

Is this a risk arising from delivering high-quality software?

Wrong Computer Command Led to Colombia Crash of American Airlines Boeing 757

American Airlines has noted that the pilots of the December 1995 crash of
Flight 965 were lost at the time, and attributed the crash to the captain
entering a computer command that steered the plane in the opposite
direction.  Unfortunately, the one-letter code for Cali on the flight chart
they were using was the same as the one-letter for Bogota, and caused the
plane to fly into a mountain, killing 159 of the 163 people aboard.  Pilots
have been alerted as to the discrepancies.  (Most airline computers use
different codes for the two cities.)

An uncoordinated software change cost $39 million, as reported in
"Inside the Air Force", July 5, 1996, page 10:

"Lockheed Martin and Boeing completed negotiations last week on how to
split the team's share of the $39 million cost of replacing the high-altitude
unmanned aerial vehicle [UAV] which crashed in April near Edwards AFB, CA.
The partners will split equally what could be a $6 million to $12 million
bill from the Pentagon for the destroyed DarkStar, the same proportion
by which it divides the workshare of building the UAVs.
The first flying DarkStar crashed shortly after take off from Edwards
on April 22, resulting in the total loss of the air vehicle, the only
flight test asset available at the time.
Although finger pointing has been assiduously avoided by both companies,
industry and Air Force sources said the crash was the result of Boeing
having adjusted software controlling flight on the UAV without commensurate
changes being made in the system by Lockheed Martin's Skunk Works division.
`The left hand didn't know what the right hand was doing,' a source said.
However, the problem has been addressed and the program should be back on
track shortly, pending the approval by the companies' lawyers of the terms
of splitting the cost for the crash.
A May 16 letter to Rep. John Murtha (D-PA), the ranking minority member
of the House Appropriations national security subcommittee, from Defense
Airbourne Reconnaissance Office chief Maj. Gen. Kenneth Israel tagged the
cost of rapidly configuring another DarkStar UAV for flight and making up
lost time in the program at $39 million."

I run a mail + news server at my home, serving only a few people but to these
the ability to receive and send e-mail is quite important.

Recently I had to leave home for a couple of weeks.
I spent a lot of time before to make the system quite fail safe, especially so
it could handle some tasks that I otherwise do manually. While I was away, it
worked more reliably than at any time before. Until one day. It was not
accessible anymore. I could not even call into a backup PC which was there
just to provide at least the ability to reboot the server system.

Why ? The wheel in the electric meter (a 35 or more years old
electromechanical device) used for counting the power consumed by the system,
somehow stopped rotating. I assume due to a problem in the bearing it was not
able to restart rotating after a simple power blackout (it restarted after
giving it a slap, manually). Well, this meter was designed to limit the
current to whatever it could count. Thus, no rotation, no current.

I understood that I'm responsible for the reliable operation of the PC hard-
and software, and I can rely on the power supplied by my PSC. But I forgot
there was one important device between their output and my system.

A mailing list I subscribe to started sending an endless loop of bounce
messages and another subscriber forwarded the following as explanation. I
have not verified the authenticity of the message with Netcom, but I have no
reason to doubt it. There are two denial of service attacks here: A person
was email bombed by someone who subscribed him to many mailing lists, and
then that person retaliated by bringing down the mailing lists.  Once again
we see an old problem that could have been prevented had the system
administrators simply configured known security measures before their system
was hacked.

Outgoing mail from Netcom mailing lists is temporarily being delayed
due to a mail looping problem, starting at 5:30 PM PDT today.

The problem was caused by a user at another site; someone subscribed
him to many Netcom mailing lists, and he responded by creating an
infinite loop of "bounce messages" to all the list subscribers.  List
mail is being queued until we can filter out these error messages.

Netcom is currently in the process of upgrading majordomo, and we hope
to implement improved security for all our lists.  In the interim, we
strongly recommend that listowners set their lists to "closed"; this
protects against all mass-subscription attacks.

Delivery of list mail should resume later this evening.  Thank you for
your patience.

The following describes DNS meltdown at my ISP the other day: all DNS
services were unavailable, despite multiple servers being online. Lack of
DNS assured that other working services were unavailable to everyone who
didn't have IP addresses written down.

Here is a technical explanation of the DNS failure, for those of you
interested.

First, a synopsis of how DNS works... every site on the net serves their
own DNS records.  Some sites serve other people's DNS records.  For
example, BEST serves the DNS records for best.com, best.net, and most
of our customer's custom domains.  No site serves more then a small
fraction of the DNS records on the internet from their own database.

The way DNS works is that when a domain name needs to be resolved, our
DNS server (anyone's DNS server) first goes to the NIC to ask where to
go to resolve the domain name.  The NIC itself cannot resolve domains,
it can only tell our DNS server where to go to resolve a domain.

Our DNS server then goes to the specified remote site to resolve the
domain name belonging to that site. The remote site replies with the
answer which our DNS server (a) caches for future reference, and
(b) returns to the original requester.

The caching is important, because otherwise a DNS server would have to
re-query the remote DNS server every time someone wanted to resolve a
domain.  DNS records propagate through caches.  It is simply not possible
to run a DNS system with caching turned off, it would create an impossible
load on the internet.

Around 4:00 a.m. yesterday, some unknown site's cache got corrupted.
The corruption propagated to many (hundreds) of other sites on the internet
and eventually propagated to us.  This corruption hit a bug in the DNS
server program that wound up corrupting the program, causing DNS to
loose major records.

Restarting the server in this case does not solve the problem because,
due to the caching on remote sites, the corrupted record repropagates
almost instantly.  BEST was hit by this problem very hard due to the
large number of custom domains we serve... so many DNS requests come into
BEST and are made by BEST that our servers would hit the corruption out
on the internet within 10 seconds of starting up.

Worse, this particular corruption tended to destroy the root records
(stored in memory), called SOA records, for the domains served locally.
This destroyed the mail system causing mail messages to bounce rather then
to simply be delayed, because the DNS server was saying 'site X does
not exist' rather then timing out.  It's worst possible corruption that
can occur in a DNS system.

--

It turns out that the last two BIND releases contain a bug that,
when a corrupted record of the type that started propagating at 4:00 a.m.
is received, results in the destruction of other **unassociated**
records stored in memory.

The particular release of BIND that we were using had been running
perfectly for several *months* before this incident.  It was not something
recently installed.

There are two fixes to the problem:  (1) One can lock out those sites
where the corrupted records come from, and (2) One can revert to an older
release.  (1) is not a good solution because, due to the nature of DNS,
corruption can propagate to many sites and it would be impossible to keep
up to date and lock all of them out.  We wound up taking action #(2)
and reverting to an older release of bind which, fortunately, did not
have the bug that caused the problem.  We had to revert to BIND 4.9.3.
Unfortunately, we did not think to do this for many hours because we were
all convinced that the problem was external in nature and just didn't
think to try a reversion.  In hind sight, that is the first thing we
should have tried since we had the friggin binary for the older version
sitting in our source tree.

As far as DNS goes... the DNS we run is not 'bsd' or 'sgi' .. it's the
*official* world-wide BIND distribution run by Paul Vixie.  It is really
not appropriate to run the older versions shipped with most operating
systems due to massive, massive security holes.  The corruption problem
was unavoidable.  What *was* avoidable was the long period of time that
elapsed before the problem got fixed, which I take full responsibility for.
We spent most of that time trying to track down where the corruption was
coming from... a near impossible task.  Around 6:00 p.m. scuttlebutt
started propagating regarding a possible bug in the last two BIND releases
at which point we instantly reverted to an earlier version, which fixed
the problem, then started banging our heads against the wall for not trying
it earlier.

Early last week, the Nashua, NH *Telegraph* ran a front page story about
U.S. Congress Bill Zeliff, who is current running for Governor of NH.  The
story asserted that the paper had discovered that the Honorable Mr. Zeliff
was registered for two SS numbers.  The excerpts I have seen from the
article indicated that the reporters from the newspaper had contacted two
`out of state' database firms that collect information from various sources
and make it available to various parties.  The data showed two SSN numbers
for Mr. Zeliff, one that was clearly his and one that looked to have been
created rather more recently.

The next day, the headline was something to the effect that the two numbers
might in fact be a database error, and included quotes from the database
firms saying that errors in these databases were common, and that they are
not responsible for errors - the errors are in the submitting systems, not
theirs.  Their was an interesting quote from one of the spokesman, something
to the effect of "The press shouldn't have access to our system".  In the
meantime the Mr. Zeliff has asked for apologies, etc.

By the third day the duplicate entry was definitely declared a mistake.

Interestingly, the influential (and decidely Anti-Zeliff) *Union Leader*
newspaper of Manchester, NH. decided to stay out of the fray, running only a
small sidebar on the issue the second day and one or two short editorials,
all of which showed amazing restraint.  (The *Union Leader* has an extremely
conservative editorial position and has the widest circulation in the state;
its statewide influence is considered to be *powerful* by most political
observers.)  Yesterday's Sunday Edition of the *Union Leader* also included
a discussion of the *risks* of such electronic databases; the article
mentions EFF and other 'privacy' advocates prominently.

As for the damage to Mr. Zeliff's election chances, the results are still
unclear, but seem minimal.  His main competitor in the Republican primary
did not make an issue of the problem, choosing instead to continue harping
on a ``fact-finding'' mission Mr. Zeliff made to South America last Winter
(at taxpayers expense, of course).

[I apologize for the sketchiness of this report: I have the newspapers at
home and should be able to substantiate some of the more relevant facts when
I get home this evening.]

Thomas Reardon of Microsoft points out that Internet Explorer 3.0 now
includes a warning of "suspect" software.  The Risk here is that this
warning is far too broad. That is you seem to get the warning for almost
everything.  Thus the typical user will almost certainly get into the habit
of pressing the Yes button every time - just as he/she already does on all
the idiot "are you sure" prompts.  The warning by itself is thus useless.
Another Risk is that the user can't distinguish between Intranet and
Internet usage. If we assume that on the Intranet he is allowed to download
ActiveX modules because they are considered safe there, but now (sorry NOT)
allowed to download ActiveX bits from the Internet, how is he able to tell
them apart. The browser certainly doesn't.  Mike Walsh, Pohjola, Finland

This is just an editorial opinion from a non-editor of risks.  We see
increasing numbers of security holes formed from what would appear to be
minor design or implementation flaws in systems - particularly in the
user-level programs running on those systems.  Perhaps the real problem
comes from not using trusted systems. Some examples:

Java allows access to user files:
A trusted system could prevent this regardless of any
flaws in Java. Just provide it with a private area.

Bash error allows character code ff to act as a separator:
A proper trusted system would not allow you to exploit this
to any advantage.

Explorer error lets you overwrite system and other files:
Again a trusted system would eliminate the problem.

Perhaps the real problem we face has to do with the lack of interest by the
community in using technologies that we know about and that are highly
effective in preventing a wide range of threats.  Instead of building on the
work of others, people keep on starting from scratch and making the same
mistakes again and again.

For a long time, I've been coming to the conclusion that one of the biggest
RISKS in computing (and, since that's starting to touch every aspect of our
lives, everything else), is an excessive degree of integration.  It
increases system complexity (read: bugginess) exponentially for often
negligible benefits.

A couple of items in <A HREF="/Risks/18.36.html">RISKS-18.36</A> bring this home:

&gt; before Explorer downloads a dangerous file like a Word document,

Sorry ?  A Word document is dangerous ?  Ah yes - when you run it, an
auto-start macro buried in the document itself might get DOS to format your
hard disk... Why do the 99% of users who just want to edit a letter have to
risk their entire system integrity for what is basically a gee-whiz feature
?

(Does Word have some way to load documents without executing any auto-start
macros ?  Or would that be too complex because users could turn it off and
then forget they'd done it when they _needed_ to run an autostart macro ?)

&gt; Friends of mine have a remote-controlled gas fireplace in their new home.

I tested this statement on several colleagues (all computer people).  They
all thought it was either (a) "hugely funny" or (b) "absolutely terrifying".

Typical reactions in the respective categories were

(a) "who's so lazy that they want a real, old-fashioned-style,
back-to-nature log[-effect] fire, but can't be bothered do something
old-fashioned like getting their b*tt [AOL!] out of their chair" [I suppose
it may have been an unrequested feature of the house, put in by the builders
following input from their "marketing" types - NB]

(b) "every electronic system fails at least once every 5 years or so - to
run something as dangerous as burning gas with a 27 MHz [we presume - NB]
$4.99 remote circuit is just insane".

The other day, I was in an electrical store (buying an overvoltage
protector...go figure) and the lady in front of me was trying to find a
replacement remote control for her shutters.  These had been stuck in the
down position for two weeks because the remote's cheap push buttons were
sticking.  If there was a manual override in the house, she sure didn't know
where it was.

These days, before buying almost anything, I try to work out what its
failure mode is likely to be, how long I can reasonably expect it to (a)
work and (b) be reparable.  The results of this calculation for personal
computers is one of several reasons why I don't own one (but that's another
story).

The very first atomic bomb was tested (and destroyed) in the desert out
west.  The second and third atomic bombs were tested over Hiroshima and
Nagasaki.  Even though the first one worked, most of the scientists weren't
sure #2 and #3 would work because they were made differently.  One of the
main reasons that a demonstration wasn't conducted for the Japanese was
because our experts weren't sure it would work.  Computers are very useful
and should be used as much as possible, however, anyone who thinks that a
computer can reliably substitute for a "real" test is naive.

[Frank sent in a long copyrighted Reuters item, 22 Aug 1996, on the Y2K
problem, citing estimated costs to the U.S. Government of $9 to $30
billions, with worldwide fixes costing from $300 to $600 U.S. billion.
The article also noted that Nebraska is imposing a two-cent tax per
pack of cigarettes, to help smoke out the state's reprogramming problem.

Independently, Mark Brader forwarded an item from Malcolm Austin
&lt;<A HREF="mailto:maus@ms.com">maus@ms.com</A>&gt;, who had suggested naming a project aimed at this problem
``Dreadnought'', but he was voted down with those preferring
``Odyssey 2000''.  In response, Malcolm noted that the original Odyssey
project (Odysseus's voyage) ended up 20 years behind schedule, and
killed off everyone involved except the lead manager.  I like Malcolm's
chosen name, but suppose that a fractured American spelling, DreadNaught,
might be slightly more appropriate.  PGN]

&gt; The northbound train (with the passengers) was the 17:04 which left on time.
&gt; The preceding northbound train (16:54) was delayed by over 6 minutes which
&gt; meant the southbound (empty) train would have been delayed by at least that
&gt; in crossing over onto the other line.

Not necessarily. The signalman would have all three trains visible on his
panel. If the other train was that late, the signalman could have crossed
the empty train *before* the late train reached the area. This is the sort
of thing they do every day.

[Here is a case that has considerable RISKS interest because of the
potential availability of historical data to regulators.  PGN]

Qualcomm Inc.'s popular Omnitronics [Omnitracs?] electronic truck-tracking
system is causing tension between regulators and truck lines.  The system
uses satellites and receivers to give trucking companies two-way messaging
with its drivers, as well as accurate data on the location of trucks.  The
Federal Highway Administration is battling Youngblood Truck Lines of North
Carolina over what data Youngblood must provide the regulators.  In
response, Truckers United for Safety has filed a lawsuit contending that
regulators are trying to force Youngblood to retain electronic data from its
system for use in audits (with even accidental discrepancies between logged
hours and actual hours potentially resulting in fines).  Youngblood is
considering dropping its very productive use of the system, to avoid the
ensuing risks.  This is at least the second time federal regulators have
demanded electronic data.  Although current regulations do not require it,
proposed new regulations do.  [Source: Regulators seeking Qualcomm truck
data, By Elizabeth Douglass, Staff Writer, *The San Diego Union-Tribune*, 25

Last Friday evening, after most people had gone home, the local police
arrived at my place of employment in response to a 911 call. There was no
message, and the caller hung up immediately. On Monday this happened again,
once in the morning and once in the afternoon. The police simply called to
check that it was a false alarm. On Tuesday the calls picked up, at one
point occurring about 5 minutes apart. By this point the police were
becoming upset (I certainly don't blame them).

Due to the nature and timing of the calls, it seemed most likely that there
was a problem with a modem. The most obvious choice was a new Win 95
notebook used by a field tech. Win95 keeps track of things like dailing 9 or
1 for you. This combined with a tech entering 9 or 1 as well might cause
this (more likely 9191 or 991, although 911 is possible).  Unfortunately for
that theory, the notebook was configured correctly.

The problem turned out to be a recently (Friday afternoon) deactivated voice
mail box. Friday was the last day for one of our sales staff (he is leaving
the area). He had set up his voice mail to page him whenever he received a
new message. When his box was deactivated, his pager number was deleted. The
code he chose to identify voice mail on his page remained. The code was, I'm
sure you've guessed by now, 911.  Whenever he received a new message the now
blank number, followed by the message (911) was sent to the switch.

Risks? First, 911 no longer sent anybody to check on the problem. If we'd
had a real emergency, response time would have been slowed. Second, a
"denial of service" as 911 operators were busy with us when there might have
been a real emergency elsewhere.

As the architectured method for language negotiation between web browsers
and web servers is not supported by all products, and often fails as users
tend not to customize their browsers properly, attempts have been made to
select the preferred language (and sometimes content) based on host names.
Similarily, different versions of a page may be sent depending on the
browser's capabilities, the line speed and the like.

Country guessing seems to get much harder with emerging caching strategies.
The two requests below originated at the same client in the .at country
domain.

The first one got propagated from proxy.tuwien.ac.at to
ebone-proxy.univie.ac.at, and finally to salvator.ecrc.net (with possibly
some additional proxy servers in between). In the second has,
ebone-proxy.univie.ac.at actually fetched the document.

salvator.ecrc.net        - - [22/Aug/1996:14:34:06 -0400]
ebone-proxy.univie.ac.at - - [22/Aug/1996:14:37:03 -0400]

Now what's the problem with this? At the server there is no evidence where
the request actually originated. The assumption that proxy servers tend to
be in the same geography, consequently in the same top-level domain, does
not hold any more.

In this case, with a .net domain, most servers will probably present the
English version of a document, which may not be the intent of the author,
but still acceptable for many users.

With proxy servers being located in different country domains, however,
there is a risk of presenting a language version which is very likely not to
be understood at all.

Likewise presenting different versions of a document to meet legal
requirements such as adding extra disclaimers, or to direct users to
country-specific information, or optimizing for specific browsers, may fail
for the very same reasons: The cached version of a dynamically created home
page, optimized for use with Netscape and excessively using tables and
graphics, was sent to a text-based Lynx client.

Excerpts from InfoWorld:

"Courion Corp. has announced Password Courier ... "
"Password Courier integrates with existing help desk systems and allows
users to reset their own passwords to networks. "
"Courion estimates that 10-20% of internal help desk calls are from users
who have forgotten their passwords or have been denied because of invalid
password attempts."
"Users can access Password Courier from a web browser in a corporate
intranet and authenticate themselves with personal identification
information.

It appears the system is for intranet applications, but I wonder how easy it
would be for someone to change my password for me? If this become an
automated process, not requiring the human verification and interaction, I'd
be concerned of the risks.

A few months ago, my wife was shopping in the supermarket when large lines
started to form at the checkout counters.  It turned out that (of course)
the whole payment system was down.

In this French store, the procedure to be followed in this case is very
simple: you wait.  I suppose the reasoning goes that even if all the
articles had price stickers, and all the checkout people had calculators
and/or very good mental arithmetic skills, there'd still be no point in
adding everything up by hand since the majority of people would have nothing
to pay with apart from their debit cards.

Anyway, after about half an hour, the lines got moving again, and my wife
made what turned out to be the right call: rather than dump her trolley and
hope that store employees would put all the frozen stuff back in the
freezers before bacteria decided to wake up and multiply for the next
customer, she made it through the line and was able to pick the children up
from school only a couple of minutes late.

I assumed this was pretty much all a store could do in this kind of case,
until I was in a Safeway supermarket in Britain last month [I think Safeway
UK is completely independent of Safeway US - NB].  While waiting in line at
the checkout, I was idly reading one of those stand-up signs that says
something like "to serve you better, this counter is closed", which was
waiting to be deployed on some unsuspecting victim.  When I turned it over,
however, I found another message, indicating that this supermarket chain, at
least, is prepared for when technological Armageddon strikes.  Here
(approximately) is what it said:

"Owing to a technical problem, we are unable to process purchased items
electronically.  Therefore, your bill will be calculated by multiplying
the number of items in your basket by an average item price.  Thank you
for your understanding."

Now, I presume this must be legal, because I said jokingly to the clerk "I
bet you hope that never happens" and he said "It happened when I was on duty
a few months ago".  Apparently the average item price (I wonder if this is
the average price of each stocked item, or a weighted average of what people
purchase) is around 94 pence, say US$ 1.42.  When the big moment comes, you
get the choice: pay the average price, or drop everything and leave the
store.

So, next time you're in Britain and the lights go low in the supermarket,
the message is clear.  Empty your trolley of canned vegetables and head for
the electrical goods and alcoholic beverages section.

The RISKS are numerous: huge financial losses for the store as savvy
comp.risks subscribers empty the shelves of foie gras and champagne;
confrontations between customers and clerks over the bill; and the store
(inadvertently) ripping you off if you just _have_ to buy a pint of milk and
a small loaf of bread, right now.

I just posted the following to comp.org.ieee, and consider it appropriate
for RISKS as well:

Since I subscribe to about 7 IEEE Computer Society publications, which take
up significant shelf space, I was excited to learn of the new CD-ROM with
all of 1995's issues on it.  To learn more, I visited the Computer Society's
Web site (www.computer.org).

The first disappointment was the difficulty of even finding the proper
sub-page (their search engine won't let you look for punctuation or "words"
of 2 letters, so I was reduced to looking for "ROM" and hoping I wouldn't
get lots of hits about ICs).  But this was nothing compared to the discovery
that the $90 CD-ROM would be a waste of my money.

Why is this true?  The CD-ROM stores articles in SGML format, together with
a database to help you search it.  SGML viewers are provided for the Mac,
Windows 3.1, and "Unix".  Note that SGML is a superset of HTML, so that
common Web browsers won't display the files correctly.  Worse, the "Unix"
variants supported by the viewers and the database engine are SunOS,
Solaris, and SGI IRIX -- *only*.  Users of DEC Alphas, Linux, Nexts, most
popular x86 Unixes, etc., are out of luck.  So are Windows NT users, who
have already raised complaints about incompatibility.

But if you think the audience is limited now, consider the potential
lifetime of the CD-ROM.  The UCLA library keeps 10-30 years of IEEE
publications on the "active" shelves, and a complete history in secondary
storage.  My own collection is smaller but still dates back quite a few
years.  What are the chances that, 30 years from now, we will be able to run
this software?  The data will be there, and there's a good chance that
there'll be hardware capable of reading the now-obsolete CD-ROMs.  But I
doubt that Windows 3.1 will be around.

The IEEE Computer Society has stumbled twice here.  First, as a society of
computer scientists, it should not be disenfranchising its members by
publishing data that can only be viewed with proprietary software.  Second,
the choice of formats and software has been excessively focused on the
technology of 1995, with little apparent planning for the libraries of the
21st century.

I recognize that the IEEE cannot afford to support every oddball operating
system out there, let alone predict the future.  It is for precisely this
reason that they should have made the CD-ROM available with complete
documentation and source code included, so that all potential current and
future customers would have an equal chance to make use of the information
therein.

Writing in an article entitled "US Army Seeks Computer Antivirus Plan" in
the 26 Aug 1996 issue of *Defense News* magazine, reporter Pat Cooper
reveals the US Army suffered from serious computer virus infections while
deployed in Bosnia.

Infections by Monkey, AntiEXE and Prank Macro caused computer software
malfunctions and related problems which "forced Army personnel to waste
hundreds of hours finding the viruses and cleaning them from the systems..."
Apparently, imperfect Monkey virus removals also resulted in non-critical
data being lost from infected hard disks.

The widespread dispersal of the viruses on Army computers in Bosnia have
catalyzed a review of information systems procedures and could have
implications for all future force deployments, servicewide, according to
Cooper and *Defense News*.

Army Captain Steve Warnock told Cooper that while virus computer trouble
was widespread, it affected only "nonsensitive data and did not adversely
affect the Bosnian mission."

Army officials pressed for solid recommendations that all computers be
checked for computer viruses prior to future deployments.  One suggestion
aired involved the maintenance of an on-line site from which Army personnel
could download current anti-virus software while in the field.

Pat Cooper commented to Crypt Newsletter that the US Army had used
IBM Anti-virus and McAfee Associates software while in Bosnia.

Let me provide a victim's perspective on Netcom's mail list troubles. I was
one of about two dozen people who were falsely subscribed to over 1000
mailing lists in the early hours of 10 Aug 1996 by someone calling
himself "johnny xchaotic". On 12 Aug, the mail bomber posted a manifesto
in news.admin.net-abuse; you can find a copy of it at
<A HREF="http://www.winmag.com/people/dmethvin/mailbomb.htm">http://www.winmag.com/people/dmethvin/mailbomb.htm</A>.

The good news as far as RISKS goes was that there were hundreds of mailing
lists that did the right thing and rejected the subscription request. Some
mail list software detected the inconsistency between the From address and
the rest of the header. Others realized that the sheer number of
simultaneous subscriptions reeked of spam. Others sent a confirmation
request that had to be returned to start the subscription; I deleted them
and the subscription never got started. Ahh, the beauty of well-behaved
software.

Netcom's mailing list software (and many others as well) fell into the other
category. It was suckered by the forged From in the header, wasn't at all
troubled that the attacker was asking to be signed up to every list at
Netcom, and didn't send any confirmation request before adding me to the
list.

By the time I logged on later that Saturday (about 10 hours after the attack
started), I had over 1600 mail messages. Since I was going on a long
business trip that week, followed by a vacation the next week, I knew I
wouldn't have time to deal with the problem immediately. I decided to have
my incoming Internet mail turned off at our corporate gateway, so that
messages to <A HREF="mailto:dmethvin@cmp.com">dmethvin@cmp.com</A> would be bounced back to the sender. In
attempts to contact them, I found out that many of the other victims are
also bouncing mail, some because their mailboxes are full.

In the case of Netcom's mailing list, I suspect that since our bounced
messages went back to their mailing list address, the software just turned
them back around and sent them to the mailing list distribution again,
including all the people who couldn't accept mail. And guess what?  The
messages bounced again and again and again. There was nothing malicious that
I or any of the other victims needed to do to cause this loop, but if it
gets Netcom to straighten out their mailing list software then it's a good
thing.

I don't know anything about this incident or about Netcom's installation of
Majordomo (the mailing list management software in question), but speaking
as the original author of the software, let me quote the original design
paper ("Majordomo: How I Manage 17 Mailing Lists Without Answering
'-request' Mail", USENIX LISA 6 conference, 1992):

... the goal is not absolute security, but to avoid people
making a nuisance of themselves by abusing the Majordomo server.

By today's standards, Majordomo's "security" measures are incredibly weak;
they weren't particularly strong even 5 years ago, when the software was
written. Most lists are configured so that users can subscribe or
unsubscribe themselves, which is determined simply by checking that the
"From:" line in the header matches the address they're trying to
subscribe/unsubscribe, and thus trivially subject to forgery. Furthermore,
those operations that are "protected" are accessed through reusable
passwords sent in clear-text through e-mail, and thus trivially subject to
interception and reuse.

The next release of Majordomo (which will be version 1.94) will include a
simple challenge/response "confirm" mode for lists, where a supposed
subscriber will be sent pseudo-random confirmation string that they must
turn around and send back to the server before their subscription is
finalized.  This should significantly cut down on the spam subscriptions.
Version 1.94 is in alpha test now, and due for release sometime in the next
few months; send e-mail to <A HREF="mailto:majordomo-announce-request@greatcircle.com">majordomo-announce-request@greatcircle.com</A> if
you'd like to be added to the list for notification when it's released, or
to <A HREF="mailto:majordomo-workers-request@greatcircle.com">majordomo-workers-request@greatcircle.com</A> if you're interested in helping
with the development and alpha/beta test)

Clearly, I should have worked harder to keep folks from making a nuisance
of themselves with the original version of Majordomo.  Some days, I think
that releasing the damn thing was the biggest mistake I ever made...  :-)
And I now have a _lot_ of sympathy for folks like Eric Allman (author of
Sendmail), whose creations have taken on a life of their own on the net...

[RISKS is greatly indebted to Brent and majordomo.  They have greatly
simplified my life, and will do even more in 1.94.  The challenge-response
will also get rid of the jerks whose FROM: addresses are flagrantly
unanswerable; on 28 Aug alone, I had to manually remove four would-be new
subscribers whose given addresses bounced on the acknowledgement, and I
had one more just before putting this issue out!  PGN]

Issues:

(1) AA battery tray safety of use
(2) Is PLGR battery venting event systemic or anomalous? (i.e. design or
manufacturing related)
(3) Is there anything that the operators can do to minimize chances of
reoccurrence?

Discussion:

This issue for us is no longer a singular matter of finding out what
happened to cause the violent venting at Fort Irwin on 29/30 July 96. We
hope to be able to determine what the exact cause of that violent venting
was, however, there could be a number of contributing factors and we may
never know exactly what caused that violent venting. The bigger issue is
what are we learning from the on-going testing as we try to determine what
could have caused the violent venting at Fort Irwin, and given this
learning, what can we tell users of the PLGR that will prevent a
reoccurrence of this type of incident in the future.

[DMK: Discussion of batteries, diodes and case specification deleted.
Summary: The investigators cannot replicate the explosion through single
failures or combinations.]

Recommendation:

Until further notice, if operating PLGRs with external power, remove prime
power battery. This includes BA5800 lithiums and AA lithium batteries when
used with AA battery holder. The use of AA alkaline batteries when used with
the AA battery holder is safe, even if holder deforms. In other words when
operating on external power the prime power battery compartment should not
contain any lithium batteries!!!

In an open chess game on the Internet, Russian grandmaster Anatoly Karpov
defeated several hundred opponents in a game that lasted 65 moves and four
and a half hours.  For each move, contestants had seven minutes [down from
the originally advertised 10 minutes, at Karpov's request -- I guess he did
not want to get too bored.  PGN] to indicate their response, and a computer
calculated the most frequently suggested response.  (*The New York Times*,
27 Aug 1996, B9)  [See &lt;<A HREF="http://www.tele.fi/karpov/gameworl.htm">http://www.tele.fi/karpov/gameworl.htm</A>&gt;.]

[This item is noted primarily for archival purposes, as a follow-up
to the risks suggested in <A HREF="/Risks/18.37.html">RISKS-18.37</A>.  The result was clearly not
a surprise.  Only about 300 hundred opponents?  Suppose the group was
composed of only a few grand masters?  What would that do to the odds?
Better yet, one grand master with others kibitzing by e-mail.  If a
grand master can play simultaneous matches, it should be no difficulty
winnowing the e-mail suggestions in real-time.

I suppose at the next Computer Chess Olympics we will see on-line groups
of Russian chess players pitted against their U.S. counterparts using
this software, *en mass-ant*.  PGN]

DIMACS Workshop on Network Threats (abridged announcement)
Sponsored by the DIMACS as part of the 1996-97 Special Year on Networks
4-6 December 1996
DIMACS Center, CoRE Building, Rutgers University

Organizers:
Rebecca Wright, AT&amp;T Research, <A HREF="mailto:rwright@research.att.com">rwright@research.att.com</A>
Peter Neumann, SRI International, <A HREF="mailto:neumann@csl.sri.com">neumann@csl.sri.com</A>
Steve Bellovin, AT&amp;T Research, <A HREF="mailto:smb@research.att.com">smb@research.att.com</A>

As the use of computer networks, and in particular the Internet, has
increased, so has the potential threat to security. In the last several
years, we have seen numerous security-related attacks on Netscape, Java, and
the Internet protocols. New protocols and systems for electronic commerce,
secure financial transactions, and other applications are being introduced,
and are being deployed quickly, and on a large scale. This workshop aims to
bring together theorists and practitioners working in areas related to
network security in an informal setting to foster discussion regarding the
nature of the threat and what we, as researchers, can do to help manage it.

This workshop will cover topics including, but not limited to:

o attacks on network security
o prevention/detection of attacks
o threat models
o threats to individual privacy
o risk management
o formal methods of security analysis
o political, legal, and social aspects of network security

INVITED TALKS: Confirmed invited speakers (subject to change) include:

o Bill Cheswick (Bell Labs)
o Ed Felten (Princeton University)
o Peter Neumann (SRI International)

Abstract submissions *by 16 Sep 1996* should describe original, unpublished
work, and should be 1-2 pages in length. Abstracts should clearly state the
problem being addressed, the nature of the solution, and the main
contribution of the work. Abstracts will be selected on the basis of
originality, significance, technical content, and applicability. Please
include a cover letter indicating the name, address, and e-mail address of
the contact author.  Electronic submissions are preferred. To submit
electronically, send postscript or plain ASCII text to:

The never ending saga of technology + human error = disaster:

Inquiry Ordered in Missile Incident
STEWART BELL, *Vancouver Sun*

The Canadian navy mistakenly launched an unarmed missile at a town near
Victoria, B.C. on Thursday, hitting a residential garage and narrowly
missing a food store and day care centre.  Sailors were testing weapons
systems aboard the HMCS Regina at 11 a.m. when the missile was fired at the
town of View Royal on Vancouver Island.  The military has since suspended
all such testing on both coasts and ordered an inquiry.  Although nobody was
injured, residents of the bedroom community of 6,000 people say things
could have been much worse. Thirty-two children were a half-block away at
the Tiny Tots Day Care Centre when the incident occurred.

HMCS Regina, one of Canada's new $1-billion high-tech frigates, was docked
at CFB Esquimalt on Vancouver Island during the mishap.  A military
official blamed human error, saying a sailor inserted a live missile instead
of a dud into the launcher.  The error apparently resulted from a mix-up
over the color-coding of the missiles. While the test called for a green
"inert test set," which contains no propellant and therefore could not
launch, a blue "inert practice round" was mistakenly used.

Neither the missile that was fired, nor the one that was supposed to have
been fired, contained explosive materials. But the errant missile
- 1.5-metres long and weighing 18 kilograms - struck with considerable
force, punching a hole in the garage roof and passing through a
workbench before exiting the building and burying itself deep in the lawn.

The story says it all, no commentary needed!

About 3 weeks with network problems [resulted] when on an "enchanted" day
somebody connected an Ethernet transceiver AUI-UTP over the net with the
Heartbeat Switch enabled.

There are two switches located on the top of the unit: the Heartbeat Enabled
(HBE) switch and the Link Test (LNK) switch. The switches are initially set
to both Heartbeat and Link test "Enabled".

In the Heartbeat enabled position, the transceiver send a signal (called a
"heartbeat") across the AUI collision pair (COL) immediately after it
transmits. In the disabled position, a heartbeat is not sent back to the
attached device.

The manual says that if the transceiver is attached to a repeater you have
to place the switch in the disabled position. Otherwise, the heartbeat
signal will falsely indicate collisions to the repeater.

The risks I see are :

* The transceiver was connected to a PC over the net WITHOUT read the
network board's manual of the PC and transceiver, and as the HBE is enabled
by default...

* The risk begin when somebody do something that can affect to everybody
without tell it to anybody...!!!

My questions are :

* Is it necessary to have the HBE enabled by default from factory..???
* Is more common to need the HBE enabled than disabled...???

The problem was already solved and we spent a lot of time trying to do it.

Not a new subject to RISKS readers, but a personal experience that amazed me
could happen.

I went to our local ATM to get some cash to pay the plasterer last week.  I
requested 110 pounds, the machine said "please take your money", nothing
appeared, then it said "please take your receipt", nothing appeared.  I
rushed into the bank, they checked it on the computer and yes it appeared to
be a valid transaction and yes it had been debited from my account. As it
wasn't a branch of my bank I have had to fill in a disputed transaction form
to try and claw the money back.

This of course is the age old risk of the computer says its true so it must
be :). However, we usually associate problems with ATM's with malicious
intent rather than software bugs. For I realised what the problem was - when
I used the ATM I initially pressed proceed without entering an amount. The
machine then reported the error and asked me for the amount.  I am convinced
that the "unusual" input conditions triggered a software bug, and sure
enough when I tried again entering the right amount straight off I was
presented with the cash, although by this time I was 220 pounds the poorer.

I am just shocked that it was this easy to confuse a simple piece of
software/firmware, where the result is rather painful.

I assume that they count the ATM delivery every night so that I *will*
eventually get my money.

I know we've already seen incidents like this, but I thought I'd mention it
for the record:

I recently moved and called my credit card company to inform them of my new
address. To verify that I was who I claimed, they asked me for the last four
digits of my social security number, which I supplied.

Of course, their records didn't agree.

The clerk and I discussed for a while how I could prove my identity. In the
end, she said she would change my address now if I agreed to call during the
next business day to work out the discrepancy with my social security
number.

But it gets better.

I called during business hours the next day to give them my true social
security number. Of course, they needed to verify that I was who I was, so
the clerk asked me for my address.

The risks? Let me count the ways ...

&gt;From the GORP section of the September 1996 issue of the AMC (Appalachian
Mountain Club) *Outdoors* magazine:

Clueless:

When two Pennsylvania hikers discovered they were lost in the White Mountain
National forest this summer, they tried to use their spiffy high-tech Global
Positioning System (GPS) [receiver] to get un-lost -- only the darn thing
turned out to be pretty useless without a map.  No matter, the hikers simply
dialed for assistance on their cell phone.  Luckily, officials who fielded
the call had not only a GPS, but a map, too, and located the hikers.

A week or so ago I used my Cellular One phone to call FedEx to inquire about
Saturday pickup locations near Boone or Blowing Rock NC. At the time, I was
nowhere near either of those places, so I did not bother to mention my
current location to the operator. The next day, Saturday, I called FedEx
with the same cell phone from Blowing Rock to arrange the pickup. The
operator immediately asked if I wanted them to come to the intersection that
I had placed my call from the day before.

Two days later, a FedEx operator confirmed that they are getting "new
systems" at some locations that are able to record the locations from which
cellular calls are placed.

I have now asked Cellular One three times to explain to me why they do not
tell subscribers that they pass this location information through the
system, but to no avail. Each person I talk with says that he or she has
never heard that this information is available,

1. Is it just me, or does it seem to other readers that there are legitimate
concerns about RISKS to cell phone subscribers who are not warned that they
may be having their locations monitored?

2. Is it possible for FedEx to capture information that Cellular One doesn't
know it's passing?

[This message was intended to have been included earlier.  It is offered
now as presenting some useful background on the 10 August power outages.
PGN]

In my personal opinion (not that of my employer), there are some factors
that contribute to outages like this.

1) The transmission system (the lines between substations) is constructed
with more redundancy than the distribution system (the lines from the
substation to your house).  As a result, the transmission system tends to be
more reliable than the distribution system and most failures on the
transmission system do not result in loss of service to customers.  Usually,
when you have an outage at your home, it is because of a fault on the
distribution system.

However, the transmission system is built on a much larger scale than the
distribution system.  Also, when redundant systems finally fail, they tend
to fail in a much more spectacular fashion than non-redundant systems.
Therefore, when an outage is due to transmission problems, it tends to be a
BIG outage.

2) Utilities, like any other business, are in business to make money.  To
make more money, you should own as few assets (lines, generators) as
possible, utilize it as heavily as possible (to maximize sales) and keep
other costs low (small staffs and extended maintenance intervals).  This is
counterbalanced by pressures from regulatory agencies and customers to
provide reliable service.  The opening up of the wholesale electricity
market in North America is putting greater pressure on electric utilities to
be profitable.  This tends to push the balance point towards the side of
unreliability.

A similar thing has happened in the long distance telephone market.  AT&amp;T
originally lost customers over price, but is recovering customers on the
basis of convenience and reliability.  The electric power market appears to
be going through a phase similar to the early days of competitive long
distance telephone service.

3) Western Systems Coordinating Council (the coordination council for
Western US/Canada) regulations mandate that each utility must have 10% extra
generation or "Spinning Reserve" available in the event of a system
disturbance.  For example, if the utility is presently generating 1000 MW,
it must be able to bring an additional 100 MW on-line within a certain
period of time (1 - 3 minutes, I believe).  Power brokers have recently
started buying selling reserve, aggregating it into a pool and selling it
from the pool back to utilities.  For example, if utility A requires 100 MW
of spinning reserve, but the only generator they have that isn't already
generating is 200 MW, they can now either:

- buy 100 MW of reserve from the pool and take their generator off
standby (perhaps for maintenance).
- leave their generator on standby and sell 100 MW of spinning reserve
to the pool, allowing some other utility to take a 100 MW generator
off standby.
- buy 120 MW of reserve from the pool, put their generator on-line and
sell 200 MW on the open market.

The net effect of this is a reduction of total spinning reserve due to the
better fit of each utilities individual resources into the larger spinning
reserve pool.  This gives the system a smaller buffer in the event of an
emergency and increases the chances of outages cascading.

The article in RISKS titled "Java passwd changer?" caught my attention, but
the surprising discovery was that this article has nothing to do with Java.
The author speculates about the risks of an automatic password changer, but
there isn't one being used today that is causing him to worry.  Of course,
such a system could be written and deployed in any language.  But it
couldn't be written and deployed as a Java applet, since the default Java
applet security policy prevents applets from reading or writing to the
client disk.

I'm not sure what the moral of the story is, but I do know that since the
RISKS list is archived all over the place, Java will now show up on search
engines with the title "Java passwd changer?" and no doubt people will start
writing "USA Today"-style articles about the danger of Java changing
passwords!

It may be that the biggest Internet security risk right now is that it's
getting harder and harder to find accurate information about
computer-related risks.

The Microsoft Network offers a free service allowing people to create their
own custom 'start' page at <A HREF="http://www.msn.com/">http://www.msn.com/</A> which may contain personal
information including the individual's address.  All of this information is
encoded into a 'cookie' which is stored by the user's own web browser and so
in theory cannot be seen by other people.  Or can it?

MSN uses Microsoft's own product, Microsoft Internet Information Server 1.0,
as its web server and it tries to send a response which will ensure that
<A HREF="http://www.msn.com/">http://www.msn.com/</A> is not cached by any proxy servers (to prevent people
seeing each others information by mistake), but is cached by the users web
browser for a short time (for speed). It does this by sending an HTTP/1.0
reply with Date and Expires headers which indicate that the information is
valid for half an hour and adds a "cache-control: private" header to prevent
any proxy servers from caching the information.  However, cache-control is a
header from the draft HTTP/1.1 specification which is not interpreted by
many HTTP/1.0 proxy servers in use today (verified by myself with the CERN
and Squid proxies) and so is ignored.  The remaining headers indicate to the
proxy that it may cache the page itself for half an hour.  If the proxy then
caches a page containing a user's personal information then any other user
accessing <A HREF="http://www.msn.com/">http://www.msn.com/</A> via that proxy in the next half hour will
receive that page (and personal information).  This scenario has indeed been
observed in practice with a busy web proxy run by a large ISP and a detailed
analysis has been sent to Microsoft for their attention.

The risk here seems to mostly be mixing HTTP standards and assuming that
HTTP/1.0 servers will understand some HTTP/1.1 headers. It raises issues for
both server coders and cache coders as the Net starts gradually migrating to
HTTP/1.1 at the same time as 'smart' web servers (generating pages on the
fly) want finer control over caching proxies.

Pete
[Aside: whilst making HTTP requests by telnetting to www.msn.com:80
(to compare headers), I noticed that www.msn.com either restarts
(connection refused) or goes missing (routing loops between msn.net
routers) quite frequently. ]

Only moments after the appearance of my complaint about the short-term
usability of the IEEE Computer Society CD-ROM, people started e-mailing me
to defend the decision to use SGML.  Rereading my posting, I realized that I
did not make myself clear.  I do not object to the choice of SGML as a
format; to the contrary (without having had the time to read an SGML spec) I
suspect that it was a very wise choice.

My problem is two-fold.  First, the software to view the articles on the
disc was provided in a very short-term format, and one that disenfranchises
a large fraction of the potential customers.  (To publicly answer a couple
of private suggestions, I do not think that I should have to go out and
browse the net to get this software, nor do I think that it would have been
any better to have included an emacs viewer as well as those already
present.)

The second problem, which I somehow omitted from my previous message, is
that the software to search the database is proprietary.  So even if I
download an SGML viewer from the net, I can only display articles, and can't
take advantage of the nifty search features that ought to be available to
everyone.

*No* solution is acceptable if it depends on external capabilities other
than the ability to read simple ASCII from the CD-ROM.  Bootstrapping by
compiling is OK, and it's OK to provide pre-bootstrapped software for common
platforms.  But I doubt that any of those platforms will be common 30 years
from now, so the Computer Society should have provided for this possibility.

(Incidentally, Software Practice and Experience made the same mistake a year
or two ago, except that they limited themselves to Windows 3.1.  I contacted
them at the time, and received a polite response that resulted in no
action.)

Actually, storing its articles in SGML was the right choice for the IEEE to
have made.  The reason for this is that SGML is a platform independent
format --- SGML, or "Standard Generalized Markup Language" is an ISO
standard ISO 8879:1986.  While the CD-ROM may have only had viewers for
Macintosh, Windows 3.1, and a few Unix platforms, it's much more likely that
an article formatted in SGML will have viewers available on other platforms
than, (for example) if the articles were stored in Microsoft Word format.

A few more words about SGML.  What's really good about SGML is that it is
designed to deal with *structured* text.  You don't specify things like
"Times-Roman-Italics, 10 point"; instead you specify "book title", and leave
it to the SGML viewer to put the text of the book title in the appropriate
font.  This is important, because different platforms have different fonts
available to them; and 100 years from now, who knows what fonts will be
available by default.

An SGML document has a prologue where it declares its Document Type
Definition (DTD).  The Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), which is used by
the Web, is a DTD.  Other examples of SGML include the QWERTZ DTD, which
provides most of the facilities of LaTeX, and the LinuxDoc SGML, which is
derived from the QWERTZ DTD, and which is the standardized format for the
Linux Documentation Project (LDP).  The LDP has provided Linuxdoc-SGML
translators which will take the Linuxdoc-SGML and translate it into LaTeX,
groff, HTML, and texinfo.  (And of course, from all of these formats, you
can then get postscript or Adobe PDF).

So the mere fact that the IEEE CD-ROM is using SGML does not mean that they
have "stumbled badly".  What's really important is what DTD did they use to
format their articles, and is that DTD documented so that other people can
write their own SGML translators.  Of course, it would have been best if the
IEEE could have provided the source to the SGML translators, but there may
have been licensing issues barring them from doing so.

Could you use raw ASCII text instead of SGML?  Of course.  However, you
would lose all the nice formatting that you would get if you were reading
the article in printed form.  Things like diagrams and graphics would be
lost.  The advantage of using SGML is that all of this information is
preserved, and assuming that the definition of the DTD is public, it
shouldn't be difficult to write a SGML -&gt; raw text translator.  It would no
doubt lose information during this transformation, but that's what you get
if you insist on viewing things using raw text.

In <A HREF="/Risks/18.39.html">RISKS-18.39</A>, Geoff Kuenning pointed out some problems with the IEEE
Computer Society publications on CD-ROM.  I would like to correct a mistake
and some perception problems that appeared in his article.

First, SGML is not a superset of HTML.  SGML is a meta-language that is used
to describe content models for documents.  Various flavors of HTML are
implementations of SGML; with the notable exception of Netscape 3.0.

The tool that IEEE provides for viewing the collection is EBT's DynaText;
but because a conforming SGML document instance is tool independent, you can
get many different viewers for many different platforms and not have to
worry about tool compatibility.  You can even construct your own
viewers/publishers/search engines, use DSSSL to provide online or paper
formats for the instance, and standard tools to perform transformations into
other DTDs, such as HTML 3.2.

[...]

IEEE did not disenfranchise their members or customers.  An SGML instance is
not based on proprietary software; it is in fact based on the complete
opposite, a recognized international standard, ISO8879.  There exists many
tools in the public domain and commercial markets for viewing, manipulating
and transforming instances.

Second, the choice reflects lots of planning for technology of the 21st
century.  There exists a commitment from ISO to keep any modifications to
the standard backwards compatible with the current version.  Because the
standard is in the hands of an international body and not a corporation
(such as Netscape's HTML; or Microsoft's RTF) there is a guarantee that
changes to the standard will be made only with public comment, public
notification, and reference implementations.

It is precisely because IEEE cannot predict the future that they selected a
document format that will insulate them from various operating system
quirks, future changes, and emerging technologies.

At my last employer we once had a lithium battery explode.  Maybe it's the
same phenomenon.

The battery in question preserved calibration data in a memory chip.  When
the instrument in question was powered, the memory was powered from the main
supply and a diode blocked current from flowing into the battery (lithium
batteries are not meant to be charged).  In this particular instrument, the
diode had been installed backwards, so when the instrument was on the
battery had energy fed _into_ it.  The resulting internal heating raised the
internal pressure until the battery case let go.

Or maybe, in the GPS instance, the GPS receiver thought it could get a better
assessment of its location if it was in lots of places at once.

Rather than an aid, this would be the ultimate sabotage for a grand master
trying to concentrate on his game, while playing against a time limit.  It
would be akin to having many people trying to shout in his ear.

The same reasoning leads us to forbid citizens from using hand-held radios
to kibitz the flying techniques of pilots while on final landing approach at

PGN adds:-
&gt; The result was clearly not a surprise.  Only about 300 hundred opponents?

Maybe that was the 300 people who did not realise that the exercise was
farce!

&gt; Suppose the group was
&gt; composed of only a few grand masters?  What would that do to the odds?

Improve them for Karpov! (Each grand master would propose a brilliant move
in each situation. These would generally be dissimilar, since each grand
master would have a different vision of how the game would look 10 moves on.
Their brilliance would therefore be cancelled out.)

&gt; Better yet, one grand master with others kibitzing by e-mail.

*That* is the point. Karpov was not (as far as I know - correct me if
I'm wrong) playing the combined power of 300 brains.

Given 300 randomly selected players, most of whom would make weak or
indifferent moves, the "most frequent" response chosen "by computer" would
almost certainly be one of the weakest responses, and (as an earlier
correspondent pointed out) not consistent with any single well-thought out
plan of attack or defence. The group that Karpov was playing were *not*
consulting one another to agree on the best strategy.

What is the point of having computer voting that looks one move ahead
in opposition to a chess genius who thinks at least 7 moves ahead?

It would be interesting to see an analysis of the resulting game.
I bet it was more crapov than Karpov!

The Beijing government has begun blocking as many as 100 Internet sites that
offer material the government deems unsuitable for its citizens -- including
dissident viewpoints from Hong Kong and Taiwan, sites sponsored by U.S.
major media organizations such as CNN and the Washington Post, and sexually
explicit sites such as Playboy and Penthouse.  An official described the
blocked sites as suspected purveyors of "spiritual pollution."  (*Wall

Junk mail seems to be overwhelming all of us (including RISKS).  America
Online has decided to block completely all incoming e-mail from five
Internet sites, three of which are run by Cyber Promotions, Inc., in
Philadelphia.  Those five sites apparently accounted daily for about 700,000
pieces of unsolicited e-mail to AOL subscribers.  Cyber Promotions earlier
had sued AOL for interfering with its business, and also sought an
injunction against AOL's blockade (although that injunction has not yet been
acted on).  Cyber also accused AOL of hypocrisy, because AOL sends its own
commercial pitches to its subscribers.  (CompuServe and Prodigy have also
taken "comparable" steps.)  [Source: Peter H. Lewis, item from *The New York
Times* in *San Francisco Chronicle*, 5 Sep 1996, D3.]

Stay tuned for further developments in the commercialization of the
Internet.  Perhaps most frustrating is that would-be retaliatory reverse
spammers often discover that the given e-mail FROM: address is bogus, with
the spammer relying on a phone number instead.

Late last month, my sons complained that AOL wouldn't let them log on.  When
I called AOL, I found out that AOL suspended our service because the
computer at the credit card company was unavailable and sent them a "try
again later" message when they tried to debit my account. (I wonder how hard
they REALLY tried to contact the credit card company.)  Apparently because
their computer couldn't talk to the credit card company's computer, the AOL
computer decided to suspend my account and cut us off.  Two days after this
happened, I got a "snail mail" from AOL saying that I owed them money and my
account was suspended until I contacted them.  The amount involved was
$20.24.

The risks - If I was using my AOL e-mail for business purposes (or other
serious use) I would have been cut off until I figured out that I needed to
call them.  I have no idea if (or how many) e-mail messages were "bounced"
because of this.  Again if this account was used for business, my reputation
could have been seriously damaged because of this policy.  Most companies
that I am familiar with will not take such drastic action immediately if the
normal payment process is delayed or interrupted.

BTW - The AOL representative I spoke to did not know if the AOL computer
would retry until got an answer.

Over the last few weeks I have experienced a series of GPS navigation errors
ranging from minor (triggering RAIM) to as large as 20 miles horizontally
and calculated GPS altitudes of below NEGATIVE 5000' MSL. I have never been
given a NOTAM telling me to expect this performance.

Reading the current issue of AOPA Pilot, I now understand.

* First: Kudos to AOPA for finally telling us what is going on.

The military has been conducting GPS jamming exercises in Southern
California affecting at least the Los Angeles and San Diego areas (that I
have observed) lasting for times up to some 15 minutes (again that I have
observed).

You should note that the vast majority of GPS units flying do NOT have RAIM
and will NOT automatically flag an erroneous GPS position.

I would seriously warn pilots against trusting VFR GPS navigation in
Southern California without cross-checks. Should a RAIM flag go on in an IFR
GPS do NOT assume that because you are receiving lots of healthy satellites
with good signal strength that you can ignore the warning. This is exactly
what you will see when you are receiving jamming.  Look at the calculated
GPS altitude and calculated position error and cross check with any other
available navigation source.

Note that the government has decided to take down LORAN and VORs which will
leave you dead when GPS is jammed. In spite of the absolutely predictable
loss of airplanes and lives that this decision will cause, it is apparently
cast in concrete. I believe that the plan may be to have a multibillion
dollar fix to GPS after all alternative means of navigation have been shut
down and a thousand or so people have been killed by GPS failure.

The following quote is from the Aug 19/96 issue of "Power Markets Week"
(published by McGraw Hill).  I thought you might find it interesting.

One Pacific Northwest market player stated that the new open-market,
profit-making electricity industry is straining the existing Western
distribution system.  "This distribution system was never designed to
maximize people's profits," he said.  The price differentiation between the
Northwest and Southeast trigger huge shifts in energy, which "can't be
supported by the existing transportation system." he added.

In my archives I came across this short article that Bernie Cosell wrote in
August 1980.  I'm posting it to RISKS, with his permission, because it
seems worth getting the article into print -- it's still of interest -- and
into all the archives where RISKS will be kept.

[Here's] a real world anecdote.  It concerns the development of the
software for the PLURIBUS multi-processor here at BBN.  I think that the
only details you need know about the PLURIBUS are that it is a symmetric
multi-processor that uses (in essence) a network to connect together
various buses; each bus contains only a limited amount of stuff: e.g., at
must two processors, not all of common memory, only one end of a doubly
interfaced I/O interface.  Each processor has a small amount of local
memory, but beyond that runs "through the switch" to execute code out of
one of the common memories.

Since the hardware was designed to be extensible and resilient, the
software was designed to be the same way.  We were out there on the fringes
figuring out how to build reliable, extensible, fault tolerant systems.

Without going into the details of how we made it all (mostly) work, let me
describe some of the more amusing properties of the system.  In particular,
it was nearly impossible to stop the sucker once you got it going.

A pretty amusing circumstance crops up when someone would (innocently)
wander up to the machine and push STOP on the console and mount a paper
tape to load up some new software with.  The console, however, only halts
the processors on the bus it is on.  Within a few seconds of halting the
bus, the other (still running) processors in the system notice that some of
their brethren have disappeared, and they reload them (lest their local
memories had gotten clobbered) and then restart them.  So as you stand in
front of the paper tape reader, you notice that your "stopped" processor is
happily back in the fold and you've been done in.

This actually happened (and caused something of a panic) when we shipped
one to Washington.  As the field engineer began uncrating the thing and
powering back up and cabling the buses together, the shards of the IMP
program we had last been debugging woke up and began sniffing about.  By
the time the whole machine was reassembled the software had long since
found enough resources to make itself happy, and so had reinstated itself
and was happily running along.  He, of course, wanted to run some
diagnostics, but couldn't (and never did) figure out how to get the system
to go away and let him do his job:

Since the system is symmetric, both for software and hardware, there is
really no critical component.  If you unplug some of memory, the system
will hiccough a moment, locate new copies of the code in the memory that is
now gone and quietly continue running.  Since the system always (if at all
possible) maintains two copies of each software module and keeps them in
separate memory modules, simply messing with memory wont stop the system.
And on and on with plausible tries that just wouldn't get the thing to
die...  (eventually, one of the software wizards in Cambridge was located
and gave him the secret:

Plant an appropriate illegal instruction in common memory in a
(carefully chosen) location which each processor would blunder
across (and so stop) before either reloading any of the other
stopped processors or noticing that the common memory checksum is
clobbered and switching in a fresh copy.)

Even then you have to be careful, because if you happen to restart one of
the processors before you load up your new code, it will quickly repair the
damage to common and then seek out and restart its brethren and almost
before you know it you're back where you started from...  sigh....

The risks are pretty clear, aren't they?

According to a sidenote on the minimum-wage bill recently passed, starting
FY 98 (?) the federal government will maintain a list of _all_ court ordered
child support payments and _all_ newly employed individuals, and then
cross-correlate them.  Needless to say, there appears to be no consideration
of the inevitable problems with misidentification, security/privacy, etc.

I work in France as a [bilateral] translator, and I am also a French editor
for an American language learning software company.  One of my roles is
purchasing content, and negotiating rights.

I have recently been negotiating with a French TV station, to purchase some
video.  My contact sent me a draft contract as an e-mail attachment, but I
had trouble opening it.  When I opened it with a text editor, I discovered
my contract, as well as 2 others.

It seems that they use Word.  Now, my Mac is a Microsoft-Free zone, so I am
not sure about how this works, but, if I understand correctly, you can save
a document under Word which includes previous versions.  (The doc I received
was about 40k, and my contract was only 5 pages.)

This means that the person had been saving his contracts like that, and for
a new contract, he just took an old one and made some changes.  Well, the
implications of this are obvious.  I could have found, for example, that the
price the previous client paid was far below what I had agreed to pay.  Or
there could have been other confidential information.

I explained this to my contact, who seemed a bit upset about not knowing
what was in the file he sent me.  I guess that many users of Word, and
probably other WP software, may be in this situation also.  If they were to
read the manual...

I reported last year and early this year regarding the accidental shooting
down of an F15 by a wing mate.

What happened: An F15 fighter plane of Japan's air force shot down another
F15 during interception training over the Sea of Japan near the Honsyu
island last November.  Both planes were based in the Komatsu air base. One
of the planes carried the live sidewinder missiles and despite the claimed
safety mechanism, the missile was launched. The pilot of downed F15
parachuted down and was rescued.

Earlier reports I picked up suggested malfunction of safety mechanism such
as static electricity problem of the master firearm system.

However, the investigation turned to a different direction, it seems.  An
article in the Asahi Shimbun on September 4th stated that the Komatsu
military police of the Air force (my English translation of the unit name)
filed formal charge with the local prosecutor's office against the 30 years
old pilot Jyun'ya Hino for disabling (turning off?) the safety mechanism and
then pushing the missile launch button.

The charge mentioned is Kashitsu-Kokuh-Kiken-Zai.  Kashitsu is a Japanese
legal term for mistake, oversight, or an error.  Kokuh here refers to air
traffic.  Kiken means danger. Zai is the legal word for crime.  In a
nutshell, the pilot is, if the prosecutor's office agrees, likely to be
charged and tried with a grave oversight that brought about the serious
accident.

My observation: It looks that the safety mechanism was overridden by human
operator for whatever reason.  This seems to be the conclusion of the air
force investigation.

That military investigators filed charge with the prosecutor's office is a
little puzzling, but I think the Japanese laws would require the handling
outside the military court. I think petit crime such as stealing would be
handled in the military.  The military investigators must have found a
serious neglect on the part of the pilot to justify the release of his name
by filing formal papers to the prosecutor's office: the pilot's name had not
been mentioned in the earlier reports at all (at least not in the newspaper
articles that I saw in Asahi, Yomiuri, Nikkei newspapers).

If the military investigators are right, the accident was more likely to be
the result of human error, and not that of computer-controlled system.

If only the live missile was taken off the airplane before the training
started. As I mentioned earlier, the reason given by the air force for not
doing so was that the airplane was used for routine real-life interception
take-offs and the unloading/loading of live missiles before and after the
training takes time. This is total non-sense since the airplane had to be
refuled anyway after the interception training which also takes time. Also,
the air force officials admitted that carrying live missile was unnecesary
for the type of interception training intended.

(Since I am not a legal expert, nor a military expert, the English
translation of the military terms and legal terms are likely to be loose.)

The majordomo software used by Netcom for their mailing lists uses the
traditional Internet mechanism for avoiding mail loops. As a victim of many
victim's attempts to bounce unwanted e-mail, I don't think it really matters
that these victims are well-meaning when they:

* automatically reply to Precedence: bulk and Precedence: junk mail
* ignore the Errors-to: header line [ admittedly, I'm not sure if
this "standard header" is in the RFC's ]
* repeatedly reply to the same From: line [ cf. vacation(1) ]

Writing correct mail handling programs is complex. Most PC vendors made and
still make many mistakes when writing gateway programs. Good intentions are
not a defense for sending thousands of unwanted pieces of mail.

Because of this problem, I do not have Reply-to: headers pointing back to
any of my mailing lists -- this generally means only the author of the
message sees the bounces. Then I get to deal with complaints like "why
doesn't this list work like my other mailing lists?"

This makes no sense to me.  If they had known how to use the GPS receiver in
the first place, they would have stored critical waypoints in it and
wouldn't necessarily need a map to get back.  Most modern handheld receivers
will even point you in the right direction and show you a tracing of the
path you've taken.  However, if you stored no waypoints, and don't even know
the approximate coordinates of where you want to be, a GPS receiver is about
as useful as something pretty useless.

Cellular carriers are now required to supply 911 emergency service centers
with caller locations to within some small distance (a block?). This is so
EMS can locate people who call in via cellular. This can be thought of
as an extension of ANI, used by such services already to determine your
address immediately upon your calling into a 911 center.

Whenever your phone is on, it is communicating with the nearest cell(s) and
flagging cell boundary crossings. This is necessary so that the cellular
service knows which cell to use to contact your phone for in-bound calls. In
addition, individual cells can ramp your transmitter signal strength up or
down to accommodate varying cell sizes.

&gt;2. Is it possible for FedEx to capture information that Cellular One doesn't
&gt;know it's passing?

No. However, like ANI and CallerID, this is a capability that the cellular
companies have apparently found a way to market, at least to customers
that it might help, like FedEx. I imagine that the number you called was
a "800" number or free cellular equivalent (*foo). Thus, FedEx would argue
that they are paying for the call and deserve the additional information...

I have been a software engineer at various companies in the cellular

There has been discussion of geographic mobile-location systems for the

adding GPS to the mobile. Such systems are:

1. Possible,

2. Of extremely limited accuracy (not nearly to the resolution of a street
intersection; more like a 20- to 45-degree arc at least a mile in radius),

3. Not implemented anywhere.

Even Cellular One didn't know your location when you made the call, so FedEx
must have determined it some other way.

&gt;  2. Is it possible for FedEx to capture information that
&gt;  Cellular One doesn't know it's passing?

No. (Well, since we're talking about a complex software system, a more
accurate answer might be ``No more likely than the possibility that a C
compiler would insert a backdoor when it compiled the Unix login program.''

RO&gt; Two days later, a FedEx operator confirmed that they are getting "new
RO&gt; systems" at some locations that are able to record the locations from which
RO&gt; cellular calls are placed.

What amazes me about this tale is that it's been widely reported in San
Francisco area newspapers that the local 911 system can't tell where a cell
phone call originates.  It strikes me as perverse that FedEx can do
something our local emergency system can't!  Talk about your RISKS! - Tony

THE SEVENTH CONFERENCE ON COMPUTERS, FREEDOM, AND PRIVACY
Call for Participation
San Francisco Airport Hyatt Regency Hotel
Burlingame, California
11-14 March 1997

CFP97: Commerce &amp; Community will be sponsored by the Association for
Computing Machinery SIGCOM and SIGSAC. The host institutions will be
Stanford University and the University of California at Berkeley.
Co-sponsors and cooperating organizations include the ACM SIGCAS, the
Electronic Frontier Foundation, the Center for Democracy and Technology, the
Electronic Privacy Information Center, and the WELL.

CFP97: Commerce &amp; Community is the latest in a series of annual conferences
assembling a diverse group of experts and advocates from the domains of
technology, business, government, and academia to explore the evolution of
information and communication technologies and public policy, and its
effects on freedom and privacy in the United States and throughout the
world.

Past CFP sessions have discussed, debated -- and often anticipated -- issues
of great social import.  In this tradition, CFP97: Commerce &amp; Community will
examine the social and policy questions posed by:

* the growth of electronic communities;
* electronic commerce and the commercialization of cyberspace;
* the problems of legal and regulatory control of the Net;
* the interests of privacy and property in the electronic domain;
* high-tech law enforcement and security concerns.

The CFP97 Program Committee invites your suggestions for presentations on
these or other important issues at the nexus of technology, business, public
policy, freedom, and privacy.

Proposals may be for individual talks, panel discussions, debates, moot
courts, moderated, interactive sessions or other formats.  Each proposal
should be accompanied by a one-page statement describing the topic and
format.  Descriptions of multi-person presentations should include a list of
proposed participants and session chair.  Proposals should be sent by e-mail
to <A HREF="mailto:cfp97@cfp.org">cfp97@cfp.org</A>. If necessary, typewritten proposals may be sent to:
CFP'97, 2210 Sixth Street, Berkeley, CA 94710.

Please submit your proposal as soon as possible.  The deadline for
submissions is 1 October 1996.  (Please note that we have extended our
deadline for submissions)

Having just survived a hellish weekend due to Hurricane Fran here in North
Carolina, I found it interesting that several technological RISKS have only
now come to light.

The area was clearly unprepared for a disaster of this magnitude, and is now
paying the price for the "can't happen here" complacency apparent in the
local utilities' failure to take preventive action which could have greatly
reduced the suffering now happening here.  Specifically, the electric
utilities (and, by extension, their customers) have thus far resisted
modernization in the form of buried power lines; presumably the rate
increases necessary to finance this are anathema to existing customers.  The
lack of attention to trees growing close to power lines has now borne fruit,
so to speak; about 100,000 subscribers have been without electricity for
over three days, as of this writing.

For what it's worth, I'm a recent transplant here myself, after having lived
for nineteen years in South Florida, where hurricanes are an established
fact of life and building codes are strict enough to persuade most designers
to do the Right Things.

The Risks Forum has had much discussion in the past of the engineering of
critical and safety systems, and how they should be designed to fail in a
"safe" mode.  It turns out that this design principle was lost on the people
who designed the apartment complex in which I live.  This complex contains
electronic card-access locks with no manual overrides, and a "security" gate
which fails into a "lockdown" mode.  This is the sort of "safe" mode which
might be appropriate for a prison, but certainly not for the only
entrance/exit for a residential community.  Had a fire broken out in the
wake of the storm, I would very probably not be here to write this.

This complex is also provided with a so-called "security system" which is
automatically hooked into each unit's telephone line.  In the event of a
power failure, these systems attempt to dial their monitoring stations to
call for service.  There is apparently no time-out interval for this; these
alarms simply seized all affected phone lines and effectively kept them out
of service until their backup batteries ran down after eight hours or so.
This means, of course, that a power failure also guarantees loss of
telephone service (for eight hours, anyway).

The RISKS here are all too depressingly obvious.  It's a near-miracle that
more people did not have to pay with their lives for such embarrassing lack
of foresight.

The *New Hampshire Sunday News* [8 Sep 1996] is reporting that at 1:45pm 29
Aug 1996 American Airlines flight 1170 was flying over Wallops Island,
Virginia, en route from San Juan to Boston when the captain reported
(apparently only to the company at the time) "a missile off the right wing".
The report has been confirmed by the NTSB, which has assigned an
investigator.  Apparently, the FAA is investigating on its own as well.  The
paper goes on to mention the proximity to Wallops Flight Facility with
nearby Navy installations at Norfolk and Lexington Park.

I'm assuming that normal cruise for the 757 would put it out of range of
surface-to-air portables and there is no way to infer the trajectory based
on what was said in the paper.  However, note the headline "American
Airlines Pilot Says Missile Zoomed by His 757", which is not what the quote
above relates.  [Not surprising.  Headlines often have little to do with
articles, because they are written by a headline specialist.  John's
subsequent comments, speculations, and questions have been omitted for
RISKS.  PGN]

[Wallops Island has long been a rocket launching facility.  Over 9 years
ago, <A HREF="/Risks/04.96.html">RISKS-04.96</A> reported the case in which a lightning strike on the
launch platform ignited three rockets and accidentally launched two of
them.  NASA had been intending to test launch capabilities in the presence
of lightning storms.  PGN]

Regular RISKS readers may remember several earlier articles about this
incident that seemed to lay the blame on software bugs.  Now, we hear a
different story entirely and the cause is alleged to be something completely
different.  [Note that a single person, Chiaki Ishikawa, has simply reported
the sequence as it arose.  See <A HREF="/Risks/17.65.html">RISKS-17.65</A>, -18.18, and -18.41.  PGN]

There is a risk that occasional readers or researchers using search engines
may come across the archived RISKS articles and use them to prove a point,
or merely to sensationalize.  They might never find the later articles that
set the record straight. This is not a criticism of RISKS, but rather an
attribute of any ongoing public discussion on the Internet.

There is also a new element to the risk. The resources needed to search
massive amounts of news archives was, until recently, only affordable to
wealthy organizations.  Now we can all do it inexpensively, but most of us
aren't trained investigators or journalists.

I believe that we should make airplane accidents a special case, and to
voluntarily withhold public discussion and speculation until the accident
report is in.  Not forever, but until the reports are in and read.

There are several reasons why just airplane disasters are exceptional.

a) Early speculations about why the incident occurred are frequently wrong.

b) The actual report, issued after all the physical and other evidence
has been examined, will be available within a reasonable time (months
to one or two years.)  There is ample opportunity to challenge
the report's conclusion or offer other opinions after its release.

c) Speculations are often highly technical.  This may lead non-technical
people to ignore what is actually said as not understandable, and to
look only at the headline and the source. RISKS is a respected source
and some people may believe anything they read here is authoritative.

d) The sensational nature of air disasters makes the public and the media
hungry for any tidbits.  Technical debates intended for a closed
audience aren't likely to stay closed for long.

e) Speculation may cause additional grief for the families of victims and
crew or others involved.  Reputations can be ruined.  Even when the
speculations prove true, the full report can include mitigating details
that color one's judgement differently than partial information might.

Pilots in the hanger engage in gossip just like anybody else.  When an air
disaster occurs, you can bet the gossip flows freely.  However, it is
considered bad form to do so within earshot of laymen.

No doubt there are other risks that also deserve sensitive treatment, but to
me airplane disasters stand out most clearly.

Dick Mills    <A HREF="http://www.albany.net/~dmills">http://www.albany.net/~dmills</A>

[It is intriguing that there are perhaps a dozen books on the KAL 007
case.  It is not surprising that theories proliferate during times
that definitive reports are not available, but it is also not surprising
that, even with the presence of supposedly definitive reports, different
theories continue to propagate indefinitely.  The TWA 800 case may become
another example.  You may note that RISKS has been silent on that case,
eschewing speculation; however, there are some rather startling hypotheses
floating around.  PGN]

The euthanasia-via-computer story in <A HREF="/Risks/18.05.html">RISKS-18.05</A> reminds me of an anecdote I
was told by a colleague in a previous job.  He once worked for a
pharmaceuticals firm and was required to find out if a particular candidate
molecule had any potential as an anti-anxiety drug.  He rigged up a set of
cages for a number of rats, each of which could be warned (by a light, or
something) and shocked (by wires in the floor of the cage).  The idea, as I
recall, was to warn the rats, then shock them briefly over a period of time
to see if the light alone subsequently caused the same amount of agitation.
If the drug was effective, it should make the rats less anxious (move around
less) when the light came on.

Unfortunately, the software he had written (in interpreted BASIC) had the
undesirable feature that, if it stopped due to a runtime error, the output
states [*] would remain as they were.  During the night, the program hung
during the "shock" routine, and when he came in the next day all the rats
had been comprehensively electrocuted [*].

[* Rat-etat(s), especially if they were French rats?  PGN]

This week I had the frustrating experience of trying to register for a
conference using an online form that provided no feedback.  I'll omit the
name of the conference to protect the guilty.  (The conference is web-related,
so its organizers really should know better.)

The HTML form used the "mailto" action to deliver user input via e-mail
rather than feeding it to a CGI program.  Not only is "mailto" not supported
by all web browsers, but it has the unfortunate feature of not providing any
feedback to the user that the form has been submitted.  In contrast,
well-written CGI transaction handling programs will provide an
acknowledgement screen and/or acknowledgement by e-mail (and very
well-written ones may provide an encrypted electronic "receipt" as well).

The risks of online transactions that lack immediate feedback?  User
confusion and anxiety over whether the form was really submitted and the
transaction really took place; redundant submission of forms as users
re-submit in expectation of feedback; multiple transactions (e.g., multiple
charges to the user's credit card) unless the back-end system has a
bulletproof way to detect duplicate submissions; possible *non*-execution of
transactions if the user's web browser really didn't catch the click on the
"Submit" button and the user has been trained to expect no feedback; and
wasted time and money as the user gives up on the online transaction and
tries to straighten it out by telephone.

I do have some sympathy for small organizations trying to carry out
transactions on the web without a prohibitive investment of resources.  The
marketplace for online commerce software is extremely chaotic right now, and
do-it-yourself CGI programming is considerably more complex than learning to
slap HTML tags into a document.  But as the web moves from being a
publishing system to being a more comprehensive system for commerce and
other kinds of transactions, it is important that the people who set up
online transaction systems recognize that their attention to reliability and
user interface design must increase accordingly.

The following happened to me about a year ago:

Wanting to ftp a file to a remote server, I accidentally used a telnet
client instead of an ftp client. Confused about the presented interface, I
managed to type in some commands that crashed the ftp server on the remote
site, dumping a core file.

A little later, I found the core file in my directory, and for no other
reason than shear boreness, I loaded it into a textfile. Removing all the
control chars, I suddenly looked at a string that was all very familiar to
me: my password.

to live too long. (It got quickly fixed.)

A British insurance company is reported to be providing a new insurance
policy.  They have been offering an "Alien Impregnation Policy", which is
said to have sold 300 policies in a week: fired up by their success, they
are now offering a "Virgin Birth" policy, on the grounds that a number of
women are worried about the millennium.  However, religious authorities are
said to be cool towards the idea.  (Since one of the larger organised
religions depends on just such a manifestation of the Holy Spirit, this
seems on the face of it inconsistent.)

This makes the Y2K computer-system date risks appear almost trivial.
The market may be limited however -- a straw poll of female colleagues
indicated that this was the last thing on their minds at the moment.

[It will be interesting to see what evidence will be required for insurance
claims on an Alien Impregnation Policy.  I presume this will be a classic
challenge for computerized DNA matching, and a glorious opportunity to
become famous for the lab technician who first identifies alien DNA,
or its equivalent!  PGN]

[...] Undoubtedly, the plaintiffs cited _Consolidated Edison v. Public
Service Commission, 447 US 530 (1980) in the injunction.

In the Supreme Court decision, the Court said that our right to be
bothered does not justify limiting First Amendment rights.  The solution
is "[simple as] transferring [it] from envelope to wastebasket."
[_Sex, Laws and Cyberspace_, 1996, pg 36]

The obvious counterpoint is that the US Postal Service is a "universal"
service which is legally mandated to attempt delivery to all residents.
With few exceptions (based on geography), receiving a letter requires no
prior setup by the individual.  Nor does the individual have to pay a
monthly charge for access to his mailbox (in contrast to the _rental_ fee
for those boxes located in a post office).  Nor does the individual have to
sign contractual agreements with the postal service regarding issues such as
"appropriate use" of the mail.  (There are postal laws, but many
"appropriate use" restrictions are more restrictive.)

In contrast, online service providers require a "setup" before they'll
accept e-mail for an individual.  They charge for access to the mail boxes.
And nearly all providers require users to agree to various "conditions of
use" before the user can access his mail box.

These differences may not be enough to directly challenge the court's
reasoning in the prior case, but it's enough to challenge the assumption
that the matter has been definitively resolved.  In 1980 the USPS was the
sole mail delivery agent for the vast majority of Americans; it was also
(until recently) literally a branch of the federal government.  Today we
have e-mail, fax/modems, FedEx, etc., all independent of direct government
involvement.

As a wild-eyed extrapolation, this case may kill the attempts by the USPS to
form its own e-mail service.  If it's ultimately decided that private ISPs
can block spammers while the USPS (as a quasi-government agency) can't, few
people would choose the spammed version if they had an alternative.

&gt;From what I gathered while scanning an article at lunch today, the spamming
company had _1.5 million_ AOL e-mail addresses.

Assuming a typical message of 2k or so and a typical target of only 1% of
the AOL subscriber base, the effects on AOL mailers could still be best
described as "mail bombing."  (15,000 messages totaling 30 MB).

Assuming the typical user has 2-3 messages in his inbox at any time, the
total amount of disk space wasted on spams is 6-9 _Giga_bytes, at best.  In
practice, with a distributed architecture the additional disk space (used or
unused) required might easily total 20+ GB.

Another important factor to consider is the cost to backup an extra material
in user's mailboxes.

The cost per AOL user is still modest, but why is it borne by AOL users, and
not the party sending the unsolicited mail?  (The sender of physical mail is
always responsible for postage.)  And what happens when it's not one company
sending mail to 1.5 million subscribers, but a thousand direct marketers?

Perhaps this subject is better thought of trying to make a silk purse out of
a sow's ear?  If you are going to put your reputation on (the) line via
contracting with an Internet Service Providor, then it behooves you to have
a service level agreement with them.  Assuming that they are going to
provide the service that you silently expect does not seem like a wise
business decision to me.

Greg Lindahl &lt;<A HREF="mailto:Greg-Lindahl@deshaw.com">Greg-Lindahl@deshaw.com</A>&gt; writes about auto-responders that
bounce messages with Precedence: {bulk,junk} and ignore the Errors-To header
field, and admits that "writing correct mail handling programs is complex."

In fact, the situation is even more complex than that.  Both fields
are undefined, nonstandard, and can cause incorrect mail handling.

Use of the Precedence field varies widely.  It was originally used by
sendmail to determine queueing priority and more recently, to determine
whether a nondelivery report returns the subject content.  Some vacation
programs use it (among other heuristics) to determine whether to respond to
a message.  Some X.400 gateways use it to encode the X.400 Priority field,
and return as nondeliverable any message that contains an unknown Precedence
keyword.  Some mailing list expanders use it as a means to prevent loops
between peered lists, and therefore refuse to forward any message with
certain Precedence values to the list membership.

As a result, there is no value for Precedence that is recognized by
vacation, which does not result in mail delivery failure for some set of
users.

Use of Errors-to violates a long-established (since 1980) standard which
indicates where to send nondelivery reports.  Within SMTP, they go to the
MAIL FROM address, and mailing lists are required to set the MAIL FROM
address to their list maintainer when distributing mail to the list
membership.  Outside of SMTP, nondelivery reports go to the address in the
Return-Path field, which is set from MAIL FROM when the mail leaves the SMTP
world.  Some lists set Errors-to without setting the MAIL FROM address, some
set only MAIL FROM, and some set both.  MTAs that comply with the standards
ignore Errors-to, but others use it to override MAIL FROM.  Still others
send nondelivery reports to both addresses, which in the worst case can
cause a form of sorcerer's apprentice syndrome.

In fact neither field belongs in the message header while the message is "on
the wire".  Queueing priority and error return addresses are both the
concern of the message transport layer (e.g. SMTP), while the message header
is intended only for use by the user agent.  MTAs are supposed to ignore
message headers, but instead they end up affecting whether a message gets
delivered.  And since these fields appear visibly in much list traffic,
there is a widely held perception that they are correct protocol.

Plain-text protocols are easy to implement and debug, but they create
the RISK that users will think they understand the protocol, and
attempt to implement it without reading the specifications!

&gt;Windows 95 allows you to specify one password on the system... and changing
&gt;the password on the Win95 screensaver does _not_ require verification with
&gt;any system-wide or user-specific passwords.

Having used this OS for about a year now, I find that it does not have a
particularly secure setup.

If windows is waiting for a user login, there appear to be two ways around it:

1. Click OK.
When windows again prompts for the password, click cancel.

This seems to have the effect of logging the user in at the highest possible
level if there are multiple users of the system, otherwise the user is
logged in as the common user. From here it is simple enough to run regedit,
causing all manner of havoc.

2. Press the windows key, or Ctrl-Esc if there isn't one.

This brings up task manager, again with the ability of running regedit from
the command line.

The only way I have seen around this is to disable the login box (change the
primary login to Windows), which will circumvent the appearance of the login
dialogue. Unfortunately, this means there can be only one user, and if there
is only one user, it isn't sensible to remove Registry editing tools.

Enable passwords at bios level, and switch it off when you leave your
machine, for optimum security. Oh, and don't use win3.1x screen savers, they
can be skipped by Ctrl Alt Del.

Microsquish Stealth Bug Insertion Technology

While I'm kind of dismayed by the "if you can't innovate, litigate"
philosophy so often applied to Microsoft, this is a particularly lethal
little gem from their MFC team.  In many development environments, this
problem will almost certainly guarantee that your app will crash the first
time it is executed on customer machines, but the crash will only happen
once, and will mystify tech support.

The problem arises in the use of property pages, otherwise known as tabbed
notebook dialogs, as they are designed and implemented in the Visual C++/MFC
environment.  VC allows the developer to use interactive resource editors to
design the property pages, but IT ONLY DOES THE FINAL STEP OF THE PROCESS IN
EXECUTING THE APPLICATION, not in the development cycle.  This step, where
the style of the page is changed in the resource will cause most machines to
abort the software as it is attempting to change a read only resource.

What really concerns me from a risks perspective is that the traditional
development model is to release an exe to the test/qa group, and then to
ship this exe to production when it receives a blessing from test/qa.  This
means that the exe shipped to production IS NOT THE SAME AS THE ONE THAT WAS
TESTED, because the tested exe has been executed, and the one sent to
production has not.  Hence, every customer who launches the app for the
first time will be rewarded with a crash, which can never be reproduced.

Yes, you can get around it with careful use of filtered exceptions.  The
problem is that this is rather insidious, and outside the realm of thinking
of most developers, who view an exe as the final product of the development
process.  In this case, the final product is an executed exe.

Personally, I feel this is a lot like the Monty Python "Frog chocolates"
sketch.  VC too should have a great big warning sticker on it saying "An EXE
from the linker is NOT A PRODUCT.  YOU MUST EXECUTE IT TO MAKE A PRODUCT."

-- -- -- -- -- -- ORIGINAL MICROSOFT DOCUMENTATION    -- -- -- -- -- --
Applies to class CPropertyPage, specifically the DoModal function that
causes the page to be presented on the screen.

virtual int DoModal( );

[... standard usage documentation deleted...]
[HERE IS THE INTERESTING BIT!!!]

Note.  The first time a property page is created from its corresponding
dialog resource, it may cause a first-chance exception. This is a result of
the property page changing the style of the dialog resource to the required
style prior to creating the page. Because resources are generally read-only,
this causes an exception. The exception is handled by the system, and a copy
of the modified resource is made automatically by the system. The
first-chance exception can thus be ignored.  Since this exception must be
handled by the operating system, do not wrap calls to
CPropertySheet::DoModal with a C++ try/catch block in which the catch
handles all exceptions, for example, catch (...). This will handle the
exception intended for the operating system, causing unpredictable behavior.
Using C++ exception handling with specific exception types or using
structured exception handling where the Access Violation exception is passed
through to the operating system is safe, however.

The IRS has apparently pulled the plug on its plans for Cyberfile, an
electronic system that would have enabled taxpayers to file their returns
directly without going through third-party service providers.  An earlier
launch of Cyberfile for April 1996 was put on hold when the Government
Accounting Office identified some security weaknesses.  The decision to
abandon the project was evidently made in July.  A GAO report just released
blamed mismanagement and shoddy contracting practices.  It also noted that
the central computer was located in a dusty subbasement of the Agriculture
Department subject to flooding, the computer-room doors had locks installed
backwards (to keep the bad guys in?), and sprinkler pipes were too low.  The
report also observed that use of the World Wide Web (rather than toll-free
direct dialups) represented security problems for taxpayers and for the IRS
alike.  At a 10 Sep 1996 hearing of the Senate Governmental Affairs

The Sunday Style editor, Gene Weingarten, does this every week. It is a
deeply subversive act, but it comes from within.

Weingarten is a deeply twisted man, and a treasure.

Sorry if this disappoints you.

In the German newspaper "Elektronik" no. 18/1996 from 3 Sep 1996, intended
for professional electronics hardware and software developers, appeared an
article containing the views of several companies regarding the usage of PCs
(personal computers) running Windows NT versus SPS (Speicher-Programmierbare
Steuerung = programmable control unit) for real-time applications.  One of
the views from the CEO of a company selling PC-based systems said (I
translate and make shortcuts):

"Regarding the poor safety of a system running under Windows,
my point of view is that every system has limited safety.
Even the praised SPS will eventually cease to work - maybe not as
soon as a PC, but sometime or other there is an end.  But in most
application cases the safety of a PC based system is high enough."

I think this is a strange kind of safety judgement.

&gt; There are several reasons why just airplane disasters are exceptional.

All good reasons.  However, one also has to deal with the political dynamics
of a crash, both good and bad.  The fact is, public safety can be affected
by the results of a crash investigation.  Therefore, to coin an old phrase,
"the public has a right to know."

Even premature information can be accurate, and even, if misleading or
wrong, can have unintended beneficial effects by putting pressure on both
manufacturers and investigators to address specific public concerns.

Examples:

- The early grounding and microscopic probing after the American Airlines
DC-10 crash at ORD in 1979 resulted in everyone in the industry becoming
very familiar with the technical issues at hand.  I doubt if anyone will
ever use a forklift to mount an engine ever again.

- The author of _Unheeded Warning_ notes his concerns (as a pilot) of the
safety of the ATR-72 in icing conditions long prior to the eventual October
1994 crash.  His book notes explicit steps taken to keep the issue alive in
the media and thereby bringing political pressure to bear on the NTSB and
FAA to maintain appropriate perspective in both the investigation and
regulation of the aircraft.  This pressure arguably resulted in FAA mandates
to adjust the design of the anti-ice system on the airplane.  Similar
pressure was absent after a similar crash in 1988 in the Italian Alps.

- Each A320 crash ignites intense discussions on software reliability.  No
A320 has crashed as a result of a flight control system failure, but even
incorrect speculation helps educate budding and practicing software
engineers and discussion of the pros and cons of this implementation, which
reflected the state of the art at the time, will hopefully help encourage a
sense of pragmatism when it comes to installing and developing
safety-critical systems.  In addition, since everyone has a personal
computer these days, and therefore considers themselves experts, USENET
discussions also have the effect of educating the lay public.  An educated
public is the enemy of political and corporate opportunists everywhere.

- I think we can all agree that the microscopic examination of ValuJet will
have the eventual effect of making it the safest airline in the air, even
though the scrutiny is politically motivated and arguably very unfair when
compared to the operational reality of other airlines.  That is, ValuJet
will be safe if the airline isn't driven out of business.

- The NTSB frequently holds open hearings on major crashes.  In at least one
situation recently (in regards to the UAL 737 crash at Colorado Springs)
they invited public comment.  It's difficult for even the technical public
(in this industry, several million people in and affiliated with the field)
to comment if they aren't provided with "premature" factual information.

Lastly, let's keep in mind that the TWA crash, which I suspect may have
helped shape your comments, is kind of exceptional.  It crashed over the
media capital of the United States, and likely of the world.  Individuals
coordinating the "victims' families" press conferences involved members
associated with "victims rights" movements in other contexts, thus imparting
some of their special skills and thus helping influence the political
dynamics of this crash (compare family coverage of this crash with any other
in recent memory).  This extraordinary combination actually resulted in
officials stating that the crash/crime investigation would be put on hold
until bodies were all recovered.  In the mean time, public safety was
potentially compromised as physical evidence was lost: nobody *knows*
whether a bomber might be running around.  In addition, since terrorism
seems very likely, the crash provides a longer-term interest than is typical
for our usual mass-media reporting, which is designed for a 45-second
attention span.

It's a political world, not a technical one.  Unfortunately, the real risk
comes from a cultural propensity to encourage the ignorant to speak loudly
and assertively. That does not mean basic data should be restricted, only
that those who glibly assert expertise from fluff seen on the nightly news
should be shushed.

Subject: Lexis-Nexis personal information database

Lexis-Nexis sells a commercial database called "Ptrax" which holds detailed
personal information on nearly all Americans (L-N claims it contains 300
million names).  This database includes name, current address, up to two
previous addresses, phone number, birth-date, social security number,
mother's maiden name and possible other personal information.  This database
is kept quite current.  Through the Nexis Express service, this information
could be available to any individual with a credit card.

As most readers will are aware, such information could easily be used for
theft of identity and other frauds.  It is possible to have one's name
removed from this database by making a telephone request.  Call
(800)543-6862, select option 4 ("all other questions") and tell the
representative answering that you wish to remove your name from the Ptrax
database.  You may also send a fax to (513)865-7360, or physical mail to
LEXIS-NEXIS / P.O. Box 933 / Dayton, Ohio 45401-0933.  Sending physical mail
to confirm your name has been removed is always a good idea.

As word of the existence of this database has spread on the net, Lexis-Nexis
has been inundated with calls, and has set up a special set of operators to
handle the volume.  In addition, Andrew Bleh (rhymes with "Play") is a
manager responsible for this product, and is the person to whom complaints
about the service could be directed.  He can be reached at the above 800
number, selection option 4 and then ask for extension 3385.

The information in this note has been been confirmed by me, and was
originally provided in forwarded messages from Russell Whitaker, Jason
Werner, Vern Winters, Katherine Florman and Reuben Snipper.

Here in Nebraska, automobile titles and registrations are handled at the
county courthouse level by the county clerk's and treasurer's offices.
Residing in the city of Bellevue, I received a renewal notice for a car of
mine that I've owned for a number of years (I bought it for cash, so I've
always had clear title).  Strange thing was, the postcard had already been
returned by the post office as undeliverable, finally reaching me after
being resent.  The name and address on it was:

Sarpy County
(my address)

This was curious, but I didn't think much of it at the time.  Near the end
of the month, I went down to the Sarpy County courthouse in Papillion,
paperwork in hand, expecting this to be a routine renewal.  The clerk at the
renewal counter noted amusingly that my name had been changed to "Sarpy
County."  She apologized for this, saying that they had recently gone to a
statewide system and a lot of records were in error.  She then noticed that
the title number of my last year's registration card did not match the title
number on my renewal notice.  Attempting to look up my records on-line found
that I was not listed as the owner of this car, Sarpy County was.  The date
of the new title was February of 1993.  She called someone at the state and
after a brief phone conversation, turned to me and asked:

"Was this an abandoned vehicle?"

Uh-oh.  Everything suddenly clicked in my mind.  My car was never abandoned,
but I did leave it parked on a city street during snow removal in January of
1993.  Though the street was not a snow emergency route, there is apparently
a rarely-enforced ordinance that cars parked on public streets must be moved
every 24 hours.  Mine hadn't been moved in at least a week (it's an
operational vehicle, I just don't drive it every day), and the small
collection of snow around it made this obvious.  I realized it had been
towed after noticing it missing the same evening after I got home.  After
promptly retrieving the vehicle from the impound lot the next day, I
received a letter in the mail from the Sarpy County Sherrif's office
indicating that the car had been towed and that I had 5 days to claim the
vehicle before forfeiting it to the county.  Concerned, I called the
Sheriff's office and was assured that as long as I had reclaimed the vehicle
such that the county was not in possession of it anymore, I had nothing to
worry about (Physical possession of the vehicle struck me as an obvious
sanity check against incorrectly initiating title claim proceedings against
non-abandoned vehicles.  For some unexplained reason, this sanity check was
not performed).  Operating under this assurance, and easily able to
re-register and (re-insure) my car in 1993, 1994, and 1995, I was happily
oblivious to the fact that the county claimed my title in error almost 4
years ago.  I only became aware of this now, in August of 1996, at the
registration renewal counter after the state finally synchronized its
records.

Armed with this information, I was referred to the title counter, and then
the Sheriff's office, the upshot being was that I had to ask the Sheriff's
office to title the vehicle back to me.  Fortunately, they were willing to
do so without any hassles or significant delays.  I signed their "Duplicate"
title as "purchaser" and the Sheriff's office wrote out a $10 check to the
county treasurer (avoiding the insult that would have been added to injury
if I had actually had to pay the title fee as a result of their mistake).  I
now hold an "Original" Nebraska title on my vehicle, once again.  With this
new title safe in my hands, and following good legal advice regarding the
risks of having duplicate, and contradictory, "original" legal documents
lying around, I turned my original "Original" title over to be destroyed.

Identifiable Risky Behaviors:

- There seems to be at least a partial lack of obvious human sanity checks
in the procedures for taking possession of abandoned vehicles.  One would be
whether or not the county is actually *in possession* of the vehicle.  A
corollary to this is, having decided they did own the vehicle, that the
county did not seem to do a reasonable amount of tracking (and auditing
after the fact) regarding the disposition of (alleged) county property,
leaving the status of this vehicle indeterminate for years.  One has to
wonder if the same oversight would have happened if the title said "1996
Mercedes."

- Keeping records in at least two different places, and subjecting them to
inconsistent, and rare updates, is just begging for trouble.  I'm not sure
how long the county and state records were out of whack, but I do know that
I was able to get registration renewals in 1993, 1994, and 1995, even though
the state records indicated that I was not the owner of the vehicle during
that time.  This suggests that at least part of the records have gone
unsynchronized for years.

- The implicit data flow in old the system was correct in principle
(propagate updates from the county level to a central clearinghouse, i.e.
the state, then propagating those changes back downward to the county), and
the move to a new, single, integrated statewide system was an appropriate
one.  However, the apparent inconsistency of, and long delays between,
record updates in the old system created the absurd situation where the
government agencies in buildings less than a few hundred feet apart (the
Sarpy County Sheriff's office, which took possession of the vehicle, and the
Sarpy County Courthouse, which tracked title and registration records) had
dramatically different versions of reality.

Risk Mitigations:

- Any sensible information system should save historical (i.e., "deleted")
records for auditing purposes.  Having historical title records on-line made
it very easy for the employees at the title counter to quickly track down my
old title and determine its disposition (issuance of a new title to Sarpy
County).  The date of the new title (early 1993) connected it in my mind to
the towing incident.

- The new system had an interesting (and perhaps unanticipated) soft failure
mode in that, even though the records showed that the car was not mine, I
still got a renewal notice which reminded me to go down to the courthouse.
I probably would have remembered anyway, but having a mismatch in title
number between my registration card and the renewal notice brought the error
to the attention of courthouse employees more quickly.

and, most importantly:

- Situations like these are often aggravated by customer service
representatives who do not understand that computer-generated data can ever
be in error, leaving the hapless customer to prove that it is incorrect.
Fortunately, the human employees at the Sarpy County Courthouse and
Sherrif's Office understood the limitations of their computer systems,
particularly in light of a move to a statewide system that introduced (or at
least brought to light) a lot of errors.  Sarpy County Clerk Debra
Houghtling, Captain Dan Jackson of the Sarpy County Sheriff's Office, and
many others got personally involved in working out this problem and reaching
a solution within an hour (The car was retitled back to me at no expense,
and minimal effort, within a few days).

Epilogue:

Later discussions with Sarpy County Treasurer Rich James (both by me and by
a friend of mine with courthouse contacts) indicated that this is a known
problem with the new statewide system.  Sometimes the error is with the
government (as in my case), sometimes the error is with the owner (as the
old system tracked driver's license, registration, and title information in
multiple places, and sometimes the motorist forgot to update all of them).
The new statewide system will at least catch these errors, and prevent new
ones from happening in the future.  Though he noted that mine was a rare
case, he did acknowledge that it is possible that similar ones are lying
around in the records and won't be discovered until the motorist tries to
re-register the vehicle.

Warning to Nebraska Residents:

The recent transition to a single, integrated statewide system for tracking
automobile title and registration information has either introduced errors,
or brought to light incorrect title actions and inconsistent updates that
have been lying undiscovered at the state level for as much as several
years.  If the ownership of your vehicle is in *any* doubt (such as if it
was towed like in my example), or you have changed your name or address and
failed to notify all appropriate government agencies, check with your county
courthouse.  Any errors won't be brought to your attention until you try to
renew your registration.  My experiences in Sarpy County seem to indicate
that they will acknowledge the error and promptly correct it with the
issuance of a new title, if necessary (If it was the county's or state's
fault, and you are politely assertive about it, it appears likely that the
agency responsible will pay any fees involved in correcting the records).
Your registration can't be renewed until this new title is received, so go
down early in your renewal month to avoid possible interruption in your
vehicle registration.

If the core file is in a users own directory then it's almost certain that
telnet crashed, not the server (ftpd). As such a telnet core is likely to
contain buffers of recently typed actions including your password.

It is perhaps preferable for core files to be dumped with mode 600. I don't
know of any systems that will do this without also changing umask for all
your other files.

On a related topic, really crashing the ftpd can also be dangerous. On our
Solaris 2.5 box connecting via telnet and simply typing 'pasv' causes a core
dump to be dumped to the remote systems root directory. This has two effects -
it overwrites any existing core even on systems where you have no login (or
root) access. Secondly it uses more disk space which may have implications for
system logs if they're not on a separate file system.

There is an interesting article in Traffic Technology International, Aug/Sept
96 issue about a system called CAPITAL that uses cellular phone calls as a
probe to monitor road traffic around Washington DC.  It describes an
experiment which has been running for two years and which has demonstrated
that this is an extremely cost-effective alternative to conventional means of
traffic monitoring.

The system is independent of the cellular phone system per se, but has
antennae on the cellular phone masts which listen to the cellular frequencies.
Every time a call is initiated, CAPITAL locates the caller by a combination of
directional multi-element antennae and time-of-arrival analysis between
different masts.  The geographical accuracy is reported to be to about 115m,
and subsequent tracking allows the speed of the vehicle to be established
within 30 to 50sec to an accuracy of 5mi/h.

At any time only less than 5% of vehicles are making calls, but this is a
sufficient sample for analysing the traffic speed (though not presumably the
traffic density).  Moreover, when the traffic slows down even more people make
calls, so there is a better density of data from the areas most interesting to
those monitoring traffic flows.

It is claimed that the boxes ignore the voice content of the call and that the
data they deliver has randomly assigned identifiers for each call, so that
nothing leaves the system which would allow calls to be associated with
specific phones.

The judge's injunction to prevent AOL from interfering with the subject
spams seemed to rest on a comparison of free speech expressed via the USPS
as against free speech expressed via on line message services, with the
assumption, pending at least until the trial in November, that there is no
essential difference.

There is, of course, a significant economic difference - which may have
no relevance in discussing the constitutional issues - but which
highlights a risk of computer and network technology to itself and its
users.  The risk is that the rapid reduction in costs and rapid growth in
capability changes the economic balance so quickly that the system's
stability, even survival, is dependent on the good manners (or common
sense) of its user community until the entire system evolves to a new
state of economic equilibrium.

Free speech via the USPS is anything but free, in the financial sense.  The
junk mail that I so readily send to the trash-to-steam plant without opening
has at least four real financial costs associated with it.  A payment to the
postal service to deliver it.  Payment to a printer to produce it and
deliver it to the postal service.  Payment to a mailing list provider so it
can be sent to a real address.  And payment of the costs related to creating
the content (text and graphics).  Thus the sender spends a few dozen cents
to a few dollars to irritate me for a second and generate an ounce of steam.

The spam advertiser, on the other hand, may have to bear some creative
expense, but the other three costs are practically zero (divide a modest
network access fee by a few million messages).

The paper mailer has to carefully balance the costs of "free speech" against
the profit expected to result, and he is using a resource that is in
equilibrium, more or less balancing the postal rates against the people and
tools needed to handle a predictable volume of paper.  The spammer has no
concern for balancing cost against profit - the potential profit of each
additional message delivered is always greater than the minuscule
incremental cost of the additional message.  But the risk to the delivery
system becomes quite large as the load rapidly exceeds the service capacity
that assumed good manners would be the norm.

To restore equilibrium perhaps the delivery system could learn to recognize
spams.  When it does, it could credit the account of each receiving mailbox
with a few cents, and debit the sender's account a similar amount.  If
spammers can still figure out how to make a profit in this new environment,
well at least the rest of us will pay less for access, and we may even make
a profit if we receive enough junk mail.

Oops!  That will tip the equilibrium the other way as individuals start
getting multiple mailboxes in hopes of attracting lots of junk e-mail.

The White House maintains a database of some 20,000 people, and is used for
sending greeting cards at Thanksgiving and Christmas, invitations to WH
events, and other purposes.  The GAO has criticized this database for its
inadequate safeguards relating to access controls and lack of audit trails
-- making usage monitoring very difficult.  Apparently 150 White House
employees have authorized access, although only 25 are regular users.
[Source: *San Francisco Chronicle*, p.A2, 11 Sep 1996]

[I presume the White House staff puts in a few bogus addresses
so that they can tell when and how it is being used.  I suppose
they now also need to worry about a Dick Morris Worm attack.  PGN]

In `Galileo team Wrestles To Keep Second Flyby', Aviation Week and Space
Technology, 2 Sep 1996, p56, Michael A. Dornheim reports that `The Galileo
orbiter went into "safe" mode on 24 Aug because of a computer error [..]
Controllers began sending commands [to restore full operation] on 28 Aug,
and the spacecraft and its computer were operating normally again on 29 Aug.
[..] The error occurred in a CDS-A processor [..] some [..] data compression
software had taken too long to execute, which shut all of CDS-A down.  [..]
Galileo then automatically entered the safe mode, which put CDS-B in charge
and suspended all but basic engineering activities.  [..] The cause of the
error was not clear [at the time of reporting] [..] Galileo was resending a
[Ganymede] image when the problem occurred [..] There are several pieces of
data on the [..] recorder that have not been sent yet, and they will be
overwritten by the second flyby.'

Prompted by a query from a colleague, I searched for "KAL 007" on Altavista
<A HREF="http://altavista.digital.com/">http://altavista.digital.com/</A>
to see what recent information had appeared on this major world incident.
In this note, I report sources and views of others and add some comments of
my own.  I am not specifically endorsing any view or assertion here of *what
happened* during the incident or its aftermath.

Lt. Col. (retd.) Lester W. Grau, of the Foreign Military Studies
Office, Ft. Leavenworth, KN, reviews a book on US-USSR relations
from 1983-1990 by Don Oberndorfer, a diplomatic correspondent for the
WP from 1976, at
<A HREF="http://leav-www.army.mil/fmso/books/reviews/turn.htm">http://leav-www.army.mil/fmso/books/reviews/turn.htm</A>
Grau says that `Izvestia conducted a further investigation
of the KAL 007 aircraft downing [..] Mr. Oberndorfer apparently has not
read it since his book continues the Soviet myth about warning shots
being fired in front of the passenger plane.'

The Izvestia article has been translated by Roy F. Cochrun and is
available as a zip file at
<A HREF="http://www.clark.net/pub/royfc/zip/kal007.zip">http://www.clark.net/pub/royfc/zip/kal007.zip</A>
The translation as well as the Izvestia original is contained in a
number of files.  (I got this URL from the last line of
<A HREF="http://aeroweb.lucia.it/~agretch/RAFAQ/KAL007.html">http://aeroweb.lucia.it/~agretch/RAFAQ/KAL007.html</A>
of which the main contents are a couple of messages from rec.aviation.military
that do not seem to contain definitive information.)

A short summary and endorsement of R.W.Johnson, Shootdown: Flight 007 and
the American Connection, Penguin, 1987, is at
<A HREF="http://www.pir.org/books.87">http://www.pir.org/books.87</A>
Johnson was a young politics Don at Magdalen College, Oxford (where I was in
the early 70's).  He basically read all the NYT and WP reports concerning the
incident and aftermath to piece together a coherent story of who knew what
and when in the US executive after the shootdown.  The references alone form
an essential bibliography for political scholars.  I was impressed ten years
ago both by his method, and that there was a newspaper which really did
contain so much useful information on a regular basis.  But I was so much
younger then.....
<A HREF="http://www.iguide.com/books/reviews/brun.htm">http://www.iguide.com/books/reviews/brun.htm</A>
is a review by Jacob Levich of Incident at Sakhalin: The True Mission of KAL
Flight 007, a recent book by Michel Brun (Four Walls Eight Windows press).
Levich says Brun claims that KAL 007 was still airborne 46 minutes after the
`officially accepted' shootdown time, and crashed several hundred miles to
the south of Sakhalin, not where it was reported to have crashed.  `[..] its
destruction was not the result of a single botched encounter with Soviet
fighters, but part of a two-hour air battle in which at least nine U.S.
military planes were shot down; the subsequent cover-up required the covert
collaboration of at least four national governments.'  Levich thinks this is
`firmly grounded in reality' and `accounts for more of the known facts than
any "simple" explanation offered so far'.  Based only on the above quote,
one could really doubt it.

However, a much more sober and thorough review of Brun's book appears at
<A HREF="http://www.clarityconnect.com/webpages/bookpress/apr96/chase.html">http://www.clarityconnect.com/webpages/bookpress/apr96/chase.html</A>
Edward R. Chase is former Editor-in-Chief of NYT Books and senior editor at
Scribner, and was approached by Brun initially to see if there was interest.
Chase introduced Brun to Richard Witkin, former NYT aviation editor, and
David Pearson, author of KAL 007: The Cover-up.  Chase, via Pearson, put
Brun in touch with John Keppel, a retired Foreign Service officer, who
collaborated with Brun.  According to Chase, Brun's thesis was that KAL007
was a decoy posing as an innocent off-course flight, but was intending to
cause the Soviet radars to light up.  Such a thesis, I seem to remember, was
proposed also by Pearson in a series of articles in The Nation and in his
book.  Brun's assertion of an air battle is new.  Chase says: `Brun's book
largely demolishes the U.S. propaganda line.  Yet it is impossible for me to
agree with all its conclusions.  Although I respect his and John Keppel's
intent, admire their industry, their skills, and their tenacity, I feel that
their work could mislead the public by positing a conspiracy theory that is
not credible in key particulars.'

Chase continues: `Brun's book makes very onerous reading for the layman.  To
follow his meticulous analysis of navigational and minute time discrepancies
among the various transcripts and reports is a daunting task, rivaling in
difficulty interpretations of texts by Kant or Derrida.  However, his
argument does demolish the official single-intrusion, single-deception,
single-shootdown theory.  [..] The two black boxes Yeltsin submitted as from
KAL 007 in late 1992 and early 1993 are passing strange, apparently phonies,
says Brun [..]  Brun's proof of the falsity of these black boxes is one of
the compelling sections of his argument.  [...]  the evidence Brun uses to
demonstrate that [the] air battle occurred is all circumstantial,
painstakingly argued, but, for me and for experts I have queried,
unconvincing to say the least.  Nor do Brun and Keppel ever clarify the
connection between the KAL 007 flight and the intrusion of U.S. military
planes around the same time and place.

One wishes Brun and Keppel had confined their charge to the persuasive facts
they elicit that there was a deliberate intrusion of breathtaking
recklessness and stupidity that has been lied about ever since, and that the
episode demands full, truthful disclosure.'

Chase also reviews: `Another recent book, Warriors of Disinformation by
Alvin A. Snyder, an excellent work highly praised by Mike Wallace and Marvin
Kalb among others, powerfully supports Brun's charge of government lying in
the KAL 007 disaster.  [..] Snyder is the official who organised and
presented the T.V. account of the shootdown of KAL 007 at the United Nations
and then the world, using tape recordings of the Soviet fighter pilot's
radio transmissions [..] What Snyder reveals is that the tapes were
doctored.  [..] Snyder reports that the full transcripts of the tapes show
that, contrary to the U.S. allegations at the U.N., the Soviet pilot did
fire warning shots, did circle 007 to get its attention, and tilted its
wings to force the plane down, after being asked repeatedly by his ground
controllers to do so.  The Soviets never realised that the airliner was a
commercial plane.  [..] He also labels as a whopper the lie by U.N.
Ambassador Jeanne Kirkpatrick that at no point did the [Soviet] pilots raise
the question of the identity of the target aircraft.  Snyder's whole book is
first-rate, and his integrity comes across as unquestioned.'

Chase hopes that Brun's book will trigger Congressional hearings, else we'll
have to wait until 2008, when the classified documents will be disclosed.

I object to Chase lumping Derrida with Kant.  But that of course has nothing
to do with KAL 007.

In summary, Pearson and Brun seem to agree on the agent provocateur
interpretation.  Seymour Hersh's idea was an innocent INS missetting in
Alaska (plus a lot of consequent coincidences), but I recall he also
documented that parts of the USAF knew it had been an accident when it
happened, contrasting unfavorably with what Kirkpatrick asserted at the UN.
Johnson agrees with this, as far as I remember, and assembles circumstantial
evidence that this was known at higher levels.  Snyder confirms this
interpretation. (I have not read the ICAO report, nor did I find WWW info on
it.)  Roll on 2008.  Or write to your Congressperson.  And let us all hope
that nothing like this incident ever happens again.

&lt;<A HREF="mailto:ladkin@TechFak.Uni-Bielefeld.DE">ladkin@TechFak.Uni-Bielefeld.DE</A>&gt;
</ADDRESS>
<I>Thu, 12 Sep 1996 16:26:42 +0200</I><PRE>

I sympathise with Dick Mills's (<A HREF="/Risks/18.42.html">RISKS-18.42</A>) desire to try to keep
inaccurate information on airplane crashes out of the public domain.  Robert
Dorsett (<A HREF="/Risks/18.43.html">RISKS-18.43</A>) notes that public discussion is a given, and that even
inaccurate discussion can be beneficial.  To control disinformation, Mills
proposes that people should keep silent until the final accident report is
published.  I don't see how that could help, and I do think it would hinder.

First, the NTSB itself does not follow that procedure.  It issues documents
at regular intervals.  There are frequent press releases, and various
information such as CVR transcripts is available before the docket is
released.  When the docket is complete, it is generally released to the
public.  This is usually many months before the final report appears.  For
example, the public docket for the AA965 accident near Buga, Colombia on 20
Dec 1995 was released on 16 Apr 1996.  I quote: `The enclosed material
contains: factual reports only; no conclusions; no determinations of
probable cause.  Analysis of the accident will occur at a later date.'
(Punctuation mine).

Second, any NTSB information may be considered definitive, as may
information from many other accident investigation boards.  Such authorities
do not `speculate'.  Valid conclusions may be drawn from this definitive
information.  A *valid* conclusion cannot be negated by further information,
so there is little chance that this will contribute to spreading
disinformation.

Third, the most common source of invalid conclusions is some sort of
`closed-world assumption' (as the logic programmers would call it).  That
is, assuming that the information one has is *all* the relevant information.
For instance, knowing the AA965 pilots didn't know where they were and
drawing the conclusion that that was the sole cause of the accident.  That
is, of course, mistaken reasoning.  Better reasoning is to accept that this
is one of probably many causal factors and expect others to be discovered.
Discussion of the accident on that basis is not inappropriate.

At some point, a closed-world assumption must be made (we usually don't
consider gremlins hammering bits off the wing as potential causes, pace The
Twilight Zone).  Such assumptions can be made explicit in any reasoning, as
they should be in final accident reports.  One should also not forget that
much `far-out' speculation bases itself on *not making* the closed-world
assumption that others have made (most conspiracy theories, for example).

Fourth, `peer review', that is, earnest discussion amongst interested
people with various sorts of competence, including dissident opinions,
is an accepted method of improving knowledge, both in academia and outside,
in many societies.  Consider it a psychological or social fact if you will,
but it's a fact nonetheless.

Fifth, accident investigation boards are necessarily composed of a small
number of the available experts in the field.  I don't see any reason why
other competents should be enjoined to keep quiet if there are things to
say.  In particular, journalists are in general not technical experts and
newspaper reports *will* appear that require discussion - and all too often,
it seems, refutation.  I don't see why, for example, a timely comment which
includes such a refutation should wait until after an accident report.

Sixth, there are various interested parties (airplane manufacturers,
airlines, pilot associations, air traffic control authorities, other
government authorities) who have sensitivities that may conflict with a
dispassionate explanation of the accident.  Airlines must keep public
confidence to continue in business.  Pilots and air traffic controllers are
sensitive to their statutory responsibility, and pilot unions may feel that
they are thereby subject to disproportion blame.  Regulatory agencies may be
pressured by executive and regulatory branches of government, who can react
precipitously to the public's precipitous reaction.  Manufacturers are keen
that the design and construction of their airplanes cannot be faulted.
These alternative goals may skew views of accident causes.  I should have
thought that careful public discussion should be welcomed from those with
some competence and no other goal than to try to clarify what happened.

Spurred by <A HREF="/Risks/18.43.html">RISKS-18.43</A>, I called Lexis's 800 number to request removal from
the Ptrax database.  I had to spend about 15 minutes on hold to do so; while
I was on hold, a sweet-voiced recording assured me [PGN has inserted here the
direct quote, provided by <A HREF="mailto:mwexler@Adobe.COM">mwexler@Adobe.COM</A> (Mike Wexler):]

The Ptrax database contains publically available information.
It does not contain any private institution information such as
credit card numbers, bank account information or mother's maiden
names of individuals.  You can not view social security numbers.

When I reached a human being and explained that I wanted to be removed,
guess what was the only information he requested?

All those who said "Your Social Security number" get a prize.  Whether or
not the SSN is hidden, it seems to be a primary key as far as Lexis is
concerned.  The SSN is both necessary and sufficient; Lexis makes no attempt
to verify that the person calling actually owns the Social Security number.
The RISKS, alas, are obvious to everybody except our friends in the database
business.

[REMARK: The SSN information is actually in the database; a given SSN
can be used in queries, but SSNs allegedly cannot be retrieved.  PGN]

&gt; ... you can save a document under Word which includes previous versions.
&gt;        [I think this problem has appeared previously in RISKS.  PGN]

Several times I think ... but the misunderstanding persists.

When Word does a "normal" save with minor changes, it does not rewrite the
entire document.  Instead, it simply appends the changes and whatever
information it requires to place them in the document.  When working with
large documents, especially on slower computers and disks, this makes an
enormous difference in the time required to save a file -- a couple of
seconds vs half a minute, for example.  And since these same small computers
adhere to the "save often or lose it" user-hostile paradigm, a faster save
means fewer unhappy users.

The result is that interpreting a raw dump of a Word file can be quite
difficult, and that many third-party programs that read other word processor
files cannot read Word files unless you first do a "slow save".  Also,
deleted text may at times appear in the raw dump.  This is mostly
unpredictable, and does not consist of a "previous version" being included
in the file.

I was recently the recipient of a large number of faxes from potential job
applicants.  Many of the applicants were students and as such used
university department fax machines where, presumably, they were required to
use their own calling cards to make the long distance call.

In a number of cases, the originating fax machine had an automatic field
displayed at the top of each page showing the number called.  Presented to
me quite clearly was a large number of calling card numbers with each user's
PIN.  Not only is this information displayed to the recepient, but the
sender likely has no idea it's being made available.

According to my rusty memory and 2 minutes of Altavista searching, there is
a U.S. Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 which requires: 1)
identification of the sender at the top or bottom of the first transmitted
page; 2) that unsolicited advertisements shall not be sent without
invitation (which can implicitly be based upon the existence of a business
relationship).

If this Act is not unconstitutional, then it seems that the same type of law
can be written regarding e-mail.  The motivation is the same: 1) senders
should be identified, not allowed to roam ISPs anonymously; 2) the receiver
is paying for the cost of the advertisement, both in real terms (paper or
message charges) and lost opportunity to receive desired items
(out-of-paper, busy phone, mailbox size limits, time required to download
junk e-mail which could have been spent looking for online smut or even
online shopping at a competitor's web page).

After reading Fred Herr's statement,

&gt;&gt; The judge's injunction ... seemed to rest on a comparison of free speech
&gt;&gt; expressed via the USPS as against free speech expressed via on line
&gt;&gt; message services, with the assumption, ... that there is no essential
&gt;&gt; difference.

I had an interesting thought.  Won't it be interesting if the US government
(via its combined legislative and judicial authority) declares that
"guarantee of free speech" applies to commercial advertisements at the cost
of the unwilling recipient but does not apply to non-commercial but
"indecent" communications among consenting adults?

Somehow, such an outcome does not seem even the slightest bit improbable to
me; "inevitable" seems more like it.  How depressing.

None of that may ever come up. There is already a large pile of case law
destroying the notion that First Amendment rights can be cost-shifted.  No
one owes you a printing press, you cannot send junkmail and expect it to be
delivered postage due, and you can't junkfax people.  Spamming cost-shifts
most or all of the expense of advertising on the receiver.  There's no First
Amendment issue (other than AOL's right to exercise editorial control over a
private service, something the TRO rather runs counter to.)  I may not be an
attorney, but AOL's case seems very strong.  The First Amendment protects
expression from interference by government, almost exclusively (there are
exceptions, such as private schools having some limits on the censorship
they may do of student publications, but these exceptions are very narrow,
and are few and far between).  AOL isn't the government, and their system is
not a public space in the legal sense.

The philosophical question of whether AOL ought to have anything to do
with restricting email in any way, even on their own service, is an
important one - even AOL's internal forums have something of the
character of a public, rather than a private, space - but such questions
should probably be consciously and clearly separated from discussion of the
legalities involved, which don't map very well to the theoretics.

Lastly, I think one should applaud AOL for shifting gears toward an
individually-customizable filtration model.  It's far better to have the
choices in the hands of the end user, than in the hands of some
intermediary, even if AOL offers some overridable defaults to filter out,
like Cyber Promotions.

Fred Herr makes some very good points about the negligible costs of spam
versus conventional junk mail, but I think the court erred in its comparison
in a critical way when it cited First Amendment protection for spam.  While
advertisers (and common citizens) have a right to speak, *nobody* can compel
us to PAY to listen.  While the court would certainly find that corporations
have a right to send junk mail or engage in telephone solicitation, they
would rule quite differently if the corporations sent mail postage due, or
tried to call us collect.  The court would rule that we have every right to
refuse to pay.  Since on-line time costs money to the recipient (no matter
how little), the comparison to regular junk mail is not appropriate.  More
appropriate is the FAX, where the owner of the FAX pays for the paper.
Anti-Junk Fax laws were passed to stop "FAX-spamming" if you will, and so
far have been found constitutional.

I think that legislation along the same lines would be appropriate and
constitutional.  Personally, I have a *major* problem with corporations
being afforded constitutional protections as if they were people, but that
is another debate entirely

This is a mind-numbingly trivial point, but I haven't actually seen it
mentioned anywhere in print: if the spammers are so keen on their "right" to
freedom of communication, why is it that the spam I receive seldom has a
valid return address?

Maybe AOL should reject mail not "because it is spam" but "because it does
not contain a valid return address" ?

[You should note that rejecting mail just because its return address is
bad will lose some mail you really wanted.  If RISKS rejected every piece
of mail whose FROM: address is not a valid address, I would have fewer
legitimate contributions to choose from.  But many would-be subscribers
get bounced immediately, because I remove their new-subscription address
as soon as the acknowledgment bounces.  As noted in <A HREF="/Risks/18.39.html">RISKS-18.39</A>, I am
looking forward to the new version of Brent Chapman's majordomo, which
will do that automatically.  PGN]

Repeated attacks by a computer cracker have virtually shut down New York's
Public Access Networks Corp., better known as Panix.  The attacks have
overwhelmed the computers' capacity to respond to requests for an
``electronic handshake'' by sending as many as 150 bogus requests a second.
``This is the first major attack of a kind that I believe to be the final
Internet security problem,'' says a Lucent Technologies Internet security
expert, who says he "has been waiting" for just such an event.  Internet
computers have no quick way of distinguishing these bogus requests from real
ones, and even when security software is upgraded to ease the problem, the
crackers could respond with even more intense assaults.  ``There's going to
be the usual arms race,'' predicts the Lucent security expert, between
improved security measures and crackers' ability to disable them.  (*Wall
Street Journal*, 12 Sep 1996, B1)

technical questions right now because we've got our hands full, but if

[At its heart, this is an unsolvable problem in general.  There are
some useful things you can do against very specific types of attacks,
but there are too many types of attacks for a comprehensive defense.
The best you can do in the near future might be to have some
early-detection capabilities to detect emerging attacks and then
reconfigure dynamically accordingly.  In the long run, it might be
desirable to have more secure systems overall, which would require
(among other things) nontrivial authentication (i.e., NOT fixed passwords)
for any resource that might be abused.  However, without draconian
measures, denials of service will always be possible, whether they
occur accidentally or intentionally.  De RISKibus non disputandum est?

MobilCom, a subsidiary of German TeleKom (since 100 years monopolist onn
telephone communication in Germany, with its monopoly ending in 1998)
publicly offers 100,000 DM to a telephone hacker who is able to communicate
at the expense of the (national) number 0171-3289966. The related chipcard
is said to be safely stored in lawyer`s office. In an attempt to paint this
dubious offer somewhat "politically correct", the successful hacker will
have to donate his earnings to a social institution of his(her) choice.

Background of this offer is a recent magazine report informing the public
that German hackers know relevant details of the encryption algorithm (A5)
implemented in GSM mobile phones; this algorithm was always quoted to be
"secure" by GSM producers and service providers. According to the magazine`s
informant (a 22 year old male), he had informed German Telekom (provider of
D1 mobile phone services) with details in May 1995. TV reports next week may
"demonstrate" of how such knowledge may be used.

The story is "old vine in new bottles". Since GSM was specified in a joint
European (essentially UK/French/German) exercise, material (though
restricted to producers of GSM hardware and service personnel) were
"available" in early 1990s, including the PSL code on which the encryption
hardware is based. GSM methods implement an authentication process with
which the caller`s chipcard-based key is compared with the database of
applicable keys; after successful authentication, a session key is generated
which is used by the encryption algorithm (A5) to "unbreakably" encrypt the
communication. (Btw: for export to non-European countries, a weaker
algorithm A5x is available; this approach is similar to NSAs policy of
exporting US crypto methods :-)

"Security" of A5 and, more interestingly, A3/A8 (the algorithms for
authentication and generation of session key) are "secure because they are
not publicly known" (well-known principle of "Security by Obscurity"). This
assumption was wrong as independent experts got copies of GSM algorithms
(written in PSL) and could determine the effective length. Among others,
Ross Anderson reported (on Internet) in 1994 about insecurity of A5 (he even
published a C version of this algorithm which could have been used in
determining weaknesses). In 1993, an expert group in a UK university had
easily cracked about 75% of the 114-bit key protecting communication.

GSM technology is used in 3 different German mobile phone services (D1, D2
and E-Plus) with more than 4,5 mio users. On the background of the media
reports, users should look at details (when telephone with which number how
long) more regularly, as falsification of individual chip cards may now
become a new hacker sport, with the generous offer of Mobil Com.

I've recently been reading Donald Norman's latest book, _Things That
Make Us Smart_ (ISBN 0-201-62695-0 pbk).  Instead of reviewing it,
though, I'm going to illustrate how it has changed my thinking by
criticizing a portion of an article I read last night in my partner's
Wesleyan alumni magazine (Vol. LXXIX No. 1, Summer 1996).

"Which Way?" (author unclear) talks about the work of Scott Plous
(Associate Professor of Psychology) and specifically his book _The
Psychology of Judgement and Decision-Making_ (McGraw-Hill, 1993).
Here's a quote from the article:

Plous indicates how easily decision-making can go awry with an example
drawn from a thirty-nine question survey at the beginning of his book:
"Linda is 31 years old, single, outspoken, and very bright.  She
majored in philosophy.  As a student, she was deeply concerned with
issues of discrimination and social justice, and also participated in
antinuclear demonstrations."

"Which is more likely," he asks, "That Linda is a back teller, or that
Linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement?"  Most
people guess that Linda is more likely to be a bank teller *and* a
feminist; that choice seems to be intuitively correct.  Yet adding
detail to a scenario does not increase its likelihood.  The more
general statement -- that Linda is a bank teller -- poses the fewest
restrictions and is the probable.  Plous's point: Mathematical
probability, not intuition, should guide this choice.  To do otherwise
is to use a flawed decision-making process that increases the
likelihood of error.

Before reading Norman's _Things That Make Us Smart_ (TTMUS), I would
have simply nodded at the quote and continued reading.  This time,
though, my immediate (almost experiential ;-) reaction was, "This is
wrong!"

TTMUS contains a large section on the fallacy of confusing formal logic
with "logic of language".  The six pages starting at 227 point this out
particularly clearly.  In the quote above, much is made of Linda's
activism; when choosing an answer, "bank teller" is almost certainly
dismissed by most people as being irrelevant to the story -- this would
be made much clearer by asking whether Linda is more likely to be a bank
teller or a computer programmer.

Which bring us back to RISKS: in user interface design, we must be
careful which information we present to the user and how we present it,
because the user will *not* interpret the information according to the
rules of formal logic.  I strongly recommend that everyone here pick up
a copy of TTMUS; with any luck, it will change the way you think, too.

[Background:] I am a pilot who flys a small airplane equipped with a GPS
satellite navigation system approved by the Federal Aviation Administration
for use in clouds (IFR). I have been experiencing in flight warnings that
the system has been (flagged) unusable somewhere around 1% of the time it is
used. Lest you think this is trivial, you can consider driving a car whose
windshield went opaque 1% of the time you were driving.

So far I have been told the following:

1) Some early GPS's were shipped with a defective Digital Signal Processing
chip. This was corrected in later units.

2) Several different models have substantially similar computational
algorithms.

3) When sufficient satellites are received, some units discard barometric
altitude information for purposes of position calculations. A satellite
declaring itself "healthy" is NEVER discarded automatically in these units.
Erroneous computed GPS altitude is a good warning indication of a bad
position fix. Usually barometric altitude is more accurate than the altitude
civilian GPS units compute from satellites (because of SA/AS).

4) US DOD mandates testing GPS units in its inventory against jamming. This
testing has resulted in interference to civilian units to a radius of some
100 miles.

5) Commercial GPS satellite simulators are widely available.

6) Were one to hook up a GPS satellite simulator to an amplifier and
antenna, one could disable many civilian GPS's at will. IFR certified units
would give RAIM warnings, but would not give usable navigation information.
(RAIM is a consistency check of computed positions found generally only in
IFR certified GPS units)

7) All GPS units lacking automatic satellite elimination capability are
likely to be similarly vulnerable. Presently, automatic satellite
elimination is mostly on GPS intended for sole means of navigation
overwater.

8) VFR (not certified by the FAA for use in clouds) only GPS units are not
required to indicate that their computed positions are erroneous.

9) Because GPS is extremely accurate almost all the time, many pilots have
fallen into the habit of trusting GPS positions without cross checking
against other means of navigation, or even against the computed errors
displayable by the GPS unit itself.

I would greatly appreciate knowing of any errors in this information and/or
additional information relevant to civilian GPS navigation use.

I think one can assume that a pilot getting a wrong position at night in the
mountains, or no position in clouds in the mountains could have a problem.

Mr. Dorsett, in <A HREF="/Risks/18.43.html">RISKS-18.43</A>, and Mr. Ladkin, in <A HREF="/Risks/18.44.html">RISKS-18.44</A>, disagree with
my call for discretion in public speculation about airline disasters, in
RISKS 18.42.

Both argue that open and lively dissuasion of the issues can have real
value.  True, but neither man offers substantial reasons why such
discussions aren't equally valuable if conducted more discretely. I also
think their arguments also show single-mindedness in that airline safety and
finding the correct conclusion are the only factors to consider.

Publicity about airline accidents makes people fear flying. Some fraction of
those people will choose to drive to their destination, using a much more
dangerous mode of transportation.  Public discussions could increase airline
safety but result in a net decline in total public safety. I can't prove
that the net change is positive or negative, nor do I believe anyone else
can prove it. Nevertheless, neglecting the secondary consequences of public
debates is shallow.

I may also have overstated my call for discretion in my original message.  I
have no wish to stifle serious discussion among technically oriented
interested parties.  I merely object to it being done in such a public
forum.  Surely we can arrange more closed forums or e-mail list servers.
Total secrecy and security aren't necessary, but a little more discretion
is.  If the NTSB is indiscreet, it too should be censured.  It should not be
interpreted as a signal that it is OK for us to be indiscreet too.

The Internet, Usenet in particular, is one of the most public forums ever
invented.  This is a particularly inappropriate place for sensitive
subjects.

American daytime TV has been filled with talk programs that show people
discussing the most sensitive and sensational subjects imaginable. The
public seems to enjoy the voyeurism.  I expect that nearly all of us detest
this development.  Is it surprising to realize that we may be unwittingly
engaging in analogous activities?

Finally, I must take strong exception to one part of what Mr. Dorsett
wrote:

- The author of _Unheeded Warning_ notes his concerns (as a pilot)
of the safety of the ATR-72 in icing conditions long prior to the
eventual October 1994 crash.  His book notes explicit steps taken to
keep the issue alive in the media and thereby bringing political
pressure to bear on the NTSB and FAA to maintain appropriate
perspective in both the investigation and regulation of the
aircraft.  This pressure arguably resulted in FAA mandates to adjust
the design of the anti-ice system on the airplane.  Similar pressure
was absent after a similar crash in 1988 in the Italian Alps.

If the facts were as Mr. Dorsett states, I think this is deplorable.  Just
think what it means to "keep the issue alive in the media and thereby
bringing political pressure to bear".  This subjects questions of
engineering safety to the same kind of handling as the O.J. Simpson trial.
It stirs up fear among the general public to give the issue emotional
strength and appeal. The word that describes precisely that set of
circumstances is demagoguery.  Demagoguery is never praiseworthy.

(My apologies to non-native English speakers.  I understand that demagoguery
is one of the least translatable words in the entire English language, but
in this case, it is the only word that fits.)

Mr. Dorsett expands on that theme when he says "It's a political world, not
a technical one."  I say no, never.  Mixing demagoguery and science is
irresponsible.  It must never be tolerated.

Bear Giles points out that Win95's handling of passwords is annoying. What's
more, it points out the poor system design because there is no correlation
between system, screen saver, or on-line login passwords. As has been
pointed out by many, Win95 is an unsecure operating system.

I learned this in a most amusing way recently, when I was setting up my new
Hitachi notebook computer. The first task was to install Windows 95 and
select a password. After rebooting, I decided to see just how secure it was
and typed the password incorrectly several times. Each was rejected, but
then I clicked on "Cancel" in the dialog box and -- lo and behold! I was
granted access.

<A HREF="/Risks/18.42.html">RISKS-18.42</A> and 18.43 discussed the possibility of passwords being found
in core files. While it is certainly a risk, there are mitigating
factors: 1) a program has to crash at a time when it still has a password
in memory, 2) an attacker must have access to the resulting core file, and
3) the attacker must inspect or copy the core file before the user (or
possibly the system) gets rid of it.

A much worse risk, and one which is unbelievably still with us, is the
storage of cleartext passwords in "password-protected" files. There is no
need for a program to take an unusual action (crash) at a particular time,
nor is there usually any time limit, since the resulting file is usually
desired by the user and kept around for some time, if not permanently.

This risk was brought to mind recently when I had a need to break into a
password-protected file that is part of a product made by the company I
work for. The file is used to install certain macros in another company's
product and the macros are password-protected to prevent accidental changes
by end users. We (the development team) knew what the password was supposed
to be, but it wasn't working. On an off-chance, I opened the file in a text
editor and started scrolling through the mostly binary contents. Toward the
end of the file, I found a string which matched the supposed password but
differed in case, which both turned out to be the password and explained
the problem. Bad enough that the password was stored in cleartext, but it
caught my eye because it was preceded by the cleartext string "Password:"!

For us, this lack of security doesn't matter, since the password
protection is intended only to discourage accidents and our support group
will give the password to any user who needs it. Others may not be so
lucky, and of course who knows what other currently-shipping products may
suffer from the same risk?

I think it's crucial to point out that the court *did not* base the TRO on
free speech law, contrary to the suggestion of some RISKS readers.  Even
Cyberpromo's lawyer has stated that their argument was based on theories
like tortious interference with contract, and not on any supposed First
Amendment right.

I agree that the TRO was improperly issued, but I think too much has been
read into it.  It's simply the judge's way of preserving the status quo so
he doesn't have to think hard about the issues until trial.  (It's crucial
in this respect to remember that the TRO was issued in the context of an
ongoing lawsuit between the parties.)

another mailing list (Keith Bostic's /dev/null list), in my responses to
junk e-mail these days.  So far I haven't yet received junk e-mail on my
home computer while it had a printer attached, but one of these days...

Under US Code Title 47, Sec.227(b)(1)(C):

"It shall be unlawful for any person within the United States to
use any telephone facsimile machine, computer, or other device
to send an unsolicited advertisement to a telephone facsimile
machine"

A "telephone facsimile machine" is defined in Sec.227(a)(2)(B) as:

"equipment which has the capacity to transcribe text or images
(or both) from an electronic signal received over a regular
telephone line onto paper."

Under this definition, an e-mail account, modem, computer and printer
together constitute a fax machine.

The rights of action are as follows.  Under Sec.227(b)(3)(B):

"A person or entity may, if otherwise permitted by the laws or
rules of court of a State, bring in an appropriate court of
that State --

(A) an action based on a violation of this subsection or the
regulations prescribed under this subsection to enjoin
such violation,
(B) an action to recover for actual monetary loss from such a
violation, or to receive $500 in damages for each such
violation, whichever is greater, or
(C) both such actions. If the court finds that the defendant
willfully or knowingly violated this subsection or the
regulations prescribed under this subsection, the court
may, in its discretion, increase the amount of the award
to an amount equal to not more than 3 times the amount
available under subparagraph (B) of this paragraph."

*The Washington Post* 13 Sep 1996 reports that a software error caused the
wrong lottery numbers to be distributed to the state's 3,800 outlets.  More
than 22,000 people successfully bet on one or more of the numbers, but threw
out their tickets thinking they lost.  Others mistakenly thought they had
won.  Getting one or two numbers right gets people $1-$5, although two
people bet numbers entitling them to $5000 in this six-state lottery.

The firm, which recently won the contract to run Maryland's lottery
games, stated that the numbers were correctly entered, but two of the
six numbers were altered in the transmission process.  A spokesman
said, "To the best of our knowledge, it was a software error."  The
Post noted that the firm recently lost its contract in Arizona due to
computer problems.

Evidently, one of the RISKS is getting bad press.

Engineer Killed

&gt;&gt;   HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif. (AP, 13 Sep 1996) -- A spider may have
&gt;&gt;tripped a motion-sensitive alarm, and a police dog was out sick.
&gt;&gt;Authorities say the combination led to the accidental killing
&gt;&gt;of an elderly man.

&gt;&gt;   On another night, a police dog instead of an officer with
&gt;&gt;pistol drawn would have searched the darkened manufacturing
&gt;&gt;business where 77-year-old Theodore E. Franks was shot and
&gt;&gt;killed Wednesday.

o	Dogs normally check our burglar alarms, but police were down to one
dog, and that dog was sick.

o	Third alarm in seven months, second in 48 hours.

o	Franks living inside the company so he could work during the hours
he otherwise would have been commuting.

[DMK: Inverse telecommuting?]

o	Police officer checking building found Franks unlocked room,
entered, was startled by Franks and accidentally shot him in the leg.  Shot
him in the femoral artery.  Franks died of exsanguination before he could
reach the hospital.

&gt;&gt;   "After hearing the facts, I think it's pretty obvious this
&gt;&gt;was an accident," Wayne Franks said after visiting the office
&gt;&gt;where his father was shot.

&gt;&gt;   [Alarm Company] checked the alarm system Thursday,
&gt;&gt;telling company owner [name deleted] a spider probably set it off,
&gt;&gt;The Orange County Register reported Friday.

&gt;&gt;   "I feel bad. It was my alarm," [name} said. "That damn spider."

According to an interview with Margot Kidder in People Online, a computer
virus was the last straw leading to her nervous breakdown.

The virus (not identified) on her computer destroyed files, including the
book she had been working for three years. Having, apparently, no backup
copies, the entire work was lost. This loss triggered her widely reported
nervous breakdown.

Must go and back up this message before I post it....

The primary network that serves Minnesota (the Minnesota Regional Network)
was cut off from the Internet for 12 hours today [15 Sep 1996].  (My
understanding is that *all* major nets and systems, private and public, in
Minnesota ultimately get their connection to the rest of the world through
MR.Net.)  Following are the initial announcement that they had discovered
they had been cut off and the final announcement indicating service had been
restored:

&gt; Date: Sun, 15 Sep 1996 10:35:22 -0500 (CDT)
&gt; To: <A HREF="mailto:all@MR.Net">all@MR.Net</A>
&gt; Subject: NET-DOWN: MRNet isolated from rest of Internet...
&gt;
&gt; Greetings,
&gt;
&gt; MRNet has become isolated from the rest of the Internet.  The T3 line to
&gt; InternetMCI is up, but we are not receiving the routing table.  We have no
&gt; details on what happened, or the extent of the problem.  InternetMCI is
&gt; working on the problem, currently they do not have an estimated time to
&gt; repair.  According to MRNet's network monitoring we have been isolated
&gt; since about quarter to 6 this morning (Sunday).

&gt; Date: Sun, 15 Sep 1996 19:28:36 -0500 (CDT)
&gt; To: <A HREF="mailto:all@MR.Net">all@MR.Net</A>
&gt; Subject: NET-UP: Routing restored from MCI
&gt;
&gt; Greetings,
&gt;
&gt; MCI routing was restored at 19:15 today.  Downtime was over 12 hours.
&gt; MRNet will be checking routing tables to see that we are getting most of
&gt; the routes we should, and will be spot checking networks to make sure that
&gt; our routing announcements are getting out.
&gt;
&gt; There has been no official word from InternetMCI as to the specific cause of
&gt; this outage, or why it took more than 12 hours to fix.  MRNet will be
&gt; following up with InternetMCI to get an explanation on Monday.

FURTHER MESSAGE FROM TED:

Date: Mon, 16 Sep 1996 16:53:53 -0500
&gt;From: <A HREF="mailto:tmplee@MR.Net">tmplee@MR.Net</A> (Theodore M.P. Lee)
Subject: Minnesota Cut Off From the World For 12 Hours!

This morning's paper [16 Sep 1996] here in Minneapolis had a bit more on it
-- the head of MR.Net said he had heard of problems as far away as Seattle
and Atlanta.  I was out all day and if there has been an explanation MR.Net
hasn't sent it out.  Probably no point to adding this to the RISKs item
until an explanation is forthcoming.

&gt;Yesterday, the Downers Grove node of CICNet (much of the Big 10, plus
&gt;Notre Dame, the University of Chicago, and other schools) was also cut
&gt;off from the outside world by InternetMCI... perhaps it was a related outage.

I was looking at VeriSign's web page, in particular their Certification
Practice Statement (CPS).  &lt;URL:https://www.verisign.com/repository/CPS&gt;

Buried among the legal gobblygook, I found the following:

"the certificate is being used exclusively for authorized and legal
purposes, consistent with this CPS," from Section 7.2.(v), Representations
by Subscriber Upon Acceptance,

and

"By accepting a certificate, the subscriber assumes a duty to retain
control of the subscriber's private key, to use a trustworthy system, and to
take reasonable precautions to prevent its loss, disclosure, modification,
or unauthorized use." from Section 7.3, Subscriber Duty to Prevent Private
Key Disclosure.

I do not understand what Section 7.2 is supposed to mean.  Authorized by
whom? Legal according to which country's laws? Section 7.3's requirement "to
use a trustworthy system" would seem to eliminate about 99.5% of the market:
almost all computers are not trustworthy, even if they are (in practice)
trusted.

RISKS: Although you agree to all of this (and that you've read it) before
you receive your VeriSign certificate, it is not reasonable to expect people
to wade through a 13-chapter work.

If almost nobody meets the requirements for using VeriSign, what good is it?
Who accepts the risk of something going wrong, when the conditions for use
are not met, and VeriSign issued a certificate knowing that these conditions
are not met?  A false sense of security can be worse than no security....

&gt;It seems incomprehensible that aircraft avionics that MUST frequently

&gt;of electronic devices is based entirely on unsubstantiated anecdotal
&gt;evidence.

Well, here's some anecdotal evidence. About 3 years ago, I was in seat 1D on
a Delta MD88 flying at cruise altitude over NE New Mexico on a clear summer
afternoon.  A flight attendant came out of the cockpit (fightdeck?) and with
a clear sense of urgency made a PA announcement to turn off all portable
electronic devices and instructed the other FAs to check all the passengers.
They quickly reported that the only device in use was a laptop in seat 2C
(right behind me) and this guy was having trouble saving his file so he
hadn't turned it off yet. The first FA said "I'm sorry sir, but you have to
turn it off NOW!" He did. She went back into the cockpit, and came out about
two minutes later. She went over to the guy in 2B, apologized, and said that
when the captain called her into the cockpit the first time (this is an
exact quote) "All the gauges were black." (The MD88 has a "glass" cockpit.)
She said that they were just now coming back on. She then said (I'm not
making this up) "The captain wants to know if you have a Compaq computer."
He said, with surprise, "Why, yes, it IS a Compaq." It was a older one with
an external mouse. I told them that I had read somewhere that external mice
greatly exacerbated the problem. I then had another cup of coffee.

It made a true believer out of me.

&gt; Mr. Dorsett expands on that theme when he says "It's a political world, not
&gt; a technical one."  I say no, never.  Mixing demagoguery and science is
&gt; irresponsible.  It must never be tolerated.

OK, let's be more blunt.

The Federal Aviation Administration has long been criticised for its dual
charter of both enforcing safety and encouraging the development of air
commerce.  The two roles are contradictory, representing an inherent
conflict of interest. This does not reflect upon the character of the many
skilled and motivated individuals that work there.  But the agency's
existence and function is based upon constraints that are often defined by
external parties, and the people that make up the FAA must work within those
constraints.  Just to make it clear, those constraints are "political," not
"scientific."

In the specific case you find "deplorable," actions taken to challenge the
operation of the ATR-72 in the US, the author makes credible points that
external influences--namely, the ramifications of a bilateral accord, in
which the US is obligated to accept the findings of the European
airworthiness authorities; economic events which had nothing to do with the
certification process; and French threats of reprisals against US
aircraft--were factors in the FAA's action (or inaction).

Faced with such heavy-duty forces, the author exploited media interest in
the October 1994 crash to point out what his concerns (as a pilot) were.  He
initially gave a public interview on a daytime talk show, and, eventually,
churned out the book. He states he did so out of concern for the safety of
the flying public.  It is arguable that the media attention influenced the
political climate.  No bureaucracy wants to be seen as fallible, and it is
equally arguable that ongoing pressure forced action on the issues.

I fail to see why this is unacceptable.  Particularly given the criteria
that you yourself have laid out, namely that it is an expert attempting to
manipulate the system in his favor.

If we lived in a science-fiction world in which some mysterious quantity
called Truth were feasible and easily obtained, then, yes, I suppose we
could live in a quasi-fascist society in which the anointed protect the
unwashed masses from the ambiguities of life.

However, we do not live in such a world.  In our world, issues often reflect
the vested interests of multiple parties, all of whom may be "in the right,"
but who may nonetheless have conflicting agendas.  There are many checks and
balances in such circumstances.  The government has competing agencies
(e.g., NTSB vs. FAA) to ensure that institutional cultures do not get out of
hand. The public can comment via its elected officials and the free press.
The victims' families can react via their lawyers. If information is
suppressed and kept in the province of "experts," the system stops working.

Creating star chambers is not the answer, particularly when it affects
operations in such a huge industry, in which MANY qualified individuals are
in credible positions to comment, and, especially, in a situation when SO
many peoples' lives can be put on the line.

I concede that investigation teams need room to work.  The NTSB freely
concedes that it must make periodic reports on the status of its
investigations.  It does not issue a probable cause statement until the
final report is issued.  However, your model implies that no discussion
whatsoever should take place until that final report is released.  That's
just unrealistic, in my opinion.  It is contrary to safety and even ignores
the interests of the affected parties--particularly the traveling public.

Just got my brand new AT&amp;T residential long-distance statement. Of course, I
pay "electronically". The quotes mean that I do it through my fancy computer
with Internet connectivity. And then the check gets printed out on wood
pulp, physically hauled in a mail sack to AT&amp;T's post office box, removed
from the envelope, and then some clerk (automated?) keys it in and credits
it to my account.

As error-prone as this process is, it sort of worked since the account number
had a check digit which gave some hope of correctly crediting the account. My
new account number no longer has the additional digits which, I'd assumed,
were a combination of unique code and check digit. Now a single slip of a
keystroke and my check gets credit to another's phone bill. But at least, the
new bill is pretty with an Olympic logo and AT&amp;T's corporate logo. Who cares
about the data.

To be honest, it isn't clear that companies really used the check
information anyway. The attitude, as with credit card companies, seems to be
deposit and, if someone complains, and verifies by showing the back of a
physical check (which banks try to not provide any more), you might convince
them that you really paid and they just miscredited it.

One day, in the far far future, there may be a course in "data integrity" as
part of the accounting or MIS curriculum Until them, may your checks find
the right home more often than not.

In <A HREF="/Risks/18.44.html">RISKS-18.44</A>, Edward Reid explains how Word saves files.  But it's worse
than what he describes.  I'm working on a Word 6 document (under Windows
3.1), trying to excise some references to obsolete terms.  I searched for
and deleted all of the references, and did a "Save As" to ensure that I'm
creating a new file without any "leftovers" from earlier versions.  Doing a
search doesn't find any references to the deleted terms, but the "Find File"
option (and utilities such as Norton Desktop's SuperFind) still locate the
supposedly deleted text.  So I presume they're somewhere in the file, which
gives me very little confidence in the safety of handing someone a Word
file.

The difference between this and previous discussions of the topic (I
believe) are that others have indicated that doing a "Save As" or disabling
the "Fast Save" option would avoid this behavior.  That's clearly not the
case, for at least some versions of Word.

Aside from the gratuitous insults, the below RISKS posting is also factually
incorrect in a number of places.

The resource modification done below is *NOT* a modification to the file on
the disk. It is done via a copy-on-write mechanism. The page containing the
modified resource is written out to the paging file, not back to the
original image. So there is no difference in the exe and whatever you ship
to production IS THE SAME AS THE ONE THAT WAS TESTED.

Writing to a read-only resource does not cause a crash for the customer.
The default unhandled exception filter for any Win32 application handles
access violations caused by writing to a resource by changing the protection
on the page from read-only (the default for resource sections) to
copy-on-write and restarts the instruction. It will now succeed, but the
modified page is written to the paging file instead of back to the original
image. For more gory details, see KB article Q126630 "Resource sections are
read-only" at <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/kb/developr/win32dk/q126630.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/kb/developr/win32dk/q126630.htm</A>

There are two reasons this behavior will cause you pain. You will see a
first-chance exception if you are running under a debugger and have the
debugger configured to handle first-chance exceptions for access violations.
If you don't understand the difference between first-chance exceptions
(exception filter functions have not executed) and second-chance exceptions
this can be confusing.
<A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/kb/developr/win32dk/q105675.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/kb/developr/win32dk/q105675.htm</A> should help you out
here.

Second, if your code has a filter function that handles this exception
before the top-level exception filter sees it, the right thing is not going
to happen. This is a RISK you always take when your exception filter handles
exceptions it doesn't know how to handle.

Microsquish Stealth Bug Insertion Technology

While I'm kind of dismayed by the "if you can't innovate, litigate"
philosophy so often applied to Microsoft, this is a particularly lethal
little gem from their MFC team.  In many development environments, this
problem will almost certainly guarantee that your app will crash the first
time it is executed on customer machines, but the crash will only happen
once, and will mystify tech support.

The problem arises in the use of property pages, otherwise known as tabbed
notebook dialogs, as they are designed and implemented in the Visual C++/MFC
environment.  VC allows the developer to use interactive resource editors to
design the property pages, but IT ONLY DOES THE FINAL STEP OF THE PROCESS IN
EXECUTING THE APPLICATION, not in the development cycle.  This step, where
the style of the page is changed in the resource will cause most machines to
abort the software as it is attempting to change a read only resource.

What really concerns me from a risks perspective is that the traditional
development model is to release an exe to the test/qa group, and then to
ship this exe to production when it receives a blessing from test/qa.  This
means that the exe shipped to production IS NOT THE SAME AS THE ONE THAT WAS
TESTED, because the tested exe has been executed, and the one sent to
production has not.  Hence, every customer who launches the app for the
first time will be rewarded with a crash, which can never be reproduced.

Yes, you can get around it with careful use of filtered exceptions.  The
problem is that this is rather insidious, and outside the realm of thinking
of most developers, who view an exe as the final product of the development
process.  In this case, the final product is an executed exe.

Personally, I feel this is a lot like the Monty Python "Frog chocolates"
sketch.  VC too should have a great big warning sticker on it saying "An EXE
from the linker is NOT A PRODUCT.  YOU MUST EXECUTE IT TO MAKE A PRODUCT."

-- -- -- -- -- -- ORIGINAL MICROSOFT DOCUMENTATION    -- -- -- -- -- --
Applies to class CPropertyPage, specifically the DoModal function that
causes the page to be presented on the screen.

virtual int DoModal( );

[... standard usage documentation deleted...]
[HERE IS THE INTERESTING BIT!!!]

Note.  The first time a property page is created from its corresponding
dialog resource, it may cause a first-chance exception. This is a result of
the property page changing the style of the dialog resource to the required
style prior to creating the page. Because resources are generally read-only,
this causes an exception. The exception is handled by the system, and a copy
of the modified resource is made automatically by the system. The
first-chance exception can thus be ignored.  Since this exception must be
handled by the operating system, do not wrap calls to
CPropertySheet::DoModal with a C++ try/catch block in which the catch
handles all exceptions, for example, catch (...). This will handle the
exception intended for the operating system, causing unpredictable behavior.
Using C++ exception handling with specific exception types or using
structured exception handling where the Access Violation exception is passed
through to the operating system is safe, however.

The system could have been configured so that it would have been difficult

Windows 95 security may not be its best aspect, but even a certified secure
product is only secure with respect to its security claims and only then
under certain conditions - eg, the procedures in the accompanying Trusted

&gt; In the Supreme Court decision, the Court said that our right to be

However there's an interesting interaction between US and UK laws here. We
have a Computer Misuse Act which makes it an offence to alter any data on
any computer without proper authorisation. If I declare that unsolicited
e-mail advertising to this node is unauthorised (and this I hereby do) then
anyone sending such mail to me is committing a criminal offence.

The US telephone service is required, under international treaties, to
prevent this.

In all the discussions on junk snail mail I see, there are many comments
about the time required to sort through it (which may or may not be the
basis for a legal case), but I've seen few comments about the direct cost of
throwing away the junk mail.

If we can enact a junk fax act on the basis of direct cost, we can
probably do so for snail junk as well.

Having tried to quash this theory repeatedly, I'm discouraged to see it
re-emerge yet again in RISKS.  The fact is that courts are not going to read
TCPA as applying to junk e-mail.  Most of the reasons are set out in the
NetGuide article whose URL I gave in my previous message.  I won't repeat
those arguments here, but here are two I didn't have room for in print:

1) Section 227(d)(1)(B) of Title 47 makes it illegal

to use a computer or other electronic device to send any message via a
telephone facsimile machine unless such person clearly marks, in a
margin at the top or bottom of each transmitted page of the message or
on the first page of the transmission, the date and time it is sent
and an identification of the business, other entity, or individual
sending the message and the telephone number of the sending machine
or of such business, other entity, or individual.

Note this section applies to noncommercial messages as well as
commercial ones.

If a computer equipped as described by Dan Franklin were really a TFM for
purposes of the TCPA, then almost every Usenet post (and a vast amount of
e-mail) would be illegal, since it is highly unusual for senders to put
their telephone numbers in the headers.  (I leave aside entirely the problem
of what a "page" is in an e-mail message, other than to observe that this is
further evidence that Congress had only conventional faxes in mind.)

BTW, it is not an adequate response to say "oh, but 'telephone number' here
just means your correct e-mail address."  If you're not willing to read
"telephone number" literally, why on earth should anyone adopt a
hyperliteral reading of the definition of a TFM in sec. 227(a)?

2) Suppose someone in your company sends e-mail to the two dozen people in
his/her working group advertising a bake sale or yard sale.  Assume further
that a single recipient reads this e-mail on a networked PC equipped with a
modem and printer.  Under the proposed broad reading of the TCPA, this would
be illegal.  Is that what Congress intended?  (The legislative history
certainly doesn't offer any support for it.)

FWIW, there are no cases addressing this question of whether junk e-mail is
covered by the TCPA.  Frankly, I think the issue will be moot before very
long; this is too hot (and vote-getting) an issue to be ignored by Congress,
which has been more than willing to legislate rules for the Internet this
year.

INTERFERENCE WITH MEDICAL DEVICES

There is an article on the effects of interference on medical devices,
``Electromagnetic interference and medical devices'', *Health Letter*,
Public Citizen Health Research Group, 12, 6, June 1996, pp, 6-7.  Apnea
monitors have failed to sound the alarm when patients have stopped
breathing.  At least one implanted defibrillator has failed, responding to
EMI and delivering a shock to a normally functioning heart.  Power
wheelchairs have also been affected.  The greatest risk still appears to be
implanted heart pacemakers, for which various problems are included in the
RISKS archives.  EMI is particularly problematic in hospitals, where
sensitive monitors converge with radiating equipment (e.g., high-frequency
generators and electrosurgical, diathermy, MRI, and x-ray machines).
Cellular telephones are also a serious concern as emitters.  Wireless
technologies are likely to make things worse.

The July 1996 issue of *Health Letter* summarizes the reports of two more
recent studies on the effects of cellular phones on pacemakers.  In the
first study, tests of analog phones (90% of today's cellular phones) showed
minimal interference (3% of the time), while *all* of the digital phones
caused some level of interference.  In the second study, 30 types of
pacemakers were tested.  Motorola's MIRS (used in foreign markets) caused
EMI in 36% of those pacemakers within 3.5 inches or less.  North American
Digital Cellular phones interacted with 10% of the pacemakers within 1.5
inches.

MISCELLANEOUS MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE PROBLEM

Incidentally, the September 1996 issue of *Health Letter* notes a Class II
recall of 7200-series microprocessor ventilators (in particular, 7200ae, e,
and sp with certain serial numbers, 8402 in all), which can stop operating
when they are first turned on -- due to defective software.  The
manufacturer is Nellcor Puritan Bennett, Carlsbad CA, 1-800-255-6773.  (2987
units of the model 7200 are also being recalled because of a defective
transducer that causes it to stop ventilation for certain data-dependent
settings.)

INTERFERENCE WITH AIRPLANES

There is an excellent article on the effects of electromagnetic inference on
airplanes: Tekla S. Perry and Linda Geppert, ``Do portable electronics
endanger flights?  The evidence mounts'', *IEEE Spectrum*, September 1996,
pp. 26-33.  Check it out.  I learned a lot.

[<A HREF="mailto:ham@cs.utexas.edu">ham@cs.utexas.edu</A> (Hamilton Richards Jr.) summarized the *Spectrum*
article as follows:
The risk that RF emissions from carry-on electronic devices will affect
avionics, although not high, is still high enough to warrant tougher

A copy of the warning letter crossed my display on 11 Sep 1996, and
immediately triggered the feeling of don't trust the information without
checking (the multiple levels of quoting by the time it got to my desk for
instance).  So, I decided to do some checking using alta vista and dejanews.

One of the first things I discovered was that the product in question is not
called ptrax (though Lotus produces something with that name) but rather
P-Trak and that warnings first went out in early June about it.[1] Before
that time Social Security Numbers were visible, afterwards they weren't
though they were still in the database.  I also found the description of the
product (date unknown, but I think June of this year).

<A HREF="http://www.lexis-nexis.com/lncc/products/media/issue396.html">http://www.lexis-nexis.com/lncc/products/media/issue396.html</A>

Lexis-Nexis also seems to have put the following up within the last day
or so:

<A HREF="http://www.lexis-nexis.com/lncc/about/ptrak.html">http://www.lexis-nexis.com/lncc/about/ptrak.html</A>

I also noted that the database lists the person's maiden name (not the
person's mother's maiden name, as stated in the warning message), though
given a large enough database a searcher might be able to figure out your
mother's maiden name.  [It is also typically on your birth certificate,
which is public-record stuff.  PGN]

Risks: Most of us seem to have accepted the message without much checking as
even the simplest check should have turned up the correct spelling of the
product name (though admittedly by phone p-trak and ptrax could sound the
same).  In this case, most of the information was correct -- but will this
always be true?

Official statement form MR.Net, 16 Sep 1996, sent to a technical list:

&gt; InternetMCI's network experienced periodic outages on national scale from
&gt; approximately 3:30am til 10:00pm CDT yesterday.  The effects of the outage
&gt; were not uniform network wide.  MRNet was one of the harder hit, CICNet and
&gt; NorthWestNet were also badly hit.  The Seattle area seems to be the hardest
&gt; hit.  Some InternetMCI customers are said to have seen nothing but slow
&gt; downs.  At one point the BGP routing to several of NAPs were affected.

&gt; The outage was caused by a bug in Cisco routers that was triggered certain
&gt; network events.  The nature of these events and why they have not shown up
&gt; until now has not been determined.  InternetMCI is still investigating all
&gt; the data gathered from the failure, until this is complete nothing is
&gt; being suggested or ruled out."

We at U of M were disconnected from the world for more than 12 hours.
Starting at ~5am on Sunday the 15th, MCI was upgrading their routers.  The
engineer I talked to at the the MCI NOC said that something went wrong
during the upgrade and all the software (I'm not sure if it was the actual
software, or the routing information) was fried.  Our connectivity to the
Internet was pretty much gone at that point ... some of MCINet's peerings
worked as we could get to msn.com, but not to microsoft.com.  To compound
problems, at about the same time, PSINet lost two of their BGP routers at
MAE-East &amp; MAE-West. This affected me since many of my customers &amp; our
corporate network are on PSINet, so I couldn't get to PSINet from MCINet
(actually, mich.net, the academic ISP for Michigan) since their peering was
at MAE-East.[*]  By Monday morning all was resolved, including PSINet's
problems.

Happy ending to a bad weekend for the 'net, but at least the engineer I
talked to at MCINet was able to joke about it.

Reading the article written by John Vert &lt;<A HREF="mailto:jvert@MICROSOFT.com">jvert@MICROSOFT.com</A>&gt; and then the
two cited KB [Knowledge Base] pages it strikes me that the real RISK is the
complexity of the software offered by Microsoft.

It is difficult to use many of the Microsoft API's because the things they
act on are inherently complex.  Often, to do a 'simple' thing you have to
call multiple APIs and many of these have a non-trivial number of arguments
and/or must be passed complex data structures.  In many cases these
parameters set to 'defaults', so why have them in the first place?  In any
case, just how can all the combinations be tested?

This situation is made worse by the incomprehensible documentation.  I find
that his article and the KBs verge on the incomprehensible.  This is rampant
through Microsoft documentation.  I'm a University educated, native English
speaker with 12 years in computing and much of the Microsoft documentation
contains semantic contradictions, before it even gets to the technical
level.

At the technical level one wonders why anyone would design it they way it
was designed [writing on a read-only object being permitting based on some
perverse set of rules].  Combined with the confusing nature of the
documentation you are left wondering if how you thought it worked is
actually how it does work.

Sometimes, as a last, turgid, resort you just have to try it out and see how
it does work and hope that you are using it in the way it was intended and
in the right context.  This is no way to write software.  I don't want to
hope that it works.  I want to know that it works.

Looking at Windows 95 I see something that is maybe an order of magnitude
more complicated than Windows 3.1, still only solving the same problem.
Doing the same with more is not progress.  Exploiting Moore's Law may be
possible, but it's not desirable.

Late last Monday night an interesting sight met me when I went to get cash
from an ATM.

These ATMs come with a small color screen a numeric keypad with a cancel and
an ok key, and 8 keys next to the screen. Normally you are first prompted to
insert your card and type in your key, after which you are presented with a
graphical menu allowing you to redraw money, check your account balance
change your PIN or retrieve your card.

This time things were different. First the person in front of me left the
ATM cursing loudly. When I got there, instead of the graphical menu the
screen was black with characters in white, several lines of "bad command or
filename" ending on a "C:\exe&gt;" prompt.

After a little experimenting I found the keys 0-9 were mapped, as expected,
to 0-9, while the OK key was mapped to &lt;ret&gt; and the CORRECT key was mapped
to &lt;del&gt;. The keys next to the screen (of which there were 8) turned out to
be mapped to A,B,C,D,.,&lt;esc&gt; respectively, with the 2 last keys apparently
doing nothing. Since I didn't have a full keyboard, and lacked an &lt;alt&gt; key
I couldn't enter anything useful, so after some brief experimenting I left
it alone. I then called the banks 24 hour hot-line and told them their ATM
needed rebooting. I got a rather vague response along the lines of "oh well
just wait a few minutes and see".

The risks ?

Well where should I start...

1) It should never be possible for the user of an ATM to access it's operating
system (if ms-dos + win 3.11 was the operating system, if not it shouldn't
be possible to access to front-end either).

2) More to the point it shouldn't be possible to use anything but the
authentication program prior to authentication. Note that during my
experimenting with the ATM I hadn't put my card in.

3) I had always assumed that ATMs ran some kind of well designed embedded
system. "Well designed" doesn't come to mind when talking about ms-dos.
I am on the other hand certain that a pc with dos/windows is the cheapest
way of building an ATM (cheap standard components, lots of programmers
available for the platform, cheap standard tools available for development).
What does this say about the general quality of the information resources
used by this bank ?

4) Does the bank ever run virus-scanners on the pc in the ATM ? Having
one of these things infected could lead to all kinds of problems. Of
course virus-scanners are never 100% reliable.

Seeing the problems these machines seem to have, it is only fair for me to
report one occasion recently when my local ATM got something right: On
requesting a certain amount of money, the ATM always hands your card back
first, and then hands you the money. Last week my card jammed in the ATM and
I got neither card nor money. I went to the local branch of my bank
immediately, expecting to find the money I hadn't received deducted from my
account, but apparently it hadn't been, indicating that at least this time
the designers of said ATM got things right.

My family and I have just recently returned from a year's assignment
overseas and have moved back into our old house, which we rented out for the
year.  Of course, we gave up our old telephone number (though I kept my
e-mail address -- first things first!).  When we returned this year, it was
easy to get a new phone number; they still had my old account information
handy.

We've been gradually re-establishing contact with our friends.  This week,
two old friends told me that they'd been trying to call me, but that the
number information gave them was "not taking calls at this time".  I asked
what number it was, and they told me our *old* number from last year!  I
called information (411 for local information) myself, and was given the
correct number.  I asked one of them to check again; again she was given our
old number.  She tried to explain that she KNEW it was the wrong number, and
was told the equivalent of "Sorry, lady, that's what the computer says."
She had dialed 555-1212 (the standard for non-local information questions)

I called NYNEX service to ask what was going on.  She checked the records --
they were correct.  With me on the line, she called 555-1212 and was given
the right number.  She explained -- reasonably -- that she couldn't fix a
problem that didn't seem to exist.

My friend tried again.  Was again given the wrong number.  She then
explained, again, that the records were wrong.  At my request, she asked for
the information on exactly which company she was talking to and where they
got their data.  She explained that they were contractors for NYNEX, Then
she asked my friend for the correct information so she could change it!

The RISKS?  The usuals:

a) Assuming that old data is good data; somebody somewhere seems to have
decided that the same name at the same address must have the same number.

b) Changing the data without having any proof at all that the new data is
valid or that the change is authorized.  Can you imagine someone doing this
to a competitor?  It was awfully easy.

c) Our assumptions that there is somehow, somewhere, God's database of
telephone numbers managed and maintained by The Almighty Telephone Company,
and that changes propagate intelligently.  'Taint so, folks.

So, I THINK that my phone number is now correctly stored in the information
systems --- unless it gets overwritten by some other glitch somewhere else.
I guess I have to keep testing it for a while.

Perhaps this is not yet anonymous digital cash, but certainly anonymous.

and steganographically watermarking the meat in the context of digitally
signed scannable grade-stamps.  Perhaps the next step in monitoring the

Dave Schulman's recent contribution ("Failure-mode risks revealed by
Hurricane Fran" <A HREF="/Risks/18.42.html">RISKS-18.42</A>) reminded me of an incident that happened to me
a little while ago.  Back in December 1995, I was interviewing for a
residency position at a hospital in Toledo, and the hospital was being
generous enough to put its applicants up in one of the better hotels in the
city (which shall remain nameless).

The hotel had recently changed over to an electronic card system on their
doors rather that the traditional lock and key system.  The morning of my
interview, I was coming back from breakfast, and was planning to get my
suit jacket from my room and check out.  When I got to my room, I inserted
the keycard into the lock and, instead of getting the green LED and hearing
the mechanism unlocking, I was greeted with a series of all three LED's
blinking, in what I assume was an error code.

I went to the front desk and explained my situation to the manager who got
the 'master key' card and tried it in my lock, and got the same response as
my key.  She went back to the front desk and put in a call to maintenance.
A few minutes later, the maintenance man showed up with what was supposed to
be a supermaster card.  No dice, same result.

He went away and returned after a long wait with two other keycards.  (He
said that it took a while for him to get in touch with his supervisor who
gave him some 'special codes').  He tried the two cards in the lock; they
obviously did something since the LED's blinking pattern changed, but the
lock still wouldn't open.

He went away again, and he then returned along with the manager and two
other people.  The manager pulled out a laptop computer connected to a
probe which fit into the keycard slot.  While she was working, one of the
two other people identified herself as the 'head concierge' and began
furiously apologizing to me.  The manager did succeed in opening the lock
this time.

This anecdote illustrates a risk touched upon be Mr. Schulman -- the
problems with not including a manual override in a computer controlled
system.  Had the laptop computer not been able to convince the lock to
open, I don't know of any way short of brute force of getting the door open
as there were no openings in the lock other than the keycard slot.  (During
the times I was left waiting in the hallway, I was half expecting the
maintenance man to return with a sledgehammer).

Although I'm not intimately familiar with the internal workings of
electronic locks, I don't believe that it would be a problem to include a
conventional mechanical keyway in the lock.  In the ideal system, the
mechanical keys would be kept secure (say, in a safe in the office) and only
the electronic cards would be given to guests.  This would keep the
advantages of the electronic locks (convenience, the ability to change locks
easily whenever a guest leaves) without having to keep track of mechanical
keys.

I must take exception to most of what Dave states here. I'm a life-time
resident of North Carolina, and have lived in the described area
(Research Triangle Park) in central NC for twenty years.

&gt;The area was clearly unprepared for a disaster of this magnitude, ...

Was Florida prepared for Homestead?  [&gt;...]

1) Raleigh-Durham is over 100 miles inland from the coast. Hurricanes rarely
effect the area with more than peripheral tropical-storm-type weather. Fran
was a major exception to the rule. Flooding along the rivers and lakes here
qualified as "200-year flood" waters, meaning that you should expect floods
of this type only once every 200 years. Normal civil engineering for
building sites relies on meeting the "100 year flood" limit in most cases.

2) Power lines are aerial still throughout much of Raleigh because Raleigh
has been here a long time. It is impractical to bury all of the power lines
due to the sheer number of miles of cable involved. Most subdivisions and
other developments built in the last 15 years do have underground utilities.
In Cary nearby, building codes require it.

3) The central NC area is covered in trees. Many of the streets in the area,
particularly older parts of town, have large oaks with canopies extending
over the streets. The trees are one of the things that gives the area its
charm.

Most widespread power outages were caused by the downing of high-tension
distribution lines. More importantly, several gas leaks resulted from
uprooted trees pulling lines UP out of the ground, so burial is far from a
cure-all.  Major trees are down throughout the central NC area. The storm
had sustained winds of 67 mph in Raleigh, with gusts of up to 117mph.
Remember, this is over 100 miles inland...  [&gt;...]

The telling point: "where hurricanes are an established fact of life."  Much
of Florida's vegetation is tropical, which is suited to severe winds and
storms. In contrast, Raleigh is known as the City of Oaks. Many of those
trees are over 300 years old. Many are uprooted or broken apart now.

Many power lines did come down. A week later, most people living in
municipalities have power restored. While inconvenient, I can deal with a
week of no power if the alternative is to cut down all of the trees anywhere
near a power line. In the hurricane aftermath at Homestead, FL, some people
didn't have power for months.  [&gt;...]

Having a sole entrance gate that fails closed is stupid, but not
particularly unsafe. Virtually all mechanical entrance gates are designed
with shear pins in the mechanism. In the event of fire, the fire department
simply drives through the closed gates, that's what those big bumpers are
for.  Most municipalities here will not allow you to build a subdivision or
apartment complex with only one entrance. A tree could have blocked said
entrance just as easily as the closed gate.

Now compare this with the alarm system my neighbor's place of work has.  He
went to work to check on things in the aftermath of the storm. It turns out
that after the backup battery on their system wears out (approx. 3 hours),
the system OPENs all of the locks on the doors. Note that typical
card-key-locked doors have a manual handle on the inside to open the door
anyway if power is off, in addition to a mechanical key for entrance, so the
risks of being locked in or out are minimal. In his case, NOBODY was locked
out. Just what you need in the aftermath of a storm, when the opportunists
are about.  [&gt;...]

It's a near miracle that more people didn't die, but it has nothing to do
with the utilities. The height of the storm was at approx. 3:00 AM, so most
people were at home. The eye of the hurricane went directly over Cary,
approximately 7 miles west of Raleigh. Carolina Power &amp; Light and Duke Power
both scrambled to obtain line crews from other regional utilities even
before the storm had gone through the area. They have reciprocal agreements
with other utilities to supply crews in the event of an emergency of this
nature. Everyone actually expected the problems to occur along the coast.
BellSouth sent their generating units there to maintain power on their
cellular towers. They were dismayed to find that the problems occurred
exactly where they had just dispatched their crews from... While there was
extensive damage at the coast, the major damage was actually inland. Wake
County alone has estimated damage in excess of 900 million dollars.

It is not that long, and explains that the proximate fault was a conversion
of a 64-bit float to a 16-bit integer.  [See <A HREF="/Risks/18.27.html">RISKS-18.27</A>,28,29,45.  PGN]

"The internal SRI [inertial reference system, en francais] software
exception was caused during execution of a data conversion from 64-bit
floating point to 16-bit signed integer value. The floating point number
which was converted had a value greater than what could be represented by a
16-bit signed integer. This resulted in an Operand Error. The data
conversion instructions (in Ada code) were not protected from causing an
Operand Error, although other conversions of comparable variables in the
same place in the code were protected.  "

The circumstances surrounding the code, testing, simulation, etc., are
probably worth reading, though the suggestions as to how to prevent such
problems in the future are mostly nontechnical, and where they are
technical, do not provide any great insight, unfortunately.

The Dutch radio station Radio 538 (<A HREF="http://www.radio538.nl">http://www.radio538.nl</A>   [in Dutch] has
set up a "Virtual Casino" on their web server, as a protest against
legislation-in-the-making against Internet gambling.

The "casino" consists of a virtual slot machine. Playing is free of charge,
and you can win real prizes, presumably paid by the sponsors whose company
logos appear prominently.

So far so good.

The amusing part is that the constructor of the Web site missed one little
detail: If you lose in a turn of the game, you just click on "BACK" on your
Web browser, and you undo your loss!

[The object is probably to let you win, gaining free publicity.
It would be a risk if there is no limit on individual winnings.
But this should certainly be a reminder to future webgame developers.  PGN]

We have recently started using the Borland 5.01 C/C++ compiler[*], and came
across an interesting anomaly.  The minimal "short" integer, as defined in
the ANSI-standard file &lt;limits.h&gt;, is -32768.  Curiously it is defined as
"(-32767-1)".

At first I attributed this format to symmetry; the maximum "short" small
integer was defined as 32767.  However I soon noticed "long constants" and
"possible loss of precision" error messages with any code which initialized
a "short" integer to -32768.  If this were human generated code, these
values could be easily changed to "SHRT_MIN", but this code was state tables
output by Gnu Flex.

Turning off these error messages is risky since a fair number of bugs (in my
experience) are related to precisely this type of logic flaw, especially
when the software needs to run on multiple platforms.  On the other hand,
leaving the error messages enabled prevented me from compiling this program,
due to "excessive errors or warnings."

Still, this situation is better than I would face when using a personal copy
of Microsoft Visual C++ 1.5.  It limits SHRT_MIN to -32767.

[*] A bit of research shows that the problem goes back to a least Borland
4.0.

For the past year I've lived on Martha's Vineyard, but I spent the summer in
Boston.  Eager to have my mail forwarded the 80-mile jump, I filed a
temporary change-of-address with the US Post Office.  The forwarding order
expired on September 4th.

Now, it has been widely reported here and elsewhere that the US Post Office
sells its national change of address register to the nation's top
bulk-mailers so that they can automatically update their addresses.  I've
also documented how this information is used for target-marketing purposes,
even though such uses are strictly forbidden by the Post Office.

What I discovered this summer, though, was that either the Post Office or
the users of the databank do not distinguish between temporary change of
addresses and permanent change of addresses.

During the summer, I had many magazines and financial statements delivered
with the "corrected" address, which was a rented post office box in Boston.
I had my insurance company call me up and ask me why I had moved without
telling them.  I had a lot of confusion.

What makes the confusion all the worse is that my rented mail box was
cancers a week after the mail forwarding order was canceled.  All mail sent
there will be returned-to-sender.  And, no, the post office will not forward
paper mail that is destined for a rented post office.

Now I'm trying to find every company that I do business with that updated
its copy of my address, and tell them that they shouldn't have updated the
address, even though they thought they were doing the right think.  All of
this has been a huge waste of time --- not just mine, but the roughly three
dozen companies that I've had to deal with.

What is the most frustrating, though, is that I did everything exactly the
way I was supposed to, and still I got screwed by the system.  On the other
hand, I don't see any way that I could have gotten my mail forwarded and not
had to suffer with these problems.

The names of over 4,000 AIDS patients were secreted out of a Pinellas
County, Florida, computer and sent to the *St. Petersburg Times* on 18 Sep
1996.  William B. Calvert III, 35, one of only three people allegedly with
access to the computer containing the files has been placed on
administrative leave (with pay!) while investigations continue.

The computer disc was accompanied by an anonymous letter claiming that
Calvert had been showing and bragging about the disc and its contents at a
Treasure Island gay bar, Bedrox. The *St. Pete Times*a said they did not look
at the names on the list.

Preliminarily, the security controls over the list are said to have included:
- A double-locked room
- A computer (no type specified) with a lock (unspecific)
- A single-attempt password system. (no specifics.)

I have been talking to the local reporters to see if we can determine any
additional details like:

- Is there any other connectivity to the machine, despite the locked room?
- Are there audit records?
- What were the real security controls
- Why there was no encryption
- Why officials do not consider such data bases confidential.

This story is making major headlines here in the St. Pete area where I live,
especially since no one knows how many other disks have been circulated and
where they might be sent, or worse posted. According to some reports,
Calvert was a disgruntled employee, with a history of allegations.

This one incident may be the largest single case of AIDS related disclosures
ever. In 1993 a Miami data base of 6,000 HIV positive people was stolen, but
investigators said the list was a corollary part of a hardware theft.

The RISK we face, beyond the obvious leakage of the names and the possible
disruptions of people's lives already disrupted by this terrible disease, is
that others may not come forward for testing and treatment for fear that their
names, too, will be publicized.

In the message following this one, I've provided a detailed update on the
current Lexis-Nexis "P-TRAK" personal information database furor, based on
my own research.  Since the situation has been changing very rapidly, this
represents the most up-to-date information I'm aware of regarding both the
service and your options for dealing with it if you so choose.

With concerns over databases and personal information running at such a high
level, this seems like the appropriate time to announce the first program
from the PRIVACY Forum's new effort: "PRIVACY Forum Radio".  As longtime
readers of the forum know, one of my major concerns is getting the word out
to people that privacy really matters, and that there are actions they can
take to help protect themselves, *before* troubles arise.  Whether related
to computer, telecommunications, or database privacy issues, or the less
esoteric aspects of privacy in our personal lives, to be forewarned is
critical.

PRIVACY Forum Radio will be an ongoing production of the PRIVACY Forum.  It
initially will include audio interviews, discussions, and other programs
conducted with all manner of persons involved in the privacy, security, and
related areas.  Participants will include persons from business, industry,
government, concerned organizations, and other individuals.  Both the
well-known "movers and shakers" and the unknown folks affected by privacy
problems will be featured.  All aspects of privacy in our personal,
commercial, and public lives will be topics for various guests.  Initial
programs will be prerecorded, but shortly we'll begin live broadcasts
offering listeners the ability to call in by phone, or send in e-mail
queries, to directly participate in the discussions.

The primary distribution medium for these PRIVACY Forum Radio materials is
the Internet, via the Xing "Streamworks" system.  Versions of the shows,
including live programs, will be available for access by listeners at
network connection rates as low as 14.4 Kbps per second.  Some materials
will also be made available at higher rates for those with the appropriate
capabilities.  In the very near future, we also plan to make some items
available with accompanying video ("PRIVACY Forum TV"), using the same
system.

These shows are also available, by arrangement, for conventional radio
syndication.  Since my primary goal is to try get the word out about these
issues as widely as possible, PRIVACY Forum Radio is also making available a
short (e.g. 60-second) "Privacy Bites", suitable for use by regular
broadcast radio stations who want to help their listeners not only become
aware of privacy risks, but to learn what they can do about them.  Inquiries
regarding any of these materials should be directed by e-mail to
<A HREF="mailto:privacy-radio@vortex.com">privacy-radio@vortex.com</A>, or by voice to (818) 225-2800.

The first special program from PRIVACY Forum Radio is an interview I
conducted a few days ago with Lexis-Nexis Corporate Counsel Steven Emmert,
on the subject of concerns over the "P-TRAK" database, and on the topics of
personal information and databases in general.  It provides fascinating
insight into views of privacy from the "database industry" side of the
fence.  To hear this program, follow the PRIVACY Forum (and PRIVACY Forum
Radio) links from

<A HREF="http://www.vortex.com">http://www.vortex.com</A>

Links are present within the PRIVACY Forum Radio area explaining the
technical details of hearing the interview and other materials, and for
downloading the (free) Streamworks software for your system that you'll need
if you don't have it already.

This is an exciting step in the evolution of the PRIVACY Forum, one that I'm
hoping will be a major stride towards helping people worldwide deal with the
ever-encroaching loss of privacy that has become part and parcel of our
modern societies.  Please direct any questions about accessing or obtaining
PRIVACY Forum Radio materials to the e-mail address or phone number
mentioned above.  Thanks much!

This is going to be a longish message, but I urge you to read it in its
entirely.  As many of you are no doubt aware, considerable controversy has
been raging around the Internet, and now in the mainstream press, concerning
the Lexis-Nexis "P-TRAK" personal information database.  Since the
transmission of P-TRAK related messages here in the PRIVACY Forum early this
month, various information, some accurate, some inaccurate, has been widely
disseminated.  In some cases, I've seen versions of the original PRIVACY
Forum items in excerpted and usually unattributed form, sometimes having
been modified or addended in manners that significantly alter the original
content.

Concern over P-TRAK has mushroomed around the country, perhaps especially
due to Lexis-Nexis' high visibility.  Many people are concerned about their
personal information, however innocuous some might consider it to be,
residing in publicly accessible databases.  They want some measure of
control over their personal data.  It is this concern that has brought this
story to national prominence.

Lexis-Nexis has put forth an official statement concerning P-TRAK
(accessible via <A HREF="http://www.lexis-nexis.com">http://www.lexis-nexis.com</A>) which is accurate as far as it
goes--but in my opinion leaves out some *very* important points which people
should be aware of and that I'll describe in detail below.

Adding to the confusion is the fact that over the last couple of weeks the
mechanisms available for people to request removal from the P-TRAK database
have been changing, largely due to the high volume of requests that
Lexis-Nexis has been receiving.  Callers to various Lexis-Nexis numbers were
at times told conflicting or apparently inaccurate information, and the
exact mechanisms for requesting removal, and what such a request really
meant in practice, has been in a state of flux.

Early deletion requests were taken by operators, then by voicemail systems,
and then later callers were told all requests had to be by mail or fax.
Most callers were asked for their Social Security numbers.  Some were told
that it was essentially useless to request removal, since they could easily
pop right back on the database again later.  Questions about how to verify
removal persisted.

Given all this, I decided to take it upon myself to go directly to the
source, and had a number of detailed conversations with the Lexis-Nexis
Corporate Counsel, Steven Emmert.  Since Lexis-Nexis was in the process of
making decisions on some of these issues, I held off this update until now
to give Mr. Emmert time to get me the latest information, which he has done.

As described in the previous message, I'm also pleased to announce that
PRIVACY Forum Radio is presenting a detailed audio interview with Mr.
Emmert, via the PRIVACY Forum web page (access via <A HREF="http://www.vortex.com">http://www.vortex.com</A>).
Mr. Emmert and yours truly discuss both the details of the P-TRAK
controversy and some of the more philosophical aspects of personal
information databases.  If you're at all concerned about these topics, you
will probably find the interview quite interesting.

Where do the P-TRAK issues stand right now?  First off, it should be noted
that Lexis-Nexis is a reseller of the data in P-TRAK, not the collector.
They don't verify or otherwise amend the original information.  The
information itself is the so-called "credit header" data which FTC and other
decisions ruled were not covered under the FCRA (Fair Credit Reporting Act)
and could be openly disseminated.  This includes name, address, phone
number, Social Security number, and other related data.  Lexis-Nexis obtains
this info from one of the big credit data agencies (published reports have
suggested that this is Transunion).  Lexis-Nexis receives this data, which
includes more than 300 million records, on a monthly basis.

While Lexis-Nexis notes that their marketing focus is to government, law
enforcement, and the legal profession, it's important to realize that
the P-TRAK database is not *restricted* in any way to ensure that
only persons in those categories are using the data.  Anyone who
wants to the pay the appropriate fee can obtain search data.  This is
a crucial problem in the database industry--the almost total lack of even
rudimentary "need to know" requirements before gaining access to
information that many persons consider (obviously erroneously in many
cases!) to be private.

Lexis-Nexis points out that you cannot view Social Security numbers through
P-TRAK.  This is true.  When the database was originally established in June
of this year, SS#'s were available for viewing, but in short order concerns
led to their display being terminated.  So, you can't derive a SS# from
someone's name via P-TRAK.

HOWEVER--this does not mean that SS#'s are not in the P-TRAK database.  In
fact, they are there, and if you already have an SS# you can use it to
search in P-TRAK for all of the other data associated with that number
(e.g., name, address, phone number, and so forth).  Lexis-Nexis considers
the SS# to be the only reliable personal identifier, and in fact has told me
that when a person requests removal from the P-TRAK database (more on this
below) the best chance of actually getting removed exists when that person
provides their SS#.  Name and address are considered less desirable for this
purpose, due to name duplications, name or address changes, etc.  This is
the reason that callers asking to be removed have typically been asked for
their SS#'s.

To Lexis-Nexis' credit, it should be noted that they have competitors (some
on the Internet) who don't restrict SS# information at all, and don't offer
any opportunity to be removed from their databases either.  Still, it's
important to understand that SS#s *are* in the P-TRAK database, and that you
still can search *by* SS# in that database.

Information available for direct view in P-TRAK includes name, maiden name
(if any), current address, up to two previous addresses, phone number, and
year/month of birth.  Mother's maiden name is not included.  The source of
phone numbers is of particular interest.  Lexis-Nexis in their statements
has likened all this data to the telephone company "white pages", pointing
out that it is all based on publicly available information.  But the
definition of "publicly available" is very broad--much broader than most
people realize.

Phone numbers in P-TRAK are *not* derived from telephone company (e.g.,
white pages) information.  They are obtained from a variety of other
sources, notably data provided by businesses that have conducted
transactions or other business with a person, to whom that person may have
provided their phone number.  As such, unlisted (non-published) phone
numbers *can* appear in P-TRAK, since an unlisted designation only affects
phone company records, not all the other places where you have provided a
number, probably with the expectation that the number would not be provided
to commercial databases!  There are no legal restrictions on the
dissemination of such phone numbers, even though many persons keep their
phone numbers unlisted for quite valid and serious reasons.

OK, let's say you've decided that you consider the information in P-TRAK to
be significant to you, and you want your record deleted.  First off, be
aware that it could take up to 60 days for a deletion to occur.  This is due
to the 30 day cycle on the database source; the deletion request needs to be
present long enough for a complete cycle to process.

Can you verify (for free) that a deletion has taken place?  No, not easily;
you need to pay for a regular P-TRAK search.  Previously there was a contact
person for verification of deletions, but due to the high volume of requests
that option is apparently no longer being offered.

Will you stay off the list once a deletion request has been processed?
Maybe.  It would seem to depend strongly on how much information you
provided with your original request.  If you provided a SS#, you probably
have a better chance of not finding yourself with a new record in a future
cycle due to non-identical name or address information appearing for you in
a future load of incoming data.  Do you want to provide your SS# with your
request for deletion?  That's a personal decision of course.

What if perchance you don't currently have a record in P-TRAK?  Will your
deletion request be held until a record does come in?  No, it will not.  If
you don't have a matching record at the time your deletion request is
processed, that request will be flushed, and if a record for you appears in
future data that record will enter the P-TRAK database.  There is no
mechanism present for a "permanent" deletion request that would deal with
such situations.

As noted above, the methods for requesting deletion have changed over the
last two weeks.  In fact, they've even changed in the few days since the
recording of the interview with Steven Emmert (a different fax number and
the re-establishment of voice requests on a new number).  So be sure to use
the information specified below, not the number that Mr. Emmert provided
during the interview.

The following is the most up-to-date information as of this writing, and
comes directly from my communications with Lexis-Nexis.  Here are your
options:

Telephone (toll free): 1-888-965-3947
Please note that this is a new number at Lexis-Nexis and
is not scheduled to be working until this Monday morning (9/23)
Eastern Time.  It is currently scheduled to go to live operators,
but if volume is very high it might be switched to voicemail.

FAX (toll free): 1-800-470-4365
Again, this number is scheduled to become functional
on the morning of 9/23, Eastern Time.

Mail: P-TRAK, P.O. Box 933, Dayton, OH 45401

E-mail: <A HREF="mailto:p-trak@prod.lexis-nexis.com">p-trak@prod.lexis-nexis.com</A>

A web form for removal requests is also available at Lexis-Nexis
via <A HREF="http://www.lexis-nexis.com">http://www.lexis-nexis.com</A>.

The minimum information required to request removal is full name and mailing
address.  As noted above, Lexis-Nexis feels that the strongest likelihood of
a successful removal will occur when Social Security number is also provided.
The web form (as of this writing) doesn't request SS#, and you of course
should use your judgment about choosing to send your SS# in e-mail.  My own
recommendation would be to use the telephone or fax options.

By no means is P-TRAK the most onerous database of personal information
now available.  But I believe the furor that has erupted demonstrates
the deep-seated concerns that many people have with details of their
personal lives being collected and sold merely as "information
commodities", with the subject of that data having virtually no input
on how it will be used, or abused.

It's time for a detailed examination of what information should and should
not be considered to be "public", who should have access to that data, and
under what circumstances.  Some database companies themselves admit that this
is not an area that they can unilaterally address in any general way--they
have competitive concerns.  Only through serious legislative efforts can we
really begin working toward reasonable changes in the commercial database
field.  And we'd better get started now, unless we want the 21st century to
be a time when the word "privacy" becomes nothing more than an amusing
anachronism in the history books.

Rory's description of his close encounter with a dodgy ATM machine reminded
me of a more than annoying incident I suffered recently.

Needing to withdraw a large amount of cash in a hurry, I went to my local
ATM machine, and requested $700.00 in cash. The machine normally gives out
$20.00 or $50.00 notes, and obviously I was expecting the latter.

Unfortunately, it gave me the former. Of course, this consists of 35 bills.
It spent some time shuffling bills behind the scenes (which was where I
started to get the idea that something was not well). Some clunking noises
later, and it gave me some bills. Eleven of them to be exact. It then gave
me a receipt.

Needless to say, it deducted the full $700.00, even as I could hear it
withdrawing the bills back into the bowels of the machine.

The cause: it simply couldn't fit that many bills through the slot. So it
sent through what it could, and took back the rest.

The RISK: Somewhere in the bank there are teams of programmers, writing and
maintaining the software for the ATMs. They handle many types of exceptions,
and error conditions.

Elsewhere, there are many engineers, carefully poring over the design of the
ATM, its cash dispenser, checking that there are no foulups, or possible
causes of mechanical failure.

Then there is the person who takes the hardware, loads the software, and
sends the ATM out. The programmers never see an ATM (except when they are
withdrawing their money), and are likely never told its physical
characteristics.

Similarly, the engineer is simply told that some software is loaded on the
computer that he (or she) has bolted into the case.

I'm sure it has just not occurred to the managers that mere physical
constraints can affect the operation of ATM software ...

The even greater RISK? How do I get a message to the programmers responsible
for the problem? There is no mechanism in the bank for you to write a
complaint to the support staff. And what do you think are the chances of
them having the time to think about the problem and discover the cause for
themselves?

James

PS. It took over a week for them to finally get my money back into the
account. Several checks almost bounced as a result.

Several years ago, several authors published details of a flaw in the design
of TCP allowing denial of services via sending a SYN packet and not
following up. In the last week or so, several magazines have published code
for a SYN flood attack, and now many ISPs are going down because of their
lack of defense and inability to trace the attacks to the sources.

I thought I would note that the CERT has now decided to advise all on the
Internet to use the techniques against IP spoofing published some months ago
in Network Security Magazine (Elsevier) in an article on IP spoofing (part
of the "Internet Holes" series.  This article was also published in the BoS
mailing list (although they should not have done so because of copyright
violation).

The basic defense is for the Internet community as a whole to refuse to
route packets from known forged addresses. For example, we shouldn't be
routing packets from 0.0.0.0 and 255.255.255.255 or the IP addresses
associated with internal-use-only IP ranges or - most importantly - packets
from IP addresses not in the range appropriate to an incoming link. (If you
service IP range 204.7.229.*, don't let inbound packets from that port with
from IP addresses not in that range).

A photograph of Minnesota State Senate candidate John Derus appeared
(without his name) on primary day in the *Star Tribune* , seemingly in
connection with an article on a Philadelphia charity fraud case.  Derus
charges that the *Star Tribune* did this intentionally.  (A lawyer for Derus
cited a sworn statement from a caller who, upon complaining to the paper,
was told that the use of the photograph ``may have been a personal act of
vengeance by an individual employee for which the *Star Tribune* is not
responsible.''  The *Star Tribune* had previously criticized Derus, and
opposed him when he ran for mayor in Minneapolis in 1993.)  The newspaper
apologized and published an erratum the next day, claiming the mix-up was an
innocent mistake resulting from a computerized system that assigns numbers
to photos in which earlier photos had not been removed from the system.

This case could represent another RISKS example of how muddy the line can be
between an innocent mistake and a malicious act that masquerades as an
innocent mistake -- a topic that I discuss in my book, *Computer-Related
Risks*.  [Source: *San Francisco Chronicle*, 24 Sep 1996, A10.]

The CIA web site (<A HREF="http://www.odci.gov/cia">http://www.odci.gov/cia</A>) was penetrated by a group of
Swedish hackers on 18 Sep 1996, causing the CIA to pull the plug the
following day.  The altered home page said, "Welcome to the Central
Stupidity Agency."  It also had valid links to Playboy and hacker netsites,
and fictional links to ``news from space'' and ``nude girls''.  Apparently,
the Swedish intruders were protesting a Swedish court case against a group
of youths who were caught breaking into computers in 1991.  The CIA is
presumably restoring its earlier web pages, which included spy-agency press
releases, speeches, and other publically available data, including CIA's
World Fact Book -- all of course unclassified.  [I just checked again before
putting this issue out.  The http address is still not working.  The altered
web-site content is reportedly at www.skeeve.net/cia .  I did not check it.]

On the same day as the CIA shut its home page down, the Justice Department
reopened its home page (<A HREF="http://www.uswdoj.gov">http://www.uswdoj.gov</A>), which had been hacked into
the "Department of Injustice" in August.  [Source: *San Francisco

[It will be interesting to see how these reminders (PANIX too) that the
our infrastructure is rather weak will play out.  RISKS readers have of
course recognized the risks for many years, but Government policies have
not consistently reflected them.  The flurry of activity might just
possibly encourage a change in attitudes toward security, encryption,
strong authentication, etc., and generally a ratcheting up the integrity
of the infrastructure -- although I am not holding my breath.  However, a
possible partial administration relaxation in export controls is
reportedly being considered.  Stay tuned.  PGN]

A bill (S 982) that would make it easier to prosecute computer crimes passed
the Senate last Friday, but its companion bill in the House (HR 4095) is not
scheduled for any action.  The National Information Infrastructure Act of
1996, sponsored by Senator Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) would explicitly outlaw:
interstate or foreign theft of information by computer; blackmail and
threats against computer systems and networks; and unauthorized use of
computer systems.  Leahy says a Carnegie Mellon University report found that
more than 12,000 computers were attacked in more than 2,400 incidents in
1995.  The Computer Systems Policy Project reports that U.S. companies lost
somewhere between $2- and $4-billion last year due to security breaches in
computer systems.  (BNA Daily Report for Executives 20 Sep 1996, A35;

America Online has received permission from a federal appeals court in
Philadelphia to resume its practice of blocking junk e-mail messages sent to
its subscribers.  Cyber Promotions Inc. had filed for and received an
injunction earlier this month ordering AOL to end its practice of blocking
unsolicited messages to its members from companies that specialize in "junk
e-mail" for promotional purposes.  A related lawsuit is scheduled to go to
trial in November.  In a separate case, a judge in San Francisco tentatively
approved a settlement to a class action suit brought by subscribers who
claimed they were improperly charged for fractions of minutes that they
didn't use.  The settlement calls for refunds of $2.95 for each $300 in
charges to former members.  AOL's total payout could add up to $700,000,
$200,000 more than was agreed to in the preliminary settlement.  (*Wall

&gt;From *The Boston Globe*, Friday, 20 Sep 1996:
Gov. William F. Weld's aides yesterday fired two state welfare-fraud
investigators who allegedly browsed the confidential tax records of some of
Boston's most beloved sports heroes.  [...]  The pair left ``electronic
fingerprints'' after calling up the records of Larry Bird, Ray Bourque and

My wife works as a physical therapist in a local hospital, which has several
sub-disciplines of PT including cardiac rehab.  The cardiac rehab department
has an exercise area in which patients can use stationary bicycles while
connected to heart monitoring equipment, under the supervision of a nurse.
The following "interesting" (from a RISKS perspective) incident occurred
last week.

First, some background.  According to my wife, the monitors have CRTs and
display a standard EKG trace in a box, along with a large numeric heart-rate
indicator.  (Note: there are several different types of EKG devices, the
most sensitive and discriminating being what is known a "twelve-lead" EKG.
The monitor in use here is less sensitive, has fewer leads, and is intended
for monitoring as opposed to diagnostic work).

When connecting a patient to the monitor, part of the procedure involves
setting a target heart rate.  If the programmed rate is exceeded during
exercise, the EKG trace turns red, but there is no audible alarm.  There was
at one time an audible alarm (on previous monitoring equipment) but it was
considered more of a nuisance than a benefit, since it is normal to exceed
the target by a few beats/minute for short periods of time and is not
considered dangerous.

The monitoring software also has an option that can double the
amount of EKG trace displayed by compressing the time axis. This
operation mode is almost never used.

Now for the interesting part.  A patient was attached to the monitor and
began exercising.  Somehow, unbeknownst to the nurse, the display was
switched into compressed mode.  When she glanced at the display, she saw
what looked like a very high heart rate based on the spacing of the EKG
peaks.  She immediately went into "emergency mode", and set off a chain of
events that led to starting an IV, calling the patient's doctor and
preparing to administer a strong heart-rate-reducing drug.  The doctor
requested a 12-lead EKG for confirmation, at which point the error was
discovered.  Luckily, no drug had yet been administered. In declaring the
emergency, the nurse had to miss or ignore a number of cues:

1) the numeric display still showed the correct heart rate (75)

2) the display had not changed color

3) the patient showed no signs of distress, remained totally
calm, and repeatedly asserted he felt nothing out of the ordinary.

While this is a fairly clear case of operator error, it's interesting to
consider what the software designers could have done to make the error less
likely:

1) Implement a progressive alarm system:

&lt; 10 bpm over target     Yellow display, no alarm
10-20 bpm over target  Yellow display, single beep every ten seconds
&gt; 20 bpm over target     Red display, continuous alarm

2) Provide a mode indication on the display when in
compressed mode (maybe change the color of the EKG trace)

The first suggestion sounds good, but also might lead to complacency on the
operator's part and excessive dependence on the alarm system itself, with
more drastic consequences when IT fails.  Sigh! Sometimes it seems like you
just can't win.

The second suggestion just highlights the fact that man-tool interface
"modality" is something people are not used to dealing with, as RISKS
readers are well aware.  (Cite five examples of tools in existence before
1950 with more than one interface mode; how about before 1900?)

An article in the 23 Sept. 1996 *San Francisco Chronicle* describes how
Caltrans (California Dept. of Transportation) tested an automated toll
collection system on the Carquinez Bridge, hoping to be able to use the
system on all ten toll bridges in the state.

The test failed because the error rate was too high: Caltrans wants a 99.95%
success rate (5 errors for every 10,000 tolls), but the system could do no
better than 99.1%.  Apparently the system had trouble recognizing different
types of [multiwheel] vehicles in order to charge the correct toll.

The article didn't explain how the system is supposed to distinguish,
say, a horse trailer from a big rig.  A given vehicle may be in different
toll classifications depending on what kind of trailer it's towing, so
there must be some cues other than the encoding in the box carried on
the vehicle.

There was no discussion of correct toll amounts charged to the wrong person,
or what drivers would have to do to correct incorrect bills.  Nor was there
any mention of privacy issues (such as government tracking of individuals
movements) that have appeared in previous RISKS discussions of automated
toll collection.

NT users beware! Retail copies of both the Workstation and Server versions
of Windows NT 4.0 shipped with an undocumented system-wiping utility. The
file Rollback.exe erases key components of the system registry, disabling
the operating system.

Microsoft Corp. officials say that once the file has been executed, the
changes cannot be undone and require a complete reinstallation of the
operating system. At least one incident of accidental erasure has occurred
and Microsoft is mulling over how to inform customers of the problem.

This undocumented feature could do the most damage to NT4.0 Server users
because it erases critical-security and user-account information. Without
an up-to-date backup, network administrators will have to recreate all of
the users' account and password profiles.  Microsoft this week sent out an
E-mail warning to its channel partners.  It stated that after running the
utility "the next thing the customer knows, they are staring at the set-up
screen and are completely down."

Rollback.exe was designed to allow OEMs to test NT with their hardware and
software configurations, and then return systems to their pre-installation
state. The file is located in the support\deptools\I386\ directory of the
NT CD-ROM and is not installed on the system by default. But the lack of
any online documentation or escape route once the program has begun has put
curious users at risk.

Microsoft officials say that more than 150,000 copies of NT Server 4.0 have
been sold since its release in late July.  Microsoft has posted an entry in
its online Knowledgebase, but has not determined how it will notify
customers and OEMs.

According to Reuter's, on Monday the Federal Trade Commission recommended
Congress tighten consumer confidentiality laws to help stop credit fraud and
identity fraud.  The body of the article clearly referred to the current
uproar over the Lexis-Nexis database, although not by name.

The article stated that in a letter to Sen. Richard Byran, D-Nev., the FTC
stated that "fraud concerns outweighted the limited legitimate uses of this
information for locating individuals."  (quoting the article, not
necessarily the letter.)

The letter further recommended that the Fair Credit Reporting Act be amended
to require a legal release before a person's maiden name, Social Security
number, prior addresses and date of birth can be released.  I didn't see a
reference to phone numbers, despite the perception by many people that
"unlisted" phone numbers aren't readily available from such sources.

On an unrelated note, a brief note in the Saturday business section said
that a three-judge appellate court overturned the lower courts injunction
against AOL blocking spams from CyberPromotions.  It's probably not a
coincidence that the spam I received from them (non-AOL) on Monday
highlights their new "block-proof, flame-proof" software.

The furor over the Lexis-Nexis database (which at first had anybody's Social
Security numbers available to any strangers subscribing to the service) has
caused a 180-degree turnaround in Congress, where anti-consumer amendments
to the Fair Credit Reporting Act have been close to passage for the past
four years.  Congressional offices are getting lots of angry messages about
Lexis-Nexis, because people realize that the source of the data is "header
information" or "above-the-line information" at the top of our credit
reports.  The Federal Trade Commission over the past seven years has allowed
this identifying information to be sold by credit bureaus without any
protections of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (among other things, notice to
the consumer).

Now, Congressional Republicans are actually thinking about protecting header
information and reversing the FTC.  They are thinking twice too about voting
for anti-consumer amendments to the FCRA.  People who are upset about Lexis-
Nexis can have a real impact this week if they promptly convey their outrage
to Members of Congress, especially their Senators and notably Sen. Richard
H. Bryan, Democrat of Nevada, who might be supportive, fax 202/224-1867, and
Sen. Alphonse D-Amato, Republican of New York and chair of the Banking
Committee, who is probably not supportive, fax 202/224-5871.

Do it this week.

[P.S. If Americans - and most users of the Internet - were more upset
about the demands for photo ID in order to board an airplane than about
the Lexis-Nexis data base, the people in Washington would take note and
reverse this pernicious invasion of privacy.  Write the Federal Aviation
Administration, the Department of Transportation, Members of Congress, and

In general the PANIX attacks simply mark the point in the life of the
Internet where zero-cost zero-security stops being a reasonable marketing
point.  If the net is to survive then it or the part that plans to become
useful must add enough authentication and auditability to be able to track
back and associate bad actions with the actors.

Once that is possible then normal time tested social mechanisms can be
employed. The internation nature of the internet means telecomunication
standards and web of bilateral agreements and the law of the sea probably
bracket the techniques that will work.

I was looking for some financial information, and came across the Barron's
Online WWW site during my search. I tried to enter an area that is
restricted to members, and was asked for my username and password. As I
don't have an account, I clicked on OK, and was allowed to "FIND my
password". I put in a silly username, and was greeted with:

"Hello John Doe. When you registered we asked you for your favorite
color. Please enter your favorite color:"

(The names and passwords here are obviously fictitious.) Naturally, I
couldn't resist, and before I reached then end of the rainbow, I received:

"Congratulations! Hello John Doe. Your password is 3246297684".

I think the RISKS from this system are obvious. Repeated guesses of
usernames brought up requests for the Mother's maiden name, date of birth,
or favorite color. Additionally, the usernames are easily guessed, any
proper name seems to be taken as a username.

It's a nice way to give away information, but I'm not sure I would
trust these people with my financial security...

In my earlier days I was one of a team of ATM programmers.  We had a machine
in the office, and we tested the software by holding on to cards and
envelopes, putting rubbish in the money bin, not taking receipts, and every
other thing we could think of.  It was a terrific job!

The operating system was specifically written for the ATM.  It had
instructions such as "get notes from hopper" and "present notes".  If an
instruction was used, the software automatically generated a mandatory error
routine, which forced us to think of the correct action to take in each
situation.  It presented an error code with dozens of values for each
instruction such as "less than the requested number of notes were
presented", "some notes not taken", "all notes not taken", etc.

These days the software in ATMs seems to be written using generic languages,
and running on generic PCs. The risk is that by reducing costs, we take on
the responsibility for thinking up each possible error ourselves, rather
than leaving that job to a specialist who knows the hardware and its
capabilities.

We also rely on a system where the hardware consists of an ATM built by one
company, a PC by a second company, interface hardware from the ATM to the PC
by a third company.  Then the PC operating system is written by a fourth
company, the ATM controlling software by a fifth, and so it goes on.
Needless to say, the risks for misunderstanding and omission are multiplied
manyfold.

Of course, this goes both ways.  The hardware-specific software we used took
up to 24 hours to generate, so the final software was full of patches
applied through a hooked-in monitor.  With modern PCs, a wide range of
software development tools would greatly assist in producing stable and well
structured code.

Numerous people have written me directly to point out that C defines
integers as a sequence of digits, and then uses unary negation for literal
negative constants.

I wish to point out that both the Gnu C and HP/UX (the only compilers I've
used for the past four years until the past few months) define

#define   SHRT_MAX    32767
#define   SHRT_MIN    (-32768)

Many compilers are fairly intelligent about how they handle literal
constants and expressions; perhaps this is how some (but not all) compilers
can accept -32768 directly.

[...] The problem is not with the Borland C compiler, which performs
according to spec, but with Gnu Flex, which is generating C code that does
not conform to the standard.  Or perhaps the problem (and RISK) is with the
type of thinking that expects people to see something like "(-32767-1)" in a

&gt;Still, this situation is better than I would face when using a personal copy
&gt;of Microsoft Visual C++ 1.5.  It limits SHRT_MIN to -32767.

This is a bit more dubious.  Unless Microsoft have done something strange to
two's-complement arithmetic, I'd say the definition was wrong, since a short
can contain a value less than SHRT_MIN.

[...] People who find C a RISKy language will like to cite this quirk as
evidence.  On the other hand, the absence of negative numerical constants
has its advantages -- for instance, it frees the programmer from ever having
to wonder whether things like -1 and -(1) might behave differently in some
contexts.

[...] So here's another RISK -- a compiler where a warning *isn't* a warning.
Instead it's 1/N of a fatal error, for some particular value of N.
In my opinion that's a serious bug in the compiler.

So much for the 'science' part of 'computer science'...

There is a trivial and elegant solution to the problem of the asymmetry
of 2's complement integers and how to input and convert them.

Low, James R.  "A Short Note on Scanning Signed Integers".  ACM Sigplan
Notices 14, 1 (Jan. 1979), 55-56.

Briefly, instead of keeping the number as a _positive_ integer, you
keep it as a _negative_ integer (which has a greater range), and then
convert back if it is positive!  In other words, "err on the Low side".

Pseudocode from Low's paper:

RESULT := 0;
while there are more digits, do
RESULT := RESULT * 10 - current_digit;
if sign is positive, then RESULT := - RESULT

While we're on the subject, no one should be allowed near a numeric
conversion routine until (s)he has read the following two papers:

This reminds me of a problem I had more than 10 years ago, using
FORTRAN IV on an HP 1000. The comparison

IF (I .EQ. J)

results in FALSE when I and J are both -32768.  This is because the HP
1000 has no COMPARE instruction, so, by necessity, the comparison is
done by SUBTRACTING one number from the other.  Subtracting -32768 from
-32768 (in 2's complement arithmetic) yields -32768, and an
overflow condition which is not tested for by the generated code.

I was using this for comparing bit-patterns, and one of the patterns I
was comparing against was Octal 100000 (= decimal -32768).

This confused me for a while!

Another e-mail scam has appeared, informing you as a would-be victim that
you have "only 24 hours to settle your outstanding account" and suggesting
that you can call an 809 number to avoid subsequent court action.  The call
goes to a Caribbean telephone company (apparently in Tortola in the British
Virgin Islands) and costs you $3 to $5 (and presumably more if you are dumb
enough to hang around for their strategy of putting you on hold with a
sequence of creative recorded messages).  The FROM: address "Global
Communications"@demon.net is BOGUS.  This is a cheaper variant on a recent
809-900 pager scam, which costs you $25 if you return the call.  [Source:

A new e-mail service offered by New Century Technologies gives customers an
e-mail address sporting a prestigious university domain name for $25 a year.
The customer, who must have a valid e-mail address somewhere else, then
receives mail addressed to <A HREF="mailto:user@DukeU.com">user@DukeU.com</A>, or whatever school is chosen. The
vanity address closely resembles the real thing, except it ends in .com
instead of .edu.  The universities aren't happy about the impersonation:
"You can't assume people understand that the address isn't affiliated with
the university somehow," says Florida State's director of Web development. A
member of Georgia Tech's licensing committee is even more adamant: "They
can't do that.  People can't sell anything over the Internet and use our
name without paying us royalties.  We will fight this."  (*Chronicle of
Higher Education Academe Today*, 19 Sep 1996) [This evidently came from

Denise M. Johnson works for Aerotek (under subcontract from EDS) as a PC
help-desk troubleshooter for Textron Corp.  Textron is accusing her of
planting a virus that caused them to lose all computer data for 15 hours
beginning at 11 p.m. on 16 Sep 1996 and shutting down their system.  She
says she is innocent of the charge and attributes the allegation to ``office
politics.''  She also noted that Textron's computers had been struggling
with computer viruses for months and that the system crashed the same week
she was accused of the crime.  An investigation is in progress.  ``The virus
was already in the system,'' she said.  [Source: Jonathan Saltzman,

The American Civil Liberties Union has filed suit in federal district court
in Georgia, challenging a new law that makes it illegal for organizations to
"fraudulently misrepresent their Web site as that of another organization,"
says Representative Don Parsons, who sponsored the Georgia bill.  The law
also prohibits anonymously sending e-mail in some circumstances.  Parsons'
critic, Rep. Mitchell Kaye, says, "We've chosen to regulate free speech in
the same manner that communist China, North Korea, Cuba and Singapore have.
Legislators' lack of understanding has turned to fear.  It has given Georgia
a black eye and sent a message to the world -- that we don't understand and
are inhospitable to technology."  (*Wall Street Journal*, 25 Sep 1996, B1)

Attempting to compromise with critics of its "key escrow" approach to data
encryption, the Clinton Administration now plans to begin allowing U.S.
computer companies to export software using powerful encryption codes (or
"keys") up to 56 bits long.  However, the government will require those
companies to develop, within two years, a "key recovery" system allowing
U.S. law enforcement or anti-terrorist groups armed with a search warrant to
get the key from the several third-party companies, each of which would hold
one part of the key.  IBM and some other large companies are supporting the
plan, but other companies are expected to oppose it.  The system will be
successful only if the Administration can convince other countries to adopt
the same kind of system.  (*The New York Times*, 1 Oct 1996 C1; Edupage, 1 Oct
1996)

[There is a huge amount of netspace devoted to this topic in the past
two days.  It is likely to generate much discussion, although much of
the basic arguments are made in earlier issues.  I include the Edupage
item to remind us to dig for it.  PGN]

Researchers at Bellcore have discovered that applying heat or radiation to a
smart card's embedded chip can make it vulnerable to reverse engineering,
allowing the data on the chips to be stolen.  Michael Smith, director of the
Smart Card Forum, discounts the researchers' findings, however.  He points
out that smart card transactions require security passes by several systems,
not just those on the card itself, and that exposing the card to heat or
radioactivity would not result in repeatable faults, which would be needed
for reverse engineering.  "If what Bellcore says is right, that would mean
you could bake 10 personal computers, turn them on, run a spreadsheet, and
each one would show two plus two equaling five," says Smith.  (*Investor's
Business Daily*, 1 Oct 1996, A8)

[The researchers are Dan Boneh, Richard A. DeMillo, and Richard J. Lipton.
Their work is fascinating, and provides another wonderful reminder of how
difficult the security problem is.  An article by John Markoff in *The New
York Times*, 26 Sep 1996, C1, seems more informative.  The Smith quotes
are evidently inaccurate.  Repeatable faults are not required.  Baking
computers is not required.  Stay tuned for the full article, which is due
out imminently.  PGN]

One more effect of the 10 Aug 1996 west-coast power outage has come to light
in a letter from Sloane Citron of Menlo Park, published in the *Palo Alto
Weekly*, 18 Sep 1996.  When the lights went out, a standby generator kicked
in at the Cable Co-op transmitting point (the ``headend'').  Batteries kept
their phone service working, although their shared answering service was
seriously overloaded.  Finally, the batteries ran out on their phone switch.
When power was restored, the cable system had to be brought back on line,
although the knowledge of which customers were affected was not available
because the phones were out.  Meanwhile, back at the headend, the circuit
board that normally scrambles the Playboy Channel was fried -- despite surge
protection.  Sloane Citron's letter on behalf of Cable Co-op apologized to
those cable viewers who were offended by having received the Playboy Channel
unscrambled.

The *Daily Telegraph* 1 Oct 1996 contains an article entitled:

"When Failure is Out of the Question"  by Paul Forster

Quoting, admittedly *very* selectively, from the article (which is approx.
600 words long):

National Air Traffic Services Ltd., part of the Civil Aviation Authority, is
close to completing a new (pounds)300 million centre at Swanick . . .  "It's
all digital and probably the most advanced ATC setup anywhere," says Dr John
Barrett, the Swanick project director, almost nonchalantly. "It's so complex
I have difficulty in explaining it even to my board," he says.  Throughout,
safety is paramount. The whole system is made up of networked workstations
rather than a central mainframe, so there is no single point of failure. . .
The system totals roughly two million lines of software, but like most
software it is behind schedule and is still being debugged .  . . Operations
are not now due to begin until the winter of 1997 . . .  "With ATC it's
obvious that we simply have to remove all the faults in the code, and we are
now working 24 hour a day, seven days a week," says Barrett. "Our
over-arching requirement is that the system has to be completely safe."

How reassuring!

Simson Garfinkel related the problem he experienced with a temporary change
of address.  I had a similar problem when my ex-wife moved out and filed
permanent change-of-address forms for herself and our two-year-old son, of
whom she had been awarded custody.  Unfortunately, my son's name differs
from mine only by middle initial.

For the last five years I have had nothing but trouble as a result,
including my and my father's mail being delivered to my ex-wife's address;
companies I do business with continually having the wrong address in their
records, in spite of numerous attempts to correct it; and my voter
registration being changed without my approval.

The risks of using change-of-address forms are many.  For example,
erroneous change-of-address data that continues to live on, long after it
has been purged from post office systems; the inability or unwillingness of
organizations to determine the age of change-of-address data, so that
erroneous data continually displaces newer, corrected information; and
governmental organizations changing registration records without direct,
written notification from the party(ies) involved.

A friend was at his grocery store, using his MOST card to buy about $150.xx
of groceries.  He wanted $30 cash, so he keyed in $180.xx When he ran the
card, it said "Daily limit exceeded".  Which was wrong, as he'd not used the
card at all that day.

He tried again without the extra $30, and it worked.

He then went over to the ATM to try to get the $30, and decided to get $100
instead.  It said "Daily limit exceeded".  He tried $30, and it said "Daily
limit exceeded."

The next day, he of course called his bank to find out what was up.  They
looked at it, and found that *every one of the transactions* was recorded as
having been successful -- so they'd deducted several hundred dollars more
from his account than he'd received.

Not a friendly failure mode.  He's still working on getting it
straightened out.

The second item is from a web page, &lt;<A HREF="http://www.usps.gov/moversnet/coa.html">http://www.usps.gov/moversnet/coa.html</A>&gt;.

It *looks* as if you can now forward anyone else's mail without ever having
to set foot in a Post Office.  A friend found this while looking for online
forms, to save him time, as he *was* moving; he used this form, and it sent
back e-mail "to confirm".  This doesn't appear real secure, although not
having tried to use this facility fraudulently, I can't be sure that there
isn't some additional level of checking.  (And for those who say "Hey, don't
spread FUD if you're not sure" -- well, the fact that I can't *tell* is a
problem in and of itself, eh?)

This is an old problem whose electronic reemergence represents a serious

the USPS have insisted that this problem would go away in the new system,
but evidently it may have worsened.  Perhaps we need to flood them with
requests to DISABLE ENTIRELY the ability to change our own addresses
electronically or by postcard, requiring in-person or electronically
certified requests (the USPS is now testing its entry into this business!),
but it is likely to take a lot of requests before anyone will listen.  By
the way, the web page Philip Smith cites indicates that signing the
change-of-address form certifies legitimacy of the request, and notes that
anyone submitting false or inaccurate information is subject to punishment
by fine or imprisonment.  Given the ease of spoofing e-mail addresses, that
is not likely to provide a sufficient disincentive.  There have already been
vastly too many scams (many untraceable) perpetrated using the old manual
approach.  Caveant omnes.

Today I got a message from David Jones (<A HREF="mailto:jones@random.org">jones@random.org</A>, names changed to
protect the guilty) with whom I correspond regularly.  David has a unique
writing style and signature that would be impossible to reproduce by
accident.  It was only after I sent him a response that I noticed that this
message was not from David after all, but from someone I'd never heard of,
John Smith (<A HREF="mailto:smith@random.org">smith@random.org</A>).

Without thinking the situation through all the way I dashed off another
note to John Smith asking him essentially who the hell he was and what he
was doing impersonating my friend Dave.

Of course what happened was that Dave had been using a public Netscape
browser that John Smith had at some earlier time configured for himself.
David (who has a Ph.D. in nuclear physics, not a dumb guy) didn't know
that you could even do that.  He just assumed that the computer had some
way of figuring out who you were and that you couldn't change it.  The
computer on his desk always does the Right Thing automagically, why
wouldn't the one in the Library?

So John Smith, who has never heard of me or David Jones, now has two very
cryptic e-mail messages from me: my original reply to David, and my
subsequent inquiry into John's identity.  And David is wondering why I am
taking so long to reply to his e-mail.

What is astounding about this mess is not only the sheer number of errors
that had to be made in order to bring it about (four - John Smith not
removing his personal e-mail configuration from the public computer, David
Jones not reconfiguring the program before using it to send e-mail, my not
checking the From address in the message, and my not thinking the situation
through before sending my second reply) but also how utterly easy it was for
all those mistakes to be made.  In fact, for *all* these mistakes to occur
is the *natural* evolution of events in the presence of Netscape running on
a publically accessible machine.  To eliminate *any* of these mistakes
requires considerable effort and knowledge.

The risk: when you reply to an e-mail message you are *not* necessarily
replying to the person who wrote it.  You could be sending mail to a
complete stranger through a completely innocent, and potentially very
common, set of circumstances.

After reading an article in the Sydney Morning Herald regarding the
theft of a laptop from a shop and subsequent death of the shop's owner
[<A HREF="http://www.smh.com.au/daily/national/961003-national6.html]">http://www.smh.com.au/daily/national/961003-national6.html]</A> I checked
out the Web page with the wanted poster for this crime, issued by the
Queensland Police [<A HREF="http://www.OntheNet.com.au/gcpolice/]">http://www.OntheNet.com.au/gcpolice/]</A>.

It's certainly an inspired way to catch this guy, but the thing that
strikes me is the RISK of the site being hacked [RISKS 18.49: CIA
disconnects home page after being hacked] or the DNS being spoofed and
some random person's picture replacing the bad guy's.  Not to mention
the ease with which copies of such 'wanted posters' could be made.

I'm sure someone will point out that this sort of thing would be
resolved when the bogus information was given to the Police.  I am
skeptical because it wouldn't be the first time that a wrong
person/address mix up has occurred, sometimes with dire consequences.

Today my doctor sent me to the HMO's lab to have some blood drawn.  After
jumping through the usual hoops (put the form in the slot, hand over the ID
card, sign here, sign there) I was called in and seated in the little room
with racks of empty vials on the wall.  Twenty or so minutes passed, which
seemed a little unusual, so I got up to find out what was causing the delay.
I found the lab technician in another room looking at a computer screen.
When I asked him what was going on he responded that he was unfamiliar with
the procedure for one of the tests my doctor had ordered, and was having
some trouble getting the instructions from the computer.  Mo, there was no
one else around whom he could ask.

I'm referring to the recent posting about the safety of medical monitoring
devices. Or better, about the failure of people to read these properly.
First of all, as the poster said, they are no EKG (ECG if you're British)
replacement. They are only used to diagnose disturbances of the heart's
rhythm or frequency. Of course, if somebody switches the display to half
speed, the spikes will still appear at the same rate which really is obvious
(should be).  Second, during an exercise situation it may be very difficult
for the monitor to pick up the correct frequency because of all the
artifacts generated by movement of the electrodes.  On the other hand, the
monitors are smarter than you might think from watching Arnold's latest
movie "Eraser": No monitor I've seen would respond to disconnection of an
electrode by showing a flatline EKG, so this "risk" is fictitious. What's
more, no nurse or doctor would (should?) shock a patient who is moving about
and protesting, only because his EKG is flatline.  Moral: With all the
machines we doctors get, we still have to think.

So it was the triggering condition that was wrong, not that the trigger
caused an audible alarm. Sigh.

&gt; She immediately went into "emergency mode", ...

This sounds quite good to me, actually, although not necessarily for the
reasons implied. Ok, so it seems that a mistake was made, and was luckily
detected before damage occurred. On the other hand, the nurse was acting as
though a serious, time-critical problem existed, and moved to handle that
problem, rather than wasting time checking the equipment - how often does
RISKS carry tales of operators not believing that the situation was as bad
as indicators claimed? Also, a sanity check was applied, *after* events were
set in motion, but *before* damage was done.  Personally, I would have
thought a quick sanity-check with a stethoscope might have been appropriate,
but I'm not in the medical profession, and don't know how effective it would
have been.

RISKS readers are well aware of the difficulties inherent in trying to
achieve strong security.  JavaSoft is trying to increase general awareness
of these problems relating to Java and related approaches, and has begun
a series of forums that should be of considerable interest to many of you.

The first forum was on the topic of ActiveX and Java.  The second forum is
on the topic of security, and started running last week.  You can find it at
<A HREF="http://java.sun.com/">http://java.sun.com/</A> .  (Follow the link from the top level page.)

We're now hosting the second in the series of online Forums, and are
inviting experts to comment on an opening statement from JavaSoft.  We will
publish statement and comments on our web page, and invite comments from the
Internet community at large.

We are interested in feedback and comments.  One thing we're hoping to do is
to raise the level of commentary about security, because we feel that
security is really an architectural issue, not a black-and-white-checkbox
kind of issue.  We recognize there are things that need to be fixed and
we're working on that from an architectural or fundamental point of view.

Check out the Forum and send us your comments.  We can't personally answer
all the comments, but we plan to publish a subset of the feedback we get in
a follow-up Forum.

Edited by Rob Kling
Computerization and Controversy: Value Conflicts and Social Choices
Second Edition
Academic Press, San Diego CA, 1996

The second edition of Rob Kling's book contains 78 articles with a wide
variety of views representing a spectrum of authors, many of whom are
familiar to long-time RISKS readers.  The parts of the book are as follows:

I.    Heads Up! Mental Models for Traveling Through the Computer World
II.   The Dreams of Technological Utopianism
III.  The Economic, Cultural, and Organizational Dimensions of
Computerization
IV.   Computerization and the Transformation of Work
V.    Social Relationships in Electronic Forums
VI.   Privacy and Social Control
VII.  System Safety and Social Vulnerability
VIII. Ethical Perspectives and Professional Responsibilities
for Information and Computer Science Professionals

There is much provocative thought in this collection, with a lot
more than just a little something for everyone.

The biannual daylight savings time confusion began this weekend in Sweden.
When Sweden joined the EU (Common Market), it changed the fall changeover
from the last weekend in September to the last weekend in October to conform
with the rest of Europe.

Unfortunately, a few hundred thousand Windows '95 machines were not
informed of the changeover and, followed pre-programmed instructions,
switched on the old schedule.

This is, of course, one small example of a much more difficult problem:
there is no obvious way to pre-program daylight savings time changeover
in a way that is sufficiently robust to withstand government intervention.
(My favorite example is Arizona, where federal land changes, but state
land remains on mountain standard time year around.)

In <A HREF="/Risks/18.45.html">RISKS-18.45</A> Mark Brader forwarded an article originally posted by Dewayne
Matthews in sci.aeronautics.airliners. In it Dewayne, commenting on a
previous post that RFI interference with airliner systems is based on
unsubstantiated anecdotal evidence goes on to give exactly the same sort of
anecdote.

A valid reading of the episode is that the MD88's glass cockpit crashed for
some unspecified reason and started to quietly re-boot.  The pilot assumed
RFI interference from PCs (he'd heard those anecdotes too) and got the only
PC on board which was on turned off.  Meanwhile the cockpit had completed
its re-boot, entirely unrelated to the PC.

So yup, it's just another anecdote proving precisely nothing, expect perhaps
that pilots listen to these stories too.

PS: meanwhile back in the real world of RFI interference I wonder if it's
occurred to the airlines that many PDAs are actually all the time in standby
mode and produce RFI. Just try putting an AM radio next to your PDA and
listen.

I'm not really sure if these guys really know what they're doing, but the
Advance Bank in Australia has offered Internet Banking:

<A HREF="http://www.advance.com.au/advance/intbank/startup.htm">http://www.advance.com.au/advance/intbank/startup.htm</A>

It claims to use RSA and IDEA for encrypting the traffic between a
PC based client and the server.

The RISKS?  Where can I start?

They currently don't offer a Java version, but they say:

Will a Java Version be released?

Not for a while. While Advance Bank is often seen to be an "early
leader" in new technology, Java is not yet a released product, nor are
the security aspects finalised to our satisfaction. We'll keep a close
eye on it, though.

"early leader?"  Ahh... bleeding edge?

In the Daily Brief, the *Los Angeles Times* reported that, according to
Social Security Administration officials, some 695,000 Social Security
recipients have been underpaid since 1972, due to a computer program error.

- total unpaid benefits are estimated at $850 million, with
and average amount per affected recipient of $1,500.

- the SSA says about 400,000 of those affected have been
identified and will be getting the back payments.

One RISK of latent bugs in financial systems is that dollars and interest
really pile up after awhile.

[Note: <A HREF="/Risks/16.67.html">RISKS-16.67</A>, 23 Dec 1994, had an item contributed by Mike Manos
from *Federal Computer Week, 21 Nov 1994, on the discovery of this
problem, which at the time was estimated at $478.5 million.  That item
says that the problem occurred in 1978, when employers began reporting
earnings annually rather than quarterly.  The item I saw on 04 Oct 1996
said the software flaw was introduced in 1972.  In any event, the problem

Two weeks ago, one of the largest potato-cutters in the Netherlands started
a competition.  Building on the typical couch-potato's perceived expertise
in football (soccer) they announced they would put a 'scorecard' into an
unspecified proportion of their bags of crisps (chips).  It has two
scratchable pictures of a football game, without ball, and a superimposed
grid.  The idea was that the expert would guess where the ball was, verify
that guess by scratching off the protective layer of that gridsquare only,
and claim fl 10 (~US$ 6) when both were right.

However, the inevitable happened: two students set up a web site with the
information gathered so far, and a request for anybody who had guessed right
or wrong to share the information.  Within two weeks the database had the
correct ball position all 1445 pictures, and the crisp-fryer called off the
competition, muttering things about unsportmanlike behaviour.

The RISK?  Assuming knowledge does not spread is clearly not appropriate
with the web around...

On 2 Oct 1996, Aeroperu Flight 603, a Boeing B757, took off from Lima at
12.45am en route to Santiago, Chile, and disappeared from radar at 1.10am.
According to CNN, the pilot had reported mechanical problems, that he was
turning back, and had declared an emergency before radio and radar contact
was lost. I do not normally report details of accidents so early, for
reasons discussed recently in RISKS (Mills, 18.42; Dorsett, 18.43; Ladkin,
18.44; Mills, 18.45, Dorsett, 18.46) and am somewhat uncomfortable about
feeling a need to comment so soon on this case.

The Peruvian Transport Minister, Elsa Carrera de Escalante, declared
to The Times that "it seems there was a blockage in the computer
system".  According to CNN, she told a news conference that "it is not
the first time that one of these planes has had this kind of fault. We
have to find out why the computers went crazy". The Times reported the
story as `Computers Blamed...' and CNN as `Computer Failure
Puzzling...'  The Electronic Telegaph reported that Gen Juan Piperes,
fire chief of the Peruvian port of Callao, said: "The plane's whole
system completely failed."

I am thus concerned about a rumor starting that attributes the cause
of the crash to be a computer failure. It has not been so determined.
The information available so far to anyone is gleaned from the
transcript of pilot/controller conversation, and radar plots. These,
by themselves, are insufficient to determine the nature of the
problems. Until the digital flight data recorder (DFDR) and cockpit
voice recorder (CVR) are recovered and analysed, very little can be
determined about the sequence of events leading to the accident.

The B757 was introduced into service in January 1983 [*] and flew until
December 1995 with an unblemished safety record. There have been accidents
on 20 December 1995 (near Cali, Colombia) and 6 February 1996 (near Puerto
Plata, Dominican Republic), and now this one. In both of the previous
accidents, pilot procedural errors, including errors in interacting with the
flight management systems, played the decisive role. There were no technical
failures, whether of structure or of flight management systems, involved in
the Cali accident; the sole technical system failure in the Birgenair
accident is (so far) presumed to have been caused by a blocked pitot tube.
The B757 has three physically independent pitot-static systems, of which two
seem to have been operating normally. It seems that normal procedures to
cope with the single pitot-static failure were not followed by the Birgenair
crew. The final report on the Puerto Plata accident is not yet published. If
a computer failure `caused' the Aeroperu crash, it would be the first time.
There is no precedent for computer failure in a B757 accident, contrary to
what Senora Carrera's statement would seem to suggest.

When the data from the CVR and DFDR are in, they might show that it
would be worth questioning if the pilot's interaction with automated
flight management may have contributed to the accident, as it did with
both the previous accidents. Although this would be an HCI question,
it's not a computer system failure per se. All sorts of hypothetical
questions such as this may arise.

In any case, if computers were involved, it's exceptionally unlikely
that they could be the sole cause, as I shall demonstrate.  The B757
aircraft uses computer systems for displaying air data, for
navigation, and for autopilot control and flight management. It does
not use computers for flight control, which is achieved by
conventional hydromechanical systems. Furthermore, the air data
computer systems are backed up by conventional electromechanical
`standby' instruments of highly reliable design used for over half a
century.  The integrity of these physically-operated standby systems
along with that of the physically-operated flight controls, as well as
structural integrity, suffices to conduct safe flight in this
airplane. From this fact, we may already draw some broad conclusions.

Let me thus divide the possible sequences of events into three.
First, suppose normal control of the aircraft was lost. The B757 is
conventionally controlled (not computer-controlled), and the air data
systems have electromechanical backups. Therefore, in the event
control was lost, either these backup systems would have had to fail
also (in which case there would be a physical contributing factor), or
the pilot would have to have made ineffective use of these backup
systems (in which case either inappropriate pilot action or some other
cognitive confusion would also be a contributing factor), or the
autopilot flew the aircraft into an out-of-control situation (as in
the Birgenair accident), in which case the pilot's behavior in
engaging and not disengaging the autopilot would be a factor, or the
pilot would somehow otherwise have allowed control to be lost. No one has
yet determined whether any of these situations occurred.

Second, if normal control was not lost, then either the aircraft must have
suffered some form of structural failure in normal flight, which
computers alone could not have been responsible for (structures can fail
under normal control inputs if the aircraft is in an overspeed condition,
but normally not otherwise); or the aircraft flew under control into the
water (i.e., a CFIT, Controlled Flight Into Terrain, accident), in which
case pilot behavior or engine failure must also have played a role.

These alternatives cover, grossly, all the possible scenarios.  Since
computers alone could not cause any of them, we may conclude that
singling out computer failure of any kind cannot be the whole story.
Since no one is able yet even to determine which of the above alternatives
occurred (or one that I missed:-), it is certainly premature to attribute
a cause of the accident.

More information on the accident, press reports, and the aircraft, as well as
links to original sources and reports on the Cali and Puerto Plata
accidents, may be found in my Compendium `Computer-Related Incidents
and Accidents With Commercial Aircraft', available through

Here's an interesting example of Info-War.

Many of us have seen and heard the television and radio commercials for a
new in-home HIV test that is accurate, fast, and anonymous.

The test works as follows:

You buy the kit.  Go home and follow the directions and obtain a sample.
Mail the sample to the lab.  In 3 days, call the lab and enter in the
`secret' code and the results of the test performed on the sample matching
your `secret' code will be revealed to you.  The secret code is used to
ensure anonymity so the user doesn't have to reveal their name.

Accurate? I believe so..

Fast? Three days is pretty fast..

Anonymous? Not at all!!! And here's why.

Whenever you call a 1-800 number, your phone number is captured and
forwarded to the company for billing purposes.  It is also available to the
PBX in the form of ANI which can the be sent to the automated phone system
that processes the request.  In the HIV test scenario, the company that is
called has a record of the calling phone number (ANI), and the requested
`secret' code.  Since they already have the test results, the company is now
able to match the phone number, which can be looked up, and the HIV status.
In effect, the company is capable of covertly developing a database
containing the names, addresses, phone number, and HIV status of the people
who purchase and take the test.

Who would want this database?

Government, insurance companies, employers, you name it.  Most health
related information is considered confidential and will not be released by
either the government nor the physicians.  If someone had a `secret'
database that contained the HIV status of millions of people, then the
interested organisations would have a discreet way of `checking-out'
potential clients, or employees.

Try this one on for size.

I have the bad luck to have moved into an apartment where the previous
tenant had the same last name. Other than that we have nothing in common as
far as I can tell. I'm male, she was female. First names aren't at all
alike.

But I still get her mail and have to be *very* careful about how I turn it
over to the post office. The first time I just marked it "Not at this
address, and it wasn't until a check didn't appear that I found out the post
office had just blithely started bouncing my mail!

It's currently "handled" by my having had a talk with the carrier, and being
careful to circle the first name *only* when writing not at this address...

&gt;From comments nade in this forum in the past, I'm not certain that the
system the post office uses for tracking forwarding orders can deal with
this properly. Anyone know for sure?

Oh yeah, to add insult to injury, I got a card from the previous previous
tenant's dentist reminding him to come in for a checkup. I wrote "not at
this address" on it and dropped it in the outgoing box.  Several days later,
it was back again. That's *really* stupid!

Another mail-forwarding problem with a slightly different (and older) cause.

I've recently moved to flat numbered 03. Note that leading zero because, for
various historical reasons I've yet to fathom, there is also a separate flat
3 at the same address.

I arranged mail forwarding from my previous address --- no prizes for
guessing where the mail actually arrived.

After several phone calls, the operator at the post office finally realised
that the software was stripping the leading zero as he typed it in...  I now
live at "flat zero three" as this seemed the only solution to the problem.

Since then I have encountered similar problems with various utility and
delivery companies.

Risks: a variation of the old theme of making assumptions about the format
of input data "nobody has an street name with more than 20 characters",
"everybody has a middle initial", etc.  Although in this case I think the
person who came up with the foolish numbering system for the flats has to
share some of the blame.

So this guy goes on vacation, see, and he's on this mailing list that sends
out a 32K digest approximately daily, see, so when his autoreplier gets the
mailing it sends back a chatty little personal note to the whole list,
quoting the entire digest in full each time which, of course, creates a
loop... and about the time someone gets THAT shut off, a very highly-placed
honcho who is a _user-interface guru_ and _internet expert_ decides to send
a chide-o-gram to this guy.  Who's on vacation.  Actually, it's his
honeymoon, as he's mentioned.  Repeatedly.  So we _hope_ he isn't going to
be hopping up every five minutes to check e-mail, right?

But accidentally, the highly-placed honcho sends this note to the whole
list.  Helpfully quoting the entire digest.  In full.

Fortunately, this is a great mailing list and the back issues are well
worth repeated rereading.

Yeah, it happens all the time, to all of us.  And exactly how long have we
been building e-mail software and mailing lists and using the network and
reading and writing books about user interface design?  Don't you sometimes

there would be a confirmation after filling out the form, I put in a change
of address for myself.  After entering information on a number of pages you
are finally directed to print out the form and give it to your letter
carrier or to mail it to your postmaster.  There is some mention of their
work on coming up with a secure system to allow the form to be filed via
e-mail.

As for the suggestion that all change of addresses be done in person, I
don't see how this would solve anything.  A photo id would be required to
confirm your identity (as a minimum) and we all know how easy it is to
obtain a false one.  Also any system is only as good as the people running
it.  On numerous occasions I have gone to the post office to pick up mail
that they were holding for me and not once was I asked for ID (different

I see no risks from the WWW USPS Change of Address form that are not already
present in the printed form available in any Post Office.  In both cases,
you never have to deal with a person or show any ID, and in both cases,
submission of the form constitutes the claim that it is valid.  Quite
frankly, I don't see much of a "Risk to the Public in Computers and Related
Systems" here -- if anything, it's simply a "Risk to the Public".

I will concede that since it's a lot easier to visit a WWW site and type in
some information than it is to visit a Post Office, pick up a form, fill it
out and mail it, the WWW form makes it easier for obnoxious people to submit
false forwarding requests for other people.  But I don't see that as a very
big deal, especially because of the verification step outlined in the
following paragraph.

Those of you who think that there isn't sufficient verification in the
USPS mail-forwarding system should perhaps have read the &lt;A
HREF="<A HREF="http://www.usps.gov/moversnet/q_and_a.html">http://www.usps.gov/moversnet/q_and_a.html</A>"&gt;Q&amp;A About Mail
Forwarding&lt;/A&gt; page available on the USPS WWW site.  Quoting from it:

&gt;How will the Postal Service verify that it received a Change of
&gt;Address Order from me?
&gt;
&gt;The Postal Service will promptly mail you a confirmation letter to the
&gt;address you are leaving, regardless of the date of your move. (For
&gt;your privacy, it will not mention what your new mail forwarding
&gt;address will be.) Another confirmation letter will be sent to you at
&gt;your new address after the date of your move.

Yes, this does really happen -- I recently field a Change of Address
order and did receive the two confirmation letters.

I assume that the USPS has sufficiently good "exception handling" that if
you get a letter about a Change of Address Order you never filed and go to
your Post Office and protest it, they can put a stop on the Change of
Address.  There is still some room for mischief, e.g., it's possible that
some mail will be lost before you stop the forwarding, especially if someone
is clever enough to file it while you are out of town or something, but the
addition of this step still makes things a heck of a lot more secure than
they were before.

I confess that I'm baffled about one thing.... When I put my mail on hold
when I go out of town, and then go to the Post Office when I get back to
pick it up, they require me to show ID before they'll give me the mail.  I
simply do not understand why they don't require people to show ID when
submitting a Change of Address Order.  The only explanation I can come up
with is that right now, the minimal number of forged requests is outweighed
by the increased convenience (and the less USPS-employee time consumed) of
the current system; this presumably means that if forging Change of Address
requests for other people ever becomes an "in" thing to do, the USPS is
going to have to ditch the convenience and start requiring that forms be
filed in person with ID and notarized by a USPS employee.

then it is critical that you understand this *if* you want to have an effect
on public policy.  If there is no political force driving a public issue
then nothing is done no matter how compelling the technical case.  Technical
changes are virtually never implemented unless someone has a political (or
financial) motivation to do so.

Here's a case in point.  In 1985 two friends of mine were killed while
flying a light aircraft.  When the details of the accident were released it
became obvious to me and several others that a major technical error was
committed by the pilots.  This was an error attributable to lack of
knowledge/training.  Unfortunately, the NTSB investigators on the case were
also not familiar with the critical technical issue of the accident
(dynamics of low-performance aircraft in mountain wave conditions) and
omitted any mention of this error in the accident report.  No
recommendations have been issued which could help prevent additional
accidents of this type, and they continue to occur with painful regularity

I have expended a significant amount of effort over the last 11 years in
trying to get the NTSB and FAA to recognize the problem and to modify pilot
and controller training such that accidents from this cause could be reduced
or eliminated.  There have been some encouraging results, but in the large
the government has not moved.

The problem is *not* technical; the solution to the problem is well known.
Rather, the problem is that there is not enough political force involved to
motivate key government players.  It likely will take either a major
accident or the death of a prominent person before changes will be mandated.

In the meantime, public discussion of the issues is the *only* means
available to disseminate this information and influence public safety.  To
that end, I have several web pages

<A HREF="http://www.wco.com/~shp/waveforatc.html">http://www.wco.com/~shp/waveforatc.html</A> and
<A HREF="http://www.wco.com/~shp/speedtofly.html">http://www.wco.com/~shp/speedtofly.html</A>

that are intended to inform people interested in the subject and keep the
matter in the public eye.  I also regularly speak on the subject at local
venues and deliberately note the problem of political apathy on this matter.
I am working on various political moves in an attempt to force the issue,
but in the meantime all I can do is discuss the problem in public to the
maximum extent possible.

Mr. Mills states: "Mixing demagoguery and science is irresponsible.  It must
never be tolerated."  On the contrary.  In this case and in others, mixing
politics and technology is likely the *only* way in which public safety will
be served.  It is the only responsible course of action at my disposal.

Two rats crawled through an underground cable conduit into a cabinet of
power switching gear adjacent to the Stanford University cogeneration plant,
and caused an explosion that cut off power to the Stanford area beginning
around 7:30pm on Thursday evening, 10 Oct 1996, and continuing until 3:30pm
Friday afternoon.  The BBN Planet hub (Internet Point of Presence, or PoP)
at the Stanford University Data Center remained in operation for a few hours
on standby battery power, but then gave out around 9pm Thursday; it came
back up around 4:30pm, an hour after Stanford restored power.  To name just
a few, Bay-Area BARNet users at Stanford, U.C. Berkeley, Apple, Sun,
Hewlett-Packard, Lawrence Livermore (partially), and SRI were cut off from
the Internet.  The *Los Angeles Times* and *San Francisco Chronicle* on-line
sites were also off the air.  Because I had no Internet access yesterday, I
held up <A HREF="/Risks/18.52.html">RISKS-18.52</A> -- thus enabling me to include this item adding to our
RISKS archives collection of rodent-induced outages.  (Long-time readers
recall that SRI alone has contributed four fresh-fried squirrels resulting
in power outages.)  [Sources: On-line messages and a front-page *San
Francisco Chronicle*, 12 Oct 1996 item]

Evidently, the horse is out of the BARNet, and the rats found the weak lynx.
They sure put a ro-dent in the day for many BayAreans.  Perhaps your mouse
will click on a tale of its own.  At any rate, this is just one more saga in
the weak-link-in-the-infrastructure department.  But I'm surprised that
power-system technology has not found a way to develop rodent-tolerant
circuits.

[With SysAdmins and others pacing the halls at SRI waiting for whatever,
Doug Moran remarked that keeping around a few fresh-frozen electrofried
rodents is allegedly standard practice for purveyors of power; it is then
very easy to have a fallback alibi when no other cause can be found.]

Punch-card ballots have been responsible for the uncertainty about the
result of the Democratic Primary for the 10th Congressional District of
Massachusetts.

The election was held on 17 Sep 1996.  The official count was not released
until two days later.  Philip Johnston was said to have defeated William
Delahunt by 266 votes out of 49,371 ballots cast.  Delahunt called for a
recount, citing some 1000 punch-card ballots that were counted as blanks by
the mechanical vote counter.  On 2 Oct, the results of the recount were
announced that showed Johnston the winner by 175 ballots.

During the recount, the questioned ballots were examined by a human election
official.  The legal standard requires that the intent of the voter should
govern the vote count.  Thus if a ballot is not punched through, but is
indented, then a vote should be counted.

Delahunt took the dispute to state court.  A state court judge examined 956
ballots in chambers and ruled that only about 50 were actually blank.  On 4
Oct, the judge declared Delahunt the winner by 108 votes.  On 8 Oct, the
Massachusetts Supreme Court upheld the decision, giving Delahunt less than a
month to gear up for the general election.

It will be interesting to see what changes will be made for the general
election.  Punch-card ballots are used by 35 municipalities in Massachusetts
(including mine).  Hopefully there will be more education of voters to be
sure that they completely punch out the perforation when they vote.

Are you being flooded with spams and scams the way I have been?
(With address variations on both my own account and RISKS, I
often get at least FOUR copies of a given spam.)

The National Consumer League has issued a list of the top five types of
Internet scams, based on complaints reported to Internet Fraud Watch.  On
top are (1) pyramid scams, such as Fortuna Alliance L.L.C. conning folks
into paying $250 to $1750 by promising them $5000 per month when others
enrolled.  Next in line are (2) bogus Internet-related services, (3)
misleading equipment sellers, (4) fraudulent business opportunities, and (5)
work-at-home offers.  The Internet Fraud Watch can be reached in the U.S. at

The smartcard security weakness [to interference phenomena] reported by
Bellcore [Boneh/DeMillo/Lipton, noted in <A HREF="/Risks/18.50.html">RISKS-18.50</A>] is well-known in the
TV-hacking community; power and clock glitches can be used to read out the
memory contents of a number of smartcards. The typical modus operandi is to
attack a loop in the card's software that reads out a series of memory
addresses to the serial port. If a glitch can be found that causes the
loop-variable decrement instruction to be wrongly decoded, then the entire
contents of memory may be output.

[Stay tuned for a paper by Ross and Markus Kuhn of Purdue's COAST
Lab that they will present at the Usenix Electronic Commerce
conference in November.  Note that the A-K techniques for analyzing the
attack results are completely different from those of B-D-L, but the
triggering events can be similar.  PGN]

A new report by RTCA Inc., a nonprofit group that advises the airline
industry, recommends tougher restrictions on the use of portable electronic
devices during "all critical phases of flight."  Some experts are even
calling for a complete ban on all devices during flight.  Currently, the
Federal Aviation Administration leaves that decision up to individual
airlines.  In addition, the report recommends a total ban on all devices
that transmit radio waves, such as a pager that automatically acknowledges
receipt of a message by sending one back, or a laptop equipped with a
wireless modem.  Studies have shown that some of the strongest
electromagnetic fields come from laptop computers, as the shielding that
protects against unintended radio emissions tends to deteriorate over time.
A laptop with a 90-Mhz microprocessor can leak radiation at that frequency
as well as at higher, so-called harmonic frequencies, interfering with a
plane's navigation and communications capabilities.  (*Business Week*,

%P   1004
%T   "Practical UNIX and Internet Security"

The title is certainly apt.  This book is definitely practical, and if your job
involves system security, at whatever level, this book belongs on your desk.
The expansion of the title is no mere attempt to gain market share: this
edition is twice the size of the old one.

The book is well planned and comprehensive.  While the emphasis and examples
are from the UNIX operating system and Internet protocols, background
information is given on related (and important) topics such as modems and
physical security.  The writing and examples are clear and understandable, and
should present no problems to the intelligent novice, but the additional
material ensures that there is value here even for the UNIX guru.

The six "parts" of the work (plus a set of appendices) present logical
divisions of the topic.  "Computer Security Basics" begins with an introductory
chapter defining computer security, an operating system and UNIX.  It continues
with a discussion of policy and guideline considerations.

Part two deals with the responsibility of the user.  The chapters deal with the
defence of accounts and the protection of data through users and passwords;
user accounts, "groups" and the "superuser"; and details of the UNIX file
system.  Part three looks at the system side of security, with attention to
backups, integrity, auditing, malicious software, and physical and personnel
security.

Part four covers communications aspects.  This is highly important considering
the strengths of UNIX in communications, the use of UNIX machines as bridges
between other proprietary systems, and the participation of UNIX systems in the
Internet.  Chapters are devoted to modems, UUCP, TCP/IP, and Kerberos.  Part
five could be seen as an extension, dealing with advanced network security
topics such as firewalls.

The sixth section begins to move away from strictly technical aspects, and
starts to deal with your response to "security incidents".  This may seem, to
some, either irrelevant or defeatist.  However, it points out an important
attitude to have with respect to security:  assume that, at some point, you are
going to fail--and be prepared.  The chapters here are no less practical than
the foregoing, detailing the discovery of break-ins, denial of service attacks,
and the (U.S.) legal aspects of security.  (I appreciate the authors'
forthrightness at this point:  the chapter is entitled "Computer Security and
U.S. Law", and doesn't assume one legal system fits all.)

Most folks know that on a Novell network the user is prompted to change
their password every so often for security purposes. CC:Mail on the other
hand is a password eternal system unless of course the user is not so
irresponsible to never change it on their own volition. The Novell/CC:Mail
double password system can be a fairly secure way to insure your mail
account privacy. A trick to access the cc:mail accounts of all the local
network users, bypassing the Novell login password follows. Login as you
normally would using your own account. Go to the N: directory prompt and
edit the hidden file "cc-mail.bat" to delete your user name. Save it and
logout. Now login again and go to the n: prompt. This time when you type
"cc-mail" you are presented with a universal login screen. Type in the users
account name that you want to read. You are then asked for a password which
in this case is usually a very easy guess. The usual last name, wife, dog,
kids, job title, nickname, works in the majority of cases. The sense of
security that the initial Novell login password gives is enough to cause
most people to pick really lame cc:mail passwords. What is REALLY funny is
that the easiest accounts to hack at our company were the managers and
supervisors accounts.

I recently downloaded a Macintosh shareware game from a reasonably
trustworthy Web site.  After playing it for a while, I decided it was
worthwhile to pay the shareware fee. This particular software author (all
names omitted to avoid unfairly painting anyone as a bad guy) included a
small utility program that allows the user to fill out an on-screen form and
print up an invoice for registration. Imagine my surprise when, upon
launching this registration utility, I found my email address already listed
in the appropriate field!  , Many Mac Internet applications used with
dial-up accounts either can (or in some cases, must) use a freeware control
panel called ConfigPPP. I imagine that this is where the registration
utility got my email address. ConfigPPP stores information about servers,
user names and, if the user so chooses, account passwords in a central
location. These can be automatically polled by savvy Internet applications,
thus making setup of each application simpler.  Since the relevant computer
is my home machine and used only by me, I had stored my PPP dollop account
password in order to save a little time each time I log on.

When I printed up the shareware registration document, there were numerous
lines of bar code printed at the bottom. These bar codes had what they
ostensibly meant printed out in plain text beneath each line; however,
there was no way I could confirm this was the information that the codes
actually contained. For all I knew, they could easily contain my password.
While I doubt very much that the shareware author in this case has done
such a thing, it sure got me thinking about other potential security
breaches. For instance, I imagine that it would be possible for a JAVA
applet to poll ConfigPPP, pull out stored user names and passwords and send
them off somewhere.

I have since deleted my password from ConfigPPP. Other Mac users may want
to reconsider storing passwords on their "secure" computers as well.

This one is gleaned from reading news.admin.net-abuse.misc over the last week.

The Microsoft Network has a user with username "abuse" who now has a full
mailbox. It's full of complaints by Internet users at large about junk mail
from other users at msn.com.

Apart from the denial-of-service consequences for this user, it also means
MSN's administrators are not getting abuse complaints (unless the poor user
is dutifully forwarding them all).

Bottom line: an unfortunate interaction of a newly-established de-facto
standard (<A HREF="mailto:abuse@domain.com">abuse@domain.com</A> for compaints about domain.com users) with an
unlikely (although explainable) choice of username.

Fire Island is a summer resort on a barrier beach off the south
shore of Long Island.  During the summer the various communities on the
island have seasonal post offices that receive their mail from the mainland
post office in Bay Shore (or Bayshore .. but that is another story), NY.
The seasonal post offices do not have individual ZIP codes or ZIP+4
extensions assigned to them.  They are all assigned the same 11706 ZIP code
of the Bay Shore post office.  That office sorts the mail addressed to the
various Fire Island communities and sends it on to the appropriate places.

Unfortuantely, when one tries to order something for delivery to a
specific community on Fire Island, the "clever" software at the mail order
vendor notices that the community specified is not the same as that for the
ZIP code (Bay Shore) and helpfully changes it.  Once the package arrives in
Bay Shore, there is no way to determine to which of the several Fire Island
communities it should be delivered.  Even when I specify that my community
must be manually entered and checked, it appears that the software either
cannot be overridden or, if manually overridden once, wins in the second
round.

I have taken to entering the name of my Fire Island community as the
second line of my address after my street address much as one would an
apartment number.  This redundancy usually works but is at best a clumsy
solution to the problem.  And, of course, it is of no use whatever to
seasonal renters who merely specify their name, address, community and ZIP
code -- and are not in the phone book.

We just had a special form of "return to sender".  In order to obtain some
of the benefits alloted to us according to Dutch law, we had to fill in some
forms, put the forms in a pre-printed envelope, enter our address at the
backside and put it in a mailbox.  Much to our surprise the letter came back
a few days later without any notice as to why it came back.  Some study
reveiled the reason.  The Dutch PTT prints in orange the "zip"-code as a
bar-code on an envelope, in this case the code was printed on the backside,
and apparently encoded our "zip"-code, so the person who did the
"zip"-coding apparently had reversed the envelope after cancelling the
stamp.  Nobody in the remaining chain until delivery had seen what was
happening.

This immediately created a new problem: how to get those forms to the
institution where they were meant to go to on time?  Time was short,
and they only accept forms with the pre-printed envelopes and they had
only a postbox address.  Putting the envelope in the mailbox again might
have many different results, return to sender again, delivered with
postage due (the stamps were already canceled, and the institution does
not accept letters that are not properly stamped), or whatever.  Well,
the letter was handed in person at the post office, they heavily crossed
out the orange printed barcode, notices were put on the envelope saying
"this is the sender" and "this is the addressee".  And no, we have not
yet received it back.  We hope it was on time.

Back in the days when I was giving dBASE seminars, I used the "stripped
leading zero" as a reason to make fields for U.S. ZIP codes character type
rather than numeric.  At one such seminar in Boston (where 02215 is a common
ZIP code), a participant noted that they'd sent their mailing list to a
Texas company for processing and it had come back with four digit ZIP codes.
Said participant now understood the problem better.  Apparently some
branches of the U.K. postal service don't.

A laptop disappeared from a ``high-security'' suite in the San Francisco
Palace Hotel while board examiners were out of the room for an hour in the
morning of 15 Oct 1996.  The laptop contained the questions for one segment
of the national oral exam for doctors seeking ophthalmology certification.
The hotel suite was reportedly accessible only by using one of six access
mag-stripe cards, with the claim being made that hotel personnel could not
possibly have had any access to the rooms.  [Source: *San Francisco
Chronicle*, 16 Oct 1996, A15]

[Now, why is it that cleaning personnel generally get in to hotel rooms
for which you are told your unique registration-time-generated mag-stripe
access code gives only you access?  Ah, yes, RISKS readers probably won't
believe that there could not have been any master-key cards, or emergency
overrides, or other access modes such as creating a new access card from
the front desk, or somehow triggering the door release electronically
with an out-of-band signal!  So, was this merely the theft of a $5000
laptop?  Or an attempt to eye the exam?  (An-eye-for-an-eye-exam?)  PGN]

The local paper here in Colorado Springs has had a series of articles about
a "massive computer glitch" affecting 12,000 customers of a local credit
union.  Ent Federal Credit Union recently announced that it was about to
subtract a total of $1.2M from the accounts of its members because, for over
a year, multiple identical ATM withdrawals on the same day were incorrectly
processed.  Only the first withdrawal was charged to the account.  People
without enough money in their accounts to cover what Ent decides they owe
will be offered loans (at prevailing interest rates, of course).  Ent blamed
the problem on a "computer conversion" by the company that services its
automatic teller transactions.

Naturally, some people are upset and are moving money out of their accounts.
The NCUA, which insures credit unions, is investigating, and (before they
had a chance to actually investigate anything) gave Ent a clean bill of
health and said it was in no danger of being closed.  A variety of experts
have been interviewed by the newspaper, and all express astonishment that it
took so long to be discovered (but curiously are not surprised that it
happened in the first place).  Ent says it has no choice but to collect the
money because absorbing the loss "would wipe out nearly three months'
profit".  Ent is asking its internal auditor, Arthur Andersen, to "fully
investigate the incident."

Also, newspapers have reported that many people reported the problem to Ent
over the past months, and were ignored.

Besides the obvious risks of potentially uncollectable losses, disgrunted
customers, and lost interest due to the time lag in charging accounts, there
are a variety of other risks.  Separate investigations by the NCUA and
Arthur Andersen must be time consuming and expensive.  Lawsuits are a
possibility (if the computer is wrong about deducting multiple charges, why
should we believe it about the charges in the first place?).  Then there is
the increased call for more federal oversight of credit unions in general
and Ent in particular.  Finally, there is the nightmare scenario: people
decide that Ent is not safe enough for their money, and start a run on the
credit union.  Ent claims that while some money has moved out since the
announcement, it is not a significant portion of their $1B in assets.  Even
assuming that's true, I'd say it leaves them with no margin of error for
future problems.

On ORBIT, a Swiss IT exhibition (held in Basel last week), Microsoft
distributed a CD-ROM with a document (including German hotline numbers)
infected with WAZZU.A Word Macro virus. Even when MS officials were made
aware of this virus, the CD-ROM was continued to be distributed. At the same
time, this infected document was also available for downloading from
Microsofts Swiss Internet site, for several (at least 5) days after MS was
warned.

MS experts at the exhibition said that this virus was "harmless". Indeed,
WAZZU.A just interchanges (with probability of 1/5th) 2 randomly selected
words in a document, and with a lesser probability, it inserts strings
WAZZU.

Any Risk in Microsoft behaviour and attitude? "WAZZU" is a harmless string
(does not delete anything :-), and random interchange of 2 words may even
improve readability of texts :-). So, what risk?

Klaus Brunnstein (October 14,1996)

PS: For those with short memory: Microsoft was that company which released
the first non-theoretical Word Macro virus, when it distributed, in July
1995, several CD-ROMs (dedicated to Windows 95 proliferation) with documents
infected with Word.Macro.Concept (now .A). Until then, this was just a
theoretical threat discussed first by Prof. Harold Highland back in
1989/1990. Since Microsoft`s pioneering work, almost 70 Word Macro viruses
have been detected (plus one EXCEL and One AMIPRO Macro virus), some of
which are "in-the-wild" primarily in the Anglo-Saxon Word World, but with
fast development also in some non-Anglo-Saxon Word countries such as Taiwan
and Germany :-)

[Check out the VIRUS-L Digest (<A HREF="mailto:listserv@lehigh.edu">listserv@lehigh.edu</A> with the command

&gt; But I'm surprised that power-system technology has not found a way to
&gt; develop rodent-tolerant circuits.

I recently discussed this with a friend who is an engineer for LILCO (and
well paid and qualified, thanks to our 18 cent/kwh rates). He pointed out
that this was a very difficult problem due to the high voltages - you don't
want ANYTHING in the neighborhood that provides a possible electrical path
between the high voltage lines. The best thing to have as insulation is
plain old air, but that leaves lots of room for little creatures to get in
and mess things up.  People have come up with lots of ideas for fancy
enclosures, traps, noise-makers and the like to keep small animals out, and
none of them have yet worked reliably for long. Anybody who can figure this
one out will be saving the utility companies a lot of money (and their
customers a lot of hassle)!

Arthur Smith (<A HREF="mailto:apsmith@aps.org">apsmith@aps.org</A>)

[I was actually thinking about rat-tolerant systems along the lines
of double-error-correcting, triple-error-detecting coding systems,
where a system could for example tolerate two rats and detect
the simultaneous presence of a third by shutting down safely.  But I
was raticent to suggest it.  PGN]

An AP story from Tampa Bay appearing in the Palo Alto Daily News asserts
that a public health worker took a laptop and disks with confidential lists
of people with AIDS and HIV home and to a gay bar to check out the HIV
status of potential dates and offered to look up names of people his
friends were interested in dating. One person asserted that he had warned
friends away from potential dates, telling them that their names were "on
the list." Another claimed that people interested in dating him backed away
after the health worker talked to them. The County Health Department has
fired him, although he claims he did nothing wrong. The former health
worker also owns and lives in a funeral home. The state had permitted such
databases to be removed from offices and taken home until they changed
their internal rules two weeks ago.

This raises anew questions about privacy and confidentiality of records,
security, and misuse/abuse of information for personal and private gain.
This ought to be raised up as an example of abuse in response to the
announced plans for a national health information database.

One day the accountants network printer failed. She needed some printouts
from the financial computer in England. We were in The Netherlands. The
"company" we worked for is based in Canada.

I called the maintainers of the financial system in London, and asked them
to re-route the account print queue to go to a different IP address. They
could not, as that was considered a security risk, and nobody in London had
the system privilege to make that change. Time zone differences meant that
the people who could change it (in Canada) were still asleep.

So, I changed an ethernet address in the bootp table, rebooted a printer,
and lo and behold, the accountants information came out on a printer in my
office. She was happy. The people in London and Canada were not - I had
broken their "security".

I also once made my manager the "head" of the organization, as she was
requested by him to send out an e-mail in his name. It took me all of about
20 seconds to copy the passwd file, change his password, have her log in,
etc, etc. She was amazed, and scared about the ease of such changes.

I could go on and on about the design issues of the network (and did, and
was listened to, by the maintainers of the system - nice people!).

The RISK? I think that the exponential growth of networking usage has
produced a whole range of uninformed "experts" who design systems and place
unreasonable bounds on them.

It is not the experts fault - it takes time to gain experience, and that
time is not available to them.

Needless to say, I no longer work for that organization.

Bill McFadden (Re: <A HREF="/Risks/18.50.html">RISKS-18.50</A>, RISKS of temporary change-of-addresses)
raises, perhaps inadvertently, an interesting point about people's names,
describing his problems with his son's name differing from his own by just
one initial.

Having been cursed at birth with three given names, I have become used over
the years to appearing in lists several times, as N.Brown, N.J.Brown,
N.J.L.Brown, etc etc.  My wife has two given names, but has always used her
second given name, perhaps fortunately for us because her first name (Nansi)
begins with N too.

When our children were born, we used unambiguity of initials as one
criterion for choosing their names (really !): manual systems have not
served us well up to now, and computer systems do not have a good record of
improving on the reliability of existing manual systems.  Thus, our children
both have exactly one given name (Alexander and Joanna respectively),
neither of which begins with the same letter as ours.

In fact even "Alexander" is turning out to be a mistake: he is only ever
called Alex, and I know he is in at least one (manual) database under both
Alex and Alexander.  This is partly because in France, most people only ever
use one given name, and also because nicknames are relatively rare.  (In the
Netherlands, by contrast, it is not uncommon to have four given names, and
be known (from birth) by a nickname which is unrelated to any of one's given
names.)

When I visit the US, I find both manual and automated systems quite unable
to cope with the idea of multiple "middle initials"; doubtless my children
will have plenty of crashes when "middle initial = &lt;empty&gt;".  Somebody told
me that some Americans have middle initials that don't stand for anything -
I wonder if their parents were anticipating software problems ?

I thought this experience might be of interest to other RISKS readers.  In
the wee hours of Saturday morning (12 Oct 1996), I was ftp-ing data from
around the world.  My network-inspired happiness was marred by my sudden
loss of the phone connection to my Internet provider.  No problem, these
things occasionally happen.  However, the situation went to annoying when my
modem announced "... your call could not be completed as dialed ...".

After this condition persisted for thirty minutes, I contacted Ameritech.
Residential Repair told me that they were told that this sort of behavior
occurs when they are disconnecting a customer and forwarded me to Business
Repair.  Business Repair said that they couldn't comment on the situation
because their computers were down.  They did, however take my name and
address and told me that they would call me back when they came back up.
I left a couple of concerned messages on my provider's voice mail and
decided to wait until morning.

By 10:00 AM Saturday, I had received no calls and the situation persisted.
I pursued the same route, starting with Ameritech Residential Repair, and
found things far less painful than the night shift had lead me to believe.
At the time that I had been cut off, Ameritech had cut our exchange over to
a brand spanking new switch.  Our line checked out all right.  Small
Business Repair placed a call to the number that I was trying to reach and
got through.  Large Business Repair filed a trouble report and a technician
called back shortly thereafter.  As RISKS readers have no doubt concluded,
the cutover apparently had a few unresolved bugs.

RISK 0 : Can you trust customer service?
By what I was first told, it seemed that my Internet provider
was going out of business ... a scary thought, as I am not only
pleased with this particular service, but I had to search quite
a bit to find one who spoke *NIX this fluently.

RISK 1 : Emergencies
I am fairly savvy as to telephony problems, having spent several
years programming for long distance resellers.  Yet in the fog
of the early AM, I obviously wasn't being too bright.  What If
someone had tried to place a call from our exchange to a doctor
in my Internet provider's exchange?  Would they have gotten
through?  Would they have though to call for operator assistance?
How much time would they waste?

I'm not sure if there is any way I could have anticipated this, and I was no
more than inconvenienced and slightly annoyed.  But twenty four hours after
the problem started, I'm back on line.  Ftp is perking along happily in one
window, and life is good again.  I'm also glancing at a postcard that
arrived this afternoon.  It announces, in glowing terms, that Ameritech is
going to install a new switch for our exchange on 12 Oct.  It figures.

The "problem" is not with PPP. PPP does not store e-mail account names in its
preferences file.

The problem almost certainly resides with something called "Internet
Config." Internet Config is a database and API for storing information that
Internet programs often need, oh, like your e-mail address. Your web browser
wants that when it mails a page (or a message), your ftp program wants that
to ease anonymous logins, and so on. Internet Config lets networking
programs have a common database of information. It also allows programs like
automatic shareware registration programs to know who you are, which is
precisely what you saw.

In <A HREF="/Risks/18.47.html">RISKS-18.47</A>, William Hutchens reports his experiences at a hotel where an
electronic keycard lock failed.  Various "master keycards" also failed to
open the door; "During the times I was left waiting in the hallway, I was
half expecting the maintenance man to return with a sledgehammer".  The door
was eventually opened using a PC with a special interface.  Mr. Hutchens
says "I don't believe that it would be a problem to include a conventional
mechanical keyway in the lock."

Just because a computer contributes to a problem, doesn't mean the computer
*is* the problem.  Just because there is no "mechanical override" doesn't
mean there *should* have been one.

I, too, once found myself locked out of a hotel room by a failed lock.
Repeated attempts to open the lock failed.  My wife and I waited around in
the hallway for quite some time as various attempts were made to get the
lock to open.  (The attempt that succeeded involved a ladder, a third floor
window, and a hotel employee with a good head for heights.)

The only difference between our experience and that of Mr. Hutchens is that
the lock in question was a traditional mechanical lock.  Part of the
mechanism broke, and literally fell off the door into the room.  Without it,
there was no way to open the door for the outside.

Should I complain about the lack of overrides for mechanical locks?

There would only be a valid complaint here if the electronic keycard locks
failed as badly as Mr. Hutchens describes significantly more often than
their mechanical brethren.  I know of no evidence that this is the case.  I
do know that, in addition to my hotel experience, in the last year I found
myself caught in a conference room at work when the (non-locking) door latch
broke (the locksmith arrived shortly after I'd managed to remove the door
from its hinges, a more elaborate job than it ought to have been); and I had
to replace a broken lock on an external door at home after it, too, failed
in a way that left the door "stuck shut".  In that case, I had to literally
smash the lock with a chisel in order to get the door open.  Finally, while
we were undergraduates (*so* many years ago, sigh), a friend got to call
security to tell them he was locked *into* his room.  Come again?  You mean
you lost your keys and are locked out, don't you?  Well, no, the lock broke
and I'm locked *in*.

Mechanical locks are not quite as reliable as Mr. Hutchens appears to
believe, and when they do fail, the failures very often do require
significant mechanical intervention - the guy with the sledgehammer - to get
them open.  That's essentially what the locksmith at the hotel I was staying
at had to use to get the old lock out of the door; it's what he would have
used to get in to the room if the third-floor-ladder trick hadn't worked.
If most failures of keycard systems - even if more common than failures of
mechanical systems - can be repaired by the simple use of a master card key,
I should think we're well ahead of the game.

You have recently referred in RISKS [18.50, 18.52] to the ingenious new
attack against public key cryptosystems developed at Bellcore. All the
published information on the subject (including Bellcore's press release)
stress that the attack is not applicable to secret key cryptosystems.  Well,
Eli Biham and I have just released a research announcement in which we show
that an extension of the attack can, under the same realistic fault model,
break almost any secret-key algorithm, including DES, multiple DES, IDEA,
etc. The attack on DES was actually implemented on a PC, and it found the
key by analysing fewer than 200 ciphertexts generated from unknown
cleartexts.

Research announcement: A new cryptanalytic attack on DES

18 October 1996
(DRAFT)

In September 96, Boneh Demillo and Lipton from Bellcore announced an
ingenious new type of cryptanalytic attack which received widespread
attention (see, e.g., John Markoff's 9/26/96 article in the New York Times).
Their full paper had not been published so far, but Bellcore's press release
and the authors' FAQ (available at
<A HREF="http://www.bellcore.com/PRESS/ADVSRY96/medadv.html">http://www.bellcore.com/PRESS/ADVSRY96/medadv.html</A>) specifically state that
the attack is applicable only to public key cryptosystems such as RSA, and
not to secret key algorithms such as the Data Encryption Standard (DES).
According to Boneh, "The algorithm that we apply to the device's faulty
computations works against the algebraic structure used in public key
cryptography, and another algorithm will have to be devised to work against
the nonalgebraic operations that are used in secret key techniques." In
particular, the original Bellcore attack is based on specific algebraic
properties of modular arithmetic, and cannot handle the complex bit
manipulations which underly most secret key algorithms.

In this research announcement, we describe a related attack (which we call
Differential Fault Analysis, or DFA), and show that it is applicable to
almost any secret key cryptosystem proposed so far in the open literature.
In particular, we have actually implemented DFA in the case of DES, and
demonstrated that under the same hardware fault model used by the Bellcore
researchers, we can extract the full DES key from a sealed tamperproof DES
encryptor by analysing fewer than 200 ciphertexts generated from unknown
cleartexts.  The power of Differential Fault Analysis is demonstrated by the
fact that even if DES is replaced by triple DES (whose 168 bits of key were
assumed to make it practically invulnerable), essentially the same attack
can break it with essentially the same number of given ciphertexts.

We would like to greatfully acknowledge the pioneering contribution of Boneh
Demillo and Lipton, whose ideas were the starting point of our new attack.

In the rest of this research announcement, we provide a short technical
summary of our practical implementation of Differential Fault Analysis of
DES. Similar attacks against a large number of other secret key cryptosystems
will be described in the full version of our paper.

TECHNICAL DETAILS OF THE ATTACK

The attack follows the Bellcore fundamental assumption that by exposing a
sealed tamperproof device such as a smart card to certain physical effects
(e.g., ionizing or microwave radiation), one can induce with reasonable
probability a fault at a random bit location in one of the registers at some
random intermediate stage in the cryptographic computation. Both the bit
location and the round number are unknown to the attacker.

We further assume that the attacker is in physical possession of the
tamperproof device, so that he can repeat the experiment with the same
cleartext and key but without applying the external physical effects. As a
result, he obtains two ciphertexts derived from the same (unknown) cleartext
and key, where one of the ciphertexts is correct and the other is the result
of a computation corrupted by a single bit error during the computation. For
the sake of simplicity, we assume that one bit of the right half of the data
in one of the 16 rounds of DES is flipped from 0 to 1 or vice versa, and
that both the bit position and the round number are uniformly distributed.

In the first step of the attack we identify the round in which the fault
occurred.  This identification is very simple and effective: If the fault
occurred in the right half of round 16, then only one bit in the right half
of the ciphertext (before the final permutation) differs between the two
ciphertexts. The left half of the ciphertext can differ only in output bits
of the S box (or two S boxes) to which this single bit enters, and the
difference must be related to non-zero entries in the difference
distribution tables of these S boxes.  In such a case, we can guess the six
key bit of each such S box in the last round, and discard any value which
disagree with the expected differences of these S boxes (e.g., differential
cryptanalysis). On average, about four possible 6-bit values of the key
remain for each active S box.

If the faults occur in round 15, we can gain information on the key bits
entering more than two S boxes in the last round: the difference of the
right half of the ciphertext equals the output difference of the F function
of round 15.  We guess the single bit fault in round 15, and verify whether
it can cause the expected output difference, and also verify whether the
difference of the right half of the ciphertext can cause the expected
difference in the output of the F function in the last round (e.g., the
difference of the left half of the ciphertext XOR the fault).  If
successful, we can discard possible key values in the last round, according
to the expected differences.  We can also analyse the faults in the 14'th
round in a similar way.  We use counting methods in order to find the key.
In this case, we count for each S box separately, and increase the counter
by one for any pair which suggest the six-bit key value by at least one of
its possible faults in either the 14'th, 15'th, or 16'th round.

We have implemented this attack on a personal computer.  Our analysis
program found the whole last subkey given less than 200 ciphertexts,
with random single-faults in all the rounds.

This attack finds the last subkey.  Once this subkey is known, we can
proceed in two ways: We can use the fact that this subkey contains 48 out of
the 56 key bits in order to guess the missing 8 bits in all the possible
2^8=256 ways. Alternatively, we can use our knowledge of the last subkey to
peel up the last round (and remove faults that we already identified), and
analyse the preceding rounds with the same data using the same attack. This
latter approach makes it possible to attack triple DES (with 168 bit keys),
or DES with independent subkeys (with 768 bit keys).

This attack still works even with more general assumptions on the fault
locations, such as faults inside the function F, or even faults in the key
scheduling algorithm.  We also expect that faults in round 13 (or even prior
to round 13) might be useful for the analysis, thus reducing the number of
required ciphertext for the full analysis.

OTHER VULNERABLE CIPHERS

Differential Fault Analysis can break many additional secret key
cryptosystems, including IDEA, RC5 and Feal.  Some ciphers, such as Khufu,
Khafre and Blowfish compute their S boxes from the key material.  In such
ciphers, it may be even possible to extract the S boxes themselves, and the
keys, using the techniques of Differential Fault Analysis.  Differential
Fault Analysis can also be applied against stream ciphers, but the
implementation might differ by some technical details from the
implementation described above.

The latest government proposal for encryption software controls touts a new
approach called "key recovery."  This provision would allow law enforcement
officials to rebuild, or "recover" the mathematical key to encoded messages
with the help of third-party code-breakers.  The new policy reflects
suggestions made in a National Research Council report released earlier this
year.  Under the Clinton plan, encryption keys would be expanded from 40
bits to 56 bits in products to be exported, provided the company agrees to
the key recovery process.  In addition, authority to issue licenses for
overseas sales of such products would move from the State Department, where
they're handled as "munitions," over to the Commerce Department.  The
Business Software Alliance, however, is still not completely happy with the
compromise.  "We expect to go back to Congress," says a BSA spokeswoman.
"Although the announcement was clearly a step in the right direction, it's
not at all what the industry was looking for in its entirety."  (*Investor's

Here's the official apology and explanation of the BBN-Planet outage last
week.  I'm a little put off by Paul Gudonis's offer for credit for two days
of service in his last paragraph.  As everyone knows, the cost of not being
able to do business is vastly greater than the cost of keeping up our single
T1 line here at SRI.

&gt;From: Paul Gudonis &lt;<A HREF="mailto:pgudonis@bbnplanet.com">pgudonis@bbnplanet.com</A>&gt;
&gt;Subject: Palo Alto Power Outage
&gt;
&gt;This letter is to our customer administrative and technical contacts
&gt;who were affected by the outage last week at BBN Planet's Palo Alto
&gt;POP.  I know how detrimental even a short outage of Internet service
&gt;is to your business; I have spoken to many of you and understand how
&gt;drastic an impact the lengthy outage on Friday had.  I want to
&gt;communicate what we know about the cause of the outage and what steps
&gt;we took and are taking.
&gt;
&gt;BBN Planet's Palo Alto POP is collocated at Stanford University's data
&gt;center.  This facility, in addition to handling the University's data
&gt;systems, hosts systems for the Stanford University Hospital.  Stanford
&gt;has redundant power systems, drawing on both Stanford's co-generation
&gt;facility and PG&amp;E power. Stanford has had continuous power at this
&gt;facility for over 10 years, including during earthquakes and during
&gt;the brownout that the western region experienced in August.
&gt;
&gt;The equipment that switches between these power sources failed last
&gt;Thursday at 7 pm PDT.  Battery backup allowed us to continue powering
&gt;equipment through 9 pm PDT.  Stanford's power was restored at 12:30 am
&gt;PDT Friday. BBN restored service to the majority of customers affected
&gt;by 1:20 PDT.  Stanford's power failed again at 6 am PDT.  Due to the
&gt;previous outage, the backup batteries were not fully recharged at this
&gt;point and BBN Planet's power was lost.
&gt;
&gt;Two backup generators were ordered and in place by 2 pm PDT.  One
&gt;generator was required for the cooling systems, the second for the POP
&gt;equipment.  When the generators started running, one failed.  To avoid
&gt;further failures, two additional generators were ordered and one was
&gt;in place by 3:30 pm PDT.  As the second generator was being started
&gt;up, main power was restored to Stanford at 4:30.  Over the next hour,
&gt;the temperature in the POP was stabilized, the POP equipment was
&gt;restarted and service restored to customers.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;From the time the first outage occurred, BBN Planet field service staff
&gt;remained on site.  I was personally at the Palo Alto facility to ensure
&gt;that our local staff had any resources -- internal or external --
&gt;required to restore service to you as quickly as possible.  At both
&gt;headquarters and our Western Region offices, additional staff were
&gt;recruited to personally call each customer and inform them of our
&gt;plans.  Our 800 632 7638 line was updated as new information was
&gt;available.
&gt;
&gt;I am proud of dedication the BBN Planet staff showed in addressing
&gt;customer concerns and striving to restore service as fast as possible.
&gt;However, none of us are satisfied with our performance.  Although the
&gt;redundant power at Stanford had performed with 100% reliability for
&gt;the last 10 years, we are taking additional steps to ensure that power
&gt;outages do not impact our customers. The generators will be kept on
&gt;site to avoid further outages until they are replaced with a permanent
&gt;generator.  They are being manned 7 x 24 to ensure we can start them
&gt;up before the batteries are exhausted.
&gt;
&gt;While BBN Planet's staff did its best to contact customers, we were
&gt;not able to call as often or as early as we, or you, would like.  We
&gt;will have an operational Emergency Broadcast System in place in
&gt;December that will allow us to contact all affected customers within a
&gt;few minutes.  We'll update you as this service comes on line.
&gt;
&gt;We have also made substantial investments in our network
&gt;infrastructure to deliver the service quality that you expect.  In the
&gt;last six months, we deployed a high-capacity national backbone with
&gt;redundant facilities, expanded our server operations, and implemented
&gt;new systems for customer support.  We are continuing to install more
&gt;capacity, more redundancy, and new systems to meet your evolving
&gt;needs.  We'll keep you informed of these improvements.
&gt;
&gt;We are automatically issuing credits for two days of service to all
&gt;customers who lost service due to the Palo Alto power failure.  We
&gt;have made significant investments and continue to strive to be the
&gt;most reliable Internet Service Provider.  After this incident, we have
&gt;a ways to go to regain your confidence, but will make every effort to
&gt;do so.
&gt;
&gt;Regards,
&gt;

As far as I can see from the archives, this is the slowest animal ever to
make it into the RISKS gallery of "rodent"-caused outages ;-)

According to a local newspaper, Soccer fans in Liechtenstein were unable
to watch the last couple of minutes of a soccer match between the French
team of Auxerre and Switzerland's Zuerich Grasshoppers when a snail
crawled into a socket. The resulting short-circuit caused the entire cable
TV network of Liechtenstein to fail.

PGN's request for redundancy brings to mind the story of the infrastructure
computer center in Trumbull, Connecticut.  It is an old story but bears
repeating.

Seems that a squirrel got into a transformer and brought down the external
power supply.  The UPS kicked in, engine generators came on line, and the
center operated in this mode for about an hour and a half.  At the end of
that time the external power was restored.  The external power, the UPS, and
the engine generators went inot a deadly embrace.  The whole thing came down
and would not come back up.

I take two lessons from this.  First, redundancy adds some complexity and a
lot of redundancy adds a lot of complexity.  At some point the redundancy
begins to introduce failure modes and failure events that would not have
exited in its absence.  There is an upper bound to such redundancy.

Second, test redundant systems through to resumption of normal operations.
In this case, the operators had tested to ensure that the redundant systems
would come online in the event of a failure of the primary system.  They had
not tested to see what would happen when the primary system was restored to
normal operation.

Who would have even thought about it?  I confess that I would not have.

Some older readers of RISKS may recall the Franklin National Bank.  An
officer, speculating in foreign currency, lost fifty million dollars, a
small percentage of the bank's capital.  While the bank was able to keep
this peculation secret for ninety days, it inevitably leaked and the leak
resulted in an article in the Wall Street Journal.  In the next ninety days
the bank lost a billion and a half dollars in deposits and ultimately
failed.

The lesson that most bankers take from the story is that publicity about
losses is often worse than the losses themselves.  In the electronic era,
bank runs do not involve panic stricken crowds in the streets.

This story would be very troubling if true.  Just as troubling is the
failure to provide a complete citation.  In the absence of such citations,
this story is merely hearsay, another modern myth.

I am reminded of the rumors, for example, of viruses, that are more
destructive than the thing that they report.  Another example is the report
that Lexis/Nexis would return social security number for name.

In the electronic era, when gossip and rumors spread with unprecedented
speed, it essential to know the primary source and to err on the side of not
repeating that which you do not know first-hand to be both true and
important.

Once again we are reminded that computer security should be considered
within a wider context that includes people security.  The *Manchester
Guardian Weekly* (vol.155, no.14, for week ending Oct.6, 1996) in its
Washington Post section (p.16) reported that a spy named Robert Chaegon Kim
in the Washington D.C. area had been able to gather sensitive information
and pass it on to a South Korean embassy official.  The report said that

"... Kim was an ideal source ... His computer work in what is
known as a SCIF (Secure Compartmented Information Facility) behind
two secure doors at the Office of Naval Intelligence afforded him
extraordinary access to a wide range of classified studies and
analysis by many intelligence agencies."

The report went on to say that "Kim routinely removed the classified labels"
before sending out the files.  One might reasonably argue that the computer
system was a significant help for Kim to do his "job".  Bob Morris often
says that "there will always be a Walker", and he is proven correct so far!

The Berliner Tagespiegel reported this week on the new light-rail switching
software that was installed the same weekend that the light rail (S-Bahn)
was moved back from the regular train track to its own tracks, which had
been under repair for some time. The tracks were cut off all day Saturday
and Sunday with busses attempting to move passengers. The software is
installed at a central switching board, so that the transportation company
can save the money they would otherwise pay real people to manually move the
switches.  The software kicked in, and Monday all went well until rush hour
hit - yep, you guessed it, a stack overflow, just like in Hamburg. And it is
the same large German company that was responsible for the Hamburg fiasco
that wrote this software - it may even be the exact same software. Will they
ever learn to *do* quality assurance at this company and not just talk about
it? It took hours to get the system back up. The newspaper quotes
(ironically?) a spokesman as saying that the software control was very
modern since there is only one point at which it can go wrong. Of course, if
that single point goes wrong...  I spoke this morning with a nameless
higher-up at the transportation company, who just said "Software always has
errors. We're just happy that no one gets killed when the software fails."
He wouldn't believe me, when I said that we have ways of ensuring that
software won't fail.

As most of the known universe is aware (or soon will be, c being a
constant), the New York Yankees won the World Series this year... so,
yesterday, the Big Apple honored them with its traditional tribute, a
ticker-tape parade... a modern twist to the event, however, is noted in the
following excerpt from *The New York Times*, 30 Oct 1996.

&gt; Ticker tape being an obsolete relic, people hurled everything from
&gt; shredded paper to confetti to toilet tissue. In fact, several
&gt; government agencies across from city hall dumped entire boxes of public
&gt; and confidential records out the window, without troubling to shred
&gt; them.  Down came checks issued by the New York City Housing Authority
&gt; and records of unemployment checks from the New York State Department
&gt; of Social Services.

...which goes to show that the risks to the privacy and confidentiality
of public record systems are not engendered solely by computers and
telecommunications technologies... ultimately they begin with people...

[This should be no surprise to long-time RISKS readers.  In <A HREF="/Risks/3.90.html">RISKS-3.90</A>,
30 Oct 1986, ten years ago to the day, I noted essentially the same
scenario after the New York Mets won the 1986 World Series.  PGN]

The following is the text of a letter which I faxed to The Editor, London
Evening Standard, today:-

As the recipient of two different versions of the e-mail message supposedly
advertising child pornography, I (like many others) at first assumed it was
genuine and complained to our e-mail postmasters.

Although they take this sort of misuse of the Internet very seriously and
are investigating it, they pointed out that the message is extremely unlikely
to be genuine, particularly since it contained the name and home address of
an individual. This opinion is shared by UKERNA, the authority responsible
for the academic network in this country.

It is probably a ``spam'' or hoax in which a message is sent by a malicious
person in such a way that it appears to come from someone else. The motive
was probably to discredit or to cause other damage to the individual named
in the e-mail message, damage which the article in your edition of 21
October has aggravated, since it actually names this person. A little
elementary fact-checking would have been advisable.

(I was also amused to see that the messages I received came from electronic
addresses on the America On-Line (AOL) service provider. AOL achieved fame a
short while ago by allegedly refusing a subscription from a user on the
grounds that four of the letters in the name of his home town constitute a
rude word! [<A HREF="/Risks/18.07.html">RISKS-18.07</A> and 08])

This scheme is pretty clever!  Of course, it doesn't address the East Coast
market, but one can take the tests in Europe too.  I took the computer
science GRE in Switzerland (got a perfect score too :-).  That's a six hour
time difference!  It never occurred to me to make notches in my pencil to
record the answers ...

I'm not sure what the charges are for prosecuting such a thing.  Kobayashi's
test-takers' answers are not copyrighted by ETS: the test takers are not
given the answers together with a copyright notice.

College Test Cheaters Arrested

Federal prosecutors in New York say a California man has been arrested on
charges of operating an elaborate scheme to help prospective graduate school
students cheat on admission exams.  Prosecutors say George Kobayashi ran a
company that provided test-takers with correct answers in code on pencils
that the students carried into the exam with them. Authorities say Kobayashi
paid a team of experts to take each exam in New York City using assumed
names. These experts then telephoned the correct answers to Kobayashi's
office in Los Angeles, where the answers were quickly coded onto pencils by
Kobayashi's employees and then provided to the cheating students. The scheme
worked because of a three-hour time difference between the cities.

For those of you who are recipients of the Computer Privacy Digest

issues lately, the moderator, Leonard P. Levine, just called me to tell me
that he had a heart attack on 13 Oct 1996, followed by a successful bypass
operation.  He is recovering nicely and wants you to know that the Digest
will eventually continue.  He insisted that he would like to be left alone
(please, no e-mail or telephone calls or faxes to him or to the Digest until
further notice), although he said he would not be averse to postcards
(Leonard Levine, Dept of EECS, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Box 784,
Milwaukee WI 53201) if postmarked no later than 13 Nov 1996 (to stave off
readers of the RISKS archives many moons from now).

There are two interesting RISKS connections.  While on the gurney being
wheeled into the operating room, Leonard observed that on his chest was a
piece of equipment from Marquette Electronics that had been designed by his
students.  (I presume he took great personal pleasure in the fact that it
worked correctly.)  He also says he learned a lot more about the medical
privacy issues.

--- Paul Kocher, Oct. 20, 1996, comp.security.misc

How to find a secret key faster than the exhaustive search without the
help of the differential analysis.
--- This paper

During the last months very interesting programs, papers and
announcements were released about the (cryptanalytic) use of transient
faults in tamper resistant (or proof) devices by:

- some well-known anonymous authors (in the payTV context; SFS);

- Anderson and Kuhn (applications well fitted to the real world);
[See Ross Anderson's comments in <A HREF="/Risks/18.52.html">RISKS-18.52</A>.  PGN]

- Boneh, Demillo and Lipton: they specifically attack public key cryptosystems;
their core attack bells an alert to the scientific community to
publish faster;

- Biham and Shamir: they described how to obtain a secret key (e.g. for DES)
using few ciphertexts.

This list is open, and we reserve some room in this paper for the
- future unknown authors.

Here we describe a new use of such attacks in order to accelerate exhaustive
keysearches in several contexts. We don't discuss if these attacks are
feasible: our main goal is to enumerate all possible attacks and their
cryptanalytic use against specific models. Knowing that will improve our
trust about the current or future devices in order to obtain a reasonable
level of security in a complete system.

Introduction

We suppose that the opponent is in possession of the secure device, able to
know the (external) inputs and the outputs and to apply some physical
constraints in order to trigger some transient errors at some random
locations (RAM, registers, ...). We suppose that these errors do not
interfere with the program used by the computations: these errors only
modify some data at some stage of the computation.  We do not here discuss
the possibility of permanent errors: it will be explained in the full paper
(incremental permanent errors with possible use of several secure devices,
...).

They are many protocols where the input message and the corresponding output
message are accessible to everybody including the opponent if the device is
physically in the hand of the user (maybe for some short period of time):

Let f be a public cryptographic function, computed by some secure device
(smart card, secure black box, security hardware, ...),
k a secret key, stored by the secure device,
guessing its value is the goal of the opponent in this paper,
n the number of bits of the key k,
K is the set of all keys for f,
N the number of possible keys in K,
m an input message,
c an output message.

General protocol:
input:  m
output: c = f(m, k)

Examples:
- encryption of m by any secret key algorithm (DES, IDEA, ...),
- decryption of m by any secret key algorithm (DES, IDEA, ...),
- computation of the hashing of m by the keyed hash function f (MAC, ...),
- m is a random number used by some identification protocol,
- ... .

Such protocols need very often some protections against possible abuses from
(well-chosen by the opponent) messages m (see Biham-Shamir, Matsui,
Vaudenay, ...) or not so random numbers.  One necessary condition is to
avoid the discovery of k by exhaustive key search: such a general search
algorithm is now described.

Key search algorithm:
Given m, c
Enumerate all candidate keys i from K
Compute f(m, i) = c_i
If c_i = c then (output i and stop)
End of loop.

Mean work factor: N / 2.

Indeed, if we suppose that the key is unique for each pair (m, c) (it is not
true for DES: they are sometimes collisions) then the number of computations
of f is N/2 for the mean case and N for the worst case.  The goal of this
paper is to show how to improve such a complexity by the use of (randomly
activated) transient faults in the secure device.

Model 1: Single fault in the secret key

- Working hypothesis:
the opponent is able to modify at a random location one bit of the
key k (the new transient key is then k*) and to get the correct result of
f(m, k*); after the reset of the secure device by the opponent, the
internal secret key is again the correct one k. We suppose that the
random modification is equidistributed on all n bits of the key k.

- Key search algorithm: given m,

1. Physical attack of the secure device:
Obtain the n possible pairs (m, c_j) where c_j is equal to f(m, k_j);
k_j is the modified key k with the jth bit being flipped;
We need about n*log n "questions" to obtain the n different
pairs (by the coupon collector paradox: in some way the dual of
the birthday paradox), that is, if f is the DES for instance, about
300 accesses to the secure device.

2. Enumerative key search on an external key search machine:
Given m, the c_j's
Enumerate (pseudo-) randomly all candidate keys i from K
Compute f(m, i) = c_i
If c_i = one of c_j's then (output i^*=i and stop)
End of loop.

3. Key correcting algorithm on an external computer:
Given m, i^*, c,
Enumerate the n values i coming from i^* with one flipped bit at
every n possible positions
Compute f(m, i) = c_i
if c_i = c then (output i and stop)  !the secret key is found!
End of loop.

Mean work factor: (N / (2*n)) + n.

Indeed, the first step is very fast, the second step needs the mean work
factor of the exhaustive key search divided by the number of bits of the key
(if we suppose that the modified keys are randomly distributed in the key
set K) and the last step needs indeed n computations of f.

For DES it means about 2^49 computations: let us recall that one FPGA device
in one proposed implementation (see van Oorschot and Wiener) is able to do
about 2^26 computations of DES, with key change, each second (using a
pipelined implementation it is possible to compute a DES at each clock tick
and we here suppose a very possible clock of 65 MHz). It means that one
secret key will be recovered by such a small , accessible and inexpensive
machine in 2^23 seconds, that is, less than 4 months. With p FPGAs working
in parallel that time will be divided by p. The comparison operation in step
2 needs a modification of such a machine (a very easy step in software): it
is a simple modification and thanks to the paper [Desmedt, Quisquater,
EUROCRYPT '87] it is possible to implement it in the case of many c_j's
without any large expense and using a very simple hash (non cryptographic)
function.

Model 2: Multiple faults in the secret key

- Working hypothesis:
The opponent is able to modify at random locations one or several bits of
the key k (the new transient key is k*) and to get the correct result of
f(m, k*); after the reset of the secure device, the internal secret key
is again k. We suppose that the random modifications are equidistributed
on all n bits of the key k. The main idea is that the opponent is able
with a high probability to change randomly few bits of the secret key.

It is easy to adapt the key search algorithm in that context.
The complexity of the attack is directly related to the number of
modified keys. The step 3 is also easy: if the key change is too
large in relation to the number of flipped bits, it is sometimes
necessary to skip the search and to begin a new one.

Model 3: Attacking several secret keys in parallel using several
secure devices

It is easy to see that the first secret key will be found by a number of
computations equal to the number needed for the two first models divided by
the number of secure devices used in parallel. It means a very fast
discovery in case of a massive attack.

In the complete paper we will explain
- how to filter efficiently the noise (transient errors with useless output),
- how to combine such an attack with the one by Biham and Shamir,
- how to resist to these attacks without expensive computations by the
secure device,
- how this attack is useful to know for public key cryptosystems.

Conclusion
We describe a new use of the attack by transient fault in a secure
device: without any new protection and if this attack is feasible
it means that a secret key will be obtained by about N / log (N) computations
2
(or less!) instead of N/2 computations by the normal exhaustive keysearch.
In that case this attack is really shortening your keys.

In the early days of DES, the US government called out another standard for
use in conjunction with DES, Federal Standard 1027.  As I recall, this
standard called for redundant hardware or other means of ensuring that
hardware malfunctions could not affect accuracy of encryption or decryption.

FED-STD 1027 was superseded by FIPS 140. The FIPS are available at
<A HREF="http://www.nist.gov/itl/lab/fips/">http://www.nist.gov/itl/lab/fips/</A>, where the version is FIPS 140-1,
"Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules".

I quote:

"Level 4 also protects a module against a compromise of its
security due to environmental conditions or fluctuations outside
of the module's normal operating ranges for voltage and
temperature. Intentional excursions beyond the normal operating
ranges could be used to thwart a module's defense during an
attack. A module is required to either include special
environmental protection features designed to detect
fluctuations and zeroize critical security parameters, or to
undergo rigorous environmental failure testing that provides a
reasonable assurance that the module will not be affected by
fluctuations outside of the normal operating range in a manner
that can compromise the security of the module."

It seems reasonable that NSA knew of Differential Fault Analysis in the
1970's.

I found this report interesting, but I think that it should have referred to
"random" rather than "unknown" cleartext messages.

Since the attack requires that the attacker have physical possession of the
encryption device and the cleartext messages (in order to encrypt them multiple
times) clearly the attacker has the capability of "knowing" the cleartext
contents directly.

To work with truly "unknown" cleartexts, I would consider only attacks that
dealt with just the cyphertext and didn't require access to the cleartext.

Last night I visited the National Cryptologic Museum.  I got to click the
wheels on an Enigma and was reminded of the story that the British had
bugged a room in France and got information about the key from listening to
the clicks when the key was entered.

Bruce Schneier reminds me that there are more ways to stress a crypto engine
than are dreamed of in my philosophy and that any phenomenon that can be
observed from outside the engine that vary with its operation can leak
information about the key.  Jerry Leichter (*) reminds me that hiding these
things is a constant battle and that is certainly confirmed by my
experience.  [* Spelling FIXED in Archive copy.]

The cryptographers can help by properly characterizing their work.  As I
understand the work reported by Biham and Shamir, it demonstrates that the
recent work reported by Bellcore and and which they admitted that they had
only demonstrated against implementations that implement algebraic
algorithms can be extended and applied to Feistel algorithms.  In both
cases, what is reported is theoretical, at least in the sense that they have
not yet been demonstrated against any existing engines.  (Based upon the
"sky is falling" calls that I have received from reporters, I can guarantee
you that little of this is understood.)

While the theoretical target of their attack was the DES, this work tells us
nothing new about the DES.  One point of the report was that the DES was
simply a chosen example of a broader class of algorithms that would yield to
such an attack.  It is not even aimed at the DES but rather at hardware
implementations.  Terry Ritter has suggested that it might be far less
effective against software implementations.  To characterize this work as "a
new attack on DES" is inaccurate at best and seriously misleading at worst.

Never having lived in the US, I have no familiarity with the detailed
workings of Social Security.  However, the fact that an error like this
apparently went unnoticed for 22 years strongly suggests that either (1)
nobody who was receiving these payments ever reported the under- payment,
because none of them had any information about how the correct amount to be
paid was calculated, or (2) the underpayments were reported by, and
corrected for, a few cautious and diligent individuals, but nobody in the
SSA ever looked for a programmatic reason why they had occurred.  Either way
the risks are obvious.

How DID the error finally come to light, anyway?

Surely it was the attempted secrecy that caused the banks's customers to
lose their trust? What are they trying to hide? A press release along the
lines of:

"We regret to announce that the XXXXX of the YYYYY department has been
suspended from duty pending the outcome of an internal inquiry into an
unexplained loss loss of ZZZZZ dollars.  On the positive side, the incident
shows that the Bank's internal audit mechanisms are fundamentally sound and
helped contain the loss to a figure that we can easily absorb.  We have
learned lessons which will enable us to further tighten up our procedures in
future."

Might have headed the whole thing off at the pass.

I'm sure that the culture of secrecy that surrounds banks actually
encourages their customers to distrust them.

Since there was no further followup after Bear Giles' item in <A HREF="/Risks/18.49.html">RISKS-18.49</A>,
let me set this matter straight.  Compiler quality is not involved; integer
type sizes are.  The expression -32768 or (-32768) is valid on any C
implementation, and must have the value -32,768.  However, its type is
implementation-defined: it is either int or long.  On some implementations,
the type int contains 16-bit values, so 32,767 is the largest int value; in
that case the type of the constant 32768 is long, so the expression -32768
must also be long.  On all other implementations, ints are wider than 16
bits and the type of -32768 is int.

In everyday contexts like

short s = -32768;

this distinction is immaterial.  Either a long or an int on the right-hand
side of the = sign will be successfully converted to a short with the value
-32,768, if the type short can represent that value; if it can't (the range
can be just -32,767 to 32,767), then of course neither one will work
correctly.

But there are a few specific situations where the type of -32768 does
matter.  Bear described one of them in his original posting: where the
compiler issues a warning for every long-to-short conversion and then
proceeds to treat a large number of warnings as an error.  And the context
mentioned above, the file &lt;limits.h&gt;, is another special case, because the C
standard requires the macro SHRT_MIN to produce an expression whose type is
int, not long.  Hence on *some* implementations, SHRT_MIN must be defined as
(-32767-1) or some other such workaround, not (-32768); but on other
implementations, where ints are wider than 16 bits, the definition as
(-32768) is as correct as the other.

Since the file &lt;limits.h&gt; contains information specific to the implementation,
it does not need to represent it in a portable manner.  Hence Gnu C is within
its rights to use (-32768) there, but, and here is the risk, it does not
follow that a user can safely extract that expression from that system file
and expect it to work anywhere.

Some of the discussions on redundancy and backup systems reminds me of an
automotive assembly plant where I once worked.

The plant engineers and management were always very insistent on having
redundant computer systems, even though a failure wasn't catastrophic for
90% of the cases. Typically there was 45 minutes to an hours worth of job
instructions printed on paper.

As a system implementor, I always argued that we spent as much time ensuring
there was adequate hardware redundancy as we did removing faults from the
software. More attention to fault removal would have eliminated enough of
the reasons the plant wanted redundancy to make the redundancy overkill.

When the primary system finally failed, it took at least as long to activate
the backup as it would have to fix the primary, but because there WAS a
backup, everyone worked on getting the backup up first. Of course, the key
reason it took so long to get the backup going was that there was so much
stuff running on it because no one wanted to "waste" that extra hardware.

A Japanese customer of the same system took a different approach, and didn't
order a backup. They felt it was much more important that the primary get
fixed immediately if it broke, and could tolerate the few hours of downtime.

The Next Stage of Differential Fault Analysis:
How to break completely unknown cryptosystems, 30 October 1996 (draft)

Eli Biham, Computer Science Dept., The Technion, Israel
Adi Shamir, Applied Math Dept., The Weizmann Institute, Israel

The idea of using computational faults to break cryptosystems was first
applied by Boneh Demillo and Lipton to public key cryptosystems, and then
extended by Biham and Shamir to most types of secret key cryptosystems.
[See <A HREF="/Risks/18.54.html">RISKS-18.54</A>.]  In this new research announcement, we introduce a
modified fault model that makes it possible to find the secret key stored in
a tamperproof cryptographic device even when nothing is known about the
structure and operation of the cryptosystem. A prime example of such a
scenario is the Skipjack cryptosystem, which was developed by the NSA, has
unknown design, and is embedded as a tamperproof chip inside the
commercially available Fortezza PC cards. We have not tested this attack on
Skipjack, but we believe that it is a realistic threat against some
smart-card applications that were not specifically designed to counter it.

The main assumption behind the new fault model is that the cryptographic key
is stored in an asymmetric type of memory, in which induced faults are much
more likely to change a 1 bit into a 0 than to change a 0 bit into a 1 (or
the other way around). CMOS registers seem to be quite symmetric, but most
types of nonvolatile memory exhibit some degree of asymmetry. For example, a
1 bit in an EEPROM cell is stored as a small charge on an electrically
isolated gate. If the fault is induced by external radiation (e.g.,
ultraviolet light), then the charges are more likely to leak out of the gate
than to be forced into the gate.

To make the analysis simpler, we assume that we can apply a low-level
physical stress to the tamperproof device when it is disconnected from
power, whose only possible effect is to occasionally flip one of the 1 bits
in the key register to a 0. The plausibility of this assumption depends on
numerous physical and technical considerations, which are beyond the scope
of this note.

We further assume that we are allowed to apply two types of cryptographic
functions to the given tamperproof device: We can supply a cleartext m and
use the current key k stored in the nonvolatile memory of the device to get
a ciphertext c, or we can supply a new n-bit key k' that replaces k in the
nonvolatile memory.

The cryptanalytic attack has two stages:

1. In the first stage of the attack, we keep the original unknown secret key
k stored in the tamperproof device, and use it to repeatedly encrypt a fixed
cleartext m_0. After each encryption, we disconnect the device from power
and apply a gentle physical stress. The resultant stream of ciphertexts is
likely to consist of several copies of c_0, followed by several copies of a
different c_1, followed by several copies of yet another c_2, until the
sequence stabilizes on c_f. Since each change is likely to be the result of
one more key bit flipping from 1 to 0 (thus changing the current key k_i
into a new variant k_i+1), and since there are about n/2 1 bits in the
original unknown key k, we expect f to be about n/2,and c_f to be the result
of encrypting m_0 under the all-zero key k_f.

2. In the second stage of the attack, we work our way backwards from the
known all-zero key k_f to the unknown original key k_0. Assuming that we
already know some intermediate key k_i+1, we assume that k_i differs from
k_i+1 in a single bit position. If we knew the cryptographic algorithm
involved, we could easily try all the possible single bit changes in a
simple software simulation on a personal computer, and find the (almost
certainly unique) change that would give rise to the observed ciphertext
c_i. However, we don't need either a simulator or knowledge of the
cryptographic algorithm, since we are given the real thing in the form of a
tamperproof device into which we can load any key we wish, to test out
whether it produces the desired ciphertext c_i. We can thus proceed
deterministically from the known k_f to the desired k_0 in O(n) stages,
trying O(n) keys at each stage. The attack is guaranteed to succeed if the
fault model is satisfied, and its total complexity is at most O(n^2)
encryptions.

This seems to be the first cryptanalytic attack that makes it possible to
find the secret key of a completely unknown cryptosystem in polynomial time
(quadratic time in our case). It relies on a particular fault model that
seems to be realistic, but requires further study.  In the full version of
this paper, we'll discuss numerous extensions of the attack -- including the
analysis of more complicated fault models in which the sequence of corrupted
keys forms a biased random walk in the space of 2^n possible keys.

America Online's new "Preferred Mail" junk e-mail blocking tool was
activated several days ago on all 6.5 million accounts;  it blocks all
e-mail from a list of (currently) 53 network domains that AOL has identified
as junk e-mailers.  Many of the domains have been used in the past by
Stanford Wallace, who is suing AOL for blocking his messages. One blocked
domain, managed by an Internet service provider called Cybercom, has been
tentatively removed from AOL's prohibited list, after protesting that it had
been placed on the list not because of its own actions but because two of
its 1500 clients sent adult-oriented junk e-mail, causing AOL immediately to
block all mail to AOL subscribers from any Cybercom customer.  (*Atlanta
Journal-Constitution*, 29 Oct 1996, D4)

[Following up on this strategy, the next step
would be for AOL to block all mail from AOL!  PGN]

The University of Colorado at Boulder has replaced the mechanical parking
meters in severals lot with a centralized computerized version that prints
a receipt convenient when challenging parking tickes. (Or is that
"convenient for them," since you need this receipt to successfully challenge
parking tickets?  :-) The two spots I use are in prominent locations -- one
is across from Regents Hall, the other is adjacent to the Police building.
I mention this because one would expect parking lot monitors to frequent
these sites...

Yet is it any wonder that I was a scofflaw during my classes on Monday
afternoon (on the first school day after the return to Mountain Standard
Time), since this high-tech solution to a simple problem made it impossible
to pay for my first hour of parking?

The flip side is worse -- if ticketed I could make a legal defense that
"what isn't permitted can't be compelled."  Unlucky visitors in the spring
can't make such a claim and may be forced to pay for an additional hour of
parking.

I don't remember seeing anything in RISKS on software bugs deflating the
success rates of recent cruise missile strikes on Iraq.  It all sounds very
similar to the Ariane-5 software reuse fiasco.  Below are the relevant
excerpts from David A. Fulghum's "Hard Lessons in Iraq Lead to New Attack
Plan" in the September 16 1996 issue of *Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology*
(pp. 24-25).

The article states: "Bomb damage assessment of the initial cruise missile
strike indicates that three of the 10 targets attacked by 13 Air Force
CALCMs (Conventional Air-Launched Cruise Missiles) emerged with "no
detectable damage," according to a U.S. intelligence report.  The Boeing
built CALCMs, converted from Cold War-era nuclear weapons at a cost of
$165,000 each, were launched from two B-52H bombers over the Persian Gulf."

Apparently: "Part of the problem with the CALCMs were that they were fired
at targets they were not designed to destroy, a product of hasty planning,
according to a senior Pentagon official. Air Force success rates were
further deflated because of missile computer programming quirks."

Further on: "Another CALCM target escaped damage because of a software
targetting quirk left over from its nuclear role. If two CALCMs are aimed at
the same target at the same time, one of the missiles will re-aim itself at
the next highest priority target. In the initial raid, one CALCM missed the
target while the other went on to the next site."

The risks of reusing software without proper testing for the new application
are obvious.

The Breeder's Cup - an American horserace being run for the first time in
Toronto last Saturday - suffered from various organizational difficulties,
according to an article in the Toronto _Globe &amp; Mail_ on Monday Oct. 28,
1996.  Among these was that the "tote board" - the display of current
betting odds - crashed.

"Betting was never halted during the tote board disruption, but [Ontario
Jockey Club president David] Willmot said it probably cost about
[CA]$400,000 in local betting handle because serious players will not make
large bets unless they can see exact odds.  It was a $35,000 bet in US
currency that crashed the system. The software designed to convert US money
to Canadian in the tote pools could not handle such a large amount."

Hmmm... $35,000.  Do you suppose a bet of oh, say $32,767 might have worked?

was also down.  In Canada, 80% of the banking is done electronically, and
the 30 million residents have 43 million bank cards.  In a separate item,
some Royal Bank customers had their accounts debited but received no cash.

The test-beating scenario could actually happen within the same time zone.
To gain entrance to a British graduate school, one usually is required to
take ELTS, which is a British administered English language test that it
similar to the American TOEFL.  ELTS contains 6 exam subjects, including the
normal listening comprehension as well as writing exams where one is asked
to compose a long essay and a short one, in the space of one hour, for two
given themes.  I singled out these two exam subjects because they tend to be
the more difficult ones for native Chinese speakers.  (Oral exam by
interview is probably more difficult, but it is almost impossible to cheat,
except perhaps by hitting on a discussion topic that is favoured by the
interviewer.)

About 10 years ago, the local British council was responsible for
administering the tests, and they had four test sites: Beijing, Shanghai,
Chengdu, and Guangzhou.  They were (and are) in the same time zone but are
hundreds of miles apart.  The British council made things worse (1) by using
a travelling team to conduct the tests, which meant 3 to 5 days delay
between two consecutive tests, and (2) by having only two sets of exam
papers.  The upshot was that snail mail could still allow a few days for one
to fully prepare for the composition tests.  It was said that a year
earlier, an examiner noticed, during listening comprehension, that some
students finished 100% correct papers when the tape was played only half-way
through.

&gt; I'm not sure what the charges are for prosecuting such a thing.

Perhaps "falsification of legal documents"?  The government has an obvious
interest if a student is admitted and gets federally backed financial aid on
the basis of fraudulent documents.  Even if the student doesn't get direct
aid, most public schools still receive indirect subsidies.

PRIVACY Forum Digest      Monday, 14 October 1996      Volume 05 : Issue 19
Moderated by Lauren Weinstein (<A HREF="mailto:lauren@vortex.com">lauren@vortex.com</A>)
Vortex Technology, Woodland Hills, CA, U.S.A.
The PRIVACY Forum is supported in part by the
ACM (Association for Computing Machinery)
Committee on Computers and Public Policy,
"internetMCI" (a service of the Data Services Division
of MCI Telecommunications Corporation), and Cisco Systems, Inc.

As you probably have seen over the last few weeks, the topic of personal
information databases has rather suddenly become a "hot topic" in the
mainstream media, propelled partially by the Lexis-Nexis "P-TRAK"
controversy.  The Federal Trade Commission is reportedly considering placing
Social Security Numbers (SSN) and some other related data back into the
"protected" status of the Fair Credit Reporting Act [FCRA] (that is,
removing SSN from the "publicly available" credit header category).  There
are also reports that Congressional efforts that were on track to *weaken*
the FCRA may have been halted or reversed by the resulting public outcry.

But it's worth emphasizing again that we need comprehensive study and
legislation to begin broadly addressing the entire privacy area; it is
simply not possible for these problems to be addressed one service at a
time.

As I pointed out originally, "P-TRAK" does not represent the most onerous of
available databases.  Lexis-Nexis *did* block name to SSN lookups (though
not the reverse), and has provided mechanisms to allow people to request
removal (which may or may not be effective in the long run--time will tell).
But they are at least trying.

There are other services that promote the availability of vast arrays of
personal information that many people would (erroneously) consider private,
with no removal options of any kind available.  It's important to note that
with all the services with which I'm familiar, there is nothing illegal or
otherwise illicit about their operations.  They're distributing "public
record" and other openly accessible data not currently covered by the FCRA
or other laws.  Much of the data comes from public municipal databases, or
from "business transaction" information of the sorts we've discussed
previously, and over which little or no legislative restrictions exist.

It's also the case that there are legitimate reasons why some individuals
and other entities might at times need access to some of the information
contained in various categories of these databases.  There are cases where
some frauds can be prevented or traced through such information.  The
problem is that at present there are no legal requirements placing any
sort of "need to know" on most of this data, so most is accessible
essentially to anyone willing to pay the designated fee, regardless of their
(good or bad) motives.

Many services are providing these sorts of data, some very large and
some small.  Outside of Lexis-Nexis "P-TRAK" with which we're already
familiar, here's information regarding two representative others...

-- "Information America" (<A HREF="http://www.infoam.com">http://www.infoam.com</A>)

IA has a nicely laid out web site listing a veritable cornucopia of public
record and other related available data.  I won't even attempt to give a
comprehensive listing here, but just a few of the many categories include:

Wizard -- master search of all Information America online services

Asset Locator -- real property, stocks, personal property, etc.

People Finder -- Address Alert, Credit Bureau Headers,
Deceased Records, Neighbor Listings,
Person Locator, Skip Tracer,
Social Security Number Tracker, Telephone Tracker,
Trace a person's residential moves

Relationship Identifier, and so on...

This is but a small sampling.  In a conversation with their Executive VP,
I learned that, in response to concerns raised by the "P-TRAK" furor, they
have very recently voluntarily removed SSN data from the credit header
output information.  Their web site has been recently updated and no longer
shows SSN as an available data output item.

This puts them in the same category as "P-TRAK" in this respect, in that you
can still *search* for other information using SSN if you already know the
number, but you can't get an SSN from other data via Information America.
I was told that some of their clients engaged in criminal investigation type
work were not at all happy at having the ability to lookup SSNs removed from
everybody's access, since they consider it to be an important investigative
tool.

Information America does not provide a mechanism for persons wishing to be
removed from any of their databases.  First, they feel that the public
record data they supply would be less useful for legitimate purposes if
people could opt-out at will.  Secondly, they say that since some of the
databases are not under their direct control, they do not have the technical
means to provide such mechanisms in any case.

--- CDB Infotek (<A HREF="http://www.cdb.com">http://www.cdb.com</A>)

CDB provides a range of services and data very similar to that of Information
America.  However, they have chosen *not* to block access to Social Security
Number data.  According to the customer service representative I spoke to,
you can still look up a person's credit header record based on name,
address, or other data, and obtain their SSN through the service (provided
the SSN is included in that person's database record of course, which would
typically be the case).  CDB also promotes the availability of all
information over the Internet.  No obvious provision for requesting removal
from their databases is apparent.
- - -

There are other similar organizations as well.  It's a difficult situation.
In the absence of legislation addressing these issues across the board,
services who take unilateral actions to restrict any class of data feel
that they're putting themselves at a competitive disadvantage compared
with those services who *don't* implement such restrictions.

We need to start working out sensible, logical, and balanced rules and laws
regarding information and privacy, that address the concerns of a wide
range of individuals and organizations.  The longer we wait, and the
more we approach the area in a piecemeal fashion, the more intractable
the problems are likely to become.

Where Wizards Stay Up Late: The Origins of the Internet
by Katie Hafner and Matthew Lyon, Simon and Schuster, NY NY 1996
(ISBN 0-684-81201-0)
Reviewed by Tom Perrine &lt;<A HREF="mailto:tep@sdsc.edu">tep@sdsc.edu</A>&gt; [See also <A HREF="/Risks/18.29.html">RISKS-18.29</A>]

The Internet has erupted onto the scene of mainstream consciousness in just
a few short years.  Numerous attempts to "explain" all this technology has
lead to a plethora of books purporting to educate "everyman" about the
innermost workings of this technology.  Out of this morass of
poorly-researched books (and entirely too few good ones) comes something
more interesting: a technological history of the Internet's direct ancestor,
the ARPA network.

Coming seemingly out of nowhere, vaulting from the relative obscurity of a
handful of research facilities into homes and schools across the country and
around the world, the Internet is obviously the most important technological
tool since the personal computer (some would say since movable type).

But where did the Internet come from?  Was it created from whole cloth?  Was
it created by a single company?  Why isn't it run by "The Phone Company?"
What was the ARPAnet?  Just who did invent the Internet, and when, and why?

All of these questions (and many more) are answered by the eminently
readable book _Where Wizards Stay Up Late: The Origins of the Internet_.
This books could be dismissed as simply _The Soul of a New Network_, but
that would be a mistake.  This book is more readable, yet more technically
complete and accurate than Kidder's _The Soul of a New Machine_.

Katie Hafner and Matthew Lyon have successfully explained the origins of the
technology that millions now depend on and take for granted every day.  They
take the reader on a journey that begins in the early days of the Cold War
with the launch of Sputnik, and ends with today's commercial on-line
services, and ubiquitous electronic mail and World Wide Web addresses.

If you doubt that "the Net" has become important to average consumers,
consider these questions: Has anyone seen a recent television commercial or
magazine advertisement without an "http" in it lately?  Why did the Cable
News Network (CNN) have as its lead stories the recent network outages of
America Online and BBN Planet that left literally millions without Internet
access for more than a day?

Along the way, we are treated to the dreams of visionaries and charlatans,
academics and bureaucrats, scientists and engineers, who shared the hope of
using technology to connect people to people.

The story is organized chronologically, yet always sets the technology in
the context of the people and the culture of the times.  The book focuses on
the earliest period of the ARPAnet, the original computer network research
project funded in the 1960s by the US Department of Defense.  This period is
the least known, and the information about this period the most important to
preserve at this time, while the persons involved are still around to tell
(and debate) their stories.

This book is a first-class piece of historical detective work, piecing
together developments at laboratories across the country and around the
world, all of which dovetailed to produce the world's first
geographically-distributed computer network.

The first chapters are devoted to the origins of the Advanced Research
Projects Agency (ARPA) itself, set in the days following Sputnik, and
America's technology "wake-up call".  The early advocates of "computer
communications" are introduced, including Bob Taylor, Joseph Licklider
("Lick"), and Larry Roberts.

This book attempts (and mostly succeeds) in tracing the engineering
decisions that shaped the ARPAnet's technology (and culture).  The early
debates of circuit-switched vs. packet-switched designs, centralized (star)
vs. distributed (mesh) are all examined and explained in accessible, yet not
over-simplified terms.

The origins of Bolt Beranek and Newman (BBN),and the people who worked there
are described in some fascinating detail.  Who would imagine that a
consulting company that was formed to perform acoustical engineering for new
buildings would become the builders of a computer network?  The trials and
tribulations of the "IMP Guys" that led to the creation of the first network
"router", the ARPANET Interface Message Processor (IMP), introduces two
people who would continue to to connect people and computers: Willie
Crowther (original author of "ADVENTURE"), and Bob Kahn, who started the
Strategic Computing Program, which is the more formal name for the
"Information Superhighway" program of the U.S. government.  The late nights,
and the eradication of "the bug" on the eve of the first IMP's shipment from
Cambridge to California are all recounted in a no-nonsense,
technically-savvy style.

Later chapters describe the activities at SRI, the original Network
Information Center (NIC), and the culture and people who decided that a
network standards document should be a "Request For Comments" (RFC).

These RFCs, and a culture of openness have been blamed (or praised) for the
demise of the International Standards Organization (ISO) Open System
Inteconnect (OSI) network protocols; the closed, agonizingly slow process of
ISO standardization process was continually "overcome be events" as the
ARPANET folks pushed the envelope with "rough consensus and running code".

Along the way we meet the first RFC, by Steve Crocker, titled simply "Host
Software", followed by the first higher level protocols, documented by Jon
Postel, Vint Cerf, the "MsgGroup" and the network's first "flame war" (over
e-mail standards), the now-infamous "header wars".

The ARPANET's direct contribution to Artificial Intelligence research,
operating systems (including UNIX), and human communication are all explored
as well.

It's an interesting journey, told through the eyes of the pioneers that
blazed the trail.  But make no mistake, this book is about the people behind
the technology as much (or more) than about the technology itself.  Having
essentially "grown up" on the net (my first ARPANET host account was active
in 1976, when I was in high school), I was fascinated by the stories of the
people who made all this communication possible.  This book has filled in
all the background of the happenings that I was too naive (or busy with
school :-) ) to understand at the time.

The authors of this book have reached back to the original sources, they
have spoken to and interviewed many of those who were directly responsible
for the work described.  In many cases the authors have reached into the
ARPA/IPTO Oral History project tapes and distilled this collection of
interviews into a seamless, coherent picture.

This book is about the people who invented the technology and culture of the
Internet, the legacy of practical engineering, and "rough consensus and
running code."

Here's yet another RISK, from erasing programs:

Marion Walton, an Arkansas man, was discovered having a cybersex affair with
a Canadian woman.  In response, his wife Pat apparently erased his mail
program.  In retaliation, he apparently beat her, twice.  ``Police are
suggesting she file charges.''  [Source: Man beats wife after she pulls plug
on cybersex, Reuters World Report, datelined Little Rock, 31 Oct 1996, via
CompuServe's Executive News Service, PGN Abstracting.]

that is, the kind that can be used to file down the iron bars?  PGN]

Automakers [are facing] runaway growth in the lines of code their engineers
must write and manage as microprocessors take over automotive functions...
``Software is where the problem is today,'' said William Powers, VP of
research at Ford.  ``Today, if you change a line of code, you're looking at
the potential for some major problems.  Hardware is very predictable, very
repeatable.  Software is in much more of a transient state.''  The volume of
code is exploding as processors proliferate behind the dashboard and under
the hood.  The typical auto has 10 to 15 processors; high-end cars can have
as many as 80 ... ``An engine controller can have 100,000 lines of code''
[according to a Bosch VP].  [``Software explosion rattles car makers'',

Electric Shade

Researchers at Vrije University in the Netherlands have developed a
light-blocking window film that can be adjusted by turning a switch.  The
film uses yttrium hydride, a metallic compound, which can block the sun
completely, partially, or can be made transparent by using a small battery
to alter the voltage passing across the film.  The higher the voltage, the
more hydrogen atoms, which causes the film to change from a metal to a
semiconductor.  The result is a clear window.  Scientists plan to use the
new product in automobiles, sunglasses, houses and other applications.
(*Popular Science*, Nov 1996, p31)

Great, eh?  One needs a voltage in order to have a clear window.  Lose power
in your automobile and you lose visibility through your window.  Let's hope
they build in appropriate fail-safes in automotive applications....

I was shopping for our Halloween party the other day, picking out all sorts
of pricey nibbles and alcohol for our guests.  At our local Vons (one of So.
Cal's biggest supermarket chains) checkout is generally fast and
straightforward, and I do not out of habit bother to check my receipt.  But
this time the price just seemed too high (perhaps I should just un-refine my
tastes?)...

A quick glance revealed an obvious suspect: the same entry for a bottle of
wine, printed and charged twice.  The apologizing checker handed me the
correct refund, and I asked how this could happen.  Apparently the first
time you swipe alcohol through for the customer you are supposed to press a
button which confirms their legal age status.  But from that point on the
very same button means "buying two of those".  In my case, the checker
simply forgot that she had run a six pack through already by the time the
wine came, and so she "confirmed my age" twice.  I do not know how
widespread this particular system is, but if it is in all Vons stores, then
it's plenty wide enough to be a potential problem.  She noted and corrected
the mistake so quickly that I suspect this circumstance is anything but
rare.

RISKS readers are well aware of the danger associated with giving a single
control two widely different meanings.  If any job leaves a worker
especially prone to forgetfulness (just through the sheer repetitiveness of
the work), it's being a grocery store clerk.  Two lessons: 1) check those
receipts, and 2) keep all your liquor purchases together; that way the
checker is less likely to forget.

Yediot Aharonot, October 23, 1996

A judge in Tel Aviv has ordered the remand in custody of two additional
suspects in a major ATM fraud case, who will join five businessmen from
Poland.  The gang are suspected of having prepared thousands of counterfeit
ATM cards.  The police claim they had purchased tens of thousands blank
plastic cards in Greece, on which they recorded the magnetic stripe and on
each there was a sticker with the PIN.  A Israeli computer expert, Daniel
Cohen of Ramat Gan, also in custody, obtained the codes and manufactured the
cards.  The Polish businessmen financed the operation, and planned to bring
foreign workers from Poland to use the cards to withdraw money from ATMs.
The police have photographs of suspects standing next to ATMs holding
quantities of forged cards.  They had used them to withdraw 1,500 Israeli
Sheqels (500 US Dollars) each, to a total of IS 600,000 (US$200,000).

A prototype e-mail program linking IRS tax databases with participating
mortgage lenders is scheduled to get underway in the next few months in
California, run by the Fresno IRS office.  Under the prototype program,
lenders will e-mail authorizations by home-loan applicants to the IRS,
allowing the agency to quickly e-mail tax data -- typically the applicants'
adjusted gross income for one or more years -- back to the lender.
[*LA Times*, 3 Nov 1996, Business section first page]

The article goes on to say that this information will be used both to verify
the information on the loan application, and to trigger IRS audits in cases
where the income reported on loan applications is more than what was
reported on tax returns.

There is no mention in the article about what if any measures are being
taken to ensure that this sensitive data is protected and authenticated.
Given the ease and regularity with which e-mail is misdirected, intercepted,
and forged, and the power that the IRS has to completely screw up your life,
I'd say this is the scariest thing I've seen in a long time (and as recent
readers of RISKS can attest, that is saying something).

Good news from those fun guys and gals at Microsoft!  According to an
article on page 19 of the October 1996, edition of Datamation, Office 97
will include VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) 5.0 as the scripting and
integration language for Access, Excel, PowerPoint, and Word.  Not only
that, but Microsoft has followed up on its promise to license VBA to other
vendors: upcoming releases of Visio (Visio), Chameleon (NetManage),
Photoshop (Adobe), and even AutoCAD (Autodesk) will use VBA 5.0.

To date, with the possible (though unlikely) exception of the recent Excel
macro virus, successful macro viruses in the wild have been confined to
Visual Basic for Word.  The report has no details regarding the level of
"backward compatibility" of VBA 5.0 with VBW, so I don't know yet whether
Concept and its ilk will continue to propagate on through Office 97 and
other VBA 5 compliant applications.  Even if they require patching, the new
VBA 5 viruses will have a much greater platform base, and therefore faster
creation and wider spread.

Office 97 shipments will begin to selected customers in December, with boxes
due on retail shelves in late January of 1997.

A possible cause of the Aeroperu crash is mentioned in the media this
morning.  Crash investigators are considering whether some of the plane's
sensor ports (``static ports'') might have been left with protective duct
tape covering them when the plane took off.  (*San Francisco Chronicle*,
CNN, etc.)  It is apparently normal maintenance procedure to cover the ports
(marking them with bright "Remove Before Flight" markers), to prevent them
from getting clogged.  [Indeed, it might seem surprising that forgetting to

&gt; Hmmm... $35,000.  Do you suppose a bet of oh, say $32,767 might have
&gt; worked?

I'm tired of dumb bugs like this tripping us up.

To my mind they are as silly as bugs which arise in programmes because of
fixed length strings, such as the famous one in sendmail where it didn't
check the size of a string it was strcpy'ing into a fixed length buffer.
(Internet worm bug - brought down 10% of the Internet.)

Fixed length integers have the same kind of problems.  If they are limited
to 2 bytes or 4 bytes at compilation time (either because the author
"knows" that there will never be the need for them to be any bigger, and
then the programme is used by someone else, or more usually, the author
didn't think about it at all), then all someone needs to do is enter
5000000000 at the prompt, and it will behave much more stupidly than if you
try a number in the range that the programme is expecting.

What I'd like is compiler support for integers, not a subset of them, in
much the same way that you get compiler support for strings, not just
strings of a fixed length.

Presumably it would malloc some space, and might have to do arithmetic in
more than one machine instruction, and yes, this would be much slower than
having a fixed 4 bytes sitting there.  But often I don't care if programmes
are slow, just as long as they are correct.

I've been watching the recent announcements about fault-induced
cryptanalysis with interest [e.g., <A HREF="/Risks/18.50.html">RISKS-18.50</A>,52,54,55,56].  Whereas the
attacks are extremely powerful tools, they aren't at all new to the crypto
community -- there has been widespread discussion for years about these,
they've been implemented by criminals and security system evaluators, and
they are reasonably well documented.

For example, NIST specifically discuss such attacks and the need to prevent
them.  FIPS PUB 74-1 (see <A HREF="http://csrc.nist.gov/fips">http://csrc.nist.gov/fips</A>), "Guidelines for
Implementing and Using the NBS Data Encryption Standard," was published way
back in 1981 and says in section 5.2.2 on Error Handling:

&gt;       Errors associated with the primary encryption device should be
&gt; detected and handled by the secondary device. Physical tampering detectors
&gt; (vibration or intrusion sensors) may be used to detect physical tampering
&gt; or unauthorized access to the encryption unit. Sensors which detect
&gt; abnormal changes in the electrical power or the temperature may be used to
&gt; monitor physical environment changes which could cause a security problem.
&gt; However, the major requirement for error detection or correction involves
&gt; the application itself. The type of error control utilized will depend on
&gt; the sensitivity of the data and the application. The method selected may
&gt; range from no error handling capability for some systems to full redundancy
&gt; of encryption devices in other systems. Errors may be ignored when detected
&gt; or the entire system may be immediately shutdown.  Errors which could
&gt; compromise the plaintext or key should never be ignored.

Anyone interested in issues relating to secure hardware design should also
study FIPS 140-1, "Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules."  It's
the best public document I know of for anyone designing tamper resistant
hardware and does a great job of covering the basics and also describes
measures to prevent these attacks, suggests using "two independent
cryptographic algorithm implementations whose output are continually
compared in order to ensure the correct functioning of the cryptographic
algorithm," etc.  In general, these attacks are fairly straightforward to
implement once the appropriate errors are available.

In addition to published sources, I've had many discussions with other
cryptographers error attacks and other hardware issues.  (Ross Anderson in
particular is extremely knowledgeable about hardware attacks and has done
much to raise awareness about them.  [See <A HREF="/Risks/18.52.html">RISKS-18.52</A>]) It's also important
to note that there are also quite a few other attacks which haven't been
published but which are widely known to the community.  (For example, I've
discussed widely my work on using timing attack math to analyze power
consumption, use of error analysis to reverse-engineer secret algorithms,
implementations of attacks using software pointer errors to damage secret
keys and encryption function tables, etc.)

With the timing attack I was alarmed by the amount of confusion and
misinterpretation that followed my initial release of the paper (though I
didn't send out any press releases or contact any reporters), even though
it been reviewed by many cryptographers prior to its release and was
available online.  I haven't seen the actual Bellcore paper yet and don't
know whether it was reviewed before they sent press releases to the media,
but in general I worry about the consequences of the public trying to
evaluate the importance, novelty, and quality of unreviewed work.

I would venture to guess that a simple replication of the encryption
circuitry, combined with a circuit that would suppress output if results are
different would make the box fairly resistant against DFA.

That can be improved further if several substantially different
implementations are used, so that identical environmental factors will not
cause identical failures.  The added benefit is better resistance against
current-draw and timing attacks.

: It seems reasonable that NSA knew of Differential Fault Analysis in the
: 1970's.

The idea to break the "black box" to learn something about it is certainly
not new.  In fact, this is one of the most powerful tools in neuroscience
and psychology (applying chemicals or current and watching the results,
or investigating injuries to different parts of brain).  However, there's
a long way from the idea to the practical application.

My favorite thing to do when handed such a URL is to strip off the filename
and try to access the directory.  The URL <A HREF="http://www.fbi.gov/mostwant/">http://www.fbi.gov/mostwant/</A>
brings up a conveniently hyper-linked listing of all the contents of that
directory.  This is usually not what the creator of those web pages
intended.  Sometimes there are additional documents or images that you
wouldn't otherwise be able to find, because they are not referenced from any
of the links in an advertised URL.

Using the terms "filename" and "directory" in the previous paragraph is
old-style web talk.  New-speak suggests the terms "trailing path component"
and "containing object", respectively.  This is to emphasize that "web
space" doesn't necessarily map into files and directories, but can be
ephemeral data.

Unfortunately, the use of abstract terminology combined with the default
settings on web servers tend to confuse the neophyte "web designer".  Their
lack of understanding leads them to create collections of pages in which
there are files that they *think* are hidden from view.

In the FBI example, everything in the directory listing was referenced from
a link on original URL.  Many times this is not the case.  Another example
comes from a company that hired an outside `expert' to create a survey for
people visiting their web site to fill out.  The survey was made accessible
at a URL ending in ".../survey/surveyform.htm".  Trying a URL with just the
ending directory component (".../survey/") brought up a surprise.  Not only
did it give a directory listing showing the files making up the survey, but
also included the a file holding the results posted to the survey form!
Very interesting reading, especially for their competitors!

Not all web servers will automatically convert directory accesses into fancy
indices this way.  Most have this as an option.  Usually an index is created
only when there is no manually created index file (commonly called
"index.html").  In fact, had the files "topten.htm" or "surveyform.htm" in
these examples been called "index.html", then not only would the URLs have
been shorter, but a directory listing would have been made unobtainable.

Hence, the solution is a combination of: avoid letting neophytes create your
web pages, fix your server, and know what you are doing before you release
it to the world.  Of course, there is far too much momentum on the WWW for
any of these to come into play these days.

As a parting thought, I wonder if any of the common web search engines strip
off trailing path components when indexing sites.  Normally a spider will
work by collecting the graph of pages available by walking the "advertised"
pages (which, in my own work, is called a "weblet").  By trying a path
stripping approach, they might end up with a slightly "richer" index.

Earlier [<A HREF="/Risks/18.18.html">RISKS-18.18</A>, 18.41], I reported on the accidental shootdown of a
Japanese air force F-15 plane by a sidewinder missile from another plane
during training and the subsequent handling of the case by the air force and
the prosecutor's office.

Now, the Japanese Air Force has taken an unusual step of adding a new
finding to its previous report citing that the 30 years pilot in question
changed its testimony to "he may have possibly turned off the safety
mechanism although he had no clear recollection of having done so" from the
earlier "he had not touched the safety mechanism".  (Translation mine.)

This additional finding to the accident investigation has been reported in
at least one Japanese national newspaper(ASAHI) and a major news channel,
NHK this morning. According to the NHK news the change of a finding issued
by an investigation committee has been very rare among defense community.

A little more detail.  After the case was sent to the local prosecutor's
office, the prosecutor's office decided that the pilot cleared the safety
mechanism. (I have absolutely no idea how the office reached this
conclusion.)  However, his case has not been sent to the court.  The
prosecutor's office decided not to pursue the case there.  (I don't know the
English phrase for this, but the office seems to think the merit of doing so
is considered less than the hassle/time/money of pursuing the case in the
court and is not worth the crime(? I am not sure if this is the right word
here.) committed.)

After the prosecutor's office concluded differently from its own
investigation committee, the Japanese air force questioned the pilot again,
and his testimony changed as noted above.  Originally, the report mentioned
possible unknown hardware (electric circuit and such) malfunction.

So the cause finally seems to me a human error of a sort.  Pilot himself,
and my main contention that whoever organized the training ought to have
missiles removed in the first place, and maybe ordered a placement of a
little gadget (even a paper cup will do as the previous discussion showed.)
over the safety switch to avoid accidental touching. I wish the higher-ups
are criticised more in the press, but not so far.

PS: I missed joining the discussion of publicly discussing the cause of
(air) accident in an open forum, which took place after my previous post re
prosecutor's office receiving the case of pilot.  Problem was that my
workstation was replaced and the printer hooked to it had to be
reconfigured. I usually print Risks digest on paper, and read it on the
commuter train. Only recently, the printer became back online and I printed
the backlog issues on paper and followed the thread. I can only observe the
following myself now.

- Public scrutiny is not necessarily a bad thing during a formal
investigation continues provided that the
information accessible to the chosen "experts" is also made available.
Beside the chosen experts, there are equally qualified people elsewhere.

- Of course, the information may not be released to the public due to
legal and other reasons. This makes it very difficult to expect
"intelligent" discussion from the public, I agree.

- I noticed that the military wanted to make sure the career of the
pilot is not unnecessarily destroyed. His name was only revealed
after there was news that his case was now handled by the local
prosecutor's office.

Today's Asahi newspaper, and NHK news in the morning
didn't mention the name. Maybe because the prosecutor's office
decided not to pursue the case in court?

- When I think about this, the public debate can ruin the career of
possibly innocent people. If the shoot down of the F15 had been
really due to flakey hardware, the pilot would have been really
in an uncomfortable position to convince others that it was the fault
of hardware produced by contractors with billion-dollar budgets.

during Olympics games comes to my mind.

So we must consider about this human element when we discuss these
things in an open forum, too. Someone pointed this out to me and
this point is well taken.

At the same time, not that I want to take side in this discussion, but
please bear in mind that all the pieces I reported have already been
reported in Japanse mass media such as national newspapers (each has
circulation of a few million, I think) and national TV. (PGN kindly noted
this.) So, by the time you read about the topic, at least a few million
Japanese readers must have seen it already.

Anyway, just wanted to let you know what is going on in Japan.

I read Mark Brader's contribution (18.55) and was a bit lost.  I can well
understand that badly designed compilers can cause problems, but what
puzzles me is that this discussion misses the fundamental background with
2's-complement representations: with 16 bits, -32768 is the smallest value
that can be represented, and 32767 is the largest value that can be
represented.  What more is there to say?

The Melbourne cup is Australia's premier horse race (handicap over 3200
metres with over $AUS 2 million prize money), that even has its own public
holiday in metropolitan Melbourne. The whole nation stops to listen or watch
the race and lots of once a year punters have a dabble on the cup. The TAB
(used to stand for Totaliser Agency Board when government owned and run, but
now a public company) is the ONLY (legal) provider of off-course racing
betting in Victoria.

However, when the punters turned up at their local TAB (or pub TAB located
in hotels) to place their bets on yesterday's race (5 November 1996) there
were queues that stretched out the door for hundreds of meters. The 15 year
old computer system had failed again on Melbourne Cup day and most small
agencies were off-line from about 10:45 am (AESST) to just before or after
the running of the cup at 3:20pm (AESST), whilst the larger agencies were
off and on with reduced numbers of active windows throughout this period.

Irate punters and TAB agency owners were, of course, furious and a lot of
money that would have been wagered was lost as punters gave up waiting to
try to get a bet placed. The TAB chief executive, Ross Wilson (already
controversial due to his seemingly excessive salary package) was quoted as
saying that the system breakdown "could have been worse"; it is hard to
imagine how. The total loss of money wagered has not yet been calculated,
but it will be huge. Ross Wilson also stated that "of course" there will be
a full investigation of the problems and these will be rectified so that it
doesn't happen again.

Breakdowns of the TAB system on Melbourne Cup day have occurred before with
the last major shutdown 4 years ago.  Yesterday's problem was described as
being the result of software modifications made to the TAB software 10
months prior to the Cup, and the excessive demand due to the huge increase
in the number of bets activated a software bug in these modifications that
lead to a shutdown of the system.

It is difficult to understand how the TAB system could not be designed and
tested to accommodate the peak betting activity as the Melbourne Cup ALWAYS
results in this level of high activity, and is therefore predictable and,
you would imagine, able to be simulated. Agency owners, who are still trying
to recover from the loss of income due to a protracted dispute with Sky
Channel who supply direct TV coverage of horse racing, are now investigating
legal action against the TAB.

An article in the *Wall Street Journal* 4 Nov 1996 describes a major problem
for Fidelity Brokerage Services (a discount stock brokerage) in London.
Very few details are given beyond "late bookings of dividends and other
problems", but it's serious enough that more than 50 people are working
14-hour days to sort through and correct three months of records *manually*.
British authorities have forced FBS to stop taking new customers until the
problems are solved.

It appears to be a familiar story to RISKS readers:  A new system was
rushed into operation in April without adequate testing.  FBS seems to be
in denial, claiming that the system wasn't rushed, but that they simply
"ran into some unanticipated glitches."

About five years ago we were the first on our block to have an Ethernet
segment implemented by a pair of 20 mW infra-red lasers.  We had been
promised that it was pretty reliable; as long as we could see the other
building, so could the laser.

And so it turned out; even though we spanned a canal in the foggiest town in
France, we managed 98% uptime during the first few months (in the winter).
Only on the foggiest days did we lose the connection, until about 10 each
morning and from 4 each evening, for about 5 days total.

Came the spring, and we started to get breaks in the connection at what
seemed to be random times.  Eventually we worked out that it was happening
half an hour after sunrise and half an hour after sunset.  We thought it
might be the sun in line with the laser, but the layout wasn't right for
that.  We changed every component in the network.  Until...

One day, I noticed a spider's web connecting the laser box to the wall.
Something must have flipped to On in my brain's background processing
section, because about three days later (I run background processing on a
very low priority), it dawned on me.  I went up to the roof at the
appropriate time and watched the laser carefully.  Sure enough... a spider
appeared, walked across the web, climbed into the transmission lens, and sat
there (upside down), apparently eating its dinner, while a voice in my ear
called "the link's down again !".

We got a cloth, a box of Q-tips, and an aerosol of insecticide, put them
in a box marked "Network Hardware Maintenance Kit", and set up a weekly
rota for cleaning the laser, and had no more problems.  I dined out on
the story for several months afterwards.

Subject: Announcement - Warning to Crypto and Banking Communities

A serious weakness of DES
Draft - 2nd November 1996

Abstract

Eli Biham and Adi Shamir [<A HREF="/Risks/18.56.html">RISKS-18.56</A>] recently pointed out that if an
attacker can induce unidirectional faults in key memory of cryptographic
devices, then keys could be extracted quickly. Although their attack is very
elegant, it is not practical against many fielded systems. For example,
inducing a single-bit change in a DES key will cause a proper implementation
to return a key parity error.

However, when combined with Peter Gutman's recent work on memory remanence,
there are two very practical attacks. One of them allows smartcard
electronic wallet keys to be extracted with much less expensive equipment
than that currently used by pay-TV pirates; the other yields an effective
attack against fielded banking security modules. These attacks show that a
feature of DES that had long been thought innocuous is actually a serious
design error.

Introduction

In a research announcement of 30th October, Biham and Shamir [<A HREF="/Risks/18.54.html">RISKS-18.54</A>]
point out that if a cryptographic hardware module employs EEPROM for key
memory only, an opponent who can turn EEPROM values from `1' to `0' with a
small controlled probability (e.g., by applying UV light) might cause a test
input to be encrypted with a series of keys, each of Hamming distance one
from the next in the series, and ending with the all zero key [1].

There are a number of reasons why their attack is not likely to work against
real systems. For example, the typical smartcard system has several
kilobytes of program code in EEPROM as well as typically two to five DES
keys. An undirected stress applied to such a card is more likely to cause a
program crash or an uninformative error than to yield a ciphertext encrypted
under a key at Hamming distance one from a genuine key. Even if we only had
to cause a hundred cards to fail to get a single input for the Biham-Shamir
attack, if we needed on average 28 inputs to recover a DES key, then the
number of cards required could be O(100^28).

The situation is made still worse by the fact that DES keys have odd parity,
and a proper implementation will reject a key if any of its bytes has even
parity. So one would be reduced to looking for keys at a Hamming distance of
two rather than one. It is this objection that inspired the following work.

A Modified Attack

My idea is to turn the DES key parity problem on its head and enable parity
to help rather than hinder the attack. Let us first consider an opponent who
can perform directed attacks on the chip. Reading the contents of an EEPROM
cell directly is difficult, and people who do it for a living use focused
ion beam workstations to modify the chip [2]. However, it is trivial to set
an EEPROM cell to the value of your choice if you do not have to read it
first; you only need two microprobes. A 10mS 18V pulse from the cell's
source to its control gate will do the trick [3].

My modified attack therefore proceeds as follows. Set the first bit of the
EEPROM containing the target DES key to 1 (or 0, the choice doesn't matter)
and operate the device. If it still works, the keybit was a 1. If you get a
`key parity error' message, then the bit was zero. Move on to the next bit;
set it to 1 and see if this changes the device's response (from encryption
to error or vice versa).

This is a practical attack even on chips whose software we do not know in
detail, as many smartcard software writers seem to have adopted a convention
that the keys are located at the bottom end of the EEPROM memory. It will
also work with protocols that use redundancy which we do not understand: we
just change each key bit back to its original value.

The use of predictable memory addresses for keys is not restricted to
smartcards; many banking security modules also keep keys at low memory. I
will now describe a related attack that extracts master keys from these
modules.

An Attack on Fielded Systems

In a brilliant Usenix paper [4], Peter Gutman described the mechanisms that
cause both static and dynamic RAM to `remember' values that they have stored
for a long period of time. A prudent security engineer will ask what the
effect of this is in the real world.

I looked at an instance of a security module used in banking. This security
module has 12 pairs of DES master keys stored in low memory.  The device is
tamper resistant in that power to the key memory is cut when the box is
opened for servicing (this is needed every few years to change the battery).
Keys are loaded into the device afterwards in multiple components by trusted
bank staff.

In this device, which dated from the late 1980's, the key values were
substantially intact on power-up. The number of bits in error was of the
order of 5-10%. I cannot give more accurate figures as I was not permitted
to copy down either the correct master key values, nor the almost-correct
values that had been `burned in' to the static RAM chips. I am also not
permitted to name the bank at which these modules are installed, and it may
not be prudent to name their manufacturer.

Nonetheless the crypto community should consider the consequences.

If each DES key is wrong by five bits, then the effort involved in searching
for the 10 wrong bits in a double DES key might be thought to be
112-choose-10 operations. Each operation would involve (a) doing a 2-key
3DES decryption of a 64 bit PIN key whose enciphered value is widely known
to the bank's programmers (b) in the 2^{-8} of cases where this result has
odd parity, enciphering an account number with this as a DES key to see if
the (decimalised) result is the corresponding PIN. The effort is 4 times
112-choose-10 DES operations - about 2^50. But it would probably be cheaper
to do a hardware keysearch on the PIN key directly than to try to implement
this more complex 2^50 search in either hardware or software.

However, the bytewise nature of the DES key redundancy reduces the effort by
orders of magnitude. If no key byte has a double error, then the effort is
seven tries for each even parity byte observed, or 7^10 - about 2^28, which
is easy. If there is one key byte with a double error, the effort is 2^38,
giving a search of 2^40 DES operations - which is still feasible for an
individual.

Conclusions

I have shown that the key parity in DES enables us to slash the cost of real
attacks on both old systems (banking security modules) and new ones
(electronic wallet smartcards).

I had already mentioned in [5] that a common fault in the driver software
for banking security modules was that `key parity error' messages were often
ignored rather than copied to the bank's security manager to give warning of
an attempted attack. This note shows that key parity is even more serious
than that.

The nature of DES key redundancy now appears to be a design error; it would
have been much better to calculate the redundancy on the whole key. The 16
bit MAC used in the Clipper and Capstone chips is preferable (although as
shown in [6], 16 bits may not be enough to prevent some protocol attacks).

The lesson for bankers is that existing security modules (and other
cryptographic devices) should be destroyed carefully at the end of their
working life.

The lesson for security engineers is that we should add key redundancy, and
the question of whether we can rely on a device's eventual destruction, to
the growing list of system parameters that must be (a) explicitly considered
during design and (b) examined carefully when the product is being
evaluated.

There has been much discussion lately, of the DFA attack on various
cryptosystems. Defence strategies appear to be based on replication, either
in space (dual-redundant crypto units, which check each other), or in time
(do the crypto twice, and compare the results). Both techniques suffer from
the same drawback: cost.

It occurs to me that a defence could be based on the use of RAM, rather than
ROM or hardwired logic, to embody the crypto algorithm. In practical terms,
this would mean a hardware embodiment using (say) a RAM-based FPGA, or a
software system which would copy the code to RAM before execution.  The
point here is that there would be typically far more RAM bits used to
specify the algorithm than are used to hold data-in-process. The odds are
that an induced error will corrupt the operating code, rather than a data
bit. The result will be either total garbage output, or the result of a
"different" algorithm (the original, plus errors).  Does this idea have any
merit?

Re: Slade in <A HREF="/Risks/18.57.html">RISKS-18.57</A> and VIRUS-L 9#208

Visual Basic is not the sole reason for these viruses to spread.
A virus needs three preconditions to spread:
- a platform that will execute its instructions,
- a vehicle in which it will be passed between users,
- a mechanism by which it will be executed unnoticed by the user.

For the Word macro viruses, the platform is the Word macro language. VBA 5
will indeed make an upwards-compatible platform more widely available.
However, Visual Basic is only sort of a syntactical framework: most standard
functions and statements are only valid for a particular application. (I do
not know VBA 5.0 yet, but I have coded a few macros both for Word 6.0 and
Excel 5.0 and found that the major part of the language were
application-specific, in both cases.) Hence, most VBA programs probably will
only work with a particular application. So I think, we will not see a much
more widely available platform for viruses to spread on, but rather a couple
of similar, yet mutually almost incompatible platforms.

A platform in itself is no particular thread, virus-wise. Platforms are
useful (after all, they are the sole purpose computers are built for).  We
should not worry about the proliferation of platforms, but rather on the
other two preconditions for viruses to spread.

The vehicle for the Word macro viruses is Word templates disguised as
documents. It was Microsofts greatest sin to allow Word templates (which
contain the macros) to come disguised as documents. Word documents are
widely, and frequently, exchanged amongst users. Now, if any document
(according to the user's perception - even if it is, technically speaking,
some other beast) can contain macros, this will constitute an ideal vector
for macro viruses.

This is one of the two main reasons for Word macros to spread so rapidly. If
the macros would be confined to separate files (as with most other
applications), users would most probably leave the macros behind when giving
away documents.

Word has two clandestine-execution mechanisms: macros with particular names
(such as AutoOpen) are executed without explicit user action (e.g. when a
document is opened) -- before the user even sees the document to be opened;
macros with other particular names are bound to explicit user actions, such
as hitting a button, or selecting a menu item. (If you think this is only
one mechanism, you are probably right. No discussion on this triviality,
please.)

In particular, the AutoOpen macro mechanism is the other main reason for
Word macros to spread so rapidly: with this mechanism in place, a user needs
only to *view* a Word document (e.g. an attachment of an e-mail message, of
a news item, or of a WWW page) to contract a virus!

Conclusion: VBA 5.0 is not a particular threat, as long as the applications
using it do not repeat Word's mistakes.  Most important is to keep macros
apart from application data (such as documents or spread-sheets); second
most important is to avoid executing macros without the user's consent.

The altavista search engine at least finds files that do not have URLs
pointing to them, as long as they are in directories that it visits for
other reasons. I discovered this when a search of a well-known CS repository
turned up files containing all sorts of administrative information, not
intended for public consumption.

It seems sensible to keep only things you want seen in directories that web
servers can access. Having permissions set properly will prevent web servers
seeing other files, but fouling up permissions is an easy error.

I think there is a Risk in attempting to add the more robust features at the
more shaky end of the language spectrum.  Ada syntax (but not necessarily
every implementation) supports unlimited programmer-specified ranges.  That
would seem a better starting place for programmer-unspecified ranges.

Anyone for zero-terminated integers ? :-)

Perhaps you should check out Poplog Pop11. It is used mostly at research
institutes, but also at some major process control sites where its
garbage collection and wide range of number formats is highly valued.

Among its number formats are: fixed int, small float, double float, ratio
(i.e. 10/3 is *not* approximated), imaginary (sqrt(-1) returns a sensible
answer), and big ints (integers as big as the size of your VM -- one of the
standard pop11 benchmarks is to calculate factorial(1000) :-) Conversion
between number formats is automatic in all the arithmetic functions.

The Symbolics Lisp machine defaulted to 'infinite' (indefinite)
precision integers.  In fact, this property was inherited by other
languages which ran on this machine, e.g., Fortran-77.  'Integers'
in Symbolics Fortran would happily take on values like

378475974398573485743579875987495734987539759837594359749857398753475

Quoting from "User's Guide to FORTRAN 77 Tool Kit", August 1986:

"The Tool Kit supports arbitrary-precision integers, called _bignums_;
as a result, all integers are immune from overflow..."

"The only operation for which arbitrary-precision integers are _not_ valid
is _unformatted_ input/output.  In this case, integers must be between -2^31
and 2^31-1."

"The Tool Kit detects uninitialized data (other than character data), so
that an error condition results if a variable is used before it is assigned
a value."

"The Symbolics Lisp Machine provides strong hardware data-type checking
among logical, integer, and real data.  Thus, the hardware prevents a
program error due to equivalencing of the data, for example, in the case
where the exponent and mantissa of a real number might be interpreted as an
integer."

(I might point out that many of the standard Internet attacks which depend
upon poor type or array bounds checking are worthless against such machines;
I understand that they remained up and happily running, after many of their
Unix brethren had been hopelessly compromised by Internet worms and other
attacks.)

These significant advances in the quality of Fortran software was _not_
appreciated by Fortran programmers, and the porting of existing Fortran
programs -- which use such equivalencing very heavily -- became a nightmare.

However, the market was not kind to Symbolics, proving that software quality
is not a particularly important feature in a computer system, as judged by
paying customers.

Mark Brader's discussion of -32768 is correct as far as it goes, but it
omits some of the more entertaining aspects of C expression evaluation.
Here's a table that may help RISKS readers appreciate some of the finer
points.

This table uses the usual C notation: an `0x' prefix means hexadecimal; an
`L' suffix means the type is `long'; `U' means `unsigned'.  2's complement
arithmetic is assumed, so none of the expressions overflow.  [SEE NOTE
BELOW.]  `*' marks disagreements with the usual mathematical meanings of
expressions.

C expression         value of C expression, assuming:
16-bit `int'           32-bit `int'

32768              32768L                 32768
0x8000              32768U                 32768

-32767 - 1         -32768                 -32768
-32768             -32768L                -32768
-0x8000              32768U *              -32768

-0x8000 == -32768          0  *                   1

0U &lt; -32767 - 1          1  *                   1  *
0U &lt; -32768              0                      1  *
0  &lt; -0x8000             1  *                   0

Is everything clear now?

[NOTE added, at Mark Brader's suggestion: Paul's assumption is one that
is assumed for this posting only; it is not guaranteed by the language.
In particular, C can be legally implemented on 1's complement hardware,
where the value -32,768 is not permissible in a 16-bit int (or short)
at all.  MB via PGN]

What you are missing is that "-32768" in C is not a constant but an
expression.  The type of a C expression depends on the type of the operands
and the operator.  In this case the operand is "32768", the operator is "-".
The type of 32768 is "long" if the type "int" is only 16 bits, and so the
type of "-32768" is "long" in that case.  But in the context of the
definition of INT_MAX the type should be "int".  On the other hand, when we
write "-32767 - 1" the type is "int" because all constituent parts are of
that type.

[This item is included to close the discussion off.  Bear Giles had it
exactly right in his followup in <A HREF="/Risks/18.49.html">RISKS-18.49</A>, and it might have been
better for me to have pointed that out privately to Kurt Fredriksson.
But the error is a common one, so perhaps it was worth flogging it once
more.  Strong typing is the answer to a lot of questions, but it also
helps to understand the questions.  PGN]

"Intel is working to make the network's help desk more than just an
answering service. With LANDesk Manager's remote access facility,
network managers can take over a node and perform most of the tasks
that typically would require a visit to the problem workstation.

"Under Novell's NMS, a network manager clicks on the node's network
map object and launches LANDesk Manager's remote access tool. The
manager can take over the user's PC and directly control the user's PC
keyboard and mouse. The network manager can also access utilities
and applications remotely, permitting checks of CONFIG.SYS,
AUTOEXEC.BAT and WIN.INI files or anything else on the machine.
This eliminates the laborious process of asking an end user to describe
cryptic error messages and codes."

war with a disgruntled (ex-)subscriber. A few days ago, an anonymous

There are a lot of rumors about the latest AeroPeru news.  CNN's reports on
the latest AeroPeru findings have been inaccurate and incomplete. PGN may
have helped to spread another one in <A HREF="/Risks/18.57.html">RISKS-18.57</A>.

The facts are, from a source at the NTSB as well as information about the
B757 static system (obtainable from my Compendium, see below):

a) *Masking tape*, not duct tape or `Remove Before Flight' Covers,
was covering the *left-side static ports* on the aircraft [NTSB];
(there's no way to attach covers: the ports are flush with the
fuselage [B757 P/S system diagram]);

b) Static ports to all three independent pitot-static systems are on both
the left side and the right side of the fuselage, including those for the
electro-mechanical backup: both static ports and pitot in each system are
interconnected by an open tube [B757 pitot-static system diagram];

c) the right-side static ports have not been recovered; it is therefore
not known whether masking tape was also covering these [NTSB];

d) blockage of all the left static ports would cause some degradation
of *all* the air data in both EFIS-displayed P/S systems plus the backup;
blockage of the right-side static ports as well would cause worse
degradation [general aero and system knowledge]; this is thus a *common
failure mode* of all three independent P/S systems: both primaries
and backup.

e) the Peruvian Transport Ministry said that this obstruction of the
sensors "could explain the erroneous and confusing altitude and
speed information received by the pilots after takeoff" [NTSB source,
quoting an official statement]. This contrasts with the Minister's
reported statement on October 2 which seemed to the press to ascribe
computer problems as the cause.

f) Putting masking tape on the ports when cleaning the aircraft is
a normal maintenance procedure [NTSB]; however, leaving it on is
certainly not! I don't know whether after such a procedure the
aircraft has explicitly to be `signed off' after inspection by a
qualified inspector, who would then make a `returned to service'
entry in the maintenance logs. This is so for most procedures which
render an aircraft temporarily unairworthy (as putting tape on the
static ports does). This is a question still to be answered here,
and I'm sure there are many readers who could do so;

g) A further question, posed by Jim Wolper, is why the air crew
did not notice the tape on static ports on the pre-flight inspection.
It was dark, but nonetheless on most airplanes visually checking the
static ports is an explicit item on the pre-flight inspection check list.
The B757 body is relatively high off the ground, but nevertheless I
should have thought that tape on the ports would be clearly visible.

h) The CVR and DFDR have been recovered, examined in the NTSB Laboratories,
and the data returned to Peruvian colleagues [NTSB];

In <A HREF="/Risks/18.51.html">RISKS-18.51</A>, I expressed extreme scepticism that computer failure could
be the sole cause of any B757 accident (except for one possibility which has
never happened to any aircraft). It should now be clear that the
recently-discovered failure mode under discussion is (a) not
computer-related, and (b) deemed sufficient by itself to cause the known
effects and history of the flight. This does not of course rule out other
simultaneous failure modes that are computer-related. We still await the CVR
and DFDR data.

More information about the B757 systems and about how a static-system
blockage would affect the air data, as well as a history of the rather
misleading statements and press reports about the Aeroperu accident, may be
found (from Friday 8 November, 1996, and so dated) under the section on the
AeroPeru accident in `Computer-Related Incidents and Accidents to Commercial
Airplanes', under <A HREF="http://www.techfak.uni-bielefeld.de/~ladkin/">http://www.techfak.uni-bielefeld.de/~ladkin/</A> Until 8
November, information on the B757 pitot-static system may be found under the

</ADDRESS>
<I>Thu, 31 Oct 1996 22:32:22 +-100</I><PRE>

On my last trip to Vienna, I placed my baggage in a very advanced coinlocker
in an urban train station. The coinlocker uses a magnetic card instead of a
conventional key. The user is guided by an LCD Screen on an operating panel
serving six compartments (equipped with a numeric keypad, which is not used
for normal operation).  I received my card and since such cards are quite
common in car parking facilities, left with confidence. On my way back, with
only twenty minutes left for the train to the airport, following the
instructions on the screen, I fed the card correctly positioned into the
slot. Nothing happened and the screen continued to show the instruction, to
feed the card into the slot to release the lock. When I asked at the ticket
counter for help, the attendant was in no way astonished and explained that
this happened because of children playing around with the keypad. A service
technician was called and used the keypad to release the compartment lock,
and then started a debugging session collecting several cards from the
machine.  Complaining that I needed my luggage, I was told that he already
had made an `exception' by handing me my suitcase without checking my
identity and that it was my problem losing my card. Considering the need to
reach my plane and the fact that I couldn't prove that I correctly inserted
my card, I took my baggage and left.

The risks I see are these: If such a mechanism fails, it should in any case
return the keycard it didn't accept. Since the keycard is not further
protected by a PIN, it makes no sense to keep it to prevent abuse. Since the
card is the only receipt, it is in the best interest of both, the user and
the owner of the coinlocker, that it is always available.  Having a keypad,
which is obviously required only for servicing purposes open for the public
is a completely unnecessary risk; sooner or later someone will be successful
in opening the locker using the keypad.  It is absolutely irresponsible, to
continue to operate a system in which malfunction is so common (during the
short time, I had to wait for the technician to open the locker, two people
passing by told me, that they had experienced the same problems before).

I can only recommend avoiding a coinlocker with such a setup, under any
circumstances.

A different sort of fault, perhaps, but Tony Sale's lecture here a few weeks
ago revealed that Bletchley Park's initial breaking of the Lorenz
teleprinter (a.k.a. "Fish") ciphers in the early years of WW2, which led
subsequently to the building of the Colossus computers, was entirely due to
*one* fault on the part of one German teleprinter operator. They found that
he had resent one lengthy message, but by re-keying it (somewhat
inaccurately) rather than using the punched teleprinter tape. From this one
pair of messages they managed to discover the full detailed logical
operation of the cipher machine unseen, and create a means of breaking the
messages that were being sent using it to and from the German High Command.
As Tony said, for the rest of the war, the cryptanalysts prayed that no
over-eager Allied soldier captured a Fish machine!

PS. Years ago, after a lecture here by Donald Davies on DES, and emboldened
merely by my reading of David Kahn and the like, I brought a
typically-academic discussion of its security to a screeching halt by
suggesting that perhaps sometime in the future I would be the proud
possessor of a DES-based cipher machine -- which (like the Enigma cipher
machine that I already own) was historically famous for the importance of
the messages that machines like it had failed to protect.  :-)

I must apologize to Bruce for including a version of his thoughtful item in
<A HREF="/Risks/18.59.html">RISKS-18.59</A> that he sent to the RISKS address that I mistakenly thought was
his expected final version, but that was actually a draft in progress, sent
for my information.  As a consequence, I will be happy to run his final
version whenever it is ready, and pardon your inconvenience for having to
read two perhaps quite similar versions.  Bruce has also asked me to ask you
all to desist from redistributing copies around the net until the final
version is ready.

Do you want to go back in time before the TWA 800 came down?  It's easy.
I've gotten in the habit of using Alta Vista to search the RISKS database
maintained in England on the web.  Today, I was trying to dig up the old
issue containing the story about the missile that took out a garage in
British Columbia. So I sent this string:

+risks +neumann +vancouver +missile

The plus signs force Alta Vista to return documents that contain that word.
I've found that the word Risks and the name of our intrepid moderator is a
great way to cut out the rest of the noise. This may be inefficient, but it
is easier than remembering where a specific RISKS database is kept.

But the article didn't show up on the list. Surprisingly, there were a few
other references. After some experimentation, I've discovered that the Alta
Vista web crawler hasn't visited the UK website archive for some time. So
the issue (18.40) wasn't included in its database.

The RISKS is that there is no easy way to tell how up-to-date
Alta Vista may be. It may have indexed one region of the Net
last night and another three months ago. I predict that this is
another feature for web crawlers to work upon.

[I noted in an earlier issue (<A HREF="/Risks/18.13.html">RISKS-18.13</A>) that Alta Vista may still think
crvax.sri.com is the RISKS archive site rather than the up-to-date archive
at ftp.sri.com.  I hope someone can finally fix that problem.  The cutover
took place almost two years ago, but apparently the old crvax archives are
STILL in place and they include only issues up to <A HREF="/Risks/16.64.html">RISKS-16.64</A>.  PGN]

Last week, the new California Earthquake Insurance agency announced that
they would shortly be releasing a billion dollars worth of Earthquake bonds,
which pay diminished returns if there is a major California earthquake.
This step was necessary because most insurers are pulling out of California
earthquake insurance, due to the inadequacy of reserves.  We wonder about
the RISK of a state-run insurance agency locating all its computers and
staff (for payouts and bond administration) in the very state the flattening
of which would trigger these bonds and payouts.

Another twist on the well known "Cleaner buffs computer room floor and takes
down entire site" stories:

We recently had some engineers from AT&amp;T in our computer room for three
days, working on a PABX which also lives in there. During this period, two
of our main Netware servers have been extremely unreliable, crashing several
times a day. The AT&amp;T engineers were working near these servers, and we
initially thought that they might have been causing the crashes by
disturbing some cables.

After a few of these unexplained crashes, one of our MIS group noticed that
every time he went in to the server room to reboot the dead servers, one of
the AT&amp;T engineers was using his mobile phone. So, they were asked to turn
their phones off while working in the server room, and the problem has not
reoccurred.

To test the theory a bit further, the MIS group then took an otherwise
unused server, and experimented with using a mobile phone near it. With the
working phone being used less than a foot away from the machine, they
provoked a crash which corrupted the system disk (and its mirror volume)
beyond repair.

Very similar to his earlier "Syslaw" (cf. BKSYSLAW.RVW), this is a general
guide to various legal aspects of life online.  The major changes are the
broadening of the scope from BBS level systems to include online services
and the Internet, and very handy (and interesting) sidebars, which give a
thumbnail sketch version of the topic under discussion.  These usually
include a reference to some specific case.

Chapters address the issues of censorship, contracts, commerce, and
copyright.  Chapter four, which deals with the responsibility of the system
operator in light of online dangers, does touch on the topic of malicious
software.  I was disappointed that this is limited to a not terribly
accurate defining of terms, and almost no discussion of the admittedly
confused legal situation.  Further chapters cover privacy, crime, search and
seizure, and a rather disappointing chapter on obscenity.  Appendices
include some very useful sample contracts, and various US laws.

Given recent developments which have strongly indicated the international
nature of the net and international legal ramifications, it is discouraging to
see that Rose still presents only a limited and US-centric view.  However, the
general principles he describes are held in common law, and this book should at
least provide guidance for the broader online world.

The Computer Science and Telecommunications Board (CSTB) of the National
Research Council (NRC) is pleased to announce the availability of its
cryptography policy study "Cryptography's Role in Securing the Information
Society".  This report was originally released in pre-publication form on
May 30, 1996.

The final printed version of this report can be obtained from the National
Academy Press, 1-800-624-6242 or Web site <A HREF.http://www.nap.edu/bookstore">http://www.nap.edu/bookstore</A>..  The
pre-publication version and the final printed copy differ in that the
printed copy contains an index and many source documents relevant to the
crypto policy debate; of course, editorial corrections have been made as
well.

An unofficial ASCII version of the prepublication report can be found at
<A HREF="http://pwp.usa.pipeline.com/~jya/nrcindex.htm">http://pwp.usa.pipeline.com/~jya/nrcindex.htm</A>; the official NRC version
should become available online in ASCII form in December.

In addition, CSTB has been conducting briefings on this report at various
sites around the country; if you would like to arrange a briefing in your
area, please let us know (<A HREF="mailto:cstb@nas.edu">cstb@nas.edu</A>, 202-334-2605).

[Message from Herb Lin]

[I note that when we held a briefing on the West Coast, Herb was surprised
to find that a scanned copy of the original report had already appeared
on-line, shortly after the draft report had been released.  The final
version is over 700 pages with all the appendices.  But I suspect that an
unofficial on-line version of the official report may not be far behind --
despite its copyright.  Incidentally, the full report is an extraordinary
source of background material.  PGN]

Just when you thought everything there was to be said about this issue had
already been said, our esteemed moderator commented that "Strong typing is the
answer to a lot of questions, but it also helps to understand the questions".

Unfortunately, strong typing is *not* the answer to this particular question!

Niklaus Wirth probably deserves to be considered the inventor of strong typing
with his development of Pascal.  (The idea was probably around earlier, but
no one talked about it much until Pascal's advantages and faults were under
discussion.)  Pascal had no unsigned type, so the question at hand didn't
arise.

Wirth next designed the Modula and Modula-2 languages.  I don't know much
about Modula, but Modula-2 has both INTEGER (C int) and CARDINAL (C unsigned)
types.  Modula-2 is strongly typed, and has no implicit conversions.  It
isn't possible to mix INTEGER's and CARDINAL's in an expression.  (You can,
of course, include explicit type conversions.)  This avoids all the complexi-
ties and ambiguities that occur in C when signed and unsigned types "meet
across an operator".  So, indeed, our moderator is correct:  Strong typing
helps.

However, the problem of constants remains.  Modula-2 does not have an explicit
"unsigned constant" marker; integral constants are just strings of digits.
(By the way, Modula-2, like C, considers -1234 to be the unary minus operator
applied to the constant 1234.)  What type should be assigned to integral
constants?  Choosing either INTEGER or CARDINAL causes problems since then
it becomes impossible to, say, compare a CARDINAL or INTEGER to a constant
value without an explicit conversion.  The *intent* all along has been that
integer constants should take on "the right" type; but getting that defined
right turned out to be unexpectedly difficult.  (-1234 ought to be INTEGER,
never a CARDINAL - but it's not a constant, it's an expression.  If we say
that the result of negation is always an INTEGER, then --1234 and 1234 have
different types - rather annoying.  And how about -0?  Do we have to assume
constant folding as part of the language definition?  And so on, and so on.)

Modula-2 was officially defined by Wirth's book, "Programming in Modula-2",
which went through four editions.  Each edition contained changes to the
language definition.  I believe that the details of the treatment of constants
changed with each edition.  There is currently an ISO draft standard for
Modula-2; it uses an entirely different approach for defining the semantics of
integral constants, in yet another attempt to get at the "obvious" meaning.
(The standard, as I understand it, assigns an abstract "NUMBER" type to
constants.  Unlike actual types, this abstract type *can* be automatically
coerced - to INTEGER or CARDINAL, as the case may be.  The details of this
abstract type then need to be worked out....)

So strong typing didn't help quite enough.

It's instructive to consider yet another language, Modula-3.  Modula-3 was
developed at DEC SRC by a number of people, with consultation and review
from Wirth.  Like Modula-2, Modula-3 has types called INTEGER and CARDINAL.
Like Modula-2, Modula-2 is strongly typed.  However, Modula-3 chose to avoid
the entire issue of the typing of integral constants, and all other
questions about how signed and unsigned values interact, by defining
CARDINAL differently: In Modula-3, CARDINAL is simply the non-negative
members of the INTEGER type.

Now, one reason Modula-3 was able to do this is that it pretty much assumes
32-bit integers.  With 16-bit integers, there was often good reason to want
to use unsigned values simply to expand the range of counters and such.
With 32-bit integers, that's hardly ever worth the effort.

By the way, for those who might object that there are legitimate uses for
true unsigned arithmetic: Modula-3 actually provides that, in the form of a
required interface that defines a WORD type and various operations on it.
WORD is in fact a synonym for integer, but the operations treat WORDS as
unsigned values.

Sometimes the right solution is not to trim the leaves but to pull the weed
out by its roots.  To those of us who programmed on 16-bit machines -
including, it seems, Niklaus Wirth - it takes a bit of effort to realize
that the tricks we had to use to get enough range out of our integers simply
are no longer needed, and there's no longer a need to distort our languages
to try to support them.  But that's clearly the way to sanity.

Actually every Ada compiler supports arbitrary precision arithmetic--at
compile time.  Static integer constants are required to be evaluated without
overflow, and the easiest way to guarantee this is to evaluate them using an
arbitrary precision arithmetic package.

Most compiler vendors use a package written over a decade ago by Gerry
Fisher, and almost all of them make it available to users as well.  Of
course this requirement has its disadvantages, a early "bug" in many Ada
compilers was that type declarations like:

type My_Int is range 0..2**Integer'Last - 1;

Took a VERY long time to be rejected.  (Dave Emery discovered this problem
by accident.  He intended to write 2**Integer'Length...)

There are numerous implementations of indefinite-precision arithmetic in C
(e.g., the Gnu "mp" package); several of these have been encapsulated into
strong C++ classes.  Implementations include both a (very large) fixed-sized
array and a malloc'd array.

Unfortunately, there are several problems with these packages:

- speed (compared to "regular" integers),

- file I/O is _much_ more difficult when you don't know how long
your integers can be, and

- ITAR restrictions on export of munitions.

The last point isn't a mistype -- I'm not an unbiased observer,
but every implementation I've seen has been part of a cryptographic
package... and once you have a good indefinite-precision arithmetic
package it's trivial to implement many cryptographic protocols.

&gt; To my mind they are as silly as bugs which arise in programmes because of
&gt; fixed length strings, such as the famous one in sendmail where it didn't
&gt; check the size of a string it was strcpy'ing into a fixed length buffer.

Point of information: the fixed length buffer was in "fingerd", not
sendmail.  sendmail had a much more obvious problem (a "DEBUG"
function that was not removed in production.) It was noted that the
problem (using the unsafe "gets" function) was tiresome even then...

We have ways of assuring that software won't fail?  Please enlighten me. We
have ways of reducing the likelihood.  But assuring?

I too am happy that no one got killed, the rest is a detail.

OK, to be fair, the getting the same naive error in a second implementation
does sound inexcusable but we should confuse the inability to simulate the
complete real-time operation (or even, the failure to do so) with the gross
error of ignoring a known critical bug. This is not about assurance but, if
true, about incompetence.

San Jose, California, has issued no garbage bills (186,000 homes and 3765
apartments) since the beginning of October -- because of ``faulty
procedures in saving backup records.''  The city is spending $360,000 to
rectify the situation, which will take another month.  [Source: *San Jose

Some Web shoppers have recently had their worst fears about electronic
commerce confirmed -- the credit card information they trustingly typed in
was accessible by anyone using a simple Web browser.  The sites affected had
improperly installed a software program called SoftCart, made by Mercantec
Inc., to handle their transactions.  "Our standard documentation clearly
explains how to avoid these security break-ins," says Mercantec's president.
The problem was attributed to human error, which occurred when inexperienced
installers failed to place completed order forms in directories not
accessible to Web browsers.  Vendors affected by the glitch say they've
taken steps to remedy the situation.  (*Wall Street Journal*, 8 Nov 1996, B6)

Many researchers have noted security flaws in existing Java implementations
as well as fundamental weaknesses in Java's security model.  Examples of the
former include attacks that confuse Java's type system, ultimately allowing
applets to execute arbitrary code with the full permission of the user
invoking the browser, and examples of the latter include the lack of audit
trails and Java's single-line-of-defense strategy.  Dean, Felten, and
Wallach's paper "Java Security: From HotJava to Netscape and Beyond" brought
most of these issues to light, sending shock waves throughout the computing
community.  (See <A HREF="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/sip">http://www.cs.princeton.edu/sip</A>).

Until now users and system designers have been content to consider these
problems transient, confident that bugs will be mended quickly enough to
limit any damage.  Netscape, for instance, has been admirably quick in
responding to the most serious problems.

However, the giant installed base of Java-enabled browsers---each inviting
an adversary to determine the browser's actions---gives reason to suspect
some kind of fallout even in "secure" implementations of Java.  Our paper,
available at <A HREF="http://www.cs.bu.edu/techreports/96-026-java-firewalls.ps.Z">http://www.cs.bu.edu/techreports/96-026-java-firewalls.ps.Z</A>,
describes attacks on firewalls that can be launched from legal Java applets.
In certain firewall environments, a Java applet that finds itself running in
a browser behind the firewall can cause the firewall to allow incoming
telnet (or other TCP) connections to that host.  In some cases, the applet
can even use the firewall to access arbitrary hosts supposedly protected by
the firewall.

The weaknesses exploited by these attacks are neither in the Java
implementation nor in the firewall as such, but rather in the composition
of the two---and in the security model that results when browsers give
adversaries such ready access to "protected" hosts.

Our paper also describes methods for preventing applets from crossing a
firewall; this is one way to prevent such attacks.  In any case we strongly
recommend that managers of firewalled sites containing Java-enabled browsers
take a good look at the issues involved and make appropriate policy
decisions.

There has been a great deal of talk about how ActiveX controls can be
written to do malicious things on the Internet.  However, what has not being
recognized is that even standard ActiveX controls can be made to do
malicious things via HTML and VBScript.  Here are two simple examples of
"good" ActiveX controls being made to do "bad" things:

The computer crashing URL - file:///aux

If Microsoft's ActiveMovie control is told to play a movie from the
URL file:///aux Internet Explorer will go into an infinite loop under
Windows 95.  Attempting to shutdown Internet Explorer by doing an "End
Task" will more often then not crash Windows 95.  This bug can be
exploited by the "bad guys" to create HTML pages that will crash
people's computers when the pages are downloaded from a web site.


VBScript and ActiveX combo disk crasher

Even more worrisome are ActiveX controls that contain methods (i.e.,
function calls) that write files to disks.  These methods can be used
by a simple VBscript program to overwrite key system files like
AUTOEXEC.BAT, CONFIG.SYS, REG.DAT etc.  The damage is done simply by
viewing an HTML page that contains the ActiveX control and the
malicious VBScript code.  I know of at least three commercially
available ActiveX controls that have methods that will save files to
disk.  Any of these controls, I believe, can be exploited to build a
disk crash HTML page.  At least two of these controls have valid
Authenticode digital signatures so that they can be automatically
downloaded and executed even with the highest security settings in
Internet Explorer 3.

The big question in my mind is what can be done about solving these sorts of
ActiveX security problems.

Well, one of our old-favorite sources of RISKS quotes has done it again!

Henry Petroski
Invention by Design: How Engineers Get from Thought to Thing
Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts
November 1996, 288 pages.  ISBN 0-674-46367-6

This book explores the underlying essence of engineering -- not so much what
makes particular products tick (or not tick), but rather why is it that the
process of engineering design can evolve so successfully (or unsuccessfully,
as the case may be).  The chapters range widely over paper clips, pencils,
zippers, aluminum cans, faxes and networks, planes and computers, water and
society, bridges and politics, and finally buildings and systems.  It has
long been my contention that those of us involved in developing and using
computer systems have much to learn from the more traditional engineering
disciplines.  Henry himself modestly eschews analysis of computer system
developments and computer engineering, perhaps because there are fundamental
differences between his disciplines and our "discipline" (or lack thereof).
He typically leaves it to us to bridge the gap.  However, this book provides

"Actually every Ada compiler supports arbitrary precision arithmetic--at
compile time.  Static integer constants are required to be evaluated without
overflow, and the easiest way to guarantee this is to evaluate them using an
arbitrary precision arithmetic package."

I had an integer constant evaluate *with* overflow during this past week.

Whilst updating a DNS record, I accidentally set the serial number to
19961100808, when it should have been 1996110808, corresponding to the four
digit year, two digit month and two digit hour of the day.

When checking the DNS record from the name daemon using nslookup (which is
essentially viewing a run-time interpretation of the DNS record), the serial
number looked nothing like what was entered in the DNS record. The serial
number had been evaluated, overflowed and the truncated result was being
used, without any complaint from the name daemon when it had re-loaded the
DNS record. As DNS serial numbers have to always increase for updates to
propagate, and I wanted something that wouldn't overflow, I ended up using
2996111117 as the new serial number.

As an accidental increase of a DNS serial number cannot be easily rectified,
I believe that the name daemon should have refused to load the DNS record
with a serial number that would cause an overflow.

...........................................................................

&gt;From e-mail to cellular communications, from secure Web access to digital
cash, cryptography is an essential part of today's information systems.
Cryptography helps provide accountability, fairness, accuracy, and
confidentiality.  It can prevent fraud in electronic commerce and assure the
validity of financial transactions.  It can prove your identity or protect
your anonymity.  It can keep vandals from altering your Web page and prevent
industrial competitors from reading your confidential documents.  And in the
future, as commerce and communications continue to move to computer
networks, cryptography will become more and more vital.

But the cryptography now on the market doesn't provide the level of
security it advertises.  Most systems are not designed and implemented in
concert with cryptographers, but by engineers who thought of cryptography
as just another component.  It's not.  You can't make systems secure by
tacking on cryptography as an afterthought.  You have to know what you are
doing every step of the way, from conception through installation.

Billions of dollars are spent on computer security, and most of it is
wasted on insecure products.  After all, weak cryptography looks the same
on the shelf as strong cryptography.  Two e-mail encryption products may
have almost the same user interface, yet one is secure while the other
permits eavesdropping.  A comparison chart may suggest that two programs
have similar features, although one has gaping security holes that the
other doesn't.  An experienced cryptographer can tell the difference.  So
can a thief.

Present-day computer security is a house of cards; it may stand for now,
but it can't last.  Many insecure products have not yet been broken because
they are still in their infancy.  But when these products are widely used,
they will become tempting targets for criminals.  The press will publicize
the attacks, undermining public confidence in these systems.  Ultimately,
products will win or lose in the marketplace depending on the strength of
their security.

THREATS TO COMPUTER SYSTEMS

Every form of commerce ever invented has been subject to fraud, from rigged
scales in a farmers' market to counterfeit currency to phony invoices.
Electronic commerce schemes will also face fraud, through forgery,
misrepresentation, denial of service, and cheating.  In fact,
computerization makes the risks even greater, by allowing attacks that are
impossible against non-automated systems.  A thief can make a living
skimming a penny from every Visa cardholder.  You can't walk the streets
wearing a mask of someone else's face, but in the digital world it is easy
to impersonate others.  Only strong cryptography can protect against these
attacks.

Privacy violations are another threat.  Some attacks on privacy are
targeted:  a member of the press tries to read a public figure's e-mail, or
a company tries to intercept a competitor's communications.  Others are
broad data-harvesting attacks, searching a sea of data for interesting
information: a list of rich widows, AZT users, or people who view a
particular Web page.

Electronic vandalism is an increasingly serious problem. Computer vandals
have already graffitied the CIA's web page, mail-bombed Internet providers,
and canceled thousands of newsgroup messages.  And of course, vandals and
thieves routinely break into networked computer systems.  When security
safeguards aren't adequate, trespassers run little risk of getting caught.

Attackers don't follow rules; they cheat.  They can attack a system using
techniques the designers never thought of.  Art thieves have burgled homes
by cutting through the walls with a chain saw.  Home security systems, no
matter how expensive and sophisticated, won't  stand a chance against this
attack.  Computer thieves come through the walls too.  They steal technical
data, bribe insiders, modify software, and collude.  They take advantage of
technologies newer than the system, and even invent new mathematics to
attack the system with.

The odds favor the attacker.  Bad guys have more to gain by examining a
system than good guys.  Defenders have to protect against every possible
vulnerability, but an attacker only has to find one security flaw to
compromise the whole system.

WHAT CRYPTOGRAPHY CAN AND CAN'T DO

No one can guarantee 100% security.  But we can work toward 100% risk
acceptance.  Fraud exists in current commerce systems:  cash can be
counterfeited, checks altered, credit card numbers stolen.  Yet these
systems are still successful because the benefits and conveniences outweigh
the losses.  Privacy systems -- wall safes, door locks, curtains -- are not
perfect, but they're often good enough.  A good cryptographic system
strikes a balance between what is possible and what is acceptable.

Strong cryptography can withstand targeted attacks up to a point -- the
point at which it becomes easier to get the information some other way.  A
computer encryption program, no matter how good, will not prevent an
attacker from going through someone's garbage.  But it can prevent
data-harvesting attacks absolutely; no attacker can go through enough trash
to find every AZT user in the country.  And it can protect communications
against non-invasive attacks: it's one thing to tap a phone line from the
safety of the telephone central office, but quite another to break into
someone's house to install a bug.

The good news about cryptography is that we already have the algorithms and
protocols we need to secure our systems.  The bad news is that that was the
easy part; implementing the protocols successfully requires considerable
expertise.  The areas of security that interact with people -- key
management, human/computer interface security, access control -- often defy
analysis.  And the disciplines of public-key infrastructure, software
security, computer security, network security, and tamper-resistant
hardware design are very poorly understood.

Companies often get the easy part wrong, and implement insecure algorithms
and protocols.  But even so, practical cryptography is rarely broken
through the mathematics; other parts of systems are much easier to break.
The best protocol ever invented can fall to an easy attack if no one pays
attention to the more complex and subtle implementation issues.  Netscape's
security fell to a bug in the random-number generator.  Flaws can be
anywhere: the threat model, the system design, the software or hardware
implementation, the system management.  Security is a chain, and a single
weak link can break the entire system.  Fatal bugs may be far removed from
the security portion of the software; a design decision that has nothing to
do with security can nonetheless create a security flaw.

Once you find a security flaw, you can fix it.  But finding the flaws in a
product can be incredibly difficult.  Security is different from any other
design requirement, because functionality does not equal quality.  If a
word processor prints successfully, you know that the print function works.
Security is different; just because a safe recognizes the correct
combination does not mean that its contents are secure from a safecracker.
No amount of general beta testing will reveal a security flaw, and there's
no test possible that can prove the absence of flaws.

THREAT MODELS

A good design starts with a threat model: what the system is designed to
protect, from whom, and for how long. The threat model must take the entire
system into account -- not just the data to be protected, but the people
who will use the system and how they will use it.  What motivates the
attackers?  Must attacks be prevented, or can they just be detected?  If
the worst happens and one of the fundamental security assumptions of a
system is broken, what kind of disaster recovery is possible?  The answers
to these questions can't be standardized; they're different for every
system.  Too often, designers don't take the time to build accurate threat
models or analyze the real risks.

Threat models allow both product designers and consumers to determine what
security measures they need.  Does it makes sense to encrypt your hard
drive if you don't put your files in a safe?  How can someone inside the
company defraud the commerce system?  How much would it cost to defeat the
tamper-resistance on the smart card?  You can't design a secure system
unless you understand what it has to be secure against.

SYSTEM DESIGN

Design work is the mainstay of the science of cryptography, and it is very
specialized.  Cryptography blends several areas of mathematics: number
theory, complexity theory, information theory, probability theory, abstract
algebra, and formal analysis, among others.  Few can do the science
properly, and a little knowledge is a dangerous thing: inexperienced
cryptographers almost always design flawed systems.  Good cryptographers
know that nothing substitutes for extensive peer review and years of
analysis.  Quality systems use published and well-understood algorithms and
protocols; using unpublished or unproven elements in a design is risky at
best.

Cryptographic system design is also an art.  A designer must strike a
balance between security and accessibility, anonymity and accountability,
privacy and availability.  Science alone cannot prove security; only
experience, and the intuition born of experience, can help the
cryptographer design secure systems and find flaws in existing designs.

IMPLEMENTATION

There is an enormous difference between a mathematical algorithm and its
concrete implementation in hardware or software.  Cryptographic system
designs are fragile.  Just because a protocol is logically secure doesn't
mean it will stay secure when a designer starts defining message structures
and passing bits around.  Close isn't close enough; these systems must be
implemented exactly, perfectly, or they will fail.  A poorly-designed user
interface can make a hard-drive encryption program completely insecure.  A
false reliance on tamper-resistant hardware can render an electronic
commerce system all but useless.  Since these mistakes aren't apparent in
testing, they end up in finished products.  Many flaws in implementation
cannot be studied in the scientific literature because they are not
technically interesting.  That's why they crop up in product after product.
Under pressure from budgets and deadlines, implementers use bad
random-number generators, don't check properly for error conditions, and
leave secret information in swap files. The only way to learn how to
prevent these flaws is to make and break systems, again and again.

CRYPTOGRAPHY FOR PEOPLE

In the end, many security systems are broken by the people who use them.
Most fraud against commerce systems is perpetrated by insiders.  Honest
users cause problems because they usually don't care about security.  They
want simplicity, convenience, and compatibility with existing (insecure)
systems.  They choose bad passwords, write them down, give friends and
relatives their private keys, leave computers logged in, and so on.  It's
hard to sell door locks to people who don't want to be bothered with keys.
A well-designed system must take people into account.

Often the hardest part of cryptography is getting people to use it.  It's
hard to convince consumers that their financial privacy is important when
they are willing to leave a detailed purchase record in exchange for one
thousandth of a free trip to Hawaii.  It's hard to build a system that
provides strong authentication on top of systems that can be penetrated by
knowing someone's mother's maiden name.  Security is routinely bypassed by
store clerks, senior executives, and anyone else who just needs to get the
job done.  Only when cryptography is designed with careful consideration of
users' needs and then smoothly integrated, can it protect their systems,
resources, and data.

THE STATE OF SECURITY

Right now, users have no good way of comparing secure systems.  Computer
magazines compare security products by listing their features, not by
evaluating their security.  Marketing literature makes claims that are just
not true; a competing product that is more secure and more expensive will
only fare worse in the market.  People rely on the government to look out
for their safety and security in areas where they lack the knowledge to
make evaluations -- food packaging, aviation, medicine.  But for
cryptography, the U.S. government is doing just the opposite.

When an airplane crashes, there are inquiries, analyses, and reports.
Information is widely disseminated, and everyone learns from the failure.
You can read a complete record of airline accidents from the beginning of
commercial aviation.  When a bank's electronic commerce system is breached
and defrauded, it's usually covered up.  If it does make the newspapers,
details are omitted.  No one analyzes the attack; no one learns from the
mistake.  The bank tries to patch things in secret, hoping that the public
won't lose confidence in a system that deserves no confidence.  In the long
run, secrecy paves the way for more serious breaches.

Laws are no substitute for engineering.  The U.S. cellular phone industry
has lobbied for protective laws, instead of spending the money to fix what
should have been designed correctly the first time.  It's no longer good
enough to install security patches in response to attacks.  Computer
systems move too quickly; a security flaw can be described on the Internet
and exploited by thousands.  Today's systems must anticipate future
attacks.  Any comprehensive system -- whether for authenticated
communications, secure data storage, or electronic commerce -- is likely to
remain in use for five years or more.  It must be able to withstand the
future:  smarter attackers, more computational power, and greater
incentives to subvert a widespread system.  There won't be time to upgrade
them in the field.

History has taught us:  never underestimate the amount of money, time, and
effort someone will expend to thwart a security system.  It's always better
to assume the worst.  Assume your adversaries are better than they are.
Assume science and technology will soon be able to do things they cannot
yet.  Give yourself a margin for error.  Give yourself more security than
you need today.  When the unexpected happens, you'll be glad you did.

In EE Product News (a free advertising journal for the electronics industry)
October 1996, p. 13, highlighted as a "Semiconductor of the Month" was the
following: (I have emphasized certain portions with *...*)

&gt; XL103 CryptChip is claimed as the industry's first real-time encryption/
&gt; decryption chip.  *It protects data streams in applications as diverse as
&gt; the Internet, modems, cellular telephones, pagers, and TV set-top decoders*.

&gt; The easy-to-use IC requires no external components and *protects data
&gt; without the burden of learning cryptography*.  Users also need not write
&gt; complicated and difficult-to-maintain software.

&gt; The chip's algorithm is a protected, hard-wired circuit that's *more secure
&gt; than software because it can't be read or copied, preventing reverse
&gt; engineering*.

&gt; The chip encrypts (or decrypts) data at a rate of 6.5 bits/ms.  *With the
&gt; ability to hold eight different 64-bit keys in internal EEPROM, the device
&gt; can handle data from eight different secure systems.  In lots of 1000,
&gt; pricing is $0.94 each* in an 8-pin plastic DIP and $0.97 in an SOIC.

How many RISKS are there in this single advertising blurb?

1. Assuming that one encryption method is suitable for any data type.
2. Is designed to be utilized by an engineer who has no understanding
of how (or if) it works.
3. Assuming that a hardware device is more secure than a software algorithm.
4. Offering the potential attacker the ability to use 8 keys at a time for
generating cyphertext and selling him the part for a buck...

[Source: Coming solar cycle may pose problems, AP item, 19 Nov 1996,
PGN Stark Abstracting and Excerpting Service.]

Cycle 23 of solar interference activities is building up, and is expected to
have considerable effects on our planet around the year 2000, according to a
panel of government researchers.  (Cycle 22 was at its peak in July 1989
[see <A HREF="/Risks/8.38.html">RISKS-8.38</A>, 39 on electric currents induced in power lines, blacking
out Quebec, and <A HREF="/Risks/8.72.html">RISKS-8.72</A> for a more detailed retrospective article]; the
strongest cycle to date was in November 1957.)  In particular, many new
industries have emerged that were not subjected to previous solar effects --
and they have not anticipated the risks to their systems and their
businesses.  Navigation and communications are considered to be particularly
vulnerable.  For information on the report, you might try contacting Air
Force Col. Jud Stailey, assistant director of the Office of Federal
Coordinator for Meteorological Services, a 13-agency panel housed in the
offices of the National Weather Service, or Ernie Hildner, director of the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Space Environment Center
in Boulder, Colo.

Potential problems to anticipate include damage to computers and other
electrical systems in satellites; expansion of the Earth's atmosphere,
slowing down satellites and pieces of space debris, making them harder to
track; induced currents in pipelines and other large arrays of metal;
disruption of signals for the inexpensive single-frequency global
positioning system satellites; interference with the newly developed
satellite cell-phone system; changes in the Earth's magnetic field,
interfering with signals used to direct oil drilling bits deep underground.

[An obvious question for RISKS readers is which will have a more dramatic
effect, Y2K or Cycle 23?  Perhaps we will have Murphy-slaw and each will
reinforce the other on the same day!  PGN]

U2-INTERNET

LONDON (AP) - The Irish rock band U2 may have become the world's first music
group to be burglarized on the Internet, according to reports.  Two songs
lifted from the band's yet-to-be released album have been removed from
computers at U2's Dublin studio and distributed on the Internet, according
to the Sunday Times of London.  Island Records, which manages the
multi-million selling artists, says the appearance of the songs represents
copyright infringement.  Island is reportedly trying to close down the
Internet sites on which the songs, "Discotheque" and "Wake Up Dead Man,"
appear.

Although people who care about computer security are concerned about
ActiveX, the problems are likely to grow in the coming months and years.
That's because ActiveX is key to Microsoft's long-term strategy of
eliminating the distinction between information stored on desktop computers
and information stored on the network.

I have had numerous conversations with Microsoft employees about ActiveX
over the past six months. In summer 1996, I was told that the security
problems would be solved by code-signing. This fall, I was told that
code-signing doesn't solve the security problem, but does provide
accountability. Now I'm told that it doesn't really give you accountability
either, but it does give you integrity for the downloaded applets and,
anyway, code signing is import for its own right. Besides, says Microsoft
folks, the dangers in ActiveX controls are no different than the dangers
that are found in downloading any program from the Internet.

The real reason that code signing does not promote authentication, of
course, is that truly malicious ActiveX components won't tell you that they
are maliciously modifying your operating system. In fact, they'll try to
make the modifications as quietly as possible. Or they might engage in a
two-pronged attack. For example, one ActiveX control could change Internet
Explorer's ActiveX security level so that you would run unsigned applets;
later, a second control could do the real damage.

On Wednesday, November 20th, my column on HotWired's "Packet" channel will
go into the ActiveX security problem in some detail. If you wish to read

A number of posts on breaking tamper resistant processors have
appeared recently; most of them have been theoretical. However, in a
paper to be published on Tuesday, we describe a number of very
practical attacks on smart cards and other security processors. We
have implemented some of them successfully against fielded systems.

The URLS are:

html:           www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/rja14/tamper.html
postscript      ftp.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/rja14/tamper.ps.gz

This work will appear at the Usenix Electronic Commerce workshop in Oakland,
California, where it has won the `Best paper' award. It was written some
time ago, but we held back the results in order to give banking systems
developers the chance to implement countermeasures.

One of the attacks we describe breaks completely a security processor that
is widely used in the banking industry; it is embedded in about a million
point-of-sale terminals, automatic-teller machines, and banking key
management systems.  Our attack enables all the code and key material to be
read out from this chip in minutes.

Other techniques we describe enable attackers to extract all or part of the
code and keys from various makes of smartcard and `secure' microcontroller.
They have profound implications for bankers, pay-TV stations, operators of
prepayment electricity meters and of course for the smartcard industry
itself.

We also include a survey of attacks developed by others, many of which have
not appeared in the literature before. We found that once we had some
results to show, everyone from chipmakers through intelligence agencies to
TV pirates wanted to swap hints and compare notes. Even some top scientists
at smartcard companies would tell us about vulnerabilities - in their
competitors' cards!

So our article describes a number of the attacks actually used by spooks and
TV pirates. We also describe techniques developed by the chip testing
industry, many of which can easily be adapted to read out secrets from
smartcards; although they are in the open literature, the security community
has just not been aware of them.

Until quite recently, many system developers relied blindly on the tamper
resistance claims made by the manufacturers of smartcards and other security
processors. Over the last two or three years, it has become increasingly
clear that organised gangs had acquired the capability to clone the
smartcards used in pay-TV access control.  This raises the obvious risk that
banking systems could be next.

Since writing this paper, we have devised a number of additional attacks.
For example, Biham and Shamir announced an attack on DES based on 200
ciphertexts in which one-bit errors have been induced by ionising radiation;
we can break DES with less than ten ciphertexts, using the kind of faults
introduced by power and clock glitches.  Boneh, DeMillo and Lipton announced
an attack on RSA using one-bit errors; we can break RSA with a one-round
glitch attack. This could be implemented in a Mafia-owned point of sale
device, and factor RSA moduli in real time without the attack being noticed
by either the customer or her bank.

Our techniques not only make Differential Fault Analysis much more
efficient; the fault model that we use is completely realistic.  No-one has
to our knowledge implemented an attack using radiation to generate one-bit
data errors, but using high frequency transients in the power and clock
inputs to a smartcard is an established way of causing it to decode
instructions incorrectly. This technique has actually been used by TV
pirates - though they attacked the card protocols rather than the
cryptographic algorithms.

Once we can cause instructions to be wrongly decoded, a range of quite novel
attacks becomes available. In addition to differential fault analysis, we
can look for glitches that reduce the number of rounds in the encryption
algorithm. If DES is reduced to one or two rounds, for example, then
extracting the key becomes trivial.

This attack can also be implemented using our most recent innovation - the
ROM overwrite attack. This is inspired by the observation that many
smartcards have a DES implementation in ROM, which we can usually see under
a microscope and which we can damage using a laser cutter. This is often a
lot cheaper and simpler than using an ion beam workstation to read keys
directly out of EEPROM.

If we are familiar with the ROM implementation (or can disassemble
it), we typically find a small number of bits with the property that
changing them reduces the number of rounds to one or two. Where this
is not possible, we may still be able to identify the S-boxes, and by
setting all their bits to the same value we can turn DES into a
linear transformation.  Again, the key can be trivially recovered.

This is a new and exciting field of research, and one that secure system
designers would be prudent to follow closely.

Apparently MasterCard has bought a 51% share in Mondex, a British company
which produces electronic cash smart cards.  Mondex has been on pilot tests
in Swindon, England, for the past year or so, and MasterCard claims to want
to make it available across Britain.

Am I the only person who thinks this is suicidal, either for MasterCard and
its associated banks, or in the worst case for the whole currency?

The arrogance of the people behind this and other forms of virtual money, in
thinking that their codes can't be defeated by either brute-force or
backdoor mechanisms, is quite breathtaking.  <A HREF="/Risks/18.15.html">RISKS-18.15</A> has an example of
how this kind of thing has already been done.  And when the Mondex trial
system was launched, BBC Television showed how easy it is to retrieve all
kinds of smart card technical data over the Internet.

Once those smart cards, readers, and ATM card-point-loaders get widely
distributed, they will be sitting targets for anyone who fancies a shot at
reverse-engineering them.  Possible reward: a machine that effectively
prints money, but far, far more attractive than forging bills.  I think the
bad guys might have a few 200 MHz Pentium Pro systems to spare for this;
although in any case, stealing just one card-loading machine would seem to
be simpler.

For one thing, a fake bill is still a fake bill after it's been passed on
ten or a hundred times, and the person introducing it into the system knows
that, for the first few times each bill is used, there's at least some
possibility of tracing it back.  For fake electronic cash, however, there's
no way to distinguish between the real virtual stuff and the fake virtual
stuff.  As a result, nobody will care whether what they're being given is
real or not, like they currently do with those fancy U-V lights, because
they won't have it rejected by the bank.

Having any ATM able to load up your smart card with points, is
equivalent to having current ATMs print the bills fresh 'n' crisp when
you ask for them, and just making a mental note to settle up with the
central bank later.  For a number of very good reasons, central banks
don't like the idea of this.  (Does anyone imagine that the directors of
BCCI would have bother ripping off their customers, had it been easier
just to print a few bills and forget to notify the Federal Reserve or
Bank of England ?)

Even worse, the only way we'll know that there are a lot of fake Mondex cash
in circulation is when inflation starts rising for no obvious reason; at
which time, the crisis in confidence in the banking system doesn't bear
thinking about.

One other point that I am reluctant to make, since I don't usually subscribe
to the "drug dealers/paedophiles/foreign agents use technology item X, so we
have to make it illegal, to protect our streets/kids/national security"
argument, but: has anyone considered just what a great tool this will be for
laundering money ?

A thief broke into a Visa International data processing center in California
a couple of weeks ago and stole a personal computer containing information
on about 314,000 credit card accounts, including Visa, MasterCard, American
Express, Discover and Diners Club, says a Visa spokesman.  Some issuers,
including Citibank, began calling customers last week and have issued new
cards.  Others are keeping quiet about the event and monitoring accounts for
unusual activity.  Authorities speculate that the perpetrator was stolen for
the resale value of the hardware, rather than the information it contained.

first batch of reader-breaking cards is probably already in consumer hands.
The article also states that Visa will levy fines on member banks from 1000

In the interim, Visa is asking member banks not to issue cards that expire

I suppose there is nothing much new in mailstorms, or in the problems of
forwarders and remailers, but ...

As some RISKS readers may be aware, I occasionally submit reviews of books
to the list.  In fact, this is only a small selection from the book reviews
that I "publish" daily over the net.  I do not run an automated mailing list
myself, submitting the reviews for the general public via the Usenet
*.books.* groups.  I do manually maintain a select mailing list for
newsletter publishers, bookstores, and Web site archivists.

A little over a week ago I started to get a flurry of bounce messages from
one site.  In fact, I was getting around a hundred messages per day.  In
addition, for some reason the messages were of extraordinary size, and were
regularly causing my account (on a VMS system) to exceed disk quota.

Often this type of thing is caused by the remailing of one of my messages
through another mailing list.  NETTRAIN (for perhaps obvious reasons) seems
to have a very high proportion of people who simply abandon their accounts
without unsubscribing, and these accounts frequently bounce errors to the
originator, rather than the list-owner.  Examination of the header, however,
showed no indication that this had happened in this instance.  My own list
had no entry that remotely resembled the site I was getting the bounces
from.

This has gone on for the past week.  All the bounces relate to the one,
single message: none to any subsequent reviews sent out.  Messages to every
"postmaster" account I could generate from the header info turned up
nothing.

The bounces haven't stopped, but I've finally got some information on whose
account it is.  One of the requests to be put on the list was for a small,
local distribution list.  One of the people on that list does not work
directly for the people running the local list.  She was provided with an
account on their system, but never learned to use it.  Her lack of use of
the local account created a problem with mail buildup on their local system,
so that account was forwarded to her work.

Her work system seems to be the one generating the problem.  Apparently they
have had unresolved network connection problems for some time now.  It seems
reasonable to assume that something tried on that one day has now created
an unresolved loop, which is still sending out the error messages.

*My* problem still isn't resolved.  Of course I have now taken the system
with the local distribution off *my* list, thus ensuring that no more mail
goes to them, her, or her employers.  In the meantime, the bug has taken on
a life of its own, plugging my e-mail account (and exceeding my quota) on a
daily basis.

Isn't automation wonderful?  :-)

&gt; Yes, this is very interesting. I believe I know
&gt; how they are doing this. They have discovered a

&gt; for a couple of years now (on and off, without really
&gt; dedicating months of time to it though :-).
&gt;
&gt; My guess would be, if you sent them a drive and
&gt; told them you had lost your password, it would come
&gt; back with a different Administrator password than
&gt; the one you sent it in with :-).
&gt;
&gt; It works like this. The NT password database in the
&gt; registry is only as secure as UNIX shadow passwords
&gt; (actually, a little less secure as they don't use
&gt; salt in their hash technique, it's pure DES for the
&gt; Lanman password, and MD4 for the NT password).
&gt; The 'nasty little secret' is that the hashed password
&gt; values are double encrypted (for 'obfuscation purposes'
&gt; it says in the NT knowledgebase) in the SAM. I believe this
&gt; company has worked out how that double encryption is done,
&gt; and just overwrite the hashed password. My explorations in
&gt; this area lead me to believe that MS use DES in ecb mode
&gt; to just encrypt the hash, and that the key is some
&gt; function of the last RID component of the users SID value.
&gt;
&gt; I believe this to be the case after doing various
&gt; experiments on an NT SAM database, changing users
&gt; names whilst keeping password the same (no change
&gt; in double-encrypted hash), assigning the same password
&gt; to users with the same name but different SID's (different
&gt; double encrypted hash), assigning the same password to
&gt; users with different names, in different domains, but
&gt; with the same last RID component of the SID (identical
&gt; double-encrypted hash). ...

The article at <A HREF="http://www.techweb.com/wire/news/1109bug.html">http://www.techweb.com/wire/news/1109bug.html</A> describes
how "A prominent Web development shop found two substantial performance
flaws in Sun Microsystems' Java Developers Kit when it attempted to
deploy it in a large-scale environment."  The developers' introduction
to various RISKS will be familiar to readers here.  Excerpted comments:

"In a complex, multiserver, multiprocess environment, that's to be
expected," Presence's McFall said.  "We had to tune several things
before we could get it stable."  Once the AtHand design was stable,
the problems in the Virtual Machine emerged.  As the load increased
between the Web server and an Oracle database on the AtHand site,
the Virtual Machine locked up.

"Some of the operations, as far as managing memory, worked under
normal load, low-stress conditions, but when you start pounding on
it--like what is going to happen on a big Web site--there are a few
bugs in there," said Xeno Derer, the software engineer at Presence
charged with fixing the Java bugs.  "It either died thinking it was
out of memory or the Virtual Machine itself would start crashing."

The article mentions that PacBell was the client and that the app
was to handle, among other things, their online directory service.

In early September, Bernard Glassman wrote about FedEx using a service
provided by Cellular One in North Carolina to locate the point from which he
originated a cell call.

I pursued the question about that service availability with my local (San
Francisco Bay Area) Cellular One office. They responded in writing:

"Cellular One Bay Area does not offer the service described in the e-mail.
It is important to remember that Cellular One is a franchise and each
service area is individually owned and operated. I will of course contact
you if I hear of any such services being offered by our company."

It seems there is a risk of assumption in dealing with a company that appears
to be a national entity but is in fact a series of franchises. We should not
assume all locations will deliver (or not deliver) the same services.

I can't recall ever having heard that different locations of any company
might offer different services _because_ the company is a franchise ...
unless it is the ubiquitous phrase on hamburger advertisements "at
participating locations only" ?

comp.risks, and our esteemed moderator has also violated the law by
distributing RISKS.  This is because that law also contains the following
clause:

"It shall be unlawful for any person within the United States [...] to
use a computer or other electronic device to send any message via a
telephone facsimile machine unless such person clearly marks, in a margin
at the top or bottom of each transmitted page of the message or on the
first page of the transmission, the date and time it is sent and an
identification of the business, other entity, or individual sending the
message and the telephone number of the sending machine or of such
business, other entity, or individual."

In other words, if you believe that 47 USC 227 applies to e-mail, and you
have ever sent an e-mail message that did not include your telephone number,
then you are a federal criminal.  (And there's still the thorny issue of
deciding exactly what constitutes a "page" of an e-mail message.)
Furthermore, the manufacturer of your computer has violated the law, because
the law also requires the manufacturers of telephone facsimile machines
after 1992 to make sure that the machine clearly marks this information on
each page.

There are several other aspects of 47 USC 227 that make no sense in this
context.  I would certainly agree that a law against unsolicited bulk e-mail
is called for.  But the way to solve that problem is to create such a law,
not to try to creatively misconstrue an existing law to cover a situation it
wasn't designed or intended for.

As an AOL subscriber, I would like to clarify this situation. AOL did not ban
these domains, they simply provided their users with the tools to block mail
from them. Any AOL subscriber can receive mail from any or all of the domains
by setting the appropriate flags.

The risk here is that AOL's member accounts are automatically set to block
these domains, and it's up to the individual members to know that they need
to unblock them if they want to receive the mail. AOL did advertise this
option conspicuously on the service.

When the Russian Mars probe crashed earlier this week, it provided an
interesting example of the difference between precision and accuracy.

The first reports said that the probe would crash land in central Australia,
bringing with it 200 g of plutonium.  State emergency services all over
Australia went into yellow alert.  Soldiers were mobilised.

&gt;From the TV pictures, the first estimates of where it would land were
anywhere in an area about 2000 km across.  The next reports said that it
would be landing at about the New South Wales/Queensland border, and they
seemed to think it would come down somewhere in an area about 500 km across.
The next reports said that it would come down somewhere in an area in the
north west of New South Wales, and the precision of this estimate seemed to
be about 100 km.

As it turned out, it came down about 2000 km west of Chile, in the Pacific
Ocean, a third of the way around the world from Australia.

So as the precision of the reports was increasing, the accuracy of the
reports was about staying about the same - very wrong.

Hacker Scheme, By KAREN MATTHEWS, Associated Press Writer
NEW YORK (AP) -- City workers, in exchange for bribes from property
owners, falsified computer records to eliminate nearly $13 million in
unpaid taxes in a scheme called the largest tax fraud	case in New York
City history.  [Associated Press news wire via CompuServe's Executive News
Service, AP US &amp; World, 22 Nov 1996]

The author makes the following key points:

o Some tax records erased.
o Other records falsely indicated as paid using funds from legitimate
payments by innocent victims.
o So far, 29 people charged in federal court.
o 200 more expected to be charged.
o $13M of debts erased.
o $7M in interest lost.
o Fraud thought to have started in 1992.
o Investigation started in 1994.
o In a section particularly intriguing for RISKS and NCSA FORUM participants,
the author writes, ``Three employees of the city collector's offices
exploited computer "glitches" to make it appear that unpaid taxes had
been paid, officials said.

More, no doubt, as the case unfolds.

This item from last week in Executive News Service on CompuServe caught my eye:

Pilots said stretched to limit by cockpit high-tech
Reuters World Report, 20 Nov 1996

LONDON, Nov 20 (Reuter) - Airline pilots are being stretched
to the limit by increasingly complex cockpit technology and need
radically different training methods to cope in future, a top
medical aviation specialist said on Wednesday.

The article makes the following key points:

o	Dr Michael Bagshaw is head of aviation medical services at
British Airways.  He wonders, "Are we perhaps reaching the
limit to pilots' mental processing capacity?"

o	However, he answered in his address in London to the Royal
Society in London , "On the face of it we may have reached a
plateau. But experience shows that having 	reached a plateau,
we then move on again."

o	According to the expert, "In both military and commercial
aviation the complexity of the environment is increasing.
Automation is being developed but the question remains
as to whether the automation relieves workload or increases it."

o	"If we examine the accident rate by type of aircraft, it
can be seen that although the overall trend is down ... new
highly-automated types have a relatively higher accident rate."

o	In some cases, plane design prevents manual overrides
even if the automated system is in trouble.

o	The increasing use of CRT and LCD displays means that what
used to be on separate dials now appears, in the words of the
author of the article, "on one cluttered computer
display, which meant pilots needed to spend more time
interpreting what they were seeing."

o	Dr Bagshaw added, "We are starting to see some of the
limitations of information processing. This is the weak
link -- information is derived from a number of sources.
It has to be integrated, then interpreted, and the appropriate
action taken to use that information appropriately."

o	The changes in technology necessitate new methods of training:
"I think we can move on from the plateau by altering the
way we approach training. We've now reached a watershed by
accepting that human error is normal," said Baghshaw after his
speech.  "The old approach was to think that human error was a
mistake which should be avoided. Now we have to assume it will
happen and instead assess how pilots cope with error."

On Monday 25 Nov 1996, Bell Atlantic -- the local telephone company serving
the mid-Atlantic region of the USA, including Philadelphia and Washington,
D.C. -- saw an outage of several hours in its telephone directory assistance
service, due (apparently) to an errant operating system upgrade on a
database server.  For unknown reasons, the backup system also failed.  The
result was that for several hours, telephone operators ended up taking
callers' requests and telephone numbers, looking the requested information
up in printed directories, and calling the callers back with the
information.

Apparently, the problem was solved by backing out the software upgrade.
Significantly (in my opinion), the Washington Post's article on the outage
mentioned this fact (albeit in slightly less technical language), which is
yet another indication of the pervasiveness of software, and of the growing
number of people in society at large that are generally aware of software
and how it works.

As the use of computer networks, and in particular the Internet, has
increased, so has the potential threat to security. In the last several
years, we have seen numerous security-related attacks on Netscape, Java, and
the Internet protocols. New protocols and systems for electronic commerce,
secure financial transactions, and other applications are being introduced,
and are being deployed quickly, and on a large scale. This workshop aims to
bring together theorists and practitioners working in areas related to
network security in an informal setting to foster discussion regarding the
nature of the threat and what we, as researchers, can do to help manage it.

At a recent meeting sponsored by the Electronic Banking Economics Society,
one speaker predicted that a bankruptcy rate of between 1% and 5% could
result directly from costs related to fixing the notorious "Year 2000
Problem."  "If you have not yet begun a Year 2000 conversion today, you will
not be able to convert by 2000," he said, noting that there are only 150
weekends left to work on systems affected by the problem.  If companies
choose to ignore the problem, they'll be liable for millions in lawsuits
brought by shareholders when company stock prices begin to plummet.  Only
one third of U.S. companies are addressing the problem, with another third
entering the preliminary discussion phase, and the other third doing
nothing.  Still, that's better than the rest of the world: "Britain is three
steps behind the United States on this issue, Europe about 10 steps behind
the United States on the issue, and Japan is about 15 steps behind the
United States on the issue," the consultant said.  (*BNA Daily Report for
Executives*, 20 Nov 1996, A16; Edupage, 24 Nov 1996)

The online edition of the Guardian newspaper has an interesting article on
the year 2000 problem; concentrating on the legal responsibility of software
and hardware vendors.

The article quotes Stephen Castell, a consultant in computer technology:
"Castell believes that around the beginning of 1992 is the earliest time
from which suppliers may be liable. He says, "The problem was sufficiently
recognised in the industry from around then, and systems developers should
have considered moving on from the two-figure date."  However, if it is
correct that the potential problem should have been obvious, courts may be
less indulgent to developers who overlooked it even before 1992."

Many of the requests processed by local government offices are requests for
information from government records. This fact has given the Danish
Ministry of Research a seemingly brilliant idea: Making government records
available on the World Wide Web would free local government officials from
processing these requests.

The first government records were made public on October 1 on
&lt;<A HREF="http://ditdanmark.nethotel.dk/vurdering/">http://ditdanmark.nethotel.dk/vurdering/</A>&gt;. The information was taken from
the land and building property evaluation records of the Danish Tax
Ministry. These records are used by employees in the tax offices of the
local government for taxation of land and building property. The published
information included the following for each piece of land and building
property in Denmark: Location, owner, estimated value, date and price
(including down payment) of last sale (if sold since last evaluation of the
property in 1992), debts to local government, rental value for
non-residential property (if rented) and further notes intended to assist
evaluation.

On the October 15 the records were made inaccessible when the large,
reputable Danish newspaper Berlingske Tidende published a critique by
professor Erik Frkjr from the Department of Computer Science at
Copenhagen University. Two thing were criticized:

1. The records could be copied without explicit permit by anyone with
access to the Internet, something which is not allowed according to the
Danish Public Authorities' Registers Act.

2. The last three items in the list above were confidential information and
could not legally be published under Danish law.

Access to the records was reestablished the next day when the offending
items had been removed. At that time the publisher, Kommunedata, assured
the public and the Danish Data Surveillance Authority ("Registertilsynet")
that the records could not be copied. The company also publicly explained
that Erik Frkjr could not possibly have copied the records except by
means that were not entirely legal.

Soon after this a group of researchers contacted the Danish Data
Surveillance Authority to demonstrate that the records are easily copied
(with entirely legal means), but the offer of a demonstration has been
declined by the Authority. Copies of the case obtained from the Authority
under the Danish Freedom of Information Act show that the Authority has been
made aware by other means that copying is possible. Despite this the
Authority refuses to take action based on this evidence so WWW access is
still possible. The only change since the reopening has been removal of most
of the information about sales when the Court in rhus informed the
Authority that this information is not and should not be publicly available.

This is the first case known to me of government records being published on
the World Wide Web. The case is instructive: There has been repeated valid
objections to the legal basis on which the records are made available. This
and the fact that the continuing operation of this service is not important
for anything but the reputation of the parties involved, leads me to expect
that access ought to be at least temporarily suspended until the questions
were resolved.

This case demonstrates a large collection of security problems inherent to
World Wide Web publication of government records as well as a lot of legal
problems that will not be mentioned here. These problems are probably
compounded because both the Danish government and Kommunedata wants to be
perceived as technologically advanced and "Internet-friendly".

1) The original records were used by the employees in local tax offices, so
information that was not meant to be disclosed publicly was maintained
together with the evaluation of each piece of property. When the records
were made available on the World Wide Web without cleanup, confidential
information was disclosed. Moral: When sensitive information is put to use
in a new way it should be checked to make sure that all information is
appropriate for the new use.

2) The Danish Data Surveillance Authority does not have its own technical
staff, so it wasn't able to asses the correctness of the claim made by the
publisher, Kommunedata, that the records could not be copied. Moral:
Government authorities should not rely on experts employed by the companies
that are checked. When new types of problems are encountered the government
should use their own or independent security experts to assess the claims
made by companies.

3) It is not possible to prevent information published on the Internet from
being copied, so information that must not be copied should not be available
on the Internet.

4) Until now the companies and government authorities involved has ignored
criticism from computer professionals. Moral: Government officials does not
automatically listen when professionals criticize security. If the critique
goes against official policy you might very well be ignored or worse, no
matter how serious the problem is.

5) Denmark prides itself on its large information systems in the public
administration. These information systems have been accepted by the public
because of a set of very restrictive laws governing these records and strict
attention to security. Other governments may be tempted to publish similar
records on the World Wide Web because when the security-conscious Danes do
it, it must be OK.

6) To add insult to injury the programs used by Kommunedata to control
access to the records performs no parameter validation which shows that
this publication probably has yet more security problems in store.

Despite the problems with publication of the records the Ministry of
Research and Kommunedata wants to make even more sensitive and personal data
available on the World Wide Web in the future. I shudder as I contemplate
the consequences.

Two days ago, I was in a computer room of a large financial institution. A
whole range of different computers is in that room. One (PC) setup consisted
of a tower on the ground, and a monitor and keyboard on a table. Nothing
usual here.  But the monitor was placed on a box which had switches for the
monitor, the tower, and a printer, and a masterswitch, on one end, and
cables on the other. The switches where facing forward.

The machine was happily minding its own - important - business.

My partner and I were working on a different machine. At one moment, he
gives way to let me handle the machine. He puts his elbow on the table,
slightly disturbing the keyboard, which is moved enough to just have the
master switch break the contact for a moment, causing the machine to crash.

- "Is that serious?", he asked.
- "It is a live machine..."

When I left two hours later, at least 5 people had been trying to get it
working again, and at least 10 nervous people asked what was going on. They
were still trying to boot it.

Today I was in the room again. They had turned the box 90 degrees.

The online edition of the UK Guardian newspaper has a long article on the
way that "Internet users leave traces and records of every online action,
from sending e-mail or posting to newsgroups to visiting Web sites."

... At the moment unwanted e-mail is about the limit of the intrusion, but
this could change. Internet commentator Dominique Paul Noth points out:
"You have no guarantee that the information is intelligently or even
accurately employed to your benefit." As more information is collected, it
is more useful to those collecting it - and less easily controlled.

... One alternative is making yourself anonymous by deleting cookie files
and using mail programs that disguise your identity.

However, making yourself anonymous online means that you cannot
personalise Web pages, ask for information via e-mail, or join mailing
lists. The issue, as Noth and other commentators recognise, is more to do
with how this information is used. Credit card companies know what we are
buying, and there is a legal framework to control their use of this
information. There is no such framework in force for online information.

It seems that the very lack of "real world" controls over online activity
which many Internet users favour has created the environment in which
marketing companies can thrive. As long as the Internet is seen as somehow
outside the reach of the law, then there will be those who abuse its
freedom. So as you surf for Christmas presents, look out for surprises in
your mailbox as a result.

%T   "Disappearing Cryptography"

The title seems to allude to, and the book jacket definitely trumpets,
steganography, the act or art of "hiding in plain sight".  An example of a
steganographic message would be one which appears to be an innocuous and
ordinary family letter, but which carries detailed information in the
background.  One chapter of the book does deal with this type of encryption,
although only in terms of hiding text data in pictures.  The book as a whole
seems more like a collection of essays on topics related to encryption.

The topics represented cover a broad range of information science.  The level
of detail provided varies, but in general the explanations are fairly simple.

Rob Slade is right.  Much of my book, _Disappearing Cryptography_ is filled
with simple discussion.  It was intended to offer many casual readers some
insight into how morphable information can be.  This is a highly important
technical topic these days because of the battles over encryption
regulation.  Sure, I could have written a nerd opera, but that wouldn't have
helped people without an advanced degree in number theory.  This topic is so
important for policy that I wanted to try and spread the knowledge around a
bit.

I think he's wrong on other counts.  The book discusses how to use
error-correcting codes, encryption, dining cryptographers networks,
compression functions, and compiler technology to make information look like
something else.  I think that each of these solutions offers a unique way to
make information `disappear' because, if it looks like something innocuous,
then it escapes detection.

I guess one's man's poison is another man's feast.

I got a kick out of the article about the problems that could be caused by
the next peak of the 11-year sunspot cycle.  Most of us amateur radio
operators are waiting in breathless anticipation for the sunspots to pick up
because it "turns on" some of the radio frequencies to long range
communications.  It's sort of like a starry-eyed 4 year old kid waiting for
Christmas hearing someone grumbling about how they don't like Christmas.

Also, the 11-year sunspot cycle has been going on for several hundred years
since the last gap in the cycle.  It says something about our technology
that some systems might not be prepared for it.  It's like someone being
surprised that it's getting cold as winter approaches.  ("Gee, didn't it
start getting cold about this time last year, too?")

&gt; ... first group to be burglarized on the Internet [?]

Those who are following this story will already know that the samples from
U2's new album were not ""siphoned off" along cables feeding the band's own
video camera", that provides a one day delayed view of U2's studio
activities, but were copied from a promotional video that was sent out from
Island Records to their office in Hungary. The video was reported to have
been borrowed and samples taken from it - a purposely degraded recording -
were uploaded to a web page on the Internet.

The story seems to have got very quickly elaborated to include hackers. The
hacker aspect appears to have come from the quote in the Sunday Times from a
"former hacker":

Hackers may have used the camera as a door into the studio's computers
where the new songs are stored.

The real risk here is that it seems that newspapers don't employ anyone
qualified to proofread and follow up their Internet related stories. (Also
c.f. the recent Observer story about pornography on the Internet).

Bell Atlantic Customers Put on Hold by Directory Assistance
[Source not specified, 26 Nov 1996.  PGN Abstracting.]

Hundreds of thousands of would-be telephone callers in nine states from NJ
to WV could not get prompt directory assistance from Bell Atlantic on 25 Nov
1996, because of flaws in new database software installed by Northern
Telecom that affected the entire customer area.  The problems affected all
of the about two dozen directory-assistance centers throughout the day,
until the old version could be resuscitated.  Operators were noting requests
and calling customers back when assistance could be attained (with delays
typically from three minutes to half an hour).  Northern Telecom said that
the new upgrade was intended to correct some minor errors in the earlier
version, and had previously been used without incident by at least two other
large telcos.  Blame was allocated to a technician who had installed the
software.  This was reportedly one of the biggest outages of this kind ever.

The Shetland Islands have a 124-year-old print weekly (*Shetland Times*) and
a 1-year-old online daily (*Shetland News*).  The *News* includes titles of
*Times* articles as hypertext links to the *Times*.  Robert Wishart, the
*Times* managing director (who once fired his former editor, Jonathan Wills,
who is now the *News* publisher), has demanded that the links be removed;
Wills has refused, although he did add asterisked footnotes.  Wishart then
invoked Scotland's Court of Session, which issued an interim interdict
against the hyperlinks.  A full hearing is pending.  If the interim
judgement is upheld, this is seemingly a landmark case in Scotland and
potentially the UK, including issues such as the differences between a web
site and a cable TV service, and whether newspaper headlines constitute

A recent security announcement was made to the 'linux-alert' security list
describing how the 'lpr' utility suffers from the (now infamous) buffer
overrun problem.  This could be exploited as a security vulnerability in
the case where it has the suid bit set.

It wasn't until after this first announcement that it was realised that
various Linux distributions have different ideas about the version number of
the *same* lpr source. Of course, this could cause much confusion and
prompted a follow-up message drawing people's attention to this somewhat
annoying and misleading situation.

The RISKS are that, especially in the case of freely-redistributable
source, users may not know the 'true' version that they are running and
may be deluded into thinking that they have a 'fixed' or 'safe' version.
Of course, the program *could* differ in all but name but in any case
some co-ordination, clarity and careful thought should be exercised by all.
A case for truth in advertising ?

Jackson, Tennessee: Cathy Mullikin's bird is cooked, and her calendar is
toast.  Mullikin had her Thanksgiving turkey dinner already cooked on
Thursday [Nov. 21], "and my friends and family are coming on the 28th and
they're going to think I'm a kook," she said.

She should never have believed that free calendar.  Jackson-Madison County
General Hospital gave out 40,000 of them last year and every last one said
Thanksgiving was on the 21st instead of the 28th. "I wouldn't have known it
was wrong except my niece called and asked what I was doing. When I told her
I was finishing up Thanksgiving dinner, she said 'A week in advance?'"
Mullikin told The Jackson Sun on Thursday.... "We've had a number of calls
from people who have seen the error and called it to our attention," [JMCG
Hospital] spokesman Ken Marston said.

[Various power outages were reported on Thanksgiving Day, when it was
stormy and windy in parts of the western U.S.  Many turkeys apparently
were left partly cooked during the outages.  PGN]

Criminal group made money by manipulating ...
COMTEX Newswire  25 Nov 1996

SARATOV, November 25 (Itar-Tass) -- A well-organised criminal group that
made more than 800 million roubles every month by manipulating computer
files in gambling has been exposed by police in the Saratov region, the
middle Volga.  A source in the regional directorate in charge of fighting
organised crime told Itar-Tass that computer-added swindling was exposed by
police for the first time in Russia, although crimes of this sort have been
reported in many regions of Russia.  The source described the technology of
fraud: the operator used a false file to influence the outcome of the
"cockroach races" in a way that ensured that the victory was won by the
cockroach chosen by the operator.  [Or perhaps the file was altered to
select the designated "winner"?  PGN]

The experience accumulated in the process reportedly will enable the law
enforcers in other regions of Russia to take into account computer swindlers
who have escaped responsibility until now.  (The net take was about US$5,500
daily.)

Here's a verbatim quote from the Orchestra List, which is occupied by
musicians and conductors.  Apparently spelling correctors are getting
RISKier all the time.  Note that this was *automatic* spelling correction,
so apparently the user didn't even get a chance to override the incorrect
decision.

[Here is a frightening snippet from Microsoft's website I'm not sure I
understand the full implications of it, but I don't doubt that there are
risks involved.]

<A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/java/sdk/getstart/javac007.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/java/sdk/getstart/javac007.htm</A> :

Updating the Java Support on a User's Machine

If you are placing an applet that uses COM on an HTML page accessible from
the Internet, you must ensure that any users who encounter that page have a
version of the Java Support for Internet Explorer that fully supports
Java/COM integration.

To do this, you must insert the following tag on the HTML page
containing your applet (or on the introductory page of your Web site):

&lt;OBJECT
CLASSID="clsid:08B0E5C0-4FCB-11CF-AAA5-00401C608500"
CODEBASE="<A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/java/IE30Java.cab#Version=1">http://www.microsoft.com/java/IE30Java.cab#Version=1</A>,0,0,1"&gt;
&lt;/OBJECT&gt;

This tag causes the user's Internet Explorer to check the version of its
Java support. If the version installed on the user's machine is not
up-to-date,
Internet Explorer downloads the latest version of Java support from
<A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com">http://www.microsoft.com</A> and updates the user's machine.

- - - -

The potential risks are endless. Say I know of a security hole in a
specific version of IE, I can automatically get visitors to
my website to install it, then attack them through the hole.
Some questions:
Does it ask the user first ?
Can I force a  'down'grade, i.e., install an older version ?
What happens if the user uses two sites that require different versions?
Is the code signing strong? (i.e., stronger than MS's CD keys ?), can I
fake a CAB file?

I'm sure we're all increasingly aware of annoying unsolicited commercial
e-mail messages forced into our electronic inboxes.  But is this just the
tip of the iceberg?

A mass mailing recently ended up in my e-mail, promising e-mail marketing to
100,000 or 1,000,000 people for $195 or $995 respectively.  Ominously, the
message did not have a valid "From:" address in the header, and was passed
through at least two servers before being distributed to an undisclosed list
of recipients.  Does a $100 InterNIC registration and $15/month ISP charge
now give anyone the ability to saturate the Internet community with
unsolicited e-mail?

Besides carefully screening incoming e-mail, what recourse does one have
against acts of e-mail terrorism?  With many SMTP e-mail servers readily
accepting mail from anonymous senders, how can we stop the constant stream
of unsolicited commercial e-mail being forced down our throats?  This trend
gravely concerns me, as it should concern us all!

Last week I was unable to use my cash card to pay for my groceries at the
local grocery store because the system wasn't working. The November 28, 1996
business section of the Albuquerque Tribune explained why:

"ATMs zapped: First Security's Albuquerque-area automated teller machines
and electronic funds-transfer stations at Smith's Food &amp; Drug Stores went on
the blink last weekend when a new cellular-telephone company started service
using a microwave frequency that bled over to First Security's ATM and EFT
frequency. Service disruptions forced Smith's to shun electronic purchases
Saturday through Monday. "We apologize to our customers who were
inconvenienced and are working hard to fix the problem, but the problem of
jammed frequencies is just going to get worse," said Paul Bouschelle,
executive vice president for First Security Bank of New Mexico."

Two obvious RISKs revealed by this incident:

1. The unintended and unexpected problems caused by bringing
a new system on-line. For whatever reasons, this problem
took the whole weekend to resolve.

2. This article also reveals that the ATMs and EFT terminals
communicate over microwave frequencies, and are thus
subject to being tapped or monitored, perhaps more easily
than if they were connected via wire or telephone lines.
I guess I've assumed that most of these terminals were
handled via phone line, which seems inherently more
secure than a radio link. This may not be true. I don't
recall much discussion in this group of the risks of
using radio links vs. wire for financial data transfer.

Your electronic wallet in the Van Allen radiation belt, or
Electronic commerce at RISK in space?

Jean-Jacques Quisquater
UCL Crypto Group - Microelectronics Lab
November 30, 1996

[Note: This short remark was intended as a contribution to the rump session
of EUROCRYPT '97 but the subject is too hot to wait.]

&gt;From end September until now many announcements were issued about the
so-called Bellcore attack against tamper-resistant chips (example: smartcard
or chipcard for electronic commerce). The attack is based on the
(theoretical) possibility of flipping some bits (at some random position) of
the secret key, stored in RAM or E2PROM, before or during the computations
done by the chip.  Another attack is to induce some decoding error during
the execution of one instruction (Anderson and Kuhn).

One crucial question is the effectiveness of such attacks by malicious
hackers.  In fact, this problem was very well studied in the contexts of
nuclear physics and of space applications (what about the behavior of
semiconductors in such hard environments?). In that area, there is the
concept of SEE (Single Event Effect) and it is what we are trying to study!
A SEE is an event induced by radiation, temperature, microwave, ..., having
some effect one time on a device.  There are many studies about that. What
we need to know are the SEEs
--- relatively well focused (one or few bits are flipped),
--- and/or at a given moment,
--- and/or for a very short time.

Here are some references to begin the study. The reference newsgroup is

Workshop on Human Error and Systems Development
The Senate Room, University of Glasgow
20-22 March 1997
Co-chairs: Nancy Leveson and Chris Johnson
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~johnson/HF_Engineering.html">http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~johnson/HF_Engineering.html</A>&gt;

Recent accidents in a range of industries have increased concern over the
management and control of safety-critical systems.  Much recent attention
has focussed upon the role of human error both in the development and in the
operation of complex processes.  This workshop will, therefore, provide a
forum for practitioners and researchers to discuss leading edge techniques
that can be used to mitigate the impact of human error on safety-critical
systems.

Our intention is to focus the workshop upon techniques that can be easily
integrated into existing systems engineering practices.  With this in mind,
each day will have a different theme.  The session on Thursday 20th March
will focus on accident analysis and risk assessment techniques.  Friday,
21st will focus more narrowly upon interface and component design,
development, and testing.  We also encourage papers that cross these
boundaries.

Saturday 22nd March will provide the opportunity for informal discussion
about the issues raised during the workshop.  The day will be spent on the
Isle of Arran, off the west Coast of Scotland [not to be confused with
Aran].

Deadlines: Authors should submit extended abstracts to Chris Johnson, see
below, to arrive no later than January 17th, 1997.  [&lt;see http...&gt;]

*The Washington Post* (6 Dec 1896) reported that a radio and television
broadcast of the annual Army/Navy football game would be distributed to many
of the ships at sea in "encripted" form.  The signal would be used to boost
morale, although the encryption may ruin morale for the folks stationed at
NSA/DIA listening posts.  But perhaps the algorithm will be simple enough to
be part of the challenge for them.

Of course, the automatic word scanners are sure to light up when words like
"bomb" and "blitz" come over the air.

I wonder if they sign the broadcast with a digital signature to make sure an
authentic version reaches the troops?  Spoofed versions would be true info
warfare.  The enemy could ensure that both divisions would be demoralized
by feeding a doctored version to the winning side.  But then there is still
the RISKS of the Air Force, who are in the big-bomb delivery department.

[Incidentally, for non-U.S.-football devotees, a "bomb" is a long pass,
and a "blitz" is an extra-man defensive attack.  I suppose "getting
sacked" has multiple meanings in an Army-Navy game.  PGN]

On 30 Nov 1996, the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce Interac service was
victimized by its attempted software upgrade, affecting about half of all
would-be transactions across eastern Canada.  [Source: Debit card failure
angers customers, by Colin Freeze, Citizen Correspondent, The Ottawa
Citizen, 2 December 1996, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.  PGN Stark Abstracting]

One business affected was Loblaw's, a grocery chain.  Grocery stores do not
accept credit cards.  (My wife Ann says it may a provincial law.)  I can
just see someone with a cartful of groceries arriving at the checkout and
being asked for cash they are not carrying.

As of 1 p.m. EST, 2 Dec 1996, the local branch of the bank had no statement
to give to customers!  Will this be touted as another example of computer
people living outside the real world, where shopping is at a peak on
Saturday afternoons, especially near Christmas?

Software hunts and kills Net viruses

VIRUS-KILLING computer software that uses artificial intelligence to find
and destroy new viruses is to be set loose on the Internet by IBM next week.
The software, originally developed to play backgammon, will spread itself
through the Net over the next year, learning how to kill new strains of
virus as it goes.  According to Gregory Sorkin, a researcher at IBM's Watson
research laboratory, the system will be far more successful than humans at
fighting computer viruses.  "Once it learns the viruses already out there,
the system will even be able to predict what new viruses will appear, and
work out ways of stopping them before they even exist," says Sorkin.  The
system uses temporal difference, a method which relies on the computer
looking for patterns within virus software, rather than individual lines of
program code.

If I understand it correctly, this is software that will spread itself on
the net, adapt itself, and destroy other things on the net.

How can something like this be tested?  How can we be sure that the
technology behind it will not be used to create the next generation of
viruses?  I find this scary.

Today I attended a meeting in a large office building of a Major
Computer Company.  As I entered the conference room, the organizer of
the meeting was trying to find a way to lower the projection screen
from its storage place in the ceiling.  There was no cord attached, so
he was searching for a switch for the screen's motor.

On the wall next to the door was a push-button switch, brightly
backlit in red, with a hand-written sign that read, "Don't touch this
switch."  (Also scribbled on the sign, in another hand, was "Don't
touch" in Spanish.)  The organizer seemed to think this might control
the screen, so he pressed the button.  Needless to say, the screen did
not descend.  The ventilation fans went off, though.

Several minutes later, a fellow poked his head in the door and asked,
"Did someone touch that switch?"  [Just like in a cartoon, isn't it?]
"Yes," the organizer said, "we were trying to get the screen down."

"Don't touch the switch," said the man in the door, "It turns off the
computer room next door."

The conference room was evidently once part of a raised-floor machine room,
and the Emergency Power Off switch next to the door is still active.

The RISKS, I submit, are too obvious to list.

National Public Radio reports that a blown fuse took out a large portion of
Iowa's 911 emergency phone system for three hours over the Thanksgiving
weekend.  U.S. West could not say how many 911 calls went unanswered.  A
spokesperson said that the troubles isolating the problem came from the
complexity of the system.  The RISKS are pretty evident.

I heard from a friend a detailed account of an apparent content substitution
attack on his corporate web server that highlights a couple of risks.  With
his permission I have summarised the order of events:

- A few days ago, a sales person employed by the company reported a
pornographic image had replaced the corporate logo on the main page.

- A correct logo was downloaded to the server within minutes, but
before saving the existing image, thus erasing the evidence.

- Research showed a known defect in the operating system code that
can be exploited to yield root access by remote users.  Tests showed
that the firewall and web server were vulnerable.  Patches were
obtained and installed to remove the vulnerability.  Much effort.

- Conflicting data from logs appeared.  The web server logs showed
that the image had not been replaced.  Firewall logs agreed.  Web
proxy server logs claimed otherwise.

- The pornographic image was found in the web proxy server cache,
with a different URL, using a search by file size, and the logs
confirmed that it had been viewed by users within the company.

- No evidence was found to prove that a break-in had occurred.

The staff deduced that the web proxy server had somehow mixed the pointers
to the cached images, and had returned the incorrect image to the internal
users.  No reports were received from Internet users.

Risk: a web proxy server may change your view of the Internet, and may cause
you to waste considerable time tracing a break-in that didn't happen.

Risk: allowing staff full access to the web increases the chances of a file
mixup causing disturbance.

Also, there were no controls to ensure that CERT notifications were integrated
into the firewall configuration.  It took a suspected break-in before a search
was made for vulnerabilities.

My daughter has a few multi-media-type CD-ROM games, and they are to various
degrees cute / cuddly / talkative / friendly.  The most talkative and
friendly one has one very annoying and counterproductive habit.  In the
find-the-hidden-objects puzzle, the little voices on the speakers say happy
/ reassuring things every time you click the mouse on a place where there's
no hidden object.  "Try again!"  "Nope, not there!" and so on.  The
encouraging phrases are as far as I can tell picked at random.
Unfortunately, some of them have *semantics* beyond just "Try again".

The most annoying ones are "Ooh, not quite!" and "You're getting closer!".
Because they're generated just at random, the voices can say "Ooh, not
quite!" when the player is clicking as far as possible from the target, and
can say "You're getting closer!" when in fact you're getting further away.
My daughter learned to ignore the semantics of these messages very quickly
(the plasticity of youth), but when looking over her shoulder I still find
them annoying and misleading, and have to remind myself that they're
meaningless.

The general tendency, the risk category, is a familiar and important one:
computers that talk seem from the outside to know what they're saying,
whereas the people who've made them talk may not really have thought it
through at all, and the programs themselves can be arbitrarily stupid.

(Another similar program will say encouraging things like "Your eyes are as
sharp as the eagle's" when the child finally gets all the rolling targets in
the archery game, even if the player is far beyond the age-appropriate
difficulty level, and has been struggling for many minutes to hit each one.
Another, related, risk that reaches far beyond computers: overgenerous
praise...)

Dealing rooms sabotaged by HK Reuters technician
By Nicholas Denton in London and John Ridding in Hong Kong, 29 Nov 1996
Financial Times Limited

A disgruntled computer technician at Reuters in Hong Kong has caused the
financial-information provider deep embarrassment by sabotaging the
dealing-room systems of five of the company's investment bank clients.
The attack crippled for up to 36 hours the computer systems bringing
market prices and news to traders at NatWest Markets, Jardine Fleming,
Standard Chartered, and two other banks.  The banks, which resorted to
alternative terminals such as Bloomberg, claimed the tampering had no
significant impact on trading and said neither they nor their clients had
experienced losses as a result.

The incident was reportedly the most serious breach of security disclosed in
Reuters' corporate history, and is causing some rethinking of privileges.
The maintenance engineer in question has been suspended.  He apparently
visited the client sites and initiated deferred commands to subsequently
delete specific operating system files.

I've been thinking a lot about (web) cookies lately.  One of the problem
with the current situation is that you basically have two choices with the
User Interface that both Netscape and Microsoft have created for your
browsers:

1. You can simply accept all cookies.
2. You can have your browser warn you every time a cookie is sent
your way and have the option of accepting it or not.

A cookie, for those not in he know, is a little tarball of data that gets
sent to your browser. Cookies can be used to track users, by keying their
browsers to a database. Or they can be used to preserve privacy, by storing
private information on the user's browser, rather than on the web server.

Right now, a cookie gets sent to your browser whenever you get an HTTP
response with the words "Set-Cookie:" in the header. After that, whenever
you contact the web site, you send the cookie back.

It seems to me that an excellent way to deal with the cookie problem would
be to have more user interface options:

* Simply do not accept cookies.
* Specify who you will accept cookies from, and who not.
* Accept cookies, but do not send them back.
* Have a decent user interface to show which cookies you have and how
often they are used. Let you delete them individually, rather than just
all or nothing.

I've written more about cookies in an upcoming article for HotWired. It will
appear at <A HREF="http://www.packet.com/garfinkel">http://www.packet.com/garfinkel</A> on Wednesday, 11 Nov 1996.

Unless especial pains are taken, 16-bit MS-Acess runtime disks made on a
Windows-95 machine with 16-bit Access will cause near-irreparable harm when
installed on a WFW or Windows 3.1 machine.  The reason is that some 32-bit
system .DLLs are copied to the distribution diskettes (or network
distribution set) along with the 16-bit files, and because the 32-bit files
have the same names as the 16-bit files, the 16-bit platform no longer works
properly.  I'm told the official Microsoft paper on the subject says to
format the hard drive and re-install everything.  I was able to "recover" by
upgrading to Windows-95; others have had success ferreting out the specific
files and replacing them.  Reinstalling WFW didn't fix anything.

January 1996 was a snowy month in Virginia.  We were hammered by a storm on
the 6th that dropped about two feet of snow, and closed everything (that
wasn't already closed) for a couple of days, followed by another storm on
the 12th that gave us another 8 or 10 inches.

So that Friday (12th), I spend most of the afternoon shoveling out my
driveway.  Then, remembering that I needed to buy a book to prepare for some
computer work that weekend, I called my favorite technical bookstore to see
if, by some chance, they might be open that night.  (I didn't really expect
them to be open, but it was worth a try...)

Sure enough, someone answered, so I asked how late they would be open.
"Nine o'clock," was the answer.  I confirmed the closing time, perhaps still
not really believing they'd be open, then drove my 4WD truck about 15 miles
on snowy roads to get there.  But when I arrived around 8:00pm, the store
was quite obviously closed.

That evening I sent off a letter of protest to the store management, who
responded the following Monday that the *Virginia* store had been closed all
day because of the heavy snow, and they'd forwarded the phones over to one
of their California stores.

[[Note: while the Swedish translations I send to RISKS are usually from
*Svenska Dagbladet*, one of the two "newspapers of record," this is from an
evening tabloid, and should be understood as such. If you imagine my other
translations as originating from *The New York Times* or *Daily Telegraph*,
think of this as from the *New York Post* or *Evening Standard*.  I've tried
to be both accurate and true to the tone of the article.  I've translated a
bit more than 50% of the article, but omitted the sidebars listing recent
air accidents. Swedish typographic conventions make it difficult to
precisely mark quotations, and I apologize for any errors.]]

The advanced computer systems developed to improve flight safety have become
a death trap. "Pilots can no longer keep track of everything," says Per-Olof
Sk=F6ld, president of the Swedish pilot's organization.  [[In bold-face on
the web page.]]

"We've discussed this problem on several occasions. The critical point is
when the computer system should be disconnected; when the pilot stops being
a passive monitor of the system and becomes an active operator," says
Sven-Eric Sigfridsoson of the national air accident commission.

The new advanced technology in airplanes was developed by technicians and
engineers. They're the ones who test-fly the system before the plane is put
into traffic.

"These things were designed by engineers and technicians are not always
pilot-friendly. Today there are several automatic sequences that pilots can
never keep track of," says Per-Olof Sk=F6ld. ... The pilot's nightmare
scenario is that the technology will get even more advanced.

That's what the technicians want.

Several years ago, a local long distance carrier began a program offering
one frequent flier mile for each minute of long distance calling. My sister
signed up for the program, but later moved and disconnected that particular
phone line.

However, recently she began receiving program statements again. It seems
that number has been reissued, and the new owners have this long distance
carrier, but have NOT signed up for the "Mile-A-Minute" program.

When reassigning a number, all features should have been reset to their
defaults.  In this case, they were obviously not.  The total 'cash' value
(at $.03 per mile) of the error is not very significant.  A more serious
risk is that my sister receives a detailed billing report every month,
listing the number called and the call duration for each qualifying
number. It is sent to the address listed on her frequent flier account, and
not to the billing address of the new owners of the line.

Today, I had my first encounter with the year 2000 problem. I took my shiny
new, already activated, Visa cheque card into Citibank, Manhattan branch and
after inserting the card into the validation machine the teller told me my
card had expired. My expiry date is 01/00.  A few moments later I had
successfully convinced that teller that the card couldn't have been issued
in the 1800's and so he phoned a verification service to check. That service
also declined the card. It wasn't until I had called my own bank and asked
them to turn off all security checks on the card that I could successfully
obtain my cash advance.

I had earlier dismissed all the hype surrounding the year 2000 problem
thinking that most corporations would have already made the necessary
changes to cope. Considering it's typical for cards to be issued for 4 year
periods it's not surprising to see a card issued in 1996 suffering this
problem. I can only hope things improve as we approach 2000.

A few months back, I was shopping at a Computer City, a large chain of PC
stores of the sort that caters to the mass market.  When I got to the front
of the checkout line (which is normally slow to begin with), things came to
a halt.  Apparently, all transactions were handled by computer, and it was
down.

OK, I thought they've got a backup in the back, and it'll kick in, or the
thing will reboot.  No good.  After awhile, one of the clerks reported that
the computer that was down was in LA (I was in San Diego).  All their
transactions were being handled remotely, and for all the computers and
manpower they had locally, they couldn't do anything but wait.

Later still, someone came back up front with a book describing how to do
checkouts manually.  None of the clerks knew.  When I was checked out, it
took four people, one to be in charge, one to use the calculator to compute
tax and total, one to verify my credit card, and one to read the instruction
book.

I was struck by two ironic facets of all this.  First, the reliance upon
centralized computers.  The PC got its big start and popularity run
initially by allowing independent computer use away from centralized MIS
departments.  Have things come full circle again, away from independent
computers to centralized ones?  It would not have been unreasonable for a
computer seller to have an extra backup computer in back, something to
process transactions locally and then transmit them remotely later.  Perhaps
the risk here is forgetting history (not to stereotype too blatantly, but I
see a distinct lack of historical computer knowledge in much of industry).

The second facet is the old risk of becoming too dependent upon technology.
Requiring four people to check out one small purchase is excessive, and all
because none were trained to do such things manually (not to stereotype too
much again, but they didn't seem to be trained that well in computers either
:-).  On the other hand, I can go into grocery stores and have the checkers
rapidly process a large purchase, knowing the price of each item; I've had
other stores take only one person to fill out receipts by hand when power
was out.  Why would a computer store be so crippled by a remote computer
being down, were they even more dependent upon technology than other stores?

This was not a complete outage, but about 60% of the Bell Atlantic company's
2,000 operator's at 36 sites could not log into their automated directory
system. Of the 40% that were able to access the database, lookup times went
from the typical 19 seconds into minutes. The problem manifested itself
about 8am on Monday November 25th, and was fixed about seven hours later by
reloading the previous version of the database software. But this was the
most extensive directory-assistance failure since telephone operators
started using computers, affecting hundreds of thousands of customers in
nine eastern states.

Originally Bell Atlantic blamed the problem on a "software glitch" in the
"Nortel Directory One" database software upgraded over the weekend. Northern
Telecom stated that the new software, which was meant to correct minor
errors in the previous version, was being used by several large phone
companies without any problems.  The problem seems to have been traced to a
Nortel technician who improperly installed the software on two RS/6000
servers. The incorrect installation of the main database, also somehow
caused the same type of access problems on the duplicate/backup database
system.

While RISKS has concentrated on software errors, installing software into
operating systems has gotten increasingly complex, usually done by
non-degreed technicians and operators, following informal instructions
scrawled on the back of napkins. In this case it seems that since the
malfunction was load related, the technician was unaware during system
checkout that the database was incorrectly installed. More scrutiny should
be given to software installation, and installation procedures or possible
problems. Formal procedures with Quality Assurance (QA) checklists should be
used. Could automated installation programs, or problem checking software,
be used to prevent or detect installation problems?

[from *Stars &amp; Stripes*, 7 Dec 1996, a daily newspaper for military and such
overseas.  Excerpted by DWW.]

A soldier is under investigation after allegedly transferring more than a
half-million dollars into his checking account from his savings account. The
problem was, it wasn't his money.  On 29 Nov 1996, he unsuccessfully
attempted to withdraw money from his overdrawn accounts. Then he conducted a
transfer of 600,000.21 from his savings to his checking account at an ATM
(banks were closed for the day after Thanksgiving). Because of a defect in
the ATM computer system, the transfer was completed without verification of
whether funds were available in the soldier's account.  Over the next few
days, the soldier was able to withdraw $300 in cash and deposited $30,005
into a newly opened credit union savings/money market account. On 2 Dec he
attempted to wire $60,000.15 to California. Officials noticed the error and
stopped the transaction.  The soldier was apprehended, but has not been
charged and is not in custody.

A spokeswoman for the bank said the incident was the result of a one-time
glitch in the bank's computer system.  An anonymous customer service
representative said there have been problems with the bank's computer
accounting system since 8 Nov 1996 - the day the data from Bank A was
converted to Bank B [the military awards banking contracts for a limited
time. They have problems at every change-over, it seems.] "From that point
on, we've just been trying to fix messes," the bank employee said, noting
that the problems range from lost data to false duplication.

[I wonder if the "uneven" amounts contributed to the mess, or if it
was a foul-up in general. - dww]

A Brooklyn federal jury awarded nearly $6 million to three women who had
sustained arm, wrist, and hand injuries apparently resulting from use of a
Digital LK201 keyboard: $5.3m to Patricia Gerassy, $306,000 to Jill Jackson,
and $278,000 to Jeanette Rotolo.  This is the first such case in which the
computer manufacturer lost.  Earlier cases involved Compaq and IBM.  Digital
will appeal.  [Source: Diana B. Henriques in *The New York Times*, 10 Dec

[Many years ago my keyboard had a very rough touch that caused severe
pain in the little finger of my left hand (the *emacs* finger).  I had two
foot pedals installed for the control and meta keys, and the problem went
away.  It also helped my organ-playing technique, speaking of manual
systems.  But, clearly it is good advice that you should not sit at your
keyboard for long unbroken sessions.  Unfortunately, I don't take my own
advice enough.]

The latest (free) beta release for linux of the adobe acrobat .pdf reader
from adobe contains an interesting risk-enhancing feature, according to its
documentation.

from MapTypes.pdf:

If the file cannot be opened as a PDF file, the viewer
examines the UNIX file permissions.  If the file can be executed by the
*********************************
user who launched Acrobat Reader or Exchange, the viewer attempts to
*******************************************************************
launch the file as an application.  If the file cannot be launched as an
*********************************
application, the viewer returns an error message.

The risk - of death by execution - is obvious. I have to admit I haven't
had time to try it. I suspect I am the only person in some radius to have
time to read the documentation! I report this to you as I find it.

I've noticed increasingly that a lot of system administrators have placed
an incredible reliance in "out of the box" security products (firewalls etc) .

These products tend to provide a fair degree of auditing and it seems that
quite a few administrators don't understand what it really all means.  I get
the impression that the response is a typical "Quick, call Chuck, we've got
a situation down here!" every time a message is logged.  (Why would these
security products log messages if it wasn't a threat?)

The first example is when a friend in Luxemburg e-mailed me saying that he
had a new job and this was his e-mail address. He doesn't know too much
about computers and asked me how I could chat to him. I asked if he was on a
Unix machine, and if he had chat, we could use that. He said that he thought
it was a Unix but wasn't sure - as a quick check I just telnetted quickly to
his site and pressed ctrl-D as most machines tell what OS they are as a
login message. The machine was TCP wrapped, but answered SunOS anyway. I
guess I could have used another method to find out (nslookup etc) but this
was quick &amp; simple. It turns out that the machine was the helpdesk for a
major bank of sorts - the connection spawned a return finger @mymachine -
which answers for a group of local machines.  It told them that five people
were currently logged on to a bunch of local machines.

The log should have been read as "You had a connection attempt on port 23
which was denied - it _may_ have come from any of these five users.."

Apparently the bank admins freaked - supposedly they had forgotten the root
password the day before and read the log as something like "you have five
people simultaneously breaking in to your machine from a variety of places;
machine1.au , machine2.au , ...". They admins freaked and ran around the
bank looking for Australians working there.  They then waved logs in their
face and asked them if they knew any of these people - any why they would be
using all these accounts trying to break in.  My friend called frantically
from Belgium at 1am in the morning and had to send me the log so I could
explain what it meant. Sheesh.

Another quick example comes from the fact I am the technical administrator
for xxxx.com. We all know that spamming is on the rise - and it seems
xxxx.com is an ideal choice as a fake source domain as it is a fairly
generic sounding name.  The risk is where admins who wish to stop the
spamming then go ahead and bar or send complaints to <A HREF="mailto:postmaster@xxxx.com">postmaster@xxxx.com</A>
asking for the spamming to stop - when if anyone read the header properly
would see it sure didn't come from the real xxxx.com. I've even had TOSEmail
at AOL send complaints - aren't these guys meant to be experienced admins?
Surely aol receives more than their fair share of spamming - these people
should know what they're on about by now. I know places like cybervalue.net
are having the same sort of problems.

The January 1997 issue of "Dr. Dobbs Journal" has an article in which the
author reports that his software simulation of the automatic baggage
handling system of the Denver airport mimicked the real-life situation.

In his conclusion, he notes that the consultants did perform a similar
simulation and had recommended against the installation of the system
currently in place. The city, however, overruled the consultant's report
(the contractors who were building the system never did see the report) and
gave the go-ahead.

A field service engineer for a major computer company relates the following
recent true story:

One day, he was working in a government office, when the police arrived with
a search warrant.  They asked, "which desk does Mr. X work at ?".  On being
shown the desk, they proceeded to remove the Macintosh from the desk and
took it away with them.  Mr. X was not there to protest, having been
incarcerated that morning on charges of forging identity papers using
PageMaker, a Macintosh, and a high-quality color laser printer.

As the police left, everyone burst out laughing, not least at the thought
that almost all the tools Mr. X was using (software and data files stored on
the server downstairs, networked printer in the next-door office) were still
sitting in the office.  I don't know if anything incriminating was ever
found on "his" Macintosh; perhaps he'll be found guilty of nothing more
serious than possession of an unlicensed copy of AfterDark.

The RISKS?  Well, apparently it's getting worthwhile (but not _perfectly_
so !) to forge official documents at work, on company time, using
taxpayer-funded high-quality printing tools; and secondly, of course, law
enforcement has a way to go in its understanding of how technology works,
but then I think we might already have suspected that.

above.  There ensued a lengthy discussion between Martin, myself, and Danny
Kohn in Sweden, about the null-, whole-, or half-truth of most of the
assertions.  Of the 11 assertional sentences contained in Martin's quote, I
found 10 of them misleading or false.  Including, especially, the title. PGN
suggested I *briefly* summarise the discussion.  Faint hope.

I would argue:
(a) against sensationalism and for precision;
(b) against the common habit of picking on one of many contributory causal
factors and calling it *the cause*;
(c) for a classification of problems into computer-per-se/requirements/HCI;
(d) against the assumption that even if computer behavior is directly
causally involved, the *type* of error must be a computer error
(I myself was disabused of this notion by Mary Shafer).

Martin would agree with me on (a) and (b), worries that the classification
proposed in (c) may lead one to miss some important aspects of system
failure, and is prepared to consider (d): he was struck by the similarity
many of the (pre-heavy-automation) accidents discussed by Perrow (`Normal
Accidents') bear to the (potentially computer-related) accidents we
discussed.  Martin went to some trouble to distance himself from the views
expressed in the article.

Martin would also like to point out that he has absolutely no training or
competence in aircraft-safety and thus cannot judge the accuracy of the
article, but definitely distances himself from the sensationalistic
"death-trap" tone of the writing.

On the other hand, Danny thinks it is `fully correct', and cites Reason's
book on `Human Error'.  He considered some military aviation accidents, such
as the two accidents with the Gripen fighter (I agree with the official
position that these were control-system design problems, not computer
problems per se). I also separate military aviation concerns from commercial
aviation.  Two cheers for diversity, I guess. But just in case the gentle
reader doesn't believe in diversity, here's my view on journalistic
sloppiness.

The Aftonbladet article suggested that new-technology airplanes are
death-traps (the statistics actually show that they have a far better
accident rate per departure than older-technology airplanes or even
wide-bodies); claimed that `technicians and engineers' are the people who
test-fly the aircraft (patently absurd. In any case, pilots are very
involved in the cockpit design of all new transports); and also seemed to be
restricting its comments to the autopilot ("The critical point is when the
computer system should be disconnected" - you'd hardly want to disconnect
your control system, or your navigation information system, or your air data
system, even were it to be possible).

The article apparently cited four accidents to justify its claim: AA,
Cali 1995; Lauda Air, Thailand, 1991; Gottro"ra (SE), 1990; Svalbard
(SE) 1996. I consider these briefly. (Thanks to Martin for translations.
He warns they're a little dog-eared, but I don't think this affects my points.)

Cali: "The accident investigation concluded that the contact between the
pilot and computer system broke down [failed]."

None of the conclusions said any such thing. Readers may check the report
for themselves in `Computer-Related Incidents with Commercial Airplanes' at
<A HREF="http://www.rvs.uni-bielefeld.de">http://www.rvs.uni-bielefeld.de</A>
(This is not to deny the serious HCI issues that arose.)

Bangkok: "A computer error that caused one of the plane's engines to
reverse could have caused the accident, concluded the investigation."

It is not possible for a `computer error' alone to cause an in-flight thrust
reverse on a B767. As I understand it, there is a hydraulic interlock which
prevents this. It was determined in tests that there exists a failure mode
of this interlock on high-time engines. No potential explanation other than
(interlock failure *plus* pilot-uncommanded in-flight thrust-reverse
request) has been found.  No probable cause was determined.

Gottro"ra: "Both motors broke up. One of the better supported
theories about the cause was problems in the computer system. The
throttle [?] in one of the motors stopped working. The computer
ran the other motor at full power and destroyed it completely."

It is my understanding that no probable cause was determined.  Danny pointed
out that this is a hot example amongst pilots in Sweden at the
moment. However, I would caution against `theory' which supposes computers
are the modern form of gremlins. A synopsis of a PhD thesis on this accident
may be found at
<A HREF="http://info.admin.kth.se/info/pressmeddelanden/1995/0517-1.html">http://info.admin.kth.se/info/pressmeddelanden/1995/0517-1.html</A>
This Swedish press-release was an invitation to Dr. Martensson's
doctoral thesis defense.

Svalbard: "[..] a Russian passenger plane flew straight into a mountain
[..] The accident cause is unclear, but there is a suspicion
that the computer system broke."

They said it themselves: the cause is unclear.

Does anyone actually know of *any* accident to a commercial airplane
in which some sort of `computer error' is cited as the probable cause?
Example and direct quotes, please. Caveat: `probable cause' and
`contributing factor' are semi-technical terms.

There are two small errors that should be corrected in my item in
<A HREF="/Risks/18.65.html">RISKS-18.65</A>:

1. The correct URL for the Aftonbladet article is
<A HREF="http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/dec/06/flyg.html">http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/dec/06/flyg.html</A>
"aftonbladed" -&gt; "aftonbladet" .  As always, note that
newspaper archives may not be kept for a long time.

2. The article title, "Computer errors cause several plane crashes" would
be better translated as "computer errors a cause of several plane
crashes." My translation made a sensationalistic Swedish article
rather more sensationalistic than necessary.

There is an important "risk" here -- that technically sophisticated readers
should avoid giving excessive weight to specific terms appearing in the
popular press. Journalists often use "terms of art" without the precision
and accuracy expected of scientific writing. In this case, readers must also
understand that terms are translated from English to Swedish to
popular-press Swedish and back to English, and have probably lost much of
the subtlety and gradation of the original.

Mitch Kabay quotes Reuters quoting Michael Bagshaw, head of aviation
medical services at British Airways, in an address to the Royal Society:

&gt;	"If we examine the accident rate by type of aircraft, it
&gt;	can be seen that although the overall trend is down ... new
&gt;	highly-automated types have a relatively higher accident rate."

Such statements need careful qualification. Boeing produces a statistical
report on worldwide aviation accidents each year, from 1959-[present year].
My 1995 copy (courtesy of Pete Mellor) divides fatal accidents worldwide
into three classes: Second generation (B727, Trident, VC-10, BAC 111,
DC9, B737-100/200, F28), Widebody (B747-100/200/300, DC10, L1011, A300),
and `New' (MD80/90, MD11, B737-300/400/500, B747-400, B757, B767, B777,
A300-600, A310, A320/A321, A330, A340, BAe146, F100). The annual rate
of fatal accidents per million departures since 1983 is in all years
lower than that of either second-generation or widebodies, except for
1988, 1994 and 1995, when widebodies had 0 and new types non-zero rates.
The new types are all `glass cockpit' aircraft of the sort to which Dr.
Bagshaw's comments are relevant.

So what can Dr. Bagshaw's comment as reported by Reuters be referring
to? Maybe a different measurement. One that may seem prima facie
reasonable is passenger deaths per passenger-mile. However, this
measurement can be misleading, because 91.2% of fatal accidents occur
in the takeoff or landing phases of flight, and only 8.2% in
cruise. The widebodies spend most of their miles in cruise, and the
new types are mostly short-haul aircraft which may only spend an hour
to two hours in flight - similar to the second generation, whose
accident statistics overall are worse. The different characteristics
of airplane use could be reflected in the standard deviation: the
figures, rounded to whole numbers, for widebodies from 85-95 are 1, 0,
1, 0, 3, 1, 2, 5, 1, 0, 0. Those for new types, rounded, are 0, 0,
then all 1's. Those for second generation are 1, 1, 1, then higher
than new's but less than 2, except for 94 (2). But these statistics
do not reflect the vast differences in `safety cultures' across the
world's airlines. These differences can be large enough that the
US prohibits aircraft operated by airlines in certain countries from
flying into the US - and this system may be extended to Europe.

So, on these measures, the `new technology' aircraft seem to be safer
overall than other types. Dr. Bagshaw's measurements lead him to a
different conclusion. The moral is: beware of facile quotation of statistics.

Dr. Bagshaw's comments on human factors are pertinent, and in fact
justifiable independently of statistics.  His comments focus on the
cognitive capabilities of pilots, as `information processors'. Such a
view lies behind much current research in aviation human factors. And
there have been some recent accidents which have focused attention on
the pilot's awareness of the system state and its proper functioning:
A320, Bangalore 1990; A320, Warsaw 1993; A300-600, Nagoya 1994; B757,
Cali 1995; B757, Puerto Plata 1996. The reason for this attention is
that these new systems allow failure modes (such as pilot's faulty
awareness of system state) that simply didn't exist in older
aircraft. Thus we need to pay attention to these problems and solve
them, no matter what comparative accident rates are.

Solving such problems will, of course, affect accident rates, no matter
how measured. Airline accident rates (pick your measure) are the lowest
in history, but they do not appear to be going down. To bring this down,
it is reasonable to suppose that research and new techniques will be
needed. And since nearly 60% of fatal accidents worldwide are primarily
due to flightcrew behavior (Boeing again, 1985-95), human factors issues
must form a major part of this program. There are two aspects to this:
establishing expectations of flight crew; and ensuring these
expectations are met. The first is the focus of Dr. Bagshaw's comments:
what can we reasonably expect from flight crew? The second is the business
of appropriate and thorough training (that `safety culture' again).

To summarise: it is appropriate, and appears to be necessary, to focus
on human factors to reduce the rate of airline accidents (however
measured).  Recent accidents with `new technology' have uncovered
human factors issues that could not arise with older-generation
aircraft. These new issues must therefore be addressed.  However, I am
not aware that accident rates as currently measured and analysed
enable us to judge whether `new technology' aircraft are inherently
`safer' or `less safe' than either second-generation or widebody
aircraft (in Boeing's classification). They're `differently safe'.

Why didn't the original sign state "Emergency Power Shutoff"?  Who would
casually press a button so labeled, especially in the offices of a "Major
Computer Company."

Instead of being a bunch of dumb sheep, let's think about this situation.
(There's a lot of computer hardware and software which commits the same sin,
after all.)  _Why_ would "MCC" leave that switch in place, since it has
obviously caused them much grief in the past?

The answer, of course, is it's an important piece of safety equipment.
Computer rooms need emergency power shutoffs, and for those shutoffs to be
useful in an emergency they can't be in the computer room itself.  As I
vaguely recall building codes won't even allow them in the doorway of the
computer room; there has to be at least a doorway between the cutoff switch
and the heavy electrical wiring.

Yet this important piece of safety equipment is effectively useless (and
actually slightly harmful) since someone posted a paternalistic "do not
touch" sign instead of posting a sign explaining the purpose of the switch.

It would be too much to suggest that we have a professional duty to press
every unlabeled red button we encounter, but the problem in this auditorium
isn't the emergency power cutoff switch or the hard-to-find screen controls.
It's the paternalistic author who thinks most people can't be trusted to
know not to touch the cut-off switch if they know what it is -- and that
they can't be trusted to know when it _is_ important to use it.

This is not a computer risk; it is the even more common human risk of people
who seem to think that signs, lights, guide ropes, barricades, etc., apply
to everyone but them.  There is no way to design around such attitudes other
than removing all potentially dangerous articles from their reach.  Like
child-proofing. :-)

[As I have noted in the past, our forum deals with COMPUTER-RELATED RISKS
(not coincidentally, the title of my book).  Unfortunately, a lot of
events that seem not to be computer risks are computer-related risks.
When your computer wipes out, for whatever reason, that is certainly
relevant here.  People-tolerant systems is still a good research area. PGN]
