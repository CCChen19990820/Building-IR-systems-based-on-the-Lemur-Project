<b>Newsbriefs.</b>  John P. Sevastos, DO, became the AOA's 99th president 
on July 21, and Howard M. Levine, DO, became the AOA's president-elect.<p>

<b>New AOA president urges DOs to be accountable.</b>  In his inaugural address, John P. Sevastos, DO, insists that the osteopathic medical 
profession must be accountable to patients and to state and federal 
officials.<p>

<b>Osteopathic medicine runs wild at 100th Boston Marathon.</b>  Robert 
L. Shepler, DO, and Thomas Wesley Allen, DO, were among the approximately 
37,000 people who ran the Boston Marathon in April. In addition, the 
University of New England College of Osteopathic Medicine and the 
Maine Osteopathic Association used the marathon to educate the public 
about osteopathic medicine.<p>

<b>Next AOA education conference to focus on practical solutions.</b>  
The AOA's seventh annual leadership conference on osteopathic medical 
education will examine examples of how medical education programs have 
been modified to meet the needs of the changing healthcare environment.<p>


<b>Retraining for a new era.</b>  In response to changes in healthcare 
economics, some specialists are becoming generalists. While internal 
medicine subspecialists are making the transition to primary care by 
relying on their early training, other  specialists are retraining.<p>


<b>About-face.</b>  Now that it is strategically and economically wise to 
practice primary care, some physicians are trying to have their 
specialties reclassified as primary care fields. Among those physicians 
are obstetricians and gynecologists, specialists in osteopathic manipulative medicine, and emergency physicians.<p><br>

<h2><a name="abstract">CHAPTER ABSTRACT</a></h2>

<p>Chapter 1, like all the text chapters, is organized around a

series of numbered learning objectives.  These objectives also

provide the framework for the chapter summary statements and

correspond to similarly numbered sections in the Student Study

Guide, the Test Bank, and chapter abstracts in this Manual.</p>



<ol>

<li><b>Define marketing and explain its origins and contemporary

meanings.</b>  Chapter one introduces marketing and explains how it

is performed by individuals and many different types of organizations, businesses, and governments.  Marketing activities are

designed to satisfy consumers and meet organizational needs.  In

a business, this specifically means generating revenue and contributing to profitability.  Marketing had its origins in simple

barter.  Today, it is a highly sophisticated series of activities

designed to fill gaps in the marketplace and add value to

exchanges with consumers.  



<li><b>Identify the key foundation concepts of marketing. </b> The foundation concepts of marketing are exchange, products, sellers,

buyers, and satisfaction.  These are the central concepts that

help define marketing, direct research efforts, and guide applications.



<li><b>Explain why it is important to study marketing.</b>  It is important to study marketing because it is pervasive in our daily

lives and has powerful effects on individual consumers,

businesses, and society.  Many students find employment in a

variety of marketing careers.  Marketing is very important to

business profitability and it plays a role of growing

significance in establishing competitiveness domestically and

internationally.



<li><b>Discuss how and why marketing is evolving.</b>  Marketing has

evolved dramatically since the earliest days of simple barter. 

It continues to evolve as society changes.  Initially, marketing

was an individual activity.  Because of the Industrial

Revolution, it became oriented toward organizational activities. 

Dominant business operating philosophies have evolved from

production, product, and selling orientations, to the marketing

concept philosophy.  Some marketers now practice societal

marketing, where the good of society is a primary consideration

in how the business operates.



<li><b>Describe how marketers use the marketing mix variables to

satisfy consumers and achieve organizational goals.</b>  The chapter

concludes with an introduction to the 4 Ps, the marketing mix

variables of product, price, place, and promotion.  These are the

tools marketers use to add value to exchanges with consumers and

achieve their strategic goals.

</ol>



<h2><a name="teaching tips">SOME TEACHING TIPS</a></h2>



<p>These suggestions provide ideas for you to adapt to your

individual teaching situation.  They are  recommendations based

on methods that have worked for me or others.  Please change them

to suit your own needs, particularly your class length.  Class

lengths are variable.  Some are 45 minutes long, while others may

be 50, 60, 75, 90 minutes, or for an evening class, 150 minutes

or longer.  Class length will significantly affect how the class

is organized.</p>  



<p>Experience suggests that students are more interested when

the instructor varies teaching methods and uses interactive

activities as frequently as possible.  This includes asking

questions and getting students involved in the answers.  Many

different types of activities and methods are suggested in the

text and this Manual.  The challenge for the individual

instructor is to select the activities and methods that are most

effective for his or her particular class, then improve on them.</p>



<p>For the first teaching day of the term, establish a set of

expectations for the rest of the term.  For example, I emphasize

the importance of using the chapter objectives as a guide for

reading, studying, and learning.  I show a transparency of

questions based on the chapter objective statements for Chapter 1

(see PART III of this Manual).  Students should be able to answer

each of these questions by the time they have completed reading

Chapter 1.  To provide an added incentive, I explain that the

chapter statements often are used as quiz or examination

questions.</p> 



<p>Students are firmly reminded that assigned chapters must be

read by the assigned date, before the chapter is discussed in

class.  The goal is to get students to read the text and be

prepared to use the information in class so that you can use

class time more productively.  If you spend all of your class

time repeating the text, you are penalizing the students who have

read it and rewarding the students who have not done so.</P>



<p>To reinforce the importance of reading the text assignment

on time, assign one or more of the chapter learning objectives in

question form as homework, due on the day the chapter is

assigned.  Alternately, assign questions that require searching

for an answer within the chapter, information that is in a table

or box.  Assign questions from the end of chapter Discussion

Questions, Check Your Understanding, What Do You Think?, or a

chapter Mini-Case.  This method can be used even in large classes

without creating a heavy grading burden.  If use an assignment

for each chapter, set a total value for the 15 assignments, for

example five points each and 75 points in total.  Use a simple

grading scale, such as five is "outstanding"; three is "average";

one is "below average."  The homework can be evaluated quickly to

detect whether the work is outstanding, average, or below

average.</p>  



<p>You might alternate the homework assignments with announced

quizzes.  For example, if Chapter 2 is due next Wednesday,

announce that there will be a short quiz using questions from the

Chapter 2 Discussion Questions Wednesday.  If you use quizzes as

a substitute for a written homework assignment, be sure that the

points awarded also substitute.</p>              



<P>There are a variety of approaches for introducing the first

chapter.  For example, ask students to write their definition of

marketing on notebook paper or three by five inch cards that you

provide.  Canvass the class to detect dominant themes in their

definitions.  How many say that marketing is just advertising or

selling?  This presents a good point to introduce the American

Marketing Association's definition of marketing on page 7 of the

text and begin discussing the diversity of marketing activities.</P>



<p>Alternately, have students share with the class some of

their marketing knowledge and observations.  Administer a

"marketing knowledge test," for fun and not a grade!  This is an

expansion of the questions asked on page 7 of the text.  Have

students write answers for the following questions.  This goes

much faster if the questions (or ones that you substitute) are

presented both verbally and on a transparency (overhead

projector).  Student responses will lead to discussions about the

marketing mix (4Ps).  You can also discuss the extent of the

marketing knowledge consumers accumulate over a lifetime and how

they learn it all.</p>  



 Some suggested "marketing knowledge" questions are:



<ol><li>Which product will do a greater number of different kinds of   

   jobs for the user, a computer or an electric typewriter?



<li>Is $5.00 a reasonable price to pay for a gallon of regular     

   unleaded gasoline in the United States?   



<li>In what place would a consumer be more likely to find:<br>

   (a) Hard-to-find, odd size tires, at a Wal-Mart or a tire      

       store?  Use the name of a local tire store to make this    

       more relevant.<br>

   (b) One-of-a-kind, made-to-order expensive jewelry, at a       

       Service Merchandise or a fine jewelry store?  Use the name 

       of a local fine jewelry store.     



<li>What brands do these promotional slogans promote?<br>

   (a) "At _____, Quality Is Job 1."  (Ford)<br>

   (b) "Pizza. Pizza."   (Little Caesar's)<br>

   (c) "Have A ____ And A Smile"  (Coke)<br>

(d) Always _____"  (Coca-Cola)<br>

   (e) "Where's The Beef?"  (Wendy's)<br>

   (f) "The King of Beers"  (Budweiser)<br>

</ol>

     



<p>After defining marketing (chapter objective 1), identifying

the foundation concepts (chapter objective 2), and explaining the

importance of studying marketing (chapter objective 3), pose the

question from the end of the chapter introduction (page 5 of the

text), What would your life be like if there were no marketing? 

This can be asked generally of the entire class.  Rather than

tackling the whole question of life without marketing at once,

begin with the question, What would your life be like if there

were no promotion?  This means no advertising, no salespeople, no

product samples or coupons?  How would you find out about new

products?  How would you learn about sales or price reductions? 

How would retail stores let customers know their hours of

operation or what forms of payment they accept for product

purchases?  Who would help you with a purchase decision?</p>



<p>Other teaching suggestions are provided in Teaching Tips For

Marketing Applications.  If you intend to use the consumer letter

Marketing Application 1.5 (page 29 of text), this is a good place

to introduce it.  Students need several days to make their

selection, find an address, and write the letter.</p> 



<p>A proven way to stimulate class discussions is to start

class by citing an article about marketing that has appeared

recently in a business or general interest periodical.  Excellent

sources for current marketing event articles are The Wall Street

Journal, Business Week, INC., Forbes, The Economist, Sales &

Marketing Management, and Marketing News.  Look for articles that

are about the day's topic.  You can prepare in advance by

labeling a manila folder for each chapter's topic.  File each

article in the appropriate folder and select the best article for

the classes when it is needed.</p>



<p>Another approach is to make a current events class

assignment.  I assign current events readings with due dates

staggered over the entire term to spread the grading load.  For

example, in a class of 45 students, each student has three

reading assignments, therefore 135 article reviews must be graded

during the term.  By alternating due dates in a 15-week term,

only nine papers must be graded each week.  Be sure to place a

limit on the length of the article review, set a format that

everyone must follow, and require that a copy of the article be

submitted with the review.  You will need to read the article (if

you haven't already seen it) before evaluating the student's

paper.  This assignment provides you with a steady stream of

articles that you might otherwise have missed.  If time permits,

have a student briefly present their article to the class and

explain its relevance to the day's topic.  Depending on class

size and length, ideally every student should have an opportunity

to make a presentation during the term.</p>



<p>A variation of this assignment requires students to seek

current marketing articles from selected periodicals.  In advance

of the assignment, key chapter topics to appropriate periodical

choices.  For example, articles to accompany Chapter 12

Understanding Promotion must be from Advertising Age, Sales &

Marketing Management, or another periodical whose main focus

parallels the chapter topic.  Students assigned an article for

Chapter 3 Segmenting the Marketing: Consumer Buying Decisions

must use American Demographics, Consumer Reports, or another

consumer-oriented periodical.  This way you can ensure that

students will read more broadly and be exposed to a variety of

important periodicals.  Be certain that students have easy access

to a periodical in the school library before you assign it.</p>



<h2><a name="outline">CHAPTER OUTLINE</a></h2>


I.   Define marketing, explain its origins and contemporary

meanings<br>

<br>
<ol>
<li>
 Marketing is more than just selling; it requires

satisfying consumer needs and wants along with achieving

organizational goals<br>

<li>Marketing is defined by the American Marketing

Association as the process of planning and executing the

conception, pricing, promotion and distribution of ideas, goods

and services to create exchanges that satisfy individual and

organizational objectives<br>

<li>Most people have been involved with marketing from an

early age and know more about marketing than they think<br>

<li>Marketing's origins can be traced to early barter

activities<br>

<li>Contemporary marketing is practiced by many groups and

individuals who are trying to identify gaps in the marketplace

and fill these gaps with products that satisfy consumers, thereby

creating value<br>

<li>Marketers perform various marketing functions designed 

to fill gaps and satisfy consumers; they bring offers to markets

and persuade consumers to make exchanges<br></ol>

<br>

II.  Identify the key foundation concepts of marketing



<ol>
<li>Marketing is constructed on foundation concepts

<li>Exchange -- a voluntary trading of things of value

between parties with the expectation that all parties will

benefit 

<li>Products -- the things of value that are the offers

marketers make to consumers

<li>Sellers -- the exchange partners that make the offer to

consumer buyers

<li>Buyers -- individuals, households, businesses,

professionals and others who are party to marketing exchanges and

seek to satisfy their needs and wants from the exchange

<li>Need Satisfaction -- in a marketing exchange means that

a gap has been filled for the buyer, a tension is reduced when a

need or want is satisfied

<li>Consumer Satisfaction -- is very important to marketers

and consumers, but it is not always clear what it takes to

satisfy consumers and satisfaction is often a function of

situations and circumstances</ol>



III. Explain why it is important to study marketing


<ol>
     <li>Marketing is important in our daily lives

    <li>Consumers have responsibilities to be efficient

     <li>Marketing offers many attractive career opportunities

    <li>Marketing is an important business process

     <li>Marketing contributes to businesses' global

competitiveness</ol>



IV.  Discuss why and how marketing is still evolving


<ol>
    <li>Marketing as a process and as an academic discipline

continues to evolve as society, technologies and markets change

    <li> The Individual Era was a time of self-sufficiency,

where marketing was primarily local and associated with simple,

mostly individual transactions; barter was common

<br>        
<ul>
<li>
During the American Colonial Period, centralized

markets developed along with small businesses, middlemen and some

small factories

          <li>Barter continues to this day, even in

technologically advanced countries</ul>

<li>Marketing evolved with the country's industrialization

into an organizational activity during the Organizational Era 

 <ul>
 <li>The Production Concept stressed production

efficiencies and products

<li>The Selling Concept stressed selling

<li>The Marketing Concept, which evolved after World

War II,  recognizes the importance of consumer satisfaction to

marketing success

<li>The Societal Marketing Concept moves a step

further and also recognizes an obligation to work for societal

good</ol></ul>



V.   Describe how marketers use the marketing mix variables to

satisfy consumers and achieve organizational goals



<ol>
<li> The 4 Ps are the marketing mix variables of product,

price, place and promotion
<ul>
<li>Product is the offer made in the marketplace

<li>Price is the amount charged for the product

<li>Place is where, when and how the product is made

available to the market

<li>Promotion is how marketers communicate with

consumers and includes advertising, personal selling, sales

promotions and public relations</ul>

<li>These are the tactical tools marketers use to achieve

their goals</ol>





<h2><a name="answer">SUGGESTED ANSWERS TO CHAPTER QUESTIONS</a></h2>



<h3>DISCUSSION QUESTIONS</h3>


<ol>
<li>
What is being exchanged between each of the following pairs   

of sellers and buyers?  


<ul>
    <li>Colleges - Students   Education, career preparation        

       exchanged for tuition.

   <li> American Cancer Society - Contributors   Information, hope 

       of a cure exchanged for money used to support              

       organization's programs and operations.

    <li>Presidential Candidate - Voters   Promises exchanged for   

       votes.

    <li>Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) - General Driving     

       Public   Promise to lobby to get drunk drivers off the     

       roads, safer driving conditions exchanged for              

       contributions of time, money.

   <li>Local Government Garbage Disposal Service - Citizens       

       Collection of garbage, sanitary disposal exchanged for tax 

       dollars.</ul>



<li>"Marketing is responsible for our materialistic society." 

Comment on this statement.  While some consumers may indulge in

materialism, marketing provides valuable information and by

stimulating competition, helps keep prices down and product

choices up.



<li>Do each of the following perform marketing activities?  If    

so, what is the goal of their marketing effort?  


<ul>
   <li>Arthur Andersen (accounting firm) Yes, marketing goal is   

       to provide accounting services for customers and make a    

       profit.

   <li>American Express (bank card) Yes, marketing goal to        

       provide financial service convenience for customers and    

       make a profit.

    <li>Good Samaritan Hospital (not-for-profit public hospital)   

       Yes, marketing goal to deliver top quality medical         

       services while keeping costs down and generating operating 

       revenues.

    <li>U.S. Army Yes, marketing goal is to attract good quality   

       recruits, offering them training and money for their       

       education, build public support for the Army.

    <li>Toyota U.S.A. Motor Manufacturing Company Yes, marketing   

       goal to product top quality automobiles that satisfy       

       consumers and make a profit.

</ul>

<li>Is the societal marketing concept a realistic concept for a

business  to adopt?  Why or why not?  Many businesses have shown

that they can be good corporate citizens and generate a profit. 

Value comes from the public goodwill generated; can help build

employee morale.  On the other hand, some economists argue that a

business' sole goal should be to generate wealth for its

stockholders.



<li>Explain why consumer insights are important to marketing.

Marketers whose businesses operate by the marketing concept

philosophy strive to satisfy consumers.  Consumer insights

provide information that marketers can use to decide what it will

take to satisfy consumers.



<li>What types of utility are created by each of the following?

a. Blockbuster Video; b. Mr. Suds' automated, drive-through car

wash; c. BancTwo Automatic Teller Machine.  All create time and

place utility; Automatic Teller Machine also creates possession

utility.



<li>Explain which is more difficult to market, an idea or a

place. Generally, an idea is more difficult to market because its

intangible and subject to misinterpretation. 



<li>Describe the foundation concepts of marketing.  These concepts

are exchange, products, sellers, buyers, and satisfaction. 

Exchange is the core process of marketing.  Products are the

things of value exchanged.  Sellers and buyers make up a market. 

Satisfaction means filling a gap between what consumers need or

want, and what they have available to them.



<li>If you were a marketing teacher, how would you explain to

your class the importance of studying marketing?  I would make

the explanation very personal, stressing that marketing affects

their lives on a daily basis and that it could provide them with

a very satisfying career.  It is vital to businesses because it

provides revenues and contributes to profitability, which can

also affect them on a personal level because the success of

marketing affects jobs.  Because of the growing competition in

the United States domestic market and abroad, marketing is

becoming even more important to a business' competitiveness.  



<li>Describe how marketing has evolved in the United States.  Do

you think it will continue to evolve?  Marketing has evolved

through two eras, first the individual era, then the

organizational era after the Industrial Revolution.  In the

latter period, several operating philosophies have dominated the

way marketing is performed.  These are the production concept,

the selling concept, and the marketing concept.  Some marketers

believe that the next step will be the adoption of the societal

marketing concept.  Marketing will continue to evolve because it

is affected by changes in its environment, particularly in

society, technology, and the economy.

<h3>CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING</h3>



<h4>Check Your Understanding 1.1 </h4>



<p>1. In your own words, what is marketing? <i>Marketing is a process

that involves planning and executing the creation of products,

their pricing, promotion and distribution to satisfy individual

and organizational goals.</i>



<p>2. Explain how sending a resume to a prospective employer is

marketing.  Who is the buyer?  Who is the seller?  <i>The exchange

can be viewed as the buyer (employer) giving up money, training,

benefits and the seller (employee) giving up time, ability,

effort and expertise.</i>



<p>3. Does marketing occur when seven families on your street get   

    together to have a garage sale?  Explain.  <i>Yes, regardless of

the number of people involved, exchange occurs at a garage sale

when goods are traded for money.</i>                     



<h4>Check Your Understanding 1.2 </h4>

<p>1. What are the foundation concepts of marketing? <i>Exchange,

products, sellers, buyers, need satisfaction, consumer

satisfaction.</i>



<p>2. Explain the concept of exchange.  <i>Exchange takes place when

two or more parties voluntarily trade things they value to their

mutual benefit.  Conditions for exchange to occur include: Two

parties are voluntarily involved; each has something of value to

exchange; parties can communicate; both are willing to trade;

both have the authority to exchange.</i>



<p>3. Why is satisfaction such an important concept in marketing? 

<i>Because it is at the core of the marketing concept.  Marketers

operating by the marketing concept consumer satisfaction an

important business goals because satisfied consumers purchase

their products.</i>





<h4>Check Your Understanding 1.3 

</h4>

<p>1. Of the reasons given for studying marketing, identify the

ones that are most important to you.  <i>Responses will vary

according to student interests.</i>



<p>2. How can marketing contribute to a standard of living? <i>By

stimulating competition that lowers prices and provides more

choices.</i>

            

<p>3. How is your daily life affected by marketing? <i>Responses will

vary. </i>



<h4>Check Your Understanding 1.4</h4>



<p>1. Explain the focus and scope of the Individual and

Organizational Eras of marketing.  <i>During the Individual Era, the

focus was on individual exchanges and exchanges involving

consumers and smaller sized businesses.  The Industrial

Revolution meant that businesses could mass produce products. 

With the development of the mass market and organizations, the

focus shifted to marketing by organizations and the scope

broadened to include large businesses as well as small and mid-size businesses.</i>



<p>2. What is the marketing concept?  Give an example of a company  

that you believe is operating on this philosophy; explain your    

answer. <i>The marketing concept is an operating philosophy that can

be adopted both by businesses and other organizations; it gives

primacy to consumer satisfaction, but also strives to meet

organizational objectives as well.  Examples can vary, popular

choices include General Electric, Dell Computer, McDonald's, Wal-Mart.</i>



<p>3. Should businesses adopt the societal marketing concept?  <i>This

question commonly generates different views.  One says that

businesses should not meddle in areas where they're not expert,

instead they should concentrate on making profits.  The other

view says that all businesses must be held responsible for their

actions, they have an obligation to behave in a responsible way.</i>



<h3>MINI-CASES</h3>

                                

<h4>Mini-Case 1.1: 'Pig's Eye' Beats Out 'Landmark' As Customers'     

               Favorite

</h4>

    <p>This case illustrates how a business that ignores consumer

insights can get in deep trouble.  This trouble affects their

profitability and the bottom line.  MBC's mistakes include the

product's name, formulation, price, and promotions.  They

squandered consumer goodwill and name recognition, then not

surprisingly experienced disappointing sales.</p>



<p>1.  Is MBC using the marketing concept philosophy?  Explain your

answer.  <i>If MBC had used the marketing concept philosophy

effectively, they wouldn't have ignored consumer preferences and

made the mistakes identified in the case.</i>  



<p>2.  Evaluate the mistakes made by MBC for each of the marketing

mix  variables (product, price, place, promotion). <i>Product was

reformulated and an unpopular name selected; the price was higher

than consumers had been paying or were willing to pay; promotions

were misleading; no information was provided about any place

(distribution) mistakes. </i>



<p>3.  How can MBC fix its mistakes?  What changes should it make? 

<i>A number of suggestions can be made.  Student suggestions can be

used for a class debate on strategies to correct MBC's marketing

mistakes.  Ask students to form teams and each is to present

his/her suggestions to the team.  Through discussion and

negotiation, each team is to arrive at a team consensus on what

strategies they recommend.  Each team can present their

strategies to the class.</i>





<h4>Mini-Case 1.2: Twentysomethings: The Consumers That Marketers     

               Almost Forgot  </h4>

 

     <p>The popular press has spent considerable time recently

dissecting the twentysomethings.  Since many of your students may

be from this age group, this case should interest them and

stimulate class discussion.   You might ask their opinions about

popular stereotypes of this age cohort and their responses to the

following statements:

<ul>

<li>This generation is relatively neglected by marketers.

<li>They are angry, cynical, dissatisfied and hopeless.

<li>They are bright, brash, intelligent, funny and like baby     

boomers but younger.

<li>They hate being marketed to and are anti-marketing.</ul>





<p>1.  Mazda ran a very conservative advertising campaign directed at baby

boomers and used cues like a woman wearing pearls and classical music in the background.  How might Mazda change their advertising for generation X

targets?  <i>Student responses will vary but the key point is that their

suggestions will reflect their own perceptions.  Point out the risks of any

business basing marketing decisions on information obtained from small

samples.  If Mazda could get a representative sample of consumers across the

country to answer this question, they could develop consumer insights to guide their advertising strategy.</i>



<p>2.  How can marketers find out what the generation X market is really all

about?  What would it take to develop consumer insight about the

twentysomethings?  <i>This question also gets to the issue of basing marketing

decisions on representative samples, small but appropriate groups of consumers whose comments and opinions can be generalized to the larger population from which they were drawn.</i>   





<h3>WHAT DO YOU THINK?

</h3>

     <p>This section can be assigned for a class debate over the pros and cons of

marketing tobacco and other products that have health hazards.  Student teams

should focus their remarks on the questions, <b>Is there a conflict between the

marketing concept's focus on delivering consumer satisfaction and the

marketing of products that are potentially harmful to consumers?  Whose

marketing standards should be followed, those of the seller's country or the

buyer's?</b> </p>



<h2><a name="internet">USING THE INTERNET</a>

</h2>



     <p>Marketing On The Internet (page 23 in text) introduces the topic and sets

the stage for subsequent discussions about how the Internet is affecting

marketing.  Many schools can Net-connect using Lynx, a text-only browser. 

Therefore, the following suggestions for getting students on the Net are based

on a Lynx system.  The first Internet activity also is Lynx-based.  If you

school connects through a paid commercial service (such as America On Line,

Prodigy, CompuServe) or through a graphical browser (Mosaic, Netscape), please

adapt these suggestions to that system.</p>



    <p> Some marketing students already know how to connect to the Internet.  In

the future, this number will grow as more primary and secondary schools Net-connect.  Students with this knowledge may help their classmates in getting on

the Internet; however, their role should support the marketing instructor's

effort, not substitute for it.</p>



<h3>Suggestions For Net-Connecting Your Students

</h3>

    <p>When teaching students to Net-connect, provide each student with clear,

concise, step-by-step written instructions to avoid misunderstandings and to

give them a record of the process in case they forget.  This includes e-mail

instructions and specifics on how to connect from various points on campus

(including dormitories) and through off-campus gateways.  If feasible, take

the class to the college or university computer center and demonstrate how to

Internet connect.  Coach students as they work through the process. 

Alternately, bring a portable computer with an overhead projector to class to

show connect procedures.  The goal is to teach students how to connect, then

let them explore through directed class applications.



    <p> For schools that Net-connect using Lynx, show students how to form

Internet addresses.  For example, once in Lynx, type G (the G)o command) to

open the URL (uniform resource locator) where the Internet address is typed. 

The letters http (hypertext transport protocol) identify an Internet address

with hyperlinks.  The last two or three letters of an address (the domain)

identifies its organizational or country origin.  For example:</p>

<center>com = commercial; <br>

gov = government;<br>

 edu = educational; <br>

<h3>A Personal Experience On The Net</h3>

     

     <p>I launched two undergraduate classes into cyberspace at the beginning of

the Spring 1995 Semester, immediately after Lynx became available at my

school.  Using class time, I introduced the Internet and explained how we

would be using it in class.  Students were cautioned about the Internet's

unregulated nature and told that they were to use the Internet principally for

work, not play.  Each student received a hard copy written description of Net-cautions and advice about Net-iquette.  



    <p> A demonstration was held in the College computer laboratory, showing

students how to use the system, set up an e-mail account, enter and use the

Internet.  In order for students to see what a graphical browser could do, I

also showed them an Internet connection using Mosaic.  If you can demonstrate

a graphical browser, start by taking your class to the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov">White House home page</a>

(a unique main menu of text, visual images, and sometimes sound prepared by

the addressee) at the White House address <b>http://www.whitehouse.gov. </b> When you

get there you will see a large color photograph of the White House building,

flanked by images and text.  Click on the image of the Presidential Seal and a

request is sent for the document that contains the President's welcome

message.  Seconds later, you'll hear the President deliver a short welcome

statement.  Return to the White House home page and listen to the Vice

President's message, go on a virtual tour of the White House, visit the First

Family, or leave a message.  



    <p> Once all students were on the Net, I assigned them three short directed

information searches.  For example, one project required a visit to the United

States Bureau of the Census, Statistical Abstract of the United States.  A

copy of the assignment, including a detailed roadmap to the site and questions

to be answered, was e-mailed to each student and students e-mailed their

answers back.  Feedback was sent to each student via e-mail reply.  The

assignment required an examination of population trends in several states, a

demographic comparison, and the identification of possible product market

matches.



     <p>Class discussions and current readings complemented student Internet

explorations.  Running Internet activities out-of-class while also

interweaving the topics in-class significantly raised student interest levels

and led to greater student participation.  Despite some problems (for example,

students deleting their e-mail addresses, forgetting to purge old mail, maxing

out their storage space), both classes were highly enthusiastic about their

Internet projects.  Several sent me e-mail messages saying that this was the

best thing they had ever done in college.    



<h3>Timing Of Internet Activities

</h3>

    <p> At what point in the term (semester or quarter) should the Internet be

introduced?  Log on as early as possible to allow time for students to

familiarize themselves with Internet search processes and capacities.  The

timing of Internet projects during a term will vary with the educational

environment, time and equipment constraints, and the number of Internet

activities assigned.  Ideally, Internet projects should be spread out over the

term, culminating with an integrative Internet project that requires using the

Internet to solve a timely marketing problem.



<h3>Internet Assignments

</h3>

     <p>Remember, things change very rapidly on the Internet.  Before making an

Internet assignment, you must check out the site to make sure that what you

are asking students to do can be done!  The information presented below on

Internet sites was current as of the publication of this <b>Manual. </b>



     <p>Initial Internet assignment should be short and easy to complete.  A

simple information retrieval assignment provides the opportunity for students

to master the process of getting on the Internet, retrieve information, and e-mail results.  For example:



<b><p>Visit the Web Page of the <a href="http://nsns.com/Mix">American Marketing Association (AMA)</a>, called the

Marketing Mix, located at address http://nsns.com/Mix.  This home page offers

the AMA's mission statement, service contacts, links to AMA special interest

groups, and a conference calendar.  Your assignment is to e-mail me the

following information, in your own words: 

<ol><li>What is the American Marketing Association?  

<li>What is its mission?  

<li>What is the nearest local professional chapter?  

<li>Select one of the AMA's journals (Under Journals and Publications)

and briefly explain the nature of its contents.</ol></b>



<p>Alternately, have students retrieve population information from the

Census Bureau.  Before making this assignment, you should visit the site,

enter the National Projections Directory and identify specific information

that you want your students to analyze.



<b><p>Visit the<a href="http://www.census.gov"> United State's Bureau of the Census</a> at  http://www.census.gov 



Follow the path:  topics in text <br>      

Population and Housing <br>                

Population Division Home Page<br>                           

<ol><li>Enter POPClock and briefly describe its contents.  

<li>Enter Population Projections.

<li>Enter National Projections and describe trends in the United States

population.  

<li>Enter State Projections and describe population trends for

our state. </ol></b>                                                



<p>These suggestions are designed to get you thinking about how to use the

Internet in your marketing class.  Please use them as a starting point and

change them to reflect your needs.  I believe that you will find this activity

well worth the time and effort.  Just remember, check out a site <strong>BEFORE</strong> you

assign it!



<h2><a name="marketing">MARKETING APPLICATIONS</a></h2>





<h3>MARKETING APPLICATION 1.1</h3>



     <p>Most Marketing Applications are designed to be small scale hands-on

learning activities that call for individual, team, and small group activities

that lead to class discussion.  The first Marketing Application also

introduces a key concept, consumer insight.  Contemporary marketing decisions

rely on information about consumers, their behaviors, likes and dislikes,

wants and needs.  In this activity, each student's responses will be personal

yet when they are compared, there are bound to be commonalities.  This can be

pointed out when the lists are compared in class and students are challenged

to answer the question What conclusions can you draw from this activity about

obstacles to developing consumer insights? 





<h3>MARKETING APPLICATION 1.2</h3>



     <p>Marketers often talk in professional shorthand, a trait common to most

professions.  Gap or opportunity analysis is frequently used when seeking a

marketing opportunity.  Students can be introduced to the concept using their

own experiences by asking them to identify what gaps the three products

(automobile, ATM and fat-free bakery goods) fill.  This can be related to the

utilities provided by each of these products and the needs being satisfied. 

An extension of this application is to have a class discussion of the gaps

identified by the students and the products that could fill the gaps.







<h3>MARKETING APPLICATION 1.3</h3>



    <p>While students are familiar with marketing activities designed to

stimulate consumer demand, few consider situations where demarketing is

required.  This Marketing Application introduces the concept of demarketing

and asks students to consider strategies for demarketing a park to protect it

from excessive crowds but doing so without ruining the market.  This may

require a combination of strategic responses.  Students may suggest raising

the price of admission, setting an entry quota for each day, launching a

public relations campaign to explain to the public why such measures are

critical and appealing to them for their support and understanding.  For each

strategy, students should consider both the benefits and possible costs.





<h3>MARKETING APPLICATION 1.4 </h3>



     <p>This is a role playing exercise that challenges students to start

thinking like marketers.  Drawing from their own experiences as consumers,

students can probably design a simple customer satisfaction survey.  You can

help them by bringing one or two samples to class.  They are often found on

tables or at the cashier in Shoney's, McDonald's and other popular fast food

chains.  This research activity is introduced early in the text to emphasize

the importance of consumer research in making marketing decisions.  Individual

student efforts can be channeled into the construction of a class survey with

your assistance as moderator.  One way to show students how challenging it is

to write good survey questions is to have them try it themselves. 

Alternately, have student teams critique surveys that they have collected from

various retail businesses.  Note the commonalities and the differences in the

questions asked, and compare the target markets these businesses seek to

serve.  







<h3>MARKETING APPLICATION 1.5</h3>



     <p>This activity is one used often with great success.  It is important to

emphasize to students that they must be honest in their communications.  This

is an ethical imperative.  They should include in their letter a current phone

number and address.  Students are often surprised by the results of their

effort.  In the past, students have received personal letters or telephone

calls from company vice presidents, coupons, free samples and in one case (a

complaint about a boot that was not wearing well), a new product.  Some

students never receive a reply.  Be sure to remind them several times

throughout the semester to bring responses to class when they're received.  At

the end of the term, conclude this application by having students recount

their experiences and whether they have changed their opinion of the business

to  which they wrote.



<h2><a name="consumer">CONSUMER INSIGHTS AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETING </a></h2>





<h3>CONSUMER INSIGHT 1.1</h3>



     <p>Students must be reminded that there are millions of consumers outside

the United States.  You might review Figure 1.1 (page 10 in text) in class,

compare the population statistics and discuss why marketers find it important

to characterize populations within countries and regions.  You can also

initiate a discussion of the opening of the China market and its economic

importance to the United States, Japan and many other countries.







<h3>CONSUMER INSIGHT 1.2</h3>



     <p>This Consumer Insight (page 20 in text) serves a dual purpose.  It

emphasizes the significance of smaller businesses to marketing and the

economy, and it highlights a consumer group that most students don't consider,

businesses and organizations.  You might ask students to draw on their own

experiences for observations about the business environment in your community

and how smaller businesses are doing, are they successful or not?







<h3>INTERNATIONAL MARKETING REPORT</h3>



     <p>PepsiCo. bartering for vodka and ships in the former Soviet Union is an

entertaining way to introduce an important topic, International Marketing

(page 24 in text).  International marketing examples are woven throughout the

text and emphasized because international markets are of growing importance to

the success of businesses of all sizes.

<h2><a name="abstract">CHAPTER ABSTRACT</a></h2>              

<p><b>1. Define the dual roles of marketing in society: micromarketing
and macromarketing.</b>  Marketing is very important to society as it
helps deliver the standard of living that most Americans enjoy. 
It plays two important roles, at the micro and macro levels. 
Micromarketing is the way marketing connects a business, its
suppliers, distributors, and consumers in activities designed to
deliver consumer satisfaction.  Macromarketing is marketing on a
broader, societal level that describes how marketing contributes
to the economy and societal welfare by balancing supply and
demand.</p>


<p><b>2. Describe the rights, responsibilities, and ethical dilemmas of
marketers.</b>  Marketers are granted broad rights in society, but
they are also expected to act legally and ethically.  Along with
rights come responsibilities.  Some businesses take this societal
obligation very seriously and make it an integral part of their
business and marketing activities.  Most marketers behave
ethically, adhering to the unwritten principles and values that
govern and bring order to society.  Marketers abide by a written
professional code of conduct as well as codes of behavior
established within their business or organization.  Self-regulation, an important behavioral monitor, is also practiced by
such groups as local Better Business Bureaus and trade
associations.</p>

<p><b>3. Identify government controls on marketing.</b>  Government
controls marketing activities through laws, rules, and
regulations.  Formal legal controls cannot possibly encompass
every activity that occurs in a complex marketplace, such as the
United States.  As a result, situations occur for which no clear
behavioral guidelines exit.  This can lead to ethical dilemmas
for marketers and sometimes, ethical lapses.  Laws are formal
statements that guide actions and set limits and penalties for
infractions.  Federal business laws are procompetitive and many
are designed to protect consumers.  The Federal Trade Commission
is the federal regulatory body that most directly controls
marketing,  including competitive and consumer protection
activities.  State and local laws, rules, and regulations control
marketing activities within these jurisdictions.  Regulations are
the rules, standards, and guidelines that government agencies
issue to implement laws.</p>


<p><b>4. Explain consumerism and the Consumer Bill of Rights.</b> 
Consumers sometimes suffer serious consequences from the
imbalance in the marketplace caused by the advantages sellers
have over buyers.  Consumerism, a response to consumer abuses in
the marketplace, is embodied in the cooperation of concerned
individuals and organizations with many diverse interests who 
respond to issues of shared distress.  President John Kennedy was
the first incumbent president to send a formal message to the
Congress identifying rights that consumers should be free to
enjoy.</p>


<p><b>5. Identify some important contemporary societal issues involving
marketing.</b>  There are many contemporary societal issues involving
marketing that capture the public imagination at various times. 
Three issues of lasting concern are green marketing, the
marketing of harmful products, and marketing to children.</p>

<h2><a name="teaching tips">SOME TEACHING TIPS</a></h2>

<p>The Chapter 4 goal is to introduce the concept of micro and
macro roles for marketing in society, state broadly the written
and unwritten guidelines by which marketing actions are bound,
raise the issue of ethical dilemmas that can lead to ethical
lapses, introduce the topic of consumerism, and identify three
societal issues involving marketing that continue to draw public
debate and criticism.  Because most business majors take a
required legal issues course, this chapter makes no attempt to
substitute for the depth of coverage found in a typical business
law course.</p>  

<p> Problems in the marketplace often receive considerable
attention when they occur.  Exemplary acts usually go unnoticed,
although they are appreciated by the consumer.  <b>Marketing
Application 4.1</b> (page 110 of the text) provides an opportunity to
personalize this issue by asking students to recount their own
observations of problems in the marketplace.  By acting as
<u>participant observers</u>, they can identify problem areas then pool
their observations to develop a consensus list of marketing
problems.  You must stress, however, that generalizing from a
small sample is not recommended.  This application can be
extended to a larger sample in order to provide a somewhat more
reliable picture of the nature and scope of marketing problems. 
Each student can ask several friends to identify marketing
problems they have encountered.  Ask open ended research
questions, such as <i>Recently, have you had any problems with 
products, prices, places where products are sold, or promotions? 
What were these problems?</i>   The results from the expanded sample
can be compared to class results to determine generally if they
are similar or not.  Be sure to have students review the list of
complaints about the marketing mix elements on pages 108-109 of
the text before they expand the sample.</p>

<p>     The issue of deviant consumer behavior was introduced in
Chapter 3.  This is a good place to consider deviant behaviors by
consumers <u>and</u> marketers.  What are some of the underlying human
characteristics and shortcomings that may be at the heart of both
types of deviant behaviors?  Contrast consumers and marketers by
their illegal and unethical behaviors.  What are the costs of
these behaviors?  Do consumers experience ethical dilemmas?  Are
they anything like those experienced by marketers?  Are there any
acceptable justifications for these behaviors by consumers or
marketers?   Do students think that these behaviors only occur in
the United States?  If you have international students in your
class, or others who have traveled or lived abroad, perhaps they
can comment on the occurrence of deviant consumer and marketer
behaviors in other countries.</p>

<p>Most people hold conflicting views about the question of the
impact of marketing on society.  Some believe it mirrors society;
others believe it influences society.  A lively student debate
can be held about the role of marketing as a societal mirror or
leader.  If it is mirror, what does this say about society?  Is
the mirror shiny and bright, or dark and cracked?  Does marketing
reflect all segments of society?  Do all segments benefit equally
from marketing activities?</p>

<p>What do students think about the rights of marketers (page
111 of the text)?  Have them consider the rights and discuss how
far the rights extend.  What roles do consumers and the
government play in limiting these rights?  Should existing limits
be changed on any of these rights?  Address this issue from three
perspectives: the consumer's, the government's, and the
marketer's.</p>

<p>Students often are interested in learning about business
support for community and societal causes.  A suggested Internet
activity presents an opportunity to learn how some major
multinational businesses are acting on their societal
responsibilities. <b>Marketing Application 4.2</b> suggests finding out
more about local businesses that support community activities and
causes.  If a local business is particularly visible in
supporting local causes, you might contact that business and ask
for more information about their activities.  Alternately, ask
your working students whether their employers are similarly
involved.  What are the benefits from societal and civic
sponsorships and support activities?  Do your students seek out
businesses that support certain causes in order to buy their
products?  Are there some causes that might backfire and turn
consumers away from the supporting businesses' products?</p>

<p>A debate over values appears to be gaining momentum
throughout the country.  How might a more conservative approach
to values affect societal ethics that govern consumer and
marketer behaviors?  How might this affect marketers and
marketing activities?  Relate the issue of values to the rules
suggested on page 115 of the text.  What do your students think
of the power of the Golden Rule, the Mom Rule, and the TV Rule
for governing consumer <u>and</u> marketer behaviors?</p>

<p>Have your students read the Code of Ethics of the American
Marketing Association (AMA) on page 116 of the text.  What do
they think of the strength of the sanctions that the AMA
threatens to invoke for members who violate the Code?  What else
may happen to marketers who violate the Code?  Relate this Code
to <b>Marketing Application 4.3</b> and contrast codes issues by other
professional organizations.  What are the similarities and
differences?</p>

<p>I strongly recommend that students who can Net-connect visit
the home page of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).  This is
described in the Internet section of this chapter.  Because of
the great influence of this agency on marketing and consumers,
students should learn more about it, directly from the source. 
The FTC home page is highly informative and well organized.  Any
student in business now or planning to go into business should
learn more about the FTC and other government agencies that
monitor and control business activities.</p>
         
<p> The periods of consumerism in recent U.S. history (page 124
of the text) can be assigned as research topics.  For example,
student teams could read about the first consumerism period which
began at the turn of the century and lasted until American
entered World War I.  Consumer problems during this period
included mail order fraud, tainted meat, spiraling prices, child
labor exploitation, and outrageous claims for health cures by
patent medicine sellers.  A catalyst spurring public outrage was
the 1906 publication of Upton Sinclair's book <u>The Jungle</u>.  Your
students may be shocked by this expose of unsanitary conditions
in the Chicago meat packing industry.  For example, the following
passage and others like it in Sinclair's book inflamed consumers
from coast-to-coast, including then President Theodore Roosevelt,
and prompted federal intervention to clean up business and
protect consumers' health and safety.</p>
<pre>
        These rats were nuisances, and the packers would put
        poisoned bread out for them and they would die, and then
        rats, bread and meat would go into the hoppers together.. 
        Men, who worked in the tank rooms full of steam...fell into
        the vats; and when they were fished out, there was never 
        enough of them to be worth exhibiting - sometimes they
        would be overlooked for days, till all but the bones of them
        had gone out to the world as Durham's Pure Leaf Lard!

        Source: Herrmann, Robert O. (1970), "The Consumer Movement
        in Historical Perspective," in Aaker, David A. and George S. Day 
        (1978), Consumerism: Search for the Consumer Interest, 3rd 
        Edition, New York: The Free Press (Macmillan): 27-36. </pre>
</p>

<p>     Ask students to relate this market problem to contemporary
issues of meat inspection.  Recent incidences of E coli
contaminated ground beef should personalize this issue.  Outcomes
of the first consumerism period included passage of meat
inspection legislation and a Pure Food Bill, as well as other
laws designed to increase competition in the marketplace and
protect consumers.  What outcomes might the recent incidences
have for business and consumers?</p>
     
 <p>    Students can debate the issues raised by green marketing,
marketing harmful products, and marketing to children.  These
topics typically provoke strong opinions, pro and con.  Student
teams can be assigned the pro or con of marketing to children, or
marketing harmful products.  What do your students think of Old
Joe Camel?  Is it a great product mascot or an engaging hook to
interest children in a harmful product?</p>

I.   Marketing plays roles at the micro and macro levels of
     society </p>                    

       <li> A. Micromarketing is a smaller scale, narrower perspective
          of the role of marketing by a business, organization,
          supplier, or individual marketer engaged in consumer
          exchanges </li></p>
<ol>
<li>
On a micromarketing level, most marketers seek to
            satisfy consumers 
<ul>
<li>
 Many consumers complain that, on a personal
                    level, marketing is not working well for them

<li>However, consumers are not always easy to
                    satisfy, and in some cases, what consumers
                    want is harmful 

<li>Some marketing criticisms concern unsafe
                    products, high prices, restrictions on where
                    products are made available, aggressive and
                    misleading promotions, unwholesome demand
                    stimulation, and privacy issues</ul>

<li>Macromarketing takes the broader, system
               perspective
<ul>
<li>       
Governments set national goals that
                    businesses help the country achieve
<li>Marketing is criticized at the macro level
                    for adding costs, wasting resources,
                    stimulating unnecessary demand, and
                    undermining societal moral values </ul></ol>


<p>II.  Describe the rights, responsibilities, and ethical dilemmas
     of marketers</p>

<p><li> A.   Marketing has societal responsibilities</li></p>
 <p><li>B.   Some businesses take their societal responsibilities
          very seriously and believe that they have an obligation
          to contribute to society</li></p>
<p><li>C.   Although social programs can be costly, they can also
          be beneficial marketing tools</li></p>   
<p><li>D.   Marketers must be knowledgeable of and adhere to the
          laws and regulations that govern marketing activities</p>

<ol>
<li>
Ethical behavior requires adhering to the societal
               rules of conduct that govern interactions
<li>Marketers often face ethical dilemmas where the
               rules of conduct may not be clear</ol>

<p><li>E.  Marketing is also governed by professional codes of
          conduct</p>

<p><li>F.   Self-regulation provides guidance to marketers through
          such mechanisms as the Better Business Bureaus and
          internal behavioral monitoring systems</p>

III. Identify governmental controls on marketing<p>

<li>     A.   Laws are formal statements that guide actions and set
          limits and penalties for infractions<p>
          <ol><li>Generally, what is illegal is also unethical; what
               is unethical is not necessarily also illegal
         <li>Marketers are bound by federal laws with
               nationwide jurisdiction
               <ul><li>Many federal laws are procompetitive and
                    protect consumers
               <li>The Federal Trade Commission more than other
                    federal agencies, oversees marketing
                    activities
              <li>Marketers are bound by many different state
                   and local laws whose jurisdiction is limited
                    to a specific area </ul></ol>
  <li>   B.   Regulations are the rules, standards, and guidelines
          that government agencies issue to implement laws</ol><p>


IV.  Consumerism refers to a constantly changing association of
     people, organizations, agencies and businesses that arise
     because people believe the imbalance in the market between
     sellers and buyers has gone too far; the goal is to correct
     the imbalance and protect consumers<p>

    <li> A.   Since the 1890s, three periods of consumerism have
          peaked in the United States<p>
   <li>B.   In 1962, President John Kennedy sent a Consumer Bill of
          Rights message to the Congress that identified problem
          areas and stated consumer rights in each<p>
<ol>
          <li>Consumers have the right to safe products
          <li>Consumers have the right to be informed about
               products
          <li>Consumers have the right to choose from among a
               variety of products
         <li>Consumers have the right to be heard and have
               complaints resolved<p></ol>


V.   Identify some important contemporary societal issues
     involving marketing<p>

    <li> A.   Many marketers are demonstrating their concern for the
          environment through green marketing, activities that
          are environmentally friendly rather than
          environmentally harmful<p>
    <li> B.   Some marketers of harmful but legal products are trying
          to show greater social responsibility, as shown by 
          beer and liquor industry campaigns against drinking and
          driving<p>
    <li> C.   Marketing to children is easier in the United States
          than in many other countries; however, it remains
                    highly controversial and criticized <p>    

<h2><a name="answer">SUGGESTED ANSWERS TO CHAPTER QUESTIONS</a></h2>
                     <b> DISCUSSION QUESTIONS</b>
<ol>
<li> Why is the buyer (consumer) often at a disadvantage in an
exchange with a seller?  <i>At its core, the imbalance involves
information, which the seller has and the buyer often can't
easily obtain.  Imbalances occur because of the control that
sellers have over price, place (where and how products are
offered), and promotion.  The latter should provide useful
information but often is exaggerated or even misleading. 
Consumers mostly act as individuals or in small family groups,
which means they cannot exert the market power that could be
yielded by a large bloc or federation of consumers.</i><p>
    

<li>Identify some of the criticisms leveled at marketing, and
discuss how they might be corrected.  <i>Some criticisms concern
illegal practices like price fixing, bait and switch, and false
advertising.  Far more involve ethical issues that are less
clearly defined by strict legal boundaries.  These issues 
include irritating advertisements, dinner time telemarketing
calls,  exaggerated advertising claims, overpriced products, mean
spirited comparative advertisements, privacy issues, and
environmentally unfriendly products. </i><p>

<li>Should consumers be satisfied all the time?  Should the
marketer work to accomplish this goal?  Explain your answers. 
<i>Although the marketing concept stresses consumer satisfaction, it
is not always possible to satisfy consumers nor is it always in 
consumers' best interests to do so.  Consumer satisfaction is a
moving target; consumers don't always know what they need or
want.  Tastes change, and what is satisfying today may not be
tomorrow.  Consumers want things they don't need and products
that can harm them, such as alcoholic beverages, cigarettes,
unhealthy foods, and drugs. </i><p>

<li>What is materialism?  Is it good or bad?   <i>Materialism is a
preference for material possessions over spiritual and
intellectual pursuits.  The ideal is to establish a healthy
balance between the two.  The problem occurs when materialism and
the activities that support a materialistic lifestyle leave no
time or energy for less material ventures.  Few of us would want
to live in a society where everyone was a strict materialist,
with no time for intellectual or spiritual pursuits.</i><p>

<li>What are some types of controls on marketing? <i> There are
formal controls exerted by governments, courts, and regulatory
agencies through laws, rules, and regulations.  There are codes
of conduct and ethics codes enacted by professional organizations
to guide their members through difficult situations.  Self-regulation also is exerted by trade and professional
associations, as well as by businesses and organizations.</i><p>

<li>Explain how some things that are unethical might still be
legal?  <i>Ethics are unwritten rules of conduct that a society
formulates to provide guidelines for acceptable behaviors and
interactions.  They are moral principles or values.  Laws are
written descriptions of acceptable and unacceptable conduct that
set behavioral limits and establish penalties for infractions. 
Laws cannot govern every possible behavior and situation.  Ethics
describe general ways to behave consistently in many different
types of situations.  In some cases, a behavior may not be
considered by any laws, yet ethical standards will govern what is
and is not acceptable behavior.  
</i><p>
<li>Are all marketers evil?  If not, what explanations could be
offered for the mistakes they make?   <i>Certainly not!  People
perform marketing activities and people make mistakes and
sometimes do unacceptable things.  Honest marketers may fail to
do the right thing because they have poor judgment, possess
incomplete information, misunderstand, lack guidance, or fail to
consider a decision's consequences.  Although all businesspeople
should be held to high standards, some will fail to perform as
desired or even as expected.  To condemn all marketers for the
misdeeds of a few is unfair and irresponsible.  However, illegal
and unethical marketers should be punished.</i><p>

<li>Is price skimming illegal?  Is it ethical?  Is it good
marketing?   <i>A skimming pricing strategy is often used when a
unique product is offered for the first time to a market.  A high
price is charged to skim the cream off the market.  This means
generating as much revenue as possible from a captive market
segment, consumers who really need or want the product, but have
no alternatives.  As time passes and competitors enter the
market, and the original marketer achieves economies of scale,
prices typically fall, sometimes considerably, and new market
segments are reached.  Think back to the introduction of the
first handheld calculators.  When the product was new, it was a
revolutionary advance over desk calculators and slide rules.  The
price was very high, often several hundred or thousand dollars
per unit.  As time passed and more competitors arrived, prices
fell.  Now, a reliable handheld solar powered calculator sells 
in discount stores for under five dollars per unit.  This is not
illegal.  It is good marketing, since profitability is a priority
business goal and price skimming increases revenues which
contribute to profitability.  Ethically, it is acceptable for
most products.  However, for products such as the first
pharmaceutical approved in the treatment of AIDS patients, the
ethical dimensions of price skimming for this life prolonging
drug upset many people. </i><p> 
 
<li>Discuss how marketers are often caught in crossfires. 
Explain how this can affect their ability to make the right
decisions. <i> Marketers are boundary spanners.  They must satisfy
their company and produce revenue.  This means selling products,
generating revenue, and contributing to profitability.  At the
same time, they must satisfy consumers so that they will make
repurchases.  This crossfire between sometimes opposing demands
can affect marketers' ability to make the right decision.
</i><p>
<li>Compare and contrast the society marketing concept and the
marketing concept.  Do you think that the societal marketing
concept will be readily accepted by all businesses?  Why or why
not?   <i>The societal marketing concept is the marketing concept
with an added goal, to act responsibly for the greater good of
society.  Since many businesses have great difficulty
successfully implementing the marketing concept, it is likely
that they will have comparable problems with the societal
marketing concept.  Some critics believe that a business must
only satisfy its stockholders and to engage in social marketing
is irresponsible.  </i><p></ol>

<b>Check Your Understanding 4.1 </b><p>
<ol>
<li>Distinguish between the dual societal roles of marketing:
micro and macro.  <i>Micromarketing is the way marketing connects a
business, its suppliers, distributors, and consumers in
activities designed to deliver satisfaction.  Macromarketing is a
broader perspective of marketing, how overall it contributes to
an economic system and societal welfare.
</i><p>
<li>Should marketers be concerned when consumers believe that
marketing is not working well for them?  Explain your answer.  <i>If
the marketer has adopted the marketing concept philosophy of
doing business, then consumer satisfaction is a critically
important concern.  If consumers complain that marketing is not
working well for them, marketers should be alarmed.</i><p>
</ol>
<b>Check Your Understanding 4.2</b> <p>
<ol>
<li>What rights do marketers have in the United States? 
<i>Marketers have the right to seek profit in a free market economy. 
Specific marketing activities are controlled by laws, rules, and
regulations.  However, marketers may compete in any way they wish
as long as they do not break any laws, rules, or regulations. 
They must behave legally and ethically.  There is no formal,
written statement of marketers' rights; however, their unwritten
right to compete in a capitalistic free market is extremely
broad.</i><p>

<li>Discuss marketing's societal responsibilities.  <i>Some believe
that marketers have an obligation to operate in the public
interest.  Many businesses already demonstrate their concern for
society because they feel an obligation to "give back" something
to the society that allows them to profit.</i><p>

<li>What kinds of ethical dilemmas do marketers sometimes face? 
<i>Ethical dilemmas often occur in grey areas, where there are no
clearly defined laws, rules, or regulations.  For example, price
skimming on essential products, fear appeals in advertising, high
pressure personal selling, and product overdesign. 
</i><p>
</ol>
<b>Check Your Understanding 4.3</b> <p>
<ol>
<li>Compare and contrast laws and regulations. <i> Laws are formal
statements that guide actions and set limits and penalties for
infractions.  They are passed by legislative bodies, enforced by
administrative and executive agencies, and interpreted by courts. 
Regulations are the rules, standards, and guidelines that
government agencies issue to enact laws.  </i><p>

<li>Identify some federal laws that affect marketing. <i> Federal
laws broadly fall into two categories, those that promote
competitiveness and others that protect consumers.  Among the
most important procompetitive laws are the Sherman Antitrust Act,
Federal Trade Commission Act, and Lanham Trademark Protection
Act.  Important consumer protection laws are the Pure Food and
Drug Act, Auto Disclosure Act, and Consumer Product Safety Act.</i><p>

</ol>
<b>Check Your Understanding 4.4</b><p>
<ol>
<li>Define consumerism.  <i>Consumerism is "a broad reaction against
bureaucratic neglect and corporate disregard of the rights of the
public."  It occurs when a coalition of people in organizations,
groups, and associations come together to protest an issue over
which they feel common distress.</i><p>

<li>Describe the major consumerism periods in U.S. history.  <i> In
the recent past, there have been three major periods of
consumerism.  Each accompanied periods of economic distress and
public perceptions that the imbalance between sellers and buyers
had shifted too far in favor of sellers.  These broad periods
were from the 1890s to World War I, the late 1920s through World
War II, and the late 1950s through the late 1970s. </i><p>

<li>Identify the rights specified in the Consumer Bill of Rights.
<i> Although it does not have the force of law, the Consumer Bill of
Rights is often cited as an important document.  It marked the
first time that an incumbent president sent a consumer rights
message to the Congress.  In this case, John Kennedy proposed
that consumers have the right to have safe products, the right to
be informed about products, the right to choose from among a
variety of products, and the right to be heard and have
complaints resolved.</i><p>

<li>What is green marketing? <i> This is the term applied to the
activities of marketers who offer products that are
environmentally friendly and not environmentally harmful.</i><p>

<li>Should all products that could be harmful to consumers be
banned?   <i>A distinction should be drawn between products that are
known to be widely harmful and those that are harmful in rare 
situations.  For example, to the person with a serious nut
allergy, peanut butter is poison.  Does this mean that all
consumers should be denied access to peanut butter because it
could harm a very small consumer segment?  Contrast this example
with the large numbers of consumers who are alcoholic or addicted
to nicotine.  As long as a product is legal, and some like
cocaine and heroin are not, a marketer has the legal right to
offer the product to the market.  Individual marketers always
have the right to refuse to work for a business that markets
products that are legal but potentially harmful.</i> <p> 

<li>Should marketers be allowed to target children? <i> This is a
matter of opinion.  Some people believe that children should not
be targeted under any circumstances.  Others believe that
children become better adult consumers if they learn from an
early age how to distinguish between market offers.  General
public opinion falls somewhere between the two extremes.  If
enough consumers believe that marketing to children is wrong,
they will inform marketers and legislators of their discontent. 
Public pressure often results in the passage of laws and the
enactment of rules and regulations that limit or even ban the
offending activity.

<b>Mini-Case 4.1: Diet Disasters: The FTC, FDA, and Others Take      
               Action</b><p>
           
    Americans are obsessed with being thin.  Some marketers take
advantage of this consumer insight and aggressively market diet
products to receptive targets.  Despite their vows to pursue
thinness, most dieters who do lose weight can't keep it off. 
It's highly probably that one or more students in your class has
some pronounced views on the diet industry and diet marketing. 
When you assign this case, also ask students to bring in print
advertisements for diet aids.  Some will probably be outrageous,
particularly the ones on the back pages of monthly women's
magazines.  Use the print advertisements along with the case to 
stir a class debate about ethical limits and dilemmas in
marketing.<p>
<ol>
<li>Why is there such an obsession with thinness in the United
States?  <i>There is no easy answer to this question.  Advertising
certainly shares some of the blame for this obsession by its use
of ultrathin models in advertisements.  However, thin is also
promoted in motion pictures, television programs, and magazine
articles.  The barrage of "thin is beautiful" images and
suggestions affect women primarily.  If society endorses and
promotes an idealized body size and shape, it is extremely
difficult for individuals to withstand the pressure to conform.</i> <p>  
 
<li>Is diet marketing legal?  Is it ethical?  <i>Most diet products
are marketed legally.  The ethical question is more difficult to
resolve.  Some diet product promises are outrageous.  They
clearly are not going to deliver the bodies pictured in their
advertisements.  Most consumers are able to distinguish between
products and avoid those whose benefits are obviously
exaggerated.  However, many people believe these products are
marketed unethically if they target woman with eating disorders
who are highly susceptible to products that promise thinness.</i>  <p>
<li>Do you think the antidiet movement in the United States will
grow?  Explain your answer.  <i>Probably not.  If anything, aging
baby boomers will probably need to diet, or at least be careful
about what they eat, to complement their exercise programs. 
Aging baby boomers present a very enticing target for diet
marketers, so one expects more diet marketing in the near future
and not less.</i><p></ol>


<b>Mini-Case 4.2: Fear Appeals Sell Products</b><p>
 
     Fear appeals can sell products.  However, there are risks. 
Extreme fear and fear used inappropriately, with the wrong
products, can backfire.  Fear is a potent emotion, but it is just
one of the emotions that marketers use to communicate with
consumers.  Like Mini-Case 4.1, print advertisements can be used
to complement the case contents.  Some print advertisements are
entertaining, others are not.  See if you can find several
different fear appeals for the same product type.  For example,
automobile advertisements that stress car safety, or insurance
advertisements that promote the need to take care of your family
if anything happens to you, the breadwinner.<p>
<ol>
<li>Do consumers react to fear appeals in the same way?  <i>No,
there is a considerable variation in reactions that reflect
personal experiences, involvement, and perceptions.
</i><p>
<li> Are fear appeals legal?  Are they ethical?   <i>Yes, as long as
they contain information that is not illegal.  Mild fear appeals
are acceptable; extreme fear appeals that seriously affect
consumers and scare them into unnecessary product purchases are
not.</i><p>

<li>Do fear appeals exploit consumers' weaknesses, or do they
instead use powerful images to market important products?    
<i>Both.  It depends on the consumer, product, situation, and
appeal.</i><p></ol>
                                
                       <b>WHAT DO YOU THINK?</b><p>

     Consumer's Digest and Consumer Reports are very popular
consumer magazines with different approaches.  One method for
stimulating student discussion over the preferable approach a
consumer magazine <i>should</i> take, is to bring in current issues of
both magazines and have student analyze them.  Then, have them
can address the question, <i>Should consumer product testing
magazines accept products and advertisements?</i><p>

     Many informative Web sites can be used in Chapter 4. 
Remember to verify Internet addresses, confirm the feasibility of
an Internet assignment <i>before</i> you make it, and stress that
students exhibit professionally responsible behavior on the Net.<p> 

<b>
Internet Assignments</b><p>

     If you have time for only one Chapter 4 Internet assignment,
have students research the government agencies most involved in
monitoring and controlling marketing activities, particularly the
Federal Trade Commission.  Visit the Federal Trade Commission
(FTC) to learn about their mission, "What's New at the FTC," and
their organizational structure.  A link describes the Bureau of
Consumer Protection, the Bureau of Competition, and Consumerline. 
Several recent FTC cases are reviewed in the "What's New at the
FTC" link.  Using the FTC site as a model, have student teams
compare Web sites for several other agencies, such as the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC), Government Services Agency
(GSA), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and Consumer
Product Safety Commission (CPSC).  How well organized are the
sites?  How informative?  What is their potential value to the
consumer and marketer?  Compare agency missions and operations.

<b>MARKETING APPLICATION 4.1</b><p>

     Most consumers have experienced problems in the marketplace. 
Students can use their own observations to compile a list of
common marketing problems.  Working from the lists compiled
individually, small groups can collaborate on developing a master
list of problems and citing the most serious ones.  As a class,
form a consensus about the nature of the problems, their relative
seriousness, what should be done about them, and who should do
it.<p> 


<b>MARKETING APPLICATION 4.2</b><p>

     Another way to learn about corporate social responsibility
is to evaluate information they place on their Web home page. 
For example, students can visit the home pages of AT&T, IBM, or
General Electric (addresses provided previously) to learn about
their involvement in philanthropic and volunteer programs. 
Alternately, ask some of your non-traditional students about such
programs in their businesses.  Perhaps they can suggest the name
and title of someone in their company who could speak to the
class about their sponsorships or other social programs.<p>  


<b>MARKETING APPLICATION 4.3</b><p>

     Marketers should take the AMA's Code of Ethics (page 116 of
the text) seriously.  What about other professions?  Since it is
likely that the majority of students in your class are non-marketing majors, ask them what they know about the professional
code of ethics in their major.  Assign each the task of finding
the copy (if there is one) and bringing it to class.  Assign this
in advance, so when you reach this point in the chapter, students
have the codes to content analyze and can determine their
similarities and differences.<p>   


<b>MARKETING APPLICATION 4.4</b><p> 

     Most cities have a local Better Business Bureau.  The head
of the local BBB is often an excellent source of information and
a good guest speaker for your class.  Some of the larger BBBs
have a speaker's bureau of professionals from member
organizations who are willing to speak to schools about their
consumer activities.<p>



<b>MARKETING APPLICATION 4.5</b><p> 

     A simple approach to this Application is to have students
contact their employers to ask how they found out about the laws
and regulations governing their activities.  Another approach is
to ask the marketing specialist in your local Small Business
Administration Small Business Development Center (SBDC) to visit
your class and explain the procedures for starting up.  If there
is a SCORE chapter in your city, these retired businesspeople are
excellent resources to draw on for this type of information.  For
more information about SCORE, see the Internet activity in this
chapter.<p>


 
<h2><a name="consumer">CONSUMER INSIGHTS AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETING </a></h2>

<b>CONSUMER INSIGHT 4.1</b><p>

     Ask your students if they have complained about a product. 
Certainly at least one has complained about food served in a
restaurant, or a product that broke the first time it was used. 
What was the outcome of their complaint?  See <b>Marketing
Application 4.12 </b>(page 110 of the text) for a complementary
activity.  This is a good time to refer to the consumer letter
from Chapter 1.  If you assigned this application, ask some of
the complaint letter writers the nature of their complaints.  If
anyone has received a reply, have them read it to the class. 
Most complaints are legitimate and marketers need to have
complaint information so they can improve their product. 
However, ask your students what they think about complainers who
make a business of complaining.  Is this legal?  Is it ethical?<p>



<b>INTERNATIONAL MARKETING REPORT</b><p>

     Ethical dilemmas also occur in international marketing.  A
fairly common problem faces marketers in countries where the
common practice is to "grease" transactions through bribes.  The
U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act specifically forbids giving or
taking kickbacks, payoffs, dash, mordida, or baksheesh.  If you
have international students in your class, ask them whether any
of these practices are common in their countries.  If so, ask
them to describe some of the situations where payments are a
necessary part of daily life and commerce.<p>

<h2><a name="abstract">CHAPTER ABSTRACT</a></h2>

<b>1. Describe the characteristics of marketing decisions.</b>  Marketing decisions require choices between sets of alternatives in the marketing functions of exchange, physical distribution, and servicing.  Marketing decisions also are about products,

 prices, places, and promotions.  They vary in their complexity, timing, focus, scope, risk, and participants.</p>

<p><b>2. Explain the importance of planning and describe the building blocks of plans.</b>  Plans are blueprints for action.  Plans, along with the planning process, can help a business cope with uncertainty and prepare it to seize opportunities.  Plannin

g horizons show how far into the future a plan extends.  While planning occurs at all business levels, significant differences exist between plans.  The building blocks of plans are goals and objectives; strategies and tactics.

<p><b>3. Describe how plans are developed.</b>  Marketers contribute to planning at all business levels.  Companywide planning requires developing a mission statement, establishing priorities, developing a strategic plan, and for a multibusiness company, 

forming a portfolio of business units.</p>

<p><b> 4. Discuss marketing planning at the business level. </b> The business level refers to an independent business or a strategic business unit of a multibusiness corporation.  Marketing plans at the business level require performing a situation analys

is, segmenting markets, selecting target markets, developing marketing mix strategies, writing a marketing plan, implementing the plan, and controlling the results.</p>

<p><b>5. Distinguish between the different environments that affect marketing decisions and plans.</b>  Marketing decisions and plans are affected by what is happening in many different environments.  Some of these environments are internal, others are ex

ternal.  Internal environments are very close to the business and include its own operating departments and other businesses in a multibusiness corporation.  External environments include the immediate external environment, along with the greater domestic

 environment and international environment.  The effects of these environments vary, along with the ability of a business to directly influence them.  Environmental volatility is a potent factor that often works to undermine even the best laid plans.</p>

<h2><a name="teaching tips">SOME TEACHING TIPS</a></h2>

Many marketing instructors find the contents of this chapter among the more difficult to teach.  This is because most students, particularly traditional ones, have little full-time work experience, let alone professional experience in making marketing 

decisions or developing marketing plans.  As a result, there are few anchors for this material in traditional student lives.  Non-traditional students with considerable work experience should find it easier to relate Chapter 2 concepts to their own work backgrounds.</p>

<p>If your class is composed primarily of traditional students, you may want to introduce the learning objectives in Chapter 2 by personalizing them, relating them to student lives.  Apply the characteristics of marketing decision to individuals.  For exa

mple, students make choices between alternatives.  They make very important decisions about which school to attend or what job to accept after graduation.  Other decisions are less critical and some are trivial.  Some individual decisions are highly compl

ex, others are simple.  Individual decisions also vary in timing and focus, and also scope and risk.  Some decisions are made solely by the individual, while others require the participation of others.</p>

<p><i>Marketing Application 2.1</i> (page 39 of the text) provides a hands-on approach to considering some decisions facing marketers.  Although competing grocery stores are used as the example, if your students rarely visit this type of retailer, select 

an alternative, such as fast food retailers.  Consider all of the marketing decisions that must be made in respect to the 4Ps -- product, price, place, and promotion.  Challenge student teams to list some decisions that a fast food retailer must make to c

ompete successfully against burger competitors as McDonald's, Wendy's, and Burger King; chicken competitors such as KFC; and fish competitors such as Long John Silver's.  How do customers and the competition, and other environmental factors affect these m

arketing decisions?</p>

<p>Planning is not a particularly exciting topic for most students, yet it is something that should concern them.  One planning activity that should be important personally is career planning.  The topic of marketing planning can be developed by establish

ing parallels with career planning.  For example, have students adapt Kirby Warren's definition of planning (page 42 of the text) to a personal planning context.  Similarly, Figure 2.2 (page 43 of the text) can be modified so that it is relevant for indiv

idual decisions and career planning.</p>  

<p>The concept of decision processes under the corporate umbrella, as illustrated by Figure 2.4 (page 48 of the text), may be difficult for students to grasp.  Traditional students with little if any work experience in multibusiness corporations often can

not relate to the size and complexity of a global giant like AT&T, General Electric, or Procter & Gamble.  As a result, they have trouble imagining the types of marketing decisions and plans made in the business units of these companies.  To learn how suc

h companies describe their organization's structure, visit the Securities and Exchange Commission EDGAR site on the Internet (see instructions in the Chapter 2: Using the Internet).  Look in Part I under the General Business heading of the 10-K report to 

find business unit descriptions.  For example, General Electric reports 12 businesses under its global corporate umbrella;  AT&T reports four broad groups. </p>  

<p>Segmentation, targeting, and positioning are critical processes to most marketers.  As a result, they are referred to throughout the text.  For some unexplained reason, many students seem to have trouble distinguishing these processes.  One suggested s

tarting point is to use the Consumer Insight (page 57 of the text) and the application suggested at the end of this chapter.</p>

<p>Chapter 2 is a good place to explore the topic of careers in marketing, particularly if you parallel planning process in marketing and for individuals, as in career planning.  Use the career appendix in the text and materials in the student study guide

 to supplement the discussion.  Invite a guest speaker to talk about careers in marketing with your students.  If you visit the American Marketing Association's (AMA) MouseTracks World Wide Web home page (see Chapter 1 of this Manual for instructions on h

ow to get to the site), you will find local AMA chapter contacts and addresses.  This is a good place to start if you are looking for knowledgeable guest speakers who can answer student questions about marketing career opportunities.</p>

<h2><a name="answer">SUGGESTED ANSWERS TO CHAPTER QUESTIONS</a></h2>

<h3>DISCUSSION QUESTIONS</h3>

<p>1. Marketers make many different kinds of decisions.  Describe some of them.  <i>Many marketing decisions are about exchange functions, others involve physical distribution and servicing.  Marketers make decisions about the kinds of products to offer t

o markets.  Other decisions involve the price to charge for a product, when to change a price and by how much.  Place decisions focus on where to offer products.  Promotion decisions are about what types of promotion to use, when promotions are scheduled,

 and how often.</i>   

<p>2. Why is it important to do the right thing rather than just do things right? <i> Peter Drucker is credited with making this observation.  Applied to marketing, it means that making the right decision is critical to marketplace success.  If you are do

ing the wrong thing, then no matter how well you do it, it is still wrong.</i>

<p>3. Why do some individuals plan for their personal lives?  Why do marketers plan? <i>Planning, both in marketing and in one's life, helps bring order to decisions, set priorities, and anticipate uncertainties and opportunities.</i> 

<p>4. Why is a mission statement important to a business?  <i>A mission statement is an announcement to many different people and organizations about the present and future of the business.  It is a vision and a commitment.</i>

<p>5.  What is a distinctive competency?  List a distinctive competency of each of the following: <i> A distinctive competency is something that a business does best.  For example, a distinctive competency of Walt Disney Company is the production of highl

y imaginative animated films that entertain and delight consumers.  This is what Disney does extremely well.  It gives Disney a competitive advantage in the market where it competes.</i>
<ul>
<li>
Dallas Cowboys Football Team.  <i> Bone crushing defense;   smart offense; entertaining cheerleaders.</i>

<li>The University of California.  <i>Theoretical and applied   research; depth and breadth of academic programs; large  number of faculty members who are Nobel Laureates.</i>

<li>The U.S. Army.  <i>Combat trained; rapid deployment;   overwhelming, sophisticated fire power.</i>

<li>Ben and Jerry's Ice Cream Company.  <i>Creamy, tasty, rich  ice cream; unusual flavors; appealing textures.</i></ul>

<p>6. What is environmental analysis?  Why is it so important? <i>An environmental analysis involves collecting information from many sources and analyzing that information for ways that the environment affects the business and marketing activities.  It i

s important to monitor the businesses' environments because they  are so volatile and have such a great impact on marketing activities.</i> 

<p>7. What is the most important outcome for marketing decisions?  Why?  <i>Marketing is the only business functional area that is responsible for revenue production.  Marketing decisions must produce outcomes that satisfy consumers and achieve organizati

onal objectives, mostly to meet profit objectives.</i>

<p>8. Why is it important for marketers to carefully identify their target markets?  <i>Target markets are the businesses, organizations and/or personal use consumers who are already purchasing your products, have purchased them in the past and may do so 

again, or are potential purchasers.  If target markets are not carefully identified, then marketing efforts will be wasted because marketing decisions will be carried out in the wrong direction.</i> 

<p>9. Describe the major parts of a marketing plan.  How are these parts related? <i>The major sections or parts of a marketing plan are the executive summary, situation analysis, marketing objectives statement, marketing strategies statement, budget, and

 appendixes.  The executive summary is usually written last as it is a summation of all other key elements in the plan.  Other parts of the plan are written sequentially.  For example, you must do a situation analysis before establishing marketing objecti

ves.  Once goals and objectives have been set, then you can formulate strategies and tactics.</i>

<p>10. List some external environmental factors that influence the marketing decisions of each of the following:
<ul>
<li>
McDonald's.   <i>Like all retailers, McDonald's is affected by such external environmental factors as the  economy (people lose their jobs, have less money to spend, eat fewer burgers); regulations (for food handling, personnel, advertising); competition 

(other fast food retailers, other restaurants); culture (healthy food  trends).</i>

<li>A local bank.   <i>Banks are affected by government banking  regulations, the economy, technology (Automatic Teller  Machines), competitors, consumers.</i> 

<li>A local police force.   <i>Since the local police are a unit  of local government, they are affected by such external environmental factors as the economy (a recession reduces  tax collections, which affect operating budgets including  salaries), cult

ure and society, the public, laws, regulations.</i></ul></ol><br>

<h3>CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING</h3>

<h4>Check Your Understanding 2.1</h4> 

<p>1.  Explain this statement: " Marketing decisions are as varied as the profession itself." <i> Marketing occurs in small independent businesses, global multibusiness corporations, government units, not-for-profit organizations, and is practiced by indi

viduals.  It includes exchange, physical distribution, and servicing activities.  Because of this diversity, it is difficult to describe a <u>typical </u>marketing decision.</i>

<p>2.  What is a window of opportunity?  Why are windows of opportunity so important to marketers?  <i>A window of opportunity occurs when a business has the distinctive competencies to fill a gap in the market.  A window of opportunity often means that t

he first business to take advantage of the opportunity has a competitive advantage and a greater chance of being profitable.</i>

<p>3.  Explain why plans are called blueprints. <i>To an architect, a blueprint is a set of drawings that show how parts of a building or other physical structure fit together.  By studying a blueprint, a builder can calculate the materials needed for the

 project and when they should be ordered.  A blueprint is a guide for future actions.  This is the same whether it is an architect's blueprint or a marketer's plan.</i>

<h4>Check Your Understanding 2.2 </h4>

<p>1.  Why is planning important to achieving marketing success?<i>Planning is important because it encourages marketers to focus their decisions and concentrate on desirable outcomes, particularly those activities that will result in consumer satisfactio

n and profitability.  By planning ahead, marketers can reduce uncertainty, avoid problems and seize opportunities.</i>

<p>2.  Should all organizations plan ahead?  Explain your answer.  <i>Yes, even if the plan is not written, the process of planning can be extremely beneficial to marketers and the business or organization.</i>

<p>3.  What differences are there among short-range, mid-range, and long-range planning horizons?  <i>Plans are made for different periods.  These periods are horizons that show how far into the future plans extend.  Short-range plans are oriented toward 

problem solving over an immediate time period, often no more than several weeks, months, or a year.  Annual plans are short-range plans.  Mid-range plans are for a longer period and are less specific than short-range plans.  The longest planning horizon o

ccurs with long-range plans that may be five or more years in the future and typically are the least specific because of the increased uncertainty of planning so far ahead.
</i>
<h4>Check Your Understanding 2.3 </h4>

<p>1.  How are goals and objectives related?  <i>Goals and objectives are the ends that the marketer seeks.  Goals are considered longer range than objectives, more general and unbounded.  Objectives are shorter-range subgoals.</i>

<p>2.  What is the difference between strategy and tactics? <i> A strategy is an overriding broad direction for future action to achieve goals and objectives.  Tactics are the short-range details that describe how strategies will be achieved.</i>
            
<p>3.  Give examples of how individuals also use strategies and tactics, and goals and objectives in their daily lives.  <i>Responses will vary.  For example, a career goal for Pete is to become a category manager within the large consumer products compan

y where he is an assistant brand manager.  An objective is to earn a reputation in the company for being a very effective marketer.  A strategy for achieving this objective is to complete his bachelor's degree in marketing with honors as soon as possible.

  A tactic is to take two courses a term at night so he can graduate early.</i>

<h4>Check Your Understanding 2.4</h4>

<p>1.  What is a mission statement?  How does a mission statement affect marketing activities?  <i>A mission statement is a written description of the present state of the business and what it intends to do in the future.  It is a proclamation about what 

the company believes is important.  It affects marketing decisions because the mission statement decides priorities, goals and objectives.  Marketing strategies and tactics must serve the goals and objectives.</i>

<p>2.  Peter Drucker believes that a business should be defined by answering three questions.  What are these questions?  <i>Who are our customers?  What do they buy from us?  What are they looking for in our products?</i> 

<p>3.  Do nonprofit organizations and governments have mission statements?  Should they?  Explain your answer. <i>Often a nonprofit (also called a not-for-profit) or government agency will provide a vision statement.  Others have mission statements.  It i

s important for all organizations to establish a consensus statement about what they are and what they intend to become. </i>


<h3>MINI-CASES</h3>

<h4>Mini-Case 2.1: Small Can Be Beautiful for Niche Marketers</h4>
                     
<p>Niche marketers seek parts of a market that typically are smaller and more tightly targeted.  Niche marketers are the opposite of mass marketers who offer their products to the mass market or very large parts of the mass.  Larder of Lady Bustle (LLB) i

s an unusual name for a profitable niche marketer that illustrates how developing your distinctive competencies and working hard to satisfy customers can be profitable. 

<p>1.  What do you think is in LLB's mission statement? <i> A statement that stresses how the business will deliver only the finest quality products that continue to delight customers. </i> 

<p>2.  What environmental factors might influence LLB's business?  <i>The economy is a factor because a downturn (recession) could erode their customer base as they are selling a nonessential product.  Competition from other niche marketers offering their

 products through specialty catalogs could challenge their market share.  Changes in culture and society, particularly an increased emphasis on healthy foods can affect their sales if their products are perceived by consumers as too rich. </i>

<p>3.  Do you think that small niche businesses plan?  Do they have marketing plans?  Explain your answers.  <i>To get an SBA or bank business loan, a small business must submit a business plan that includes a marketing plan.  To be profitable, the busine

ss should continue to plan to avoid problems and seize opportunities.</i>


<h4>Mini-Case 2.2: Euro Disney: Even a Master Marketer's Plans Can Go  Wrong</h4>
 
<p> Walt Disney Co. is an entertainment giant.  It is very successful with its entertainment parks in Florida (Disney World), California (Disney Land), and Japan (Tokyo Disney).  It has not performed as well in Europe, where Euro Disney opened outside Par

is in 1992.  Many factors have contributed to Disney's inability to turn a profit in Europe.  This case identifies some of these environmental influences.

<p>1.  Disney's Older parks (in Orlando, Anaheim, and Tokyo) are all profitable.  What effect might their profitability have had on Disney's decisions for Euro Disney? <i> Being successful in the other locations may have lulled Disney into a sense of infa

llibility.  Disney's planners might not have anticipated some unique problems that would face them in France, from the climate to French coolness toward many parts of American culture.</i>

<p>2.  Even a company of Disney's size cannot directly affect the European economy.  Does this mean that what a marketer can't control shouldn't be considered in planning?   <i>No!  If this were the case, marketers wouldn't ever make plans because so many

 environmental factors are beyond their control.</i>  


<h3>WHAT DO YOU THINK?</h3>

<p>This section introduces the idea that marketing is a boundary spanning activity.  Marketers link the businesses' internal environments with its external environments.  Because marketers interact directly with consumers, competitors, and other external 

environment factors, they are in an excellent position to collect information that can be used to make marketing decisions and develop marketing plans.  Another way of collecting commercial intelligence is to purchase products made by competitors and auto

psy them, looking ways to make improvements in your own product.  This is commercial intelligence, not commercial espionage, which is illegal and unethical.  What do you think about the practice of product autopsy?  Is it a good idea?  Why or why not? <i>

It is essential to know what differentiates your product from competing products.  You also assume that as you are examining the competition's products, they are doing the same to your products.  Remember, the key is to collect commercial intelligence and

 not commit commercial espionage.</i>


<h2><a name="internet">USING THE INTERNET</a></h2>

<p>Those of you connecting to the Internet by Lynx have found that it provides very rapid information transfer.  This full featured Web browser is a product of the Academic Computing Services of The University of Kansas.  It is copyrighted by the Universi

ty and provided free for noncommercial, educational use.  For more information on Lynx, look for a file "About Lynx" that typically is located on the home page of those educational institutions using the Lynx browser.</p>  

<p>If you are getting ready to make Internet assignments, remember to caution students about the downside of Internet use.  Stress again that their conduct on the Internet through your class must be professional always.  There are enough Net-nuisances alr

eady out there already, so please don't add to their numbers! </p>

<p>Because of the Web's volatility, the accuracy of information and addresses provided cannot be guaranteed.  Internet assignments in this Manual have been checked and rechecked.  However, sites on the Web change so rapidly that it would be impossible to 

maintain 100 percent accuracy.  That is why it is essential that you verify Internet addresses and confirm the feasibility of an Internet assignment before you make it.</p>

<h3>Internet Assignments</h3>

<p>Chapter 2 has several topics that lend themselves to Internet explorations.  For example:</p>

<p>Students who are interested in the <b>International Marketing Report</b> (page 40 of the text) can learn more about NAFTA on the Internet.  The agreement is located at the Department of Commerce and at several universities.  If your school has access t

o an on-line document search system such as CARL (Colorado Alliance of Research Libraries) or FirstSearch, students can find many current articles about NAFTA.  Use this information in a class debate about whether NAFTA will have positive or negative effe

cts on marketing products in the three countries -- the United States, Mexico, and Canada. </p>

<p><b>Marketing Application 2.1</b> (page 39 of the text) emphasizes the importance of satisfying consumers.  It presents an opportunity for students to compare local retail stores by the success of their customer satisfaction efforts.  This important iss

ue can also be explored on the Internet.  Teams of students can visit Web sites to learn if and how businesses state their intention of satisfying consumers.  Students can do a content analysis and comparison of consumer satisfaction statements made by se

veral businesses in the same industry.  These statements can be evaluated within home pages, often through links that provide information about company history or with AT&T, its Fact Book.  They must search because the information appears at different loc

ations on business home pages.  As you cruise the Web, you'll find other sites that can be used for this assignment.  Caution your students that a visit to a business home page is analogous to a visit in person to a corporate office.  Professional behavio

<h2><a name="marketing">MARKETING APPLICATIONS</a></h2>

<h4>MARKETING APPLICATION 2.1</h4>

<p>Marketers' observations of consumers and consuming situations are frequently used in planning and marketing decision making.  In this <b>Application</b>, students are asked to record their own observations of how retail stores satisfy consumers.  It ca

lls for them to evaluate a store on dimensions that are often important to consumers.  If grocery stores are not appropriate to your class, let them select other types of retail stores, for example fast food, sports equipment, athletic shoes, or music.  I

f they use other retailers, be sure that they also develop a suitable list of features for their evaluation.  Rather than have a general discussion of their findings, you might have students form small discussion groups.  Each group can compare their anal

yses and answer the questions in the <b>Application</b> on page 39 of the text.  Ask each group to prepare a short oral summation of their analysis for presentation to the class.</p>  


<h4>MARKETING APPLICATION 2.2</h4>

<p>While this Application deals directly with media planning, specifically advertising scheduling, impress on your students how plans are made for all kinds of marketing activities.  Students in teams or small groups should block out a 12-month time line 

on which they can record their media buying decisions.  They need to estimate demand cycles.  For example, students should analyze the times when flowers are most in demand and when they are least in demand.  For what situations do consumers purchase flow

ers?  Which holidays are associated with flower gifts?  Media spending decisions are based on observations about consumer demand and particularly, peak demand periods.  Allow sufficient time <u>before</u> each demand peak so advertising can be heavied up 

before that peak.  You can extend this planning exercise by having a guest speaker meet with the class to discuss advertising media planning for a florist or other specialty retailer. </p>  


<h4>MARKETING APPLICATION 2.3</h4>

 <p>Mission statements are not easy to write, as your students will find out when they try to write one for the U.S. Postal Service and another delivery service.  Two differences between the Postal Service and other delivery systems are the government aff

iliation of the former and the profitability of the latter.  As an alternative to delivery services, have student teams write mission statements for two competitors in other industries, for example Coca Cola and PepsiCo; Apple Computer and Dell Computer; 

AT&T and Sprint.  An Internet application relates to this task, as it provides a roadmap to the United States Postal Service, UPS, and Securities and Exchange Commission reports in the EDGAR-SEC files.  Mission statements can be inferred from the Part I G

eneral Business discussion in  10-K Reports.  Alternately, students can find mission statements on home pages of competing businesses, then compare their contents.</p>


<h4>MARKETING APPLICATION 2.4</h4> 

<p>Many different environments affect not-for-profit organizations and governments.  For example, a not-for-profit hospital faces the same environments, internal and external, as a for-profit hospital faces, with one exception.  The not-for-profit hospita

l does not have to satisfy stockholders by earning a profit.  However, both must market their services and face such internal environments as other operating departments within the hospital, other hospital units, and the hospital's culture.  External envi

ronments include suppliers, customers, competitors, society, the economy, government, laws and regulations, science/technology, and the public.</p>



<h2><a name="consumer">CONSUMER INSIGHTS AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETING </a></h2>

<h4>CONSUMER INSIGHT 2.1</h4>

<p>The Small Business Administration's (SBA) Small Business Development Centers (SBDCs) have been extremely helpful to small businesses in such practical areas as marketing planning.  However, as the <b>Consumer Insight</b> (page 47 of the text) was writt

en, the SBA and SBDCs were under Congressional attack and their future funding was seriously in doubt.  At least for the immediate future, SBDCs are a resource that small businesses can rely on to provide marketing assistance.  A related Internet activity

 provides a roadmap to SBAONLINE, the Internet files of the Small Business Administration.  This site offers marketing success stories of real SBA clients, and information about the SBA and SBDCs.  Ask your students if they, their families, or employers h

ave ever used the services of an SBDC, particularly for assistance in developing a marketing plan.  Alternately, if there is an SBDC nearby, invite the marketing specialist to class as a guest speaker to discuss marketing services they offer.  A list of S

BDC contacts in each state is provided at the SBAONLINE home page.  You may also find a local SBDC under U.S. Government listing in your local telephone directory.

<h4>CONSUMER INSIGHT 2.2</h4>

<p>This <b>Consumer Insight</b> (page 57 in text) focuses on tools for identifying consumer segments.  Stress that consumer segmentation is used for businesses as well as personal use consumers.  Ask your students about zip code demographic information fo

r your city or state.  Get a zip code map from the local post office or possibly, your telephone book.  Identify different neighborhoods within the zip codes.  Using class knowledge of the kinds of homes in these areas and where the owners are employed, a

ssign names to the zip code areas that describe the inhabitants.  For example, following Claritas' example, you may identify zip codes with segments such as "profs and docs", a zip code with many professors and doctors from the local university and its me

dical center; "horses and buggies", where horse farms and riding stables are located; and "auto alley" where many assembly line workers from a local automobile factory live.</p>



<h3>INTERNATIONAL MARKETING REPORT</h3>

<p>The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is providing marketing successes for American businesses, despite the rapid devaluation of the Mexican peso during early 1995.  The economic destabilization was a setback to many businesses' plans; howeve

r, it has not stopped others from forging ahead to take advantage of the opportunities that NAFTA offers.  Now, there is growing support for an extension of NAFTA to include other Latin and South American countries.  Prime target countries are Chile and T

rinidad and Tobago.  Unexpected volatility in international markets, as illustrated by the Mexican financial crisis, can disrupt even the most carefully developed marketing plans.</p>

<title>CHAPTER 9: UNDERSTANDING PRICE</title>
</head>
                                
<h1><center>CHAPTER 9</h1>
<h1>UNDERSTANDING PRICE</center></h1>
                                
<h2>CHAPTER ABSTRACT</h2>


<p><b>1. Explain how different perspectives on price influence the
pricing process.  </b>Price is known by many different names.  There
are many different perspectives on price.  Concern about price
has risen in the past several decades, fueled by changes in the
economic environment, swings in consumer confidence, and
increased domestic and international price competition.  Consumer
confidence is an important indicator of future purchase
behaviors.  This has obvious price implications.  When consumers
are not confident of their jobs and futures, their spending
usually declines, they become more price sensitivity, and
marketers consider this in their price decisions.


<p><b>2. Describe how pricing decisions are made.  </b>The many different
perspectives on price also affect the marketer's pricing
decisions.  Consumers often perceive price as a surrogate for
value cues.  Some consumers are price conscious, others are not. 
Consumers make price comparisons between products, using this
information in their purchase decisions.  Price is an allocation
device, rationing products among consumers and balancing supply
and demand.  For most products, the law of demand holds so that
price and demand move in opposite directions.  For essential
products, inelastic demand prevails so that a change in price
does not have the expected effect on demand.  Because these
products are necessities, consumers will continue to purchase
them (up to a point) even when prices are raised.  A marketer
must be aware of the various perspectives on price, including
those of the government, consumers, the business, the
competition, and channel of distribution members.


<p><b>3. Discuss further influences on price.  </b>There are other
influences on price, including such factors as costs, the
economy, seasons, special events, nature, and suppliers.


<p><b>4. Describe the four decisions made during pricing.  </b>Good
information, collected from internal and external sources, is
essential to making good price decisions.  Some price decisions
follow the price set by the market leader, others are seat of the
pants price decisions, highly intuitive and subjective.  Pricing
decisions generally follow four steps: setting price objectives,
formulating a pricing strategy, setting price tactics, and making
price adjustments, if and as needed.


<p><b>5. Discuss popular pricing practices.  </b>Prices change as a result
of the influence of many different factors.  Marketers use a
variety of pricing approaches, including odd/even, loss leader,
bundled, prestige, time-period, and trial pricing.  All of these
approaches serve different goals that price must accomplish for
the marketer.


<p><b>6. Decide if price is an art or a science.  </b>Most marketers will
tell you that pricing is both an art and a science.  While many
marketers use statistical models and computer simulations to help
set prices, often the final price is determined with considerable
input from experienced marketers who have developed a keen sense
of what the market will tolerate.  There is a place for both
objective, statistical and subjective, judgmental input to price
decisions.


<p><b>7. Discuss the interrelationship among price and the other
marketing mix variables (product, place, and promotion).  </b>Price
is a critical marketing mix variable and the one that most
directly and quickly affects revenue.  However, price cannot be
considered apart from the other marketing mix variables (product,
place, and promotion) that also significantly affect the price
that consumers are willing to pay for a product.  

<h2><a name="teaching tips">SOME TEACHING TIPS</a></h2>

<p>The Chapter 9 opening question asks: "Why is it so difficult
for marketers to arrive at the right price for a product?  The
crux of this question relates to the question of self-interest.
From the marketer's perspective, the right price for a product
will achieve the marketer's self-interest goals of covering
costs, generating revenue, and achieving profit goals.  The
marketer's price may not be the right price for consumers, who
are operating on their own rules of self-interest.  When there is
a misalignment between marketer and consumer perspectives about
the right price, the result can be disaster as consumer purchases
dry up.  The determination of what is right in pricing has to
satisfy multiple parties and still be in line with the
competition's prices.

<p>     Consumer self-interest expresses itself differently
according to the situation and what the consumer values.  For
price conscious consumers, the self-interest rule usually calls
for paying as little as possible for as much product as possible. 
For quality conscious consumers, the self-interest rule states
that the consumer values quality and will correlate price and
quality, when other product quality information is absent.

<p>     An excellent illustration of the strong influence of price
on consumer perceptions of quality appears in a book by Robert B.
Cialdini (1993).  The author sites a true case (paraphrased
below) as an example of the power of price to convey messages
about product quality, particularly when other quality cues are
absent.  

<p>     The owner of a Native American jewelry store in Arizona was
     having difficulty selling some good quality turquoise
     jewelry at a fair price.  She tried everything, from
     displaying the jewelry in a central store location to having
     her sales staff hard sell the pieces.  It was the height of
     the tourist season, the store was jammed with tourists, but
     the jewelry wasn't selling.  

<p>     The night before she was due to leave town on a business
     trip, the store owner wrote her head salesperson a note
     telling her to sell the jewelry at "price X 1/2", even
     though this meant a loss.  When she returned several days
     later, she wasn't surprised to find the jewelry sold out. 
     However, she was shocked to find that the salesperson had
     misread her note and instead of marking the jewelry down
     half price, each piece had been remarked to "2 X" and sold
     at twice the original price! 

<p>The explanation for the tourists' behavior lies in their
having very little knowledge about the quality of the turquoise
jewelry.  They perceived the initial price as too low for good
quality jewelry, when it actually was a fair price.  They bought
the jewelry at double the price because they were following a
stereotype that price equals quality, when no other quality
information is available.  For quality conscious consumers, price
often is the surrogate for quality.

<p>     Students can provide examples of other products for which
price is a quality proxy.  Ask them to consider service products
along with tangible goods where price conveys information that
some consumers need in order to make a purchase decision.

<p><b>The Dollar Standard</b>

<p>     The <b>International Marketing Report</b> (page 269 of the text)
highlights the use of the U.S. dollar at the currency standard in
many countries.  An activity in the Using the Internet section of
this chapter identifies an information source for students to
check current country currency rates of exchange.  Rates of
exchange and their fluctuation can have dramatic effects on
price.  For example, in mid-1995 the dollar was sinking in value
against the Japanese yen and the United States government was
threatening a trade war over the closed Japanese automobile
market.  A weak dollar means American goods are cheaper in
countries that have a strong currency against the dollar.  A
strong dollar means American goods are priced higher because the
foreign currency is weaker.  Which situation (weak or strong
dollar) favors the pricing of American products abroad?  Which
situation (weak or strong dollar) means that American consumers
will pay a higher price for imported foreign products in the
United States?

<p>     This point can be emphasized by having students track the
dollar against several major foreign currencies over several
months.  Currency exchange rates can be tracked in hard copy
publications such as The Wall Street Journal, in a local
newspaper, or on the Internet.  At the end of the tracking
period, have students consider whether any swings in currency
rates that occurred might have been sufficient to increase prices
for consumer products.  Would the effects have been experienced
equally by personal use and business/organization consumers
making product purchases?

<p><b>Consumer Confidence And Business Cycles</b>

<p>     Consumer confidence is an important concept for marketers
trying to predict how prices will affect demand.  Consumer
confidence is often cited as a numerical representation of
consumer willingness to make purchases and invest in the future,
as a function of their current feelings about their job security
and future.  It is used to track changes in consumer attitudes
over time.  The information is derived from surveys most often
associated with the University of Michigan's Survey Research
Center and the nonpartisan Conference Board's Consumer Confidence
Index.

<p>     Sales forecasts can be made regionally, based on regional
differences in levels of consumer confidence.  Since consumer
confidence is a gauge of consumers' attitudes toward making
purchases, marketers can use the information to forecast demand
and make corresponding geographic supply adjustments.  Chrysler
Corporation places a high priority on the use of consumer
confidence data to predict purchase behavior (Shaver 1992). 
Surveys also provide information about consumers' intentions to
purchase major appliances, homes, and furniture.  This is
valuable demand information for these industries.  When consumer
confidence begins to grow, marketers can stimulate demand even
further by providing price incentives and sales promotions.  

<p>     Consumer confidence is closely linked to business cycles and
changes in the economic environment.  These cycles are periods
when levels of business activity change as a result of many
converging factors including imbalances in supply and demand, raw
materials shortages, government spending and policies, and
international conditions.  Over time, business and the economy
experience different activity level cycles that affect the entire
society.  For the most part, all the economies of the world's
industrialized countries generally tend to run parallel business
cycles because of their economic interdependency.  However, the
point at which a cycle begins to turn (begins or ends) may not be
the same in each country.   

<p>     The business cycles we hear the most about are prosperity,
recession, depression, and recovery.

<ul>
<li>Prosperity describes a period when business activity,
     production, employment, and consumption are high. 
     Generally, personal use consumers "feel good" about their
     jobs and their futures; businesses are willing to invest
     capital in expansion, employees, and future growth.  A sense
     of optimism is reflected in greater purchases of
     nonessential and luxury products, and indulgence in
     vacations and consumer durable products.  Consumer
     confidence is high as consumers feel great optimism for the
     future and make big ticket purchases that can be paid off
     over time.

<li>Recession occurs as business activity slows, production
     declines, demand falls, and inventory rises, at least in the
     short run.  Unemployment rises as businesses delay
     investment and reduce production.  Purchases by both
     personal use and business/organization consumers tend to
     return to essentials, frill and luxury purchases are
     delayed, and consumers of both types become more price
     sensitive.  Consumer confidence falls, consumers become more
     apprehensive about the future, and are less willing to make
     big ticket purchases or incur large debt.

<li>Depression is the most severe period where business activity
     is heavily curtailed, unemployment rises to a peak, demand
     and production fall, and capital investments virtually
     cease.  Consumer confidence falls to its lowest levels, and
     consumers struggle to hold on to what they have and not lose
     their investments, homes, or jobs.  The United States and
     the industrialized countries experienced The Great
     Depression beginning in 1929 and running through the early
     1930s to the beginning of World War II.  The terrible
     economic times, high unemployment, and consumer pessimism
     contributed to political unrest and social turmoil.

<li>Recovery occurs when conditions start to improve. 
     Unemployment begins to fall as production increases.  Demand
     rises, and as it does, businesses begin to invest more in
     production and the future.  Consumer confidence rises, but
     consumers  are cautious, waiting for a full recovery.
</ul>

<p>     Two other influences on consumer spending, inflation and
deflation, also affect the economy and prices.  Inflation occurs
when prices rise more rapidly than incomes and is most often
associated with growth and prosperity.  As this occurs, consumer
buying power shrinks and consumers have a tendency to accelerate
their purchases because they are apprehensive about future price
rises.  As they "stock up" at lower current prices, the
purchasing frenzy also reduces the rate of savings.  Deflation
occurs when prices fall because demand is reduced.  As this
occurs, revenues fall off and profits dry up.  Deflation often
accompanies the beginning of a recession.

<p>     Marketers can't afford to hide when the economy swings into
a new cycle.  They must respond to changes in the marketplace and
business activity in order to increase their chance of profiting
and surviving.  To emphasize this point, guide students through a
discussion of marketer responses to changes in business cycles. 
Begin by having them complete a simple table (example below) that
describes what happens generally to demand, employment,
production, investment, and consumer confidence during each
business cycle.  This can be conveyed by using arrows: up arrow =
increasing, down arrow = decreasing.  For each business cycle,
have students identify what happens to consumer spending by using
a plus (+) or a minus (-) in the consumer confidence column. 
Stress that these are generalizations and exceptions can be found
of businesses thriving in a depression and others perishing in a
growth period.

     Car)," <i>American Demographics</i> (September): 59-60.

<p><b>Price and Mass Customization </b>

<p>     Unless a consumer is willing to pay a high price for a
custom made product, the alternative is a mass produced product
with a few model variations offered at different price points. 
However, increasingly sophisticated computer technology is
changing mass production to mass customization.  Mass
customization is also called agile manufacturing and agile
marketing.  It occurs when a producer offers a design base on
which consumers can make changes to suit their preferences,
needs, and in many cases, price constraints.  Changes are
accepted within certain categories of specifications, often
called modules.  The flexibility offered consumer types is far
greater than what is found in traditional mass production.  

<p>     In personal computers (PC), mass customization means that a
producer might ship five different basic PC models to resellers. 
The resellers offer their customers the chance to customize their
own PC at various price points depending on the options selected
(Goldberg 1995).  

<p>     In clothing, a jeans maker might offer several basic jeans
styles.  A salesperson measures the consumer and inputs the
measurements into a computer program that matches the
measurements to the nearest jeans size, often selecting from
hundreds of alternative pattern sizes.  The customer pays for the
jeans, the pattern order is sent by computer to the factory, the
pattern is cut, the jeans sewn to size, packaged, and delivered
to the customer.  The price reflects the design module selected.

<p>     In furniture, some retailers allow consumers to select from
among a series of sofa frame sizes, styles, wood types, and
cushion designs.  After the frame is selected, the consumer
selects a fabric from hundreds of possible alternative colors,
textures, and weaves.  The sofa order is placed and built to the
customer's specifications.  The price also is customized because
each selection module carries its own price point.  The consumer
has customized a sofa by selecting from a broad selection of
alternatives or modules, and prices.

<p>     In publishing, The Wall Street Journal has introduced
"...the first newspaper published for a circulation of one."  The
Personal Journal is a customized newspaper delivered to the
consumer's personal computer each business day morning.  It
contains information in categories that the consumer preselects,
such as  Wall Street Journal columns and editorials, stocks,
mutual funds, and news.  The Personal Journal is updated
continuously.  The price is less than a dollar per business day
(WSJ 1995).

<p>     Mass customization is being hailed as the next major trend
in marketing.  Some marketers believe that mass customization
will end the emphasis on segmentation and eliminate the need for
place by distributing products directly to the customer (Schultz
1994).  It also will accelerate the trend toward customized
promotion and pricing.  Production will focus on modules and
product life cycles will become even shorter (Andel 1995).

<p>     Students may have experienced mass customization if recently
they have made a personal computer or new automobile purchase. 
If anyone has remodeled their home, some window companies are
using this process so customers can customize product design.  

<p>     Ask your students to consider the questions

<p><b>Problem Areas in Pricing</b>

<p>     Pricing often is a controversial part of marketing because
of a number of illegal practices, particularly those shown in
Figure 9.4 (page 277 of the text), namely price fixing, deceptive
pricing, predatory pricing, and discriminatory pricing.  Student
teams can research these practices and report to the class about
their incidence and recent actions taken against offending
businesses.  Have any students been victimized by one of these
practices?  How did they handle the problem?  Were they satisfied
with the outcome?

<p>     Other pricing problem topics can be developed for class
debate, such as the issue of ethical concerns over pricing
particularly of ethical pharmaceutical products.  Students can
investigate the pricing of early AIDS drugs amid claims of
unfairness because of skimming pricing tactics.  Should
government regulate drug prices more stringently and force price
reductions?  What might happen to drug company research and
development if price controls are implemented?  What has been the
outcome in the past when price controls have been tried?  

<p><b>Price Wars</b>
  
<p>     There was a time when consumers loved gasoline price wars. 
Back in the days when gasoline was less than a dollar a gallon,
competing gasoline stations would sometimes get into a price war. 
Each would try to outdo the other in reducing prices, often to
the point where consumers could buy gasoline at far less than
dealers' costs.  Do consumers really benefit from a price war? 
Have any of your students experienced a price war as a consumer
or as an employee of a warring retailer?  Students often can
provide interesting perspectives on the harmful fallout of a
price war for a business and its employees.

<p><b>Setting Prices</b>

<p>     Several years ago I spent some airport waiting time in
Cincinnati talking with a marketer who worked for, as he
described it, "a big soap maker" in that city.  Since his company
is the market leader in most markets where it competes, I asked
him how the competition priced its products in these markets.  He
replied that he could predict to the penny what competing prices
would be because each company had a set rule.  Their price would
always be 1 percent, 5 percent, or even 10 percent less than his
company's price.  In other words, the competition followed the
leader, always by the same percentage, which simplified the
pricing process for them, but also gave the soap maker even
greater power in the marketplace.

<p>     The pricing process differs greatly between businesses and
industries.  If possible, invite a guest speaker to class to talk
about pricing from a first hand perspective.  Often a local
chapter of the American Marketing Association can provide a
speaker.  You can find local chapter contacts on the Internet
(see <a href="#internet">Using the Internet</a> in this chapter).

<p><b>Creative Pricing</b>

<p>     Have student teams perform a content analysis of current
newspaper, magazine, and television advertisements, as well as
their own direct mail, looking for examples of some of the
different pricing approaches identified in Figure 9.9 (page 294
of the text).  Their findings can be the basis for a class
discussion of creative pricing practices.  Are some of these
approaches difficult to understand?  Might some consumers be
misled?  Consider the last line in Figure 9.9 and discuss its
meaning for marketers and consumers.

<p>     "Note: Once you've been creative, make sure you're covered. 
     <b>The most important aspect of any pricing approach is that it
     is legal and ethical.</b>  Check with counsel."  

<p><b>Price And The Other Marketing Mix Variables</b>

<p>     If your students participated in the egg delivery system or
wooden pencil exercise, they set a price for their new product. 
Ask them to rethink how they decided on a price and what effect
the other marketing mix variables had on their price decisions. 
For example, ask them to consider

<ul>
<li>how their pricing decisions were influenced by their
     product, what changes in price could be associated with
     changes in product design and features, whether there might
     be a luxury version of their product with a prestige price

<li>how their pricing decisions were influenced by place, where
     the product could be sold and the type of retailer involved

<li>how their pricing decisions were influenced by promotion,
     decisions about how, when, and for what period of time to 
     promote the product
</ul>

<h2><a name="outline">CHAPTER OUTLINE</a></h2>

I.   Explain how different perspectives on price influence the
     pricing process
<ol>
<li>Price represents many things, including what it takes
          to purchase products and the value of things traded in
          a marketing exchange; there are many different
          perspectives about price
<li>Price has grown in importance because of many changes
          in the economic environment, swings in consumer
          confidence, and the increased incidence of price
          competition
<li>Consumer confidence influences price because of its
          relationship with price sensitivity and attitude toward
          a purchase 
</ol>

II.  Describe how pricing decisions are made
<ol>

<li>The principal meaning of price to a marketer relates to
          how price affects total revenue and profit
<li>To consumers, price is a signal used to indicate a
          product's value, particularly in the absence of other
          information
<ul>
<li>Some consumers are price conscious; others may be
               status conscious, service conscious, or quality
               conscious
<li>Consumers make price comparisons and typically
               evaluate the acceptability of a price within a
               price range
<li>Price is an allocative device 
<ol>
<li>For nonessential products, the law of demand
                    holds in predicting that when price falls,
                    demand rises; when price rises, demand falls
<li>For essential products, products that
                    consumers consider necessities of life, a
                    change in price does not result in a
                    comparable percent change in demand
</ol>
</ul>
<li>To government, price is an important factor in the
          efficient functioning of the marketplace as it brings
          supply and demand into balance
<li>Government works to ensure competitive pricing and
               currency stability
<li>The marketer's pricing authority is limited by
               government
<li>The marketer and the business view price as a marketing
          mix factor that can be changed swiftly and is a key
          element affecting revenue and profit
<ul>
<li>Marketers use price to differentiate products
<li>Price can be used to reward members of the channel
               of distribution
<li>Price is a competitive weapon
<li>Price is an area where ethical abuses are prone to
               occur
</ul>
<li>To the competition, price is a weapon that sometimes
          gets out of control and price wars can result
<ul>
<li>Price wars usually are highly destructive to the
               participants
<li>Nonprice competition has advantages over price
               competition, it is harder for the competition to
               match, but it is also usually harder for the
               marketer to implement
</ul>
<li>Channel of distribution members view price as the
          mechanism for generating revenue and profit  
</ol>

III. Discuss further influences on price
<ol>

<li>All of the perspectives on price should be considered
          when setting a price; they often are not
<li>There are many other important influences on price,
          including costs, economic conditions, seasons, special
          events, nature, and suppliers
</ol>

IV.  Describe the four decisions made during pricing
<ol>
<li>Pricing decisions often involve marketers and others
          involved in product production and delivery
<li>Pricing decisions depend on good information from both
          internal and external sources
<li>Pricing requires decisions in four areas
<ul>
<li>Setting price objectives
<li>Formulating a pricing strategy 
<li>Setting price tactics
<li>Making price adjustments, if and as needed
</ul>
</ol>

V.   Discuss popular pricing practices
<ol>

<li>Acceptable prices occur when the marketer's prices fall
          within an acceptable range, between a price ceiling and
          a price floor
<li>There are many different pricing practices, including
          odd/even, loss leader, bundling, prestige, time-period,
          and trial pricing
</ol>

VI.  Decide if price is an art or a science
<ol>
<li>Some people think pricing is an art, developed through
          years of experience, judgment, and a sense of what the
          market will tolerate
<li>Others believe that it is art and science, and that
          effective pricing requires skill in both
</ol>

VII. Discuss the interrelationship among price and the other
     marketing mix variables (product, place, and promotion)
<ol>
<li>Price is the critical marketing mix variable that most
          directly affects revenue and profit
<li>Price must be considered along with the other variables
                    of product, place, and promotion
</ol>
                    
<h2><a name="questions">SUGGESTED ANSWERS TO CHAPTER QUESTIONS</a></h2>

<h3>DISCUSSION QUESTIONS</h3>


<p>1.  Why is it so difficult for marketers to arrive at the right
price for a product.  <i>The difficulty of arriving at the right
price addresses the question of perspective.  We assume that
everyone involved in pricing has certain goals and that these
goals may conflict.  Therefore, the right price to meet the
marketer's goals can be the wrong price for consumers, and vice
versa.</i>

<p>2.  Following are some of the names used for price - explain what
the consumer gets for each price: rent, tuition, toll, charitable
donation.  <i>Standard exchanges for each of the prices are that
rent gives the consumer a product to use for a predetermined time
period; tuition gives the consumer access to an educational
opportunity; a toll gives a consumer permission to travel on a
road or pass over a bridge; a charitable donation gives a
consumer a feeling of satisfaction for contributing to a worthy
cause.</i>

<p>3.  Discuss some of the reasons for the increasing importance of
price to marketers and consumers.  <i>Price has grown in importance
because the latter years of the 20th century have seen an
increase in price competition.  It has been a period of economic
growth and then recession, economic uncertainty, swings in
consumer confidence, deregulation, and increased foreign
competition domestically and abroad. </i>

<p>4.  What is consumer confidence?  Why should marketers be
concerned when consumers lack confidence?   <i>Consumer confidence
describes the positive or negative feelings consumers have about
the present, the future, their job security, and their spending
ability.  It is a predictor of consumer spending and can be used
to forecast demand.</i>

<p>5.  Give an example of the purchase behavior of each of the
following consumers: status conscious, price conscious, service
conscious.  <i>A status conscious consumer purchases high price
products in order to demonstrate economic well being, social
status, or prestige; a price conscious consumer prefers to pay as
little as possible for as much product as possible; a service
conscious consumer values service and will pay a higher price in
order to get it.</i>

<p>6.  In your own words, explain the relationship between price and
quantity sold, as expressed in the law of demand.  <i>The law of
demand states that there is an inverse relationship between price
and quantity demanded (sold), so that when price rises, demand
falls; when price falls, demand rises.  </i>

<p>7.  Milk, gasoline, and urgent medical treatment are examples of
inelastic products.  What does this mean?  <i>These products are
essential to consumers, so they continue to purchase the products
even when their prices rise because the products are extremely
important in their lives.  </i>

<p>8.  Why is the government concerned about the prices charged for
products?  Should the government be concerned about prices?  What
do you think?  <i>Government is very concerned about price because
it plays such an important allocative role in the economy. 
Government wants to ensure fair price competition to keep the
free market healthy and protect consumers against illegal pricing
practices.  Government has a legitimate role in pricing, although
sometimes it overreacts and does harm.  Government also plays an
important role in setting national policy which affects price,
and tries to maintain the stability of the currency. </i>

<p>9.  What is a price war?  Is it good for consumers?  <i>When
aggressive price competition gets out of hand, it sometimes
results in a price war.  This means competitors intensify their
efforts to undercut each other on price.  It may benefit
consumers in the short term, as they take advantage of price
cuts.  However, in the long term it can be harmful because it can
drive competitors from the market, which ultimately reduces
choices and raises prices.</i>

<p>10.  Explain this statement: "Price and costs are inextricably
linked."  <i>Most businesses link the two because the first part of
the goal for price to accomplish is to raise sufficient revenue
to cover costs, then an additional amount to provide a profit.</i>

<p>11.  What happens if the marketer's price range for a product and
the consumer's range of acceptable prices are not similar?  <i>This
means price incompatible.  Generally the result is that the
consumer will not make a purchase.  However, if the product is
essential (demand is inelastic) and there are no alternatives,
the consumer may still make a purchase, at least in the short
term.</i>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING</h3>

<h4>Check Your Understanding 9.1 </h4>

<p>1.  Describe some of the meanings commonly applied to price.  
<i>Price can be identified in terms of currency used, for example as
dollars, yen, or pesos.  Price is the value of things traded in a
marketing exchange.  It is a measure of what must be given up in
order to make an exchange.  It is called many different things,
including rent, tuition, fee, ticket, and tax.</i>

<p>2.  Explain this statement: "Price is a matter of perspective."
<i>Price has different meanings depending on whose perspective is
taken.  Price often reflects self-interest, for example marketers
serve their self-interest by using price to generate revenue and
profit; price conscious consumers serve their self-interest by
trying to get as much product as possible for as low a price as
possible. </i>
 
<p>3.  Discuss the various perspectives on price.  <i>Among the most
important perspectives are those of the marketer and the
business, consumers, government, the competition, and members of
the channel of distribution.  Each has a different perspective on
price and each attempts to satisfy their self-interest in the
process.  For example, consumers look at price as a signal, a cue
about quality, value, status, and quantity.  Marketers view price
as a means to achieve goals.  Government's perspective on price
is complex because price serves such an important allocative role
in the economy.  </i>

<h4>Check Your Understanding 9.2 </h4>

<p>Describe the many factors that influence price.  <i>Price is
influenced by many factors because it does not exist in a vacuum. 
All of the different perspectives on price can influence it.  It
also is affected by costs, the economy, seasons, special events,
nature, and suppliers.</i>

<h4>Check Your Understanding 9.3 </h4>

<p>Describe the steps in making a price decision.  <i>Although some
marketers follow the market leader is setting their product
prices and others price "by the seat of their pants," most follow
some general pricing steps.  These steps are setting price
objectives, formulating a pricing strategy, setting price
tactics, and making price adjustments, if and as needed. </i>

<h4>Check Your Understanding 9.4</h4>

<p>1.  Discuss commonly used pricing practices.  <i>There are many
different approaches used in pricing, including leader pricing,
demand-based, odd/even, loss leader, bundled, and prestige
pricing.  Each approach may provide a different price in order to
serve a different goal.  Several different price approaches are
typically used over a product's life.  </i>

<p>2.  Is price art or science?  <i>Most marketers believe it is both
and effective pricing requires use of demand forecasts and
mathematical models along with good judgment and experience.</i>

<p>3.  Describe the interrelationships of price and the other
marketing mix variables.  <i>Price directly generates revenue;
however, price affects and is affected by product, place, and
promotion.  Marketers must take all the marketing mix variables
into consideration when setting prices.</i>



<h3>MINI-CASES</h3>
                                
<h4>Mini-Case 9.1: The Price You See Is The Price You Pay - No Haggling</h4>

<p>     No-dicker car shopping has its advantages for many
consumers.  Some of your students may have had experience with
no-haggling at a local Saturn dealership.  If so, ask them to
share their observations of the process and make comparisons with
traditional car shopping.  One point to investigate is whether or
not there was any flexibility to the process.  For example, was
their room to negotiate over a discount for a trade-in.

<p>1.  Do you think that a no-negotiating pricing policy will appeal
to all consumers?  What types of consumers might not like this
price strategy?  <i>It is probably impossible to come up with any
marketing strategy that will appeal to all consumers, and that
includes pricing.  Price-conscious consumers might prefer to
negotiate, believing that they can dicker the price down.  Some
consumers enjoy the sport of negotiating; most do not!</i>

<p>2.  What is the risk for the car dealer who adopts the no-haggling pricing strategy?  <i>There is a threat from the Department
of Justice, as it considers whether or not no-haggling is
anticonsumer and in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act. 
Another risk is that the dealer will be undercut by the
competition, which will cost the dealer sales.  By adopting the
no-haggling strategy, dealers lock themselves into an inflexible
position that can backfire when price competition becomes
aggressive.</i>

<p>3.  Do you think no-negotiating pricing is anticonsumer?     
<i>Answers will vary.  It can be interpreted as being anticonsumer,
if it is also assumed that consumers can do better by
negotiating.  Others believe that consumers benefit because car
dealers always have the upper hand in the negotiations.</i>

<h4>Mini-Case 6.2: To Lease Or Not To Lease: Is There A Question?</h4>
 
<p>     With the price of new cars soaring, many consumers have
turned to leasing as an attractive alternative.  There is a high
probability that some of your students have leased cars.  Ask
them what they believe are the advantages of leasing.  Others
will probably feel very strongly that leasing is bad economics. 
This topic lends itself to a student debate.  Since there is a
considerable literature on automobile leasing, student teams can
research the pros and cons, then present their results to the
class.

<p>1.  Do you think leasing rather than purchasing a new automobile
is a good idea for all consumers?  <i>No idea can possibly be good
for all consumers.  It certainly is a good idea for some
consumers.</i>

<p>2.  Could automobile leasing be bad for the economy?  <i>It possibly
will have negative effects on new car production, because the
market will be flooded with cars coming off lease.  As a result,
the used car market will boom, both as a result of the stock of
good used cars and the high price of new cars.  This will reduce
demand for new cars.</i>

<p>3.  What are automakers and dealers going to do with all the cars
coming back from being leased?  <i>They are going to expand their
used car lots and profit from used car sales.</i>
                                
<h3>WHAT DO YOU THINK?</h3>

<p>     FlaskBake is a great new product.  Most busy consumers will
be very interested in this time saving product, once the price
becomes more competitive with traditional ovens.  Ask your
students whether they would be interested.  At what price would
they begin to be interested; at what price would they certainly
purchase the oven?

<h2><a name="internet">USING THE INTERNET</a></h2>

<p>     Please verify all Internet addresses and confirm the
feasibility of an Internet assignment <b>before</b> you make it.  No
guarantee of any Internet address or information can be made past
this <b><i>Manual's</b></i> publication date.  However, suggestions for <b>Using
the Internet</i> should provide ideas for ways that you can use the
Internet productively in your marketing class.  Be sure to
impress on your students the importance of professional behavior
on the Net, at all times.

<h3>Internet Assignments</h3>
 
     <p>Students should learn to use the Internet to search for
information.  Since the Internet can be used to make product
comparisons, and price information is often included, students
can compare the relative advantages of several different search
tools for gathering product and price information.

<p>     Consider the example of a consumer who wants to find out
more about an Apple Macintosh computer.  This includes obtaining
information about product specifications, retail prices, and
purchase options.  Since this exercise seeks to compare how
different search engines locate "Apple Computer" links, it is not
designed for in-depth product or price comparisons, although that
can be added, if time permits.  

<p>     The assignment can be approached in several ways.  It can be
performed individually, with each student selecting one search
tool, then collaborating with others to compare tools. 
Alternately, each student can use two search tools and compare
them.  A dyad or small team of students can work together, using
several different search tools.  Two outcomes are expected: a
short written memo (describing how the assignment was conducted
and presenting the results) and a short oral presentation to the
class.  

<p>     Although six search tools are identified, there are many
others.  Personal experience with veronica suggests that it is
often "too busy" to offer much help.  If you prefer other search
engines, please use them.  Likewise, if you prefer to use a
different product for the search comparison, check it out
carefully before assigning it and if it is feasible, use it.

<h3>MARKETING APPLICATIONS</h3>


<h4>MARKETING APPLICATION 9.1</h4>


<p>     Comparison shopping can be performed in stores, using print
advertisements, and on the Internet.  However the comparisons are
made, students should draw conclusions about pricing practices
from their observations.  Their conclusions can be reported in
memo form and/or in a short oral presentation to the class. 
Comparison shopping is a routinely practiced part of collecting
competitive intelligence.  If you haven't debated the issue of
competitive intelligence versus competitive espionage previously,
it can be introduced at this point.


<h4>MARKETING APPLICATION 9.2</h4>

<p>     Special event pricing is fairly common.  Students should be
familiar with higher than usual movie ticket prices for highly
promoted, eagerly anticipated motion pictures.  Likewise, concert
tours by popular bands use special event pricing.  A content
analysis of your local newspaper's entertainment listings may
provide prices for special events.  A comparison of prices for
these events should provide insight into the value that the
ticket sellers are placing on the event in anticipation of what
consumers are willing to pay.  Students typically are eager to
express their opinions about special event pricing, particularly
for events they dearly wish to attend but whose ticket prices are
beyond their budgets.


<h4>MARKETING APPLICATION 9.3</h4>

<p>     Price discounting by age rarely causes complaints.  However,
when such discounting is withdrawn, consumers usually protest
quite vocally.  This was the case when airlines began charging
fares for small children rather than letting them sit on parent's
laps.  Safety concerns were the cause of the change, yet that did
little to soften the blow.  Students can investigate the use of
senior citizen discounts by friends and relatives who qualify for
such price benefits.  Are the age discounts popular?  Which types
of products are most often associated with senior discounts?


<h4>MARKETING APPLICATION 9.4 </h4>

<p>     Loss leaders are usually featured quite prominently in
weekly newspaper advertisements for local grocery stores.  Often
they are accompanied by cents off coupons.  Do loss leaders draw
consumers into stores?  Students can research this question by
constructing a simple survey and administering it to other
students, friends, and relatives.  Compile the results in class
to determine why consumers shop where they do, and whether or not
they pay attention to loss leaders in the print advertisements or
in the store.


<h3>INTERNATIONAL MARKETING </h3>


<h4>INTERNATIONAL MARKETING REPORT</h4>

<p>     One certainty about the U.S. dollar is that nothing is
certain.  It is being used worldwide as a currency standard, yet
it continues to lose strength against most major currencies.  At
the same time, it is strong compared to our major trading
partners, Mexico and Canada.  Because of the dollar's
fluctuations, students can get a better picture of its current
status by conducting research on the subject, either in the
library or on the Internet.</p>

<h1><center>CHAPTER 5</h1>
<h1> MULTICULTURAL AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETING</center></h1>

 <h2>CHAPTER ABSTRACT</h2>

<p><b>1. Explain why marketers should develop cultural understanding.</b>  
The United States is the world's most culturally diverse society. 
Even if marketers have no intention of marketing internationally,
where cultural differences are expected, they face increasing
cultural diversity in their own domestic market.  As a result,
successful marketers develop cultural understanding and
sensitivity to cultural differences, and avoid cultural myopia
and the self-reference criteria.  Learning to market to
culturally diverse consumers increases the probability of being
able to satisfy them.  Marketers also are culture change agents
and must recognize how powerful marketing can be in speeding
culture change.


<p><b>2. Identify the three largest ethnic microcultures in the United
States.</b>   The three largest ethnic microcultures in the United
States are African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, and Asian-Americans.  Even though consumers may be identified with one of
these groups and group members may share some consumer
preferences and behaviors, individual differences occur and they
may be quite profound.

<p><b>3. Discuss how and why businesses go international.</b>  Businesses
go international for a number of different reasons.  Some
businesses go international by accident, when faced with
unexpected foreign demand for their products.  Others follow key
customers abroad in order to service them.  The most common
reasons are to generate revenue, escape domestic competition,
prolong product life, receive tax incentives, and dispose of
discontinued goods.  The ways that businesses go international
are equally diverse.  Entry strategies include direct and
indirect exporting, joint ventures, wholly owned subsidiaries,
licensing, and franchising.

<p><b>4. Describe the environment of international marketing. </b>
Successful international marketers must consider environmental
factors when planning and implementing marketing activities. 
Among the most important environmental factors are culture,
political and legal factors, and economic factors, including
technology and level of economic development.


<p><b>5. Analyze the contemporary issues facing international
marketers.</b>  Three extremely important contemporary issues facing
international marketers involve the North American Free Trade
Agreement (NAFTA), European integration, and the emergence of the
Pacific Rim.  All of these issues have implications for free
trade and international competitiveness.

<h2><a name="teaching tips">SOME TEACHING TIPS</a></h2>
                 
<p>Some of us teach in schools that are culturally homogeneous;
others teach in schools whose students come from diverse national
and cultural backgrounds.  In the former situation, I have drawn
on the resources of the school's international student office to
find volunteers for cross-cultural interviews with marketing
students.  International students, or domestic students whose
parents are foreign-born, are valuable class resources for
providing insights about consumer activities in their ancestral
countries.       

<b>Conducting Cross-Cultural Interviews</b>

 <p><b>Marketing Application 5.5</b> (page 157 of the text) presents a
marketing problem that would benefit from information obtained
through cross-cultural interviews.  This process can be broadened
to learn more generally about a country and its consumers.  If
possible, arrange to match each of your students with an
international student so they can participate in a cross-cultural
interview.  As an ice breaker, I sponsor a cookies and punch
social in the school cafeteria for my class and the cooperating
international students.  To ensure that everyone clearly
understands the process, I spend several minutes introducing
myself, my class, and the purpose of the activity.  For the rest
of the time, students meet with their interview partner and begin
the interview process.  Often it can be completed in one session;
other times the interview extends to several meetings.  The
interviews are based on questions developed by the class.  An
example of the types of question categories generated by students
is provided on the next page.  This assignment requires that
students conduct the interview, analyze the results, identify one
good product opportunity for the country, and report on the
product opportunity orally to the class and in written memo form.

<p>If you have enough international students participating in
the cross-cultural interviews, you will find that several are
from the same country.  If so, have your students compare 
results from shared country interviews.  See if they can arrive
at a consensus good product opportunity based on an analysis of</p>

might be used for products marketed in the U.S. domestic market.  

<b>Student Memo Writing</b>

<p>Students need to develop good communication skills. 
Marketing professionals frequently criticize students for their
communication deficiencies, and marketing educators for failing
to correct the deficiencies.

<p>The memorandum is the principal mechanism for transferring
important information within a business or organization.  Memos
are workhorses, essential to efficient information flow yet often
misused and abused.  You can help your students develop effective
memo writing skills by providing memo writing guidelines in
class, linking memo writing to marketing assignments, and giving
students constructive feedback for improving their writing
skills.

<p>Before making a memo writing assignment, I provide a list of
memo guidelines.  If you have other suggestions, add them to the
following list.

                   <p><b><center>Memo Guidelines</center></b>         

<ul>
<li>
Clearly state to yourself the purpose of the memo; what you
     hope to achieve by sending it 

<li>Know who you are sending the memo to, his or her level of
     responsibility, technical expertise, and knowledge of the
     memo's topic

<li>Consider who else might read the memo and whether this will
     affect what you say and how you say it

<li>Make an outline of the points you intend to make in the memo
     before you begin to write

<li>Use a heading that is standard for your business or
     organization.  This usually includes the date, name(s) of
     the recipient(s), your name, titles if commonly used, and
     the memo's subject.  A typical heading is </ul>                   
                                                                  
<p>               <b><center>M E M O R A N D U M</center></b>                               
                                                                 
<p> TO:                     
<p> FROM:                            
<p>SUBJECT:                          
<p>DATE: 

<p><ul>
<li>  
Because you are using a heading, it is not necessary to
     begin with a salutation (Dear :) nor have a signed
     ending (Sincerely,), but you should initial or sign
     your name after the FROM in the heading

<li>Strive for a memo that is clear, concise, complete, and
     short, no more than two pages long (if possible)

<li>Use bullets where appropriate, particularly to highlight key
     points and simplify reading

<li>Spell and grammar check your work, edit it carefully to
     ensure that your words are effective and accurate

<li>Because this is a business communication, avoid non-business
     content, small talk, pleasantries, repetition of unnecessary
     information

<li>If additional materials are enclosed with the memo, note
     this at the end of the memo by adding a separate, last line
     with the statement  </ul>                                         
                                                                 
<p><center>Enclosure:</center>                                                   
        
<ul>
<li>
If the memo concerns a highly controversial or sensitive
     topic, <u>if you have the time</u>, let it sit overnight, reread it
     the next morning, and make necessary corrections before you
     send it

<li>Establish a standard memo-naming system for each memo you
     send, so you can file and later retrieve the memo on disk or
     hard drive.  For example, a memo written to Jane Wong on
     11/2/96 is stored on an A: drive data disk as         
     A:/wong.mem   11/2/96                                        
     which identifies the recipient and the communication form
     memo = mem; the word processing program notes the date on
     which the memo was stored</ul>   

<b>Multicultural Marketing</b>

<p>Many marketers specialize in microcultural marketing,
concentrate mainly or solely on marketing to African-Americans,
Hispanic-Americans, Asian-Americans, or others.  Students can
learn about these marketing efforts by content analyzing print
advertisements in culturally targeted magazines.  Your school
library is a good place to begin.  Have student teams pick a
particular product category, for example hair products including
shampoo, conditioner, and coloring agents.  Next, locate same
date copies for three months (January, June, September) of two
magazines, one mass market and the other targeted.  For example,
students might select <i>Vanity Fair </i>and <i>Ebony</i>.  Content analyze the
advertisements for the selected products, looking at such things
as models, message, and activities pictured.  Evaluate the
results and report them to the class.

<p><b>International Marketing</b>

<p>Start your discussion of international marketing by relating
the topic to student experiences.  Compile a list of businesses
that appear to be American-owned, but are not, like Burger King,
Pillsbury, CBS Records, Bridgestone Tires, and Carnation.  Some
students may have worked for one of these companies, others have
bought their products.  There is a high probability that even if
your students never work abroad, they may work for a foreign-owned business in the United States, or work for an American
business that actively markets products internationally.       
 
<h2><a name="outline">CHAPTER OUTLINE</a></h2>

<p>I.   Explain why marketers should develop cultural understanding

<ul>
<li>    
Culture is how a society lives through its social
          institutions, values, beliefs, attitudes, customs,
          languages and preferences

<li> The United States is a multicultural society that
          presents challenges and opportunities for marketers
          because of its diversity

<li> The United States macroculture is composed of many
          smaller microcultures

<li>Even though Americans are highly diverse, they share
          core values

<li>Language is an important cultural force that unifies or
          separates communities

<li>Cultural sensitivity means viewing people from other
          cultures objectively, respectfully, and nonjudgmentally
<ol>
<li>
Growing cultural diversity in the United States
               revenues greater cultural sensitivity

<li>Marketers often proceed through states of cultural
               perception that include ignorance, awareness,
               knowledge, and understanding

<li>Marketers are culture change agents, bringing
               products into a society and in the process,
               influencing its culture</ol></ul>



<p>II.  Identify the three largest ethnic microcultures in the
     United States
<ul>
<li>
Marketers recognize the value of targeting ethnic
          microcultures, particularly the three largest
<li> African-Americans are currently the largest
          microculture in the United States
<li>Hispanic-Americans comprise the most rapidly growing
          American microculture
<li>Asian-Americans tend to be the most highly educated of
          the microcultures</ul>


<p>III. Discuss why and how businesses go international
<ul>
<li>
Many businesses go international in order to generate
          revenue, escape domestic competition, prolong product
          life, receive tax incentives, or dispose of
          discontinued surplus merchandise

<li>Some businesses become international marketers by
          accident, others follow a major customer abroad

<li>There are many different sources of information that
          provide valuable assistance to businesses considering
          going international including the U.S. Department of
          Commerce, state and world trade offices</ul>


<p>IV.  Describe the environment of international marketing    
<ul>
<li>
 Marketers must evaluate many environmental factors
          before going international, including
 <ol>
<li>
Culture factors
<li>Political and legal factors
<li>Economic factors including market technology and
               level of economic development  </ol>
 <li> Entry strategies are how a company goes international
 <ol>
<li>
Entry barriers stop or slow entry of foreign
               products into a market
<li>Entry alternatives include direct and indirect
               exporting, joint ventures, direct ownership,
               franchising and licensing
<li>Marketing mix strategies require decisions about
          standardization and how each of the marketing tools
          will be used in a market</ol></ul>

<p>V.   Analyze the contemporary issues facing international
     marketers
<ul>
<li>
The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) will
          present many marketing opportunities and challenges for
          both the members (the United States, Mexico, and
          Canada), as well as competitors from other countries
<li>European integration establishes a free trade zone for
          its member countries

<li> Some marketing experts expect the 21st Century to be
          dominated by the activities of countries in the 
          Pacific Rim, including Japan, China, the Philippines,
          Malaysia, and city-states Hong Kong and Singapore</ul>
   
       
<h2><a name="questions">SUGGESTED ANSWERS TO CHAPTER QUESTIONS</a></h2>

 <h3>DISCUSSION QUESTIONS</h3>

<p>1.  What are the three largest ethnic microcultures in the United
States?  <i>African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, and Asian-Americans.</i>

<p>2.  What is the difference between a macroculture and a
microculture?  <i>In the United States, the macroculture is the
culture of the entire society, over 262 million people;
microcultures are homogeneous segments within the macroculture
that are smaller in numbers but still important influences on
society and marketing.</i> 

<p>3.  Explain what is meant by the term multicultural society.<i> A
multicultural society is heterogenous, composed of many different
cultures.  For example, the United States, the world's most
culturally diverse country, is made up of such important
microcultures as African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, and
Asian-Americans, as well as many other definable groups.</i>

<p>4.  What are American core values?  Explain how they are used in
describing a nation.  <i>Core values are the things that a society
holds in high esteem, for example core values that are generally
associated with Americans include achievement and success,
efficiency and practicality, progress, freedom, and
individualism.  They are important to understand because values
often provide insights into how people will respond to objects,
people, and situations, as well as marketing activities.</i>

<p>5.  Compare and contrast the terms homogeneous and heterogeneous.
<i>When referring to a population like Japan's, we say that it is
culturally extremely homogeneous, which means that the Japanese
people are more culturally alike than different, they share many
values, outlooks, and behaviors.  On the other hand, the
population in the United States is highly heterogeneous, which
means that there is great cultural diversity and many different
values, outlooks, and behaviors.</i> 

<p>6.  Do you think body language is important in marketing? 
Explain.  <i>Yes.  It is estimated that 60 percent of all
communication is nonverbal.  Body language can affect business
interactions and marketing success.</i>

<p>7.  Can cultural sensitivity be overdone?  Might it threaten the
unity of the United States if immigrants don't assimilate?  
<i>Opinions will vary, but most people agree that at the least,
linguistic homogeneity is essential.  If people cannot share a
language, it is problematic whether they can successfully share
much else.  Linguistic assimilation is probably critical to long
term survival as a united nation.</i>

<p>8.  Are marketers cultural change agents?  Could this be the case
even in the United States?  Explain. <i> Absolutely, and it
certainly happens in the United States with marketers introducing
new products to existing or new markets.  This is the case with
the introduction of new products from abroad, as well as products
that incorporate new technologies.  For example, the marketing of
microwave ovens changed how many consumers viewed cooking.  At
one time, traditional expectations for women held that they spent
a considerable part of their time over a hot stove, cooking
family meals.  Today, with the microwave and other labor saving
devices, home cooked often means home assembled, microwaving many
ingredients in minutes, as opposed to hours with a traditional
stove and oven.</i>

<p>9.  How are recent immigrants to the United States contributing
to international marketing?  <i>Cultural diversity in the American
workforce leads to marketing opportunities.  Workers with
international contacts can be helpful in facilitating
international marketing activities for their employers.</i>           
                        
<p>10.  Why do businesses go international?  Describe the important
factors a marketer must consider when going international and
selecting target markets.  <i>Often businesses go international by
accident or to follow a key customer.  They seek international
markets to generate revenue, escape domestic competition, prolong
product life, receive tax incentives, or dispose of discontinued
surplus merchandise.  Factors to be considered include culture
factors, political and legal factors, and economic factors
including market technology and economic development. </i>


<h3>CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING</h3>

<h4>Check Your Understanding 5.1</h4> 

<p>1.  Compare and contrast the U.S. macro- with the principal U.S.
and microcultures.  <i>The macroculture is the entire society of
over 262 million people; the microcultures are segments within
the macroculture.  Approximately 30 million are African-Americans, 25 million are Hispanic-Americans, and 9 million are
Asian-American.</i>

<p>2.  What is the self-reference criterion and why is it important? 
<i>This refers to the practice of judging other cultures by
comparison to your own, which tends to lead to cultural bias
which undermines the ability to make rational, objective
decisions.</i>
 
<p>3.  Why is language an important element in culture?  <i>Language is
an extremely strong force that unifies or separates a culture.</i>  

<h4>Check Your Understanding 5.2 </h4>

<p>1.  Define the term cultural sensitivity and explain its
importance to marketers in a multicultural society.  <i>This means
viewing people from other cultures objectively, respectfully, and
nonjudgmentally.  Failure to be respectful of other cultures can
lead to misunderstandings and for marketers, failure to sell
their products.</i>

<p>2.  Are marketers cultural change agents?  Explain your answer. 
<i>Yes, by introducing new products to a market, marketers can
influence culture. </i>

<p>3.  Identify the largest ethnic microcultures in the United
States and describe some of their characteristics.  <i>These are
<u>generalizations</u> and do not represent all members of an ethnic
microculture.  Several recent studies indicate that African-Americans have a high preference for products made in the United
States, are very mindful of product quality and will select a
store based on the quality of its products, and watch more
television than the other two major microcultures.  Fewer
Hispanic-Americans have bank accounts than the other two
microcultures; they are quality-minded, and listen more to radio. 
Asian-Americans are the most highly educated micro-culture, they
are less apt to prefer products made in the United States, have
the highest incidence of bank accounts and watch the least
television.</i>

<h4>Check Your Understanding 5.3</h4> 

<p>1.  Why should businesses consider going international? <i> No
business should consider going international unless it can
profit.  Otherwise, businesses become international marketers by
accident, to follow an important customer, to avoid competition
in the domestic market, to receive tax incentives, prolong
product life, or to dispose of discontinued surplus merchandise.</i> 

<p>2.  What kind of help can businesses get in going abroad?  <i>Many
different organizations and agencies are interested in helping
businesses market abroad.  These include the United States
Department of Commerce, state and world trade organizations, the
Department of Agriculture, and others.</i>
            
<p>3.  What is the Triad?  What are the emerging nations? <i> The Triad
are the major trading blocks of North America (the United States,
Canada, and Mexico), Europe (the integrated states), and Japan,
which dominates many emerging markets in the Pacific Rim. 
Emerging nations are markets that are growing and represent great
potential, including China, Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines,
India, some countries in Eastern Europe, and some countries in
Latin and South America.</i>

<h4>Check Your Understanding 5.4</h4>

<p>1.  Is international marketing more complex than domestic
marketing? <i> Yes, it is NOT domestic marketing in another country. 
Many additional factors must be considered in each international
market entered.  An additional layer of complexity is added with
each country.</i>

2.  What are some common barriers to entry?   <i>Barriers to entry
fall into two categories: tariffs, taxes on selected imports, and
non-tariff barriers, such as quotas, exchange controls, local
content laws, and embargoes.</i>

<p>3.  What is global marketing?  <i>Global marketing assumes that all
markets are the same, wherever they are located.  It assumes that
one product offer will be accepted anywhere, promotions can be
the same worldwide, and products are priced and distributed
without consideration of local cultures, political systems,
economies, and the like.</i>

<h4>Check Your Understanding 5.5</h4>

<p>1.  Discuss different product alternatives that can be offered to
international markets.  <i>A straight product extension means that
the same product offered in a domestic market is marketed abroad
unchanged.  It is more likely that a product adaptation will be
required.  For less developed markets, some products have to be
simplified; this is backward invention.  Forward invention means
making product more technically sophisticated to suit a market's
requirements.</i>
 
<p>2.  Why is pricing more complex in international markets? <i>More
elements must be considered in pricing products internationally
than when pricing domestically.  For example, currency
fluctuations, distribution costs, risk, and the costs of
competition must be compensated for in order to reach
profitability.</i>

<p>3.  Describe the contemporary issues concerning international
marketing.  <i>Three important contemporary issues facing marketers
are the effects on international trade of the North American Free
Trade Agreement (NAFTA), European integration, and the emergence
of aggressive competition from nations in the Pacific Rim.</i>

<h3>MINI-CASES</h3>
                                
<h4>Mini-Case 5.1:  Pier 1: Retailer of Global Goods Goes  International  </h4>  
                         
<p>     Many of your students will be familiar with Pier 1 or
similar importers.  Have them critique the company's plans to
offer American goods in Asian stores.  What goods would they
recommend that Pier 1 offer in its Asian stores?  Similarly,
after reading this chapter and drawing from their own
experiences, what do they think of the idea of offering the same
inventory that sells well to Cuban-Americans and other Latinos in
Puerto Rico to other Latin and South American countries?  

<p>1.  What do you think of Pier 1's plans?  Is their strategy an
example of "go global, think local?"<i> Answers will vary, but
probably the most common response is that the retailer is "right
on target."  This is a very good example of cultural good sense
that should translate into profitability and marketing success.</i>

<p>2.  Would you recommend that Pier 1 find a local partner in the
countries where it plans to open stores?  Explain your answer. 
Probably they should.  <i>Again, answers will vary.  However,
overall, finding joint venture partners in the various markets
Pier 1 seeks to enter should make their entry easier.  While they
will share the profits, they will also share the risks.</i>

<p>3.  Is the plan to market to Puerto Rico the same way Pier 1
markets to Florida a good one?  Explain. <i> Unless the company has
performed extensive market research to determine that this is a
reasonable approach, it appears on the surface to be quite risky. 
Again, unless they have solid information to support their
contention about the similarity of these markets, they run a
significant risk of misreading consumers and not doing a good job
of predicting local tastes and what will sell.</i>

<h4>Mini-Case 5.2: Joint Ventures at Home and Abroad</h4>
 
 <p>    Ask your students if they are working for or have worked for
a company that joint ventures?  Many probably do but don't
realize it.  Examples of domestic joint venture partners are
increasing, particularly in high technology fields.  In part,
this reflects the added risks and costs associated with high tech
fields.  Point out some recent joint ventures and ask students
what each partner can bring to the table, what unique
competencies they contribute, and the risks inherent in any
partnership.

<p>1.  What do you think of joint ventures?  What are the benefits
and shortcomings?  <i>Generally, a good joint venture partnership
can be very profitable because it shares expertise and risk, as
well as capital.  However, the downside occurs when joint venture
partners disagree or don't meet the expectations of the other. 
Another problem involves sharing profits, since profits must be
shared in a joint venture. </i>

<p>2.  What can a catalog company gain from forming a joint venture
partnership with a magazine targeted to African-American women?
<i>Expertise and market penetration are two reasonable expectations
for the partnership.</i>  

<p>3.  What can AT&T gain from having joint venture partners in
China?  <i> AT&T gains a foothold in the largest consumer market in
the world, over one billion people!  They gain contacts and
market knowledge; the Chinese gain access to technology and
expertise.  AT&T should benefit from reducing some risk, but 
considerable risk remains even with joint venture partners.  See
this chapter's What Do You Think? for more China information.</i>
                                
<h3> WHAT DO YOU THINK?</h3>

 <p>    China is a mystery and a magnet for many Americans.  Some
people assume China can make the transition from the last major
Communist nation to a free market economy without bloodshed.  Ask
your students for their opinions on this question.  International
students from China or students of Chinese descent may be able to
add a more personal perspective to this problem.  An Internet
activity is included in this chapter that provides a source for
information about China that can complement class discussion.  

<h2><a name="internet">USING THE INTERNET</a></h2>

<p>     Although Internet discussion groups can be time consuming,
there still are many benefits to joining.  You can make contacts 
through these lists with marketing instructors at other
universities as well as professionals in the United States and
abroad.  You may find marketing educators from other countries
who are interested in having their students cooperate in cross-cultural interviews on the Internet.  This has worked quite
successfully for some instructors.  Other international contacts
can provide insights into how marketing works in their countries. 
For list information, visit the American Marketing Association
Home Page at http://www.nsns.com/MouseTracks.  Access The List of
Lists, where you'll find information about such marketing
discussion groups as Market-L, MKTSEG, and MKTTEACH.

<p>     One of the most intriguing characteristics of the Internet
is that many different paths lead to the same place.  For
example, if you wish to access a federal government source such
as the Department of Commerce's Census Bureau, you can get there
by taking any of the following paths, and many others, as well. <br>

that the gopher site for the U.S. Census Bureau through 
http://gopher.census.gov would be disconnected, instructions were
given on how to download Lynx from the University of Kansas as
visitors with Lynx (or a graphical browser) could access the
Bureau by http://www.census.gov.  When a site changes its
address, a connecting link to the new address usually is kept
active for a period of time so visitors can find the new site. 
Savvy Internet visitors keep their own address book with
bookmarks either in their browser or separately on a data disk or

feasibility of an Internet assignment before you make it.  Stress
Net-etiquette with each student assignment.

<h3>Internet Assignments</h3>

<p>     Information about ethnic micro-cultures and population 
trends, and some product usage information, can be obtained

usage raise troubling questions about access to technology by all
microcultures.  The directory Population Components of Change has
files on population trends for Whites, Blacks, Asians, and

<h3>MARKETING APPLICATIONS</h3>

<h4>MARKETING APPLICATION 5.1</h4>

<p>     Given the cultural diversity in the United States, it might
be difficult to convince someone that Americans share many core
values.  However, looking at the list of American core values
shown in Figure 5.1 (page 141 of the text), it also might be
difficult to imagine anyone not agreeing with most, if not all of
these values.  Use the print advertisements that students bring
to class as a point of departure for a discussion and debate of
core values and the question Do these core values hold true of
all Americans?  If there is a consensus, are certain of the
values more important than others?  

<p>     If your class is large enough, 25 to 30 students or more,
test the question of relative importance (also called rank) among
your students and possibly, extend the sample to their families
or other students.  Prepare a simple survey for your students (an
example is provided on the next page) by listing each of the 11
values.  Ask students to assign a numerical value that signifies
the personal importance of each value on the blank line beside
the value.  One demographic question, about gender, is also
included on the sample survey.  

<p>     If students tabulate the surveys, clearly explain the
tabulation process.  Sort all male-completed surveys into one
pile; female-completed surveys into a second pile.  Add together
all male importance scores for each value, starting with
Achievement and Success.  Divide the sum by the total number of
male surveys.  For example, if there are 30 males and their total
Achievement and Success score is 163, 163/30 = 5.433.  Tabulate
all male scores and all female scores, then calculate combined
scores for each value.  A sample tabulation form students can use
follows the sample survey.  

<p>     Have student teams analyze the results and identify the five
most important values for each category.  These are the values
with the five lowest total scores.  What inferences can be drawn
about the importance of the values to both genders?  Are there    

            <b><center>SURVEY OF THE IMPORTANCE OF CORE VALUES</center> </b>          
           
<p>     This survey is designed to find out how important each of
the following values is to YOU.  Please read the list and
carefully consider each value.  How important is it in your life? 
Identify the importance by assigning a number to each value using
the scale: <b># 1 = most important - to - #11 = least important </b>
<u>Do not leave any value blank</u>.   Use each number (1 through 11)
only once.  Do not sign your name or otherwise identify yourself
on this survey.  Thank you.

be generalized, how might a marketer apply the consumer insights? 
Relate this to the print advertisements used in class.  If
differences exist between males and females on the importance of
the values, how might this information be used in marketing?  Ask
students to identify other variables that can influence value
importance, for example age, ethnic background, education, and
occupation.  Are these important segmentation variables?

<p>     While it is relatively easy to identify ethnic influences on
American eating habits, it is less obvious which American foods
have been successfully exported.  Students should be able to name
such well-known global foods as Coke, hamburgers, and french
fries; franchises such as KFC and McDonald's.  Ask your
international students or any students who have traveled abroad
what American foods are found in other countries and whether or
not they taste the same.  Often, they do not.  What does this
indicate?

<h3>CHAPTER  5: CONSUMER INSIGHTS AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETING</h3>

<h4>CONSUMER INSIGHT 5.1</h4>

<p>     Barbie dolls are tailored to market characteristics.  This
is a customization or adapted marketing strategy that recognizes
an opportunity in ethnic marketing.  Students can learn more
about ethnic Barbies by visiting local toy stores when they are
fully stocked with Christmas toys.  Observe whether or not there
are any ethnic Barbies.  Do they reflect the ethnic composition
of your area?  Students can find information about the ethnic
composition of your city from the local government, Chamber of
Commerce, or by visiting the Census Bureau, Population Data and
Social and Demographic Data on the Internet (see Using the
Internet in this chapter).  If your area is highly multicultural,
is this diversity reflected in the availability of ethnic
Barbies?  


<h4>CONSUMER INSIGHT 5.2</h4>

<p>     Contact the local Small Business Development Center, a World
Trade Center, state agency or other organization that promotes
international business and ask for help in identifying a local
small business that is marketing internationally.  With their
help, ask a small business international marketer to speak to
your class about his or her experiences abroad.  Addresses of
local Small Business Administration offices are in the government
section of most local telephone directories and on the Internet
(see Using the Internet in this chapter).


<h3>INTERNATIONAL MARKETING REPORT</h3>

<p>     The full text of the NAFTA Agreement can be found on the
Internet (see <b>Using the Internet</b> in this chapter).  Some students
in your class have probably visited Canada or Mexico; others may
have relatives living in these countries.  Ask what they have
observed about American products offered in these countries.  How
well do consumers accept products from the United States?<p>

<title>CHAPTER 6: MARKETING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY</title>
</head>

<h1><center>CHAPTER 6</h1>
<h1> MARKETING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY</center></h1>

<h2>CHAPTER ABSTRACT</h2>

<p><b>1. Explain why information is so important to marketers.</b>
Marketers need information in order to be able to make good
marketing decisions.  Good information used wisely can help
marketers recognize and take advantage of windows of opportunity,
avoid threats, and achieve competitive advantage.  In order to be
usable, information must be current, reliable, suitable,
sufficient, affordable, and available.  The information
revolution, fueled by advances in computer technology, is
affecting the way marketers collect and use information.  While
there are many benefits to the information revolution,
information overload and technology overkill are among its
hazards.


<p><b>2. Understand that all marketers need information.</b>  Marketing is
information-intensive.  Marketers must have information to make
good decisions involving the marketing mix variables, product,
price, place, and promotion.  They use both descriptive and
prescriptive information.  Marketers must manage information
effectively in order to make decisions that satisfy consumers and
achieve business goals.


<p><b>3. Describe a marketing information system (MIS) and explain how
it works.</b>  A marketing information system (MIS) is an organized,
systematic process designed to help marketers effectively manage
and use information.  Contemporary MIS systems integrate three
sets of interrelated activities: information collection,
information analysis, and information dissemination.  Most MIS
systems rely heavily on computers to aid in these activities.  
Some use sophisticated computer-based systems called Marketing
Decision Support Systems (MDSS) that rely on highly complex
statistical programs to suggest answers to specific marketing
problems.

<p><b>4. Identify the steps in marketing research.</b>  Marketing research,
according to the American Marketing Association, links the
consumer, customer, and public to the marketer through
information .  Marketing research is a systematic process for
establishing that link and facilitating the use of information in
making marketing decisions.  Research should be conducted
whenever information is needed.  It is used in all aspects of
marketing activities.  Marketing research is performed by
individuals and groups, in small, mid-size, and large businesses,
as well as by businesses whose sole mission is to conduct
research and sell the results.  Marketing research generally
follows a prescribed set of steps.  Marketers strive to perform
research that is valid, reliable, and generalizable.


<p><b>5. Discuss how recent advances in information technology are
pushing marketing in new directions.</b>  In the last 30 years, the
information revolution has accelerated, fueled in great part by
advances in computer technology.  This is affecting marketing, as
well as society and business generally.  Electronic measuring
devices, facsimile machines, virtual reality, and the Internet
are just some examples of new technologies that are changing the
ways that marketing activities are conducted.

<h2><a name="teaching tips">SOME TEACHING TIPS</a></h2>

<p>We are living in an information age: We are part of an
information revolution.  Information travels around the world in
seconds on the Internet, by telephone and fax machine, and
through satellite television transmission.  The challenge for
marketers is to effectively use information in making marketing
decisions and solving marketing problems.  This chapter presents
some hands-on opportunities for students to see for themselves
how information and the computer are affecting marketers and
marketing activities.  Introduce this topic by asking students to
consider how their daily lives are affected by computers and the
information they transmit.  For example, many cities use
computers to analyze highway traffic flow information and control
traffic light changes.  People often make clothing decisions
based on weather information transmitted by satellites, analyzed
by computers, and relayed on television.  Consumers rarely
experience product stockouts because scanner data signal when
product inventory is approaching the reorder point.</p>

<p><b>Information and Competitive Advantage</b></p>

<p>Begin the discussion of marketing research and information
technology with the question that introduces the chapter (on page
171 of the text), "How can information be used by marketers to
gain competitive advantage?"   Have student teams select a
national business that is the acknowledged market leader in its
industry, such as McDonald's, Wal-Mart, or Microsoft.  Using the
Information Needs of Marketing Managers from Figure 6.2 (page 175
of the text), ask each team to </p>

<ul>
<li> relate several of the ranked items specifically to their selected business,
<li> suggest where and how needed information can be obtained,
<li> explain how it relates to competitive advantage.
</ul>

<p>For example, it is reasonable to assume that McDonald's
marketing managers use information to "identify, anticipate, and
respond to competitors" (rank 6 of the Main Information Needs in
Figure 6.2).  Therefore, McDonald's needs competitive
intelligence, information obtained by marketing researchers who
systematically and objectively evaluate the competitions'</p>

<ul>
<li> product (taste the food, experience the service)
<li> prices (compare product prices)
<li> place (observe convenience, cleanliness)
<li> promotion (look for sales promotions, observe advertising)
</ul>

<p>McDonald's own customers can be surveyed to determine if
they eat at competitors and if they do, how these consumers
compare the competition to McDonald's.  Information about the
competition is critical to McDonald's continued success because
McDonald's can learn what the competition is doing right, then
improve on it.  By determining if the competition poses a threat,
McDonald's can respond and protect their competitive advantage.</p>

<p>Once each team has completed their analysis, have them draft
a memo reporting their results, then present their analysis to
the class.  As a group, analyze whether or not each business
appears to be using information effectively.</p>

<b><p>International Marketing Information Needs</b></p>
 
<p>Introduce the topic of the information needs of
international marketers by referring to the chapter opening
story.  Have students consider the information needs facing
Isabelle Ono in determining whether or not Japan is a good market
for her company's health foods.  Students can identify questions
that Isabelle must answer before proceeding with the product
market match decision.  For example, a critical question that
must be answered is whether the concern for eating healthy food 
expressed by government officials and health researchers is
shared by consumers.  It is essential to forecast consumer
demand.  Consumers must buy enough of Isabelle's product for her
company to profit.  If demand is very weak and cannot be
stimulated, entering the market could be a disaster.  Ask
students how consumer demand can be evaluated.  What information
must Isabell have and how can it be obtained?</p>

<b><p>Marketing Tasks Performed Using Computers</b></p>

<p>Figure 6.1 (page 174 of the text) identifies some marketing
tasks performed using computers.  In order to develop a more
thorough understanding of how computers are affecting marketing
activities, ask student teams to investigate a task from Figure
6.1 that they find particularly interesting or applicable to
their career interests.  For example, students specializing in
promotions and advertising should investigate desktop publishing,
advertising design and layout, or media scheduling using computer
technology; students interested in distribution should look at
inventory control and logistics.  They can begin their research
by using secondary sources, learning about the technology from
articles in journals and trade publications.  This effort can be
extended to include primary research, first person interviews
with professionals using the technology.  If the latter approach
is used, interview subjects often can be identified by contacting
local professional groups and asking their assistance. 
Alternately, a professional may discuss the topic in class. 
Guest speakers can add an exciting practical dimensions to class
discussions, particularly if they demonstrate an applied
technology, such as advertising design, desktop publishing,
inventory control, or database management.</p>

<b><p>Information Collection Frequency</b></p>

<p>Personal use consumers, like businesses and marketers, have
different information needs.  Some information is collected
routinely; other information is collected once or only rarely. 
Students can compare their personal information needs to
marketing information needs as presented in Figure 6.3 (page 177
of the text).  Fold a sheet of paper vertically into three equal
columns.  Label the columns "Routine", "Periodic", and
"Nonroutine" respectively.  In the "Routine" section, identify
routine information needs, such as daily weather and traffic
reports, daily television programming, weekly specials at the
grocery store, and weekend movie schedules.  Do the same for the
other columns, then identify sources for the information.</p>

<p>Generally, information collected routinely involves an
almost effortless, habitual information search.  Have students
contrast this with "Nonroutine" information search.  Make the
point that marketers work very hard to provide consumers with
information that they can use to make purchase decisions.  Survey
students to determine if any have identified product advertising
as a source of information.  Students often don't associate
advertising with information, yet this is a key advertising
function.</p>

<p>Many people view the Internet as the ultimate information
source.  It is a source for routine information, such as traffic
reports on Los Angeles freeways, the time of day, the weather
forecast, or spot currency exchange rates.  The Internet can be
used to collect information for periodic needs, like product
comparison shopping for computer hardware, automobiles, or real
estate.  It provides access to information that personal use
consumers need infrequently or only once.  For a complementary
activity, see this chapter's Using the Internet.</p>

<b><p>Marketing Research</p></b>

<p>Marketing research, like all research, comes in many forms
and is designed to serve many purposes.  It is important to
stress that marketing research is the broadest type of research
in marketing because it can include any aspect of marketing
activity.  Other types of research, for example consumer
research, advertising research, or market research, focus
narrowly on a specific area of marketing interest, in this case,
consumers, advertising, or markets.</p>

<p>Most marketing research is applied research designed to
transfer technology or apply concepts developed through empirical
research.  Marketing research can be formal, involving highly
structured activities, many researchers, and considerable time
and expense.  It can also be informal, involving one or several
researchers quickly seeking answers to specific, applied
marketing problems.  Some research is exploratory, designed to
collect additional information or explore approaches that can be
used in the next research stage.  Other research is descriptive,
describing markets and consumers, and developing summary
statistics.  Causal research seeks to develop and test
relationships between variables, while predictive research seeks
to predict relationships and forecast trends.</p>

<p>It is important for students to become familiar with the
steps of marketing research.  Although the names given these
steps and the number of steps identified may vary, there is no
exception to the demand for research that is systematic,
organized, and objective.  The best way to teach these steps is
to have students experience them.  Marketing Application 6.3
(page 191 of the text), a mini-research project that involves a
class survey, can be used for this purpose.  Review the steps in
marketing research (page 186 of the text) and relate them to the
task in this Application.</p>

<b><p>The Mystery Shopper</b></p>
     
<p>Another approach to teaching about marketing research is to
have students engage in an applied observational research
activity such as becoming mystery shoppers.  This is a technique
often used by marketing professionals to collect competitive
intelligence.  It is particularly useful where published data are
not available or for new product introductions (Czepiec 1983). 
It is very common in services, particularly banks and fast food
restaurants, and grocery stores.</p>

<p>This is an opportunity for students to develop applied
research skills like those routinely used by marketing
professionals.  Ask students to form teams or small groups.  Each
team or group selects a different tangible good that lends itself
to comparison shopping in multiple retail outlets.  Ideally, it
should be a product that students are interested in purchasing or
have recently purchased, or a product about which students are
knowledgeable.  For example, steel belted radial tires, a
computer fax modem, color television set, or compact disc player.</p>

<p>Refer to the marketing research steps (page 186 of the text)
and ask students to work together to</p>

<ul>
<li> Identify the problem - a statement of the research question
     which, in this case, relates to determining competitive
     pricing strategies for the same product at five different
     retail outlets
<li> Develop a plan - how students will make their price
     comparisons, including developing a standard reporting form
     that each student can use to analyze a retailer and identify
     product prices
<li> Execute the plan - conduct the price comparisons in five
     different stores within a one-week period
<li> Analyze and interpret the results - while a statistical
     comparison is not appropriate to this research, a
     descriptive analysis should identify price differences and 
     the price strategies each retailer is following
<li> Report findings and recommendations - using memo form, each
     reports their analysis and makes a recommendation.  Have the
     teams imagine that they are suggesting competitive product
     pricing strategies that can be used by a hypothetical
     marketer who is entering the market and will compete
     directly with the five existing retailers
</ul>
 
<p>You might ask students what products they "shop around" for
in order to get the best price.  These examples can form
conceptual anchors for the mystery shopper exercise.  For
example, I had one student volunteer that her hands were very
sensitive to soap, so there was one brand that she purchased
exclusively.  Because this brand was expensive, she routinely
comparison shopped for it.  As a result, she told us to the
penny, the price of the soap at a major grocery chain, an
independent grocery, a discount club, a mass merchandise
discounter, and a chain drug store!</p>

<p>In order to ensure some standardization between teams, work
as a class to establish common data categories.  Data to collect
should include (but not be limited to)</p>

<ul>
<li> Store name
<li> Type of store (descriptive categories such as catalog,
     department, discounter, specialty, grocery, supermarket,
     category killer, club, or other)
<li> Type of customer (descriptive categories such as bargain
     hunters, quality shoppers, value conscious, upper class)
<li> Product (including brand name, model, color, size, and other
     important features)
<li> Price (full price, discounted price, sale price)
<li> Competing products (description of directly competitive
     products also offered, including prices and features)
<li> Other comments
</ul>

<p>At the conclusion of the research, ask each team to present
their findings to the class.  These research results often
provoke interesting class discussions about the pricing
strategies of different retailers.</p>

<b><p>A Class Focus Group</b></p>

<p>Focus groups are the most widely used form of exploratory
research (Solomon 1994).  They are used to determine consumer
feelings about products through directed group interviews with 5
to 9 consumers.  The participants are usually seated around a
conference table in a specially designed room that has hidden
recorders and video cameras.  A trained focus group leader guides
the group through a directed discussion.  Focus group
participants usually have some involvement with the product
category.  For example, when a major contact lens producer was
preparing to introduce a revolutionary (at that time) innovation,
disposable contact lenses, focus groups were held with people 
already wearing contacts.  Video tapes of the focus groups
revealed that lens wearers' major complaint was cleaning them. 
This theme was repeated consistently across groups.  Consumers
hated using cleaning solutions, day after day.  This consumer
insight was integrated into a highly successful advertising
campaign that stressed how the best solution to lens cleaning was
"no solution", meaning the manufacturer's disposable lenses!</p>

<p>Focus groups are used in most product categories.  They have
even been used with motion pictures, where groups of consumers
are invited into a special screening room to preview a soon-to-be
released motion picture.  As viewers watch the film, their
responses are observed and sometimes recorded.  Afterwards, they
participate in a focus group discussion that gauges their
response to the film.  Movies have been recut because of focus
group responses.  In some recent focus groups, a computer
analysis of recorded voices has been used to reveal more of what
consumers are really thinking (Hoeffel 1994).</p>

<p>Introduce the topic of focus group research to your class
and ask for six to eight student volunteers to participate in a
focus group study.  Set up a scenario for the focus group using a
product that students know and find interesting.  For example,
previous successfully used topics include a popular movie, a new
non-alcoholic beer, and student class registration procedures. 
These focus groups respectively sought student opinions about the
controversial movie ending (what should it have been?), the
appeal of the new non-alcoholic beer (will students buy it?), and
pre-registration (what can be changed to make it easier?).  Avoid
topics that polarize or are too controversial.</p>

<p>With the participant/volunteers out of the room, ask the
remaining students (the observers) to brainstorm the types of
questions that the focus group should explore.  Assemble 10 to 15
usable questions, which you will probably need to edit.  Explain
to the student observers that their assignment during the focus
group interview will be to observe, listen carefully to what is
said, and write short statements about their observations.</p>

<p>At the next class meeting, arrange the room so that you have
space in the front for the focus group volunteers to sit as a
group, preferably turned so they are not directly facing the rest
of the class.  This prevents interactions and distractions. 
Introduce the topic and explain that you are seeking their
opinions, so no answer is "right."  Work through the questions,
allow each student ample time to comment, and encourage
discussion.  Do not allow any student to dominate or disrupt. 
Complete as many questions as you can, allowing sufficient time
to wrap up the focus group, thank all participants, and collect
the observers' written comments at the end.</p>

<p>At the next class meeting, ask students to identify some of
the strengths and weaknesses of this type of marketing research. 
In particular, identify such problems as subjectivity, low
numbers, and generalizability; such advantages as greater
willingness to express opinions in a group and stimulating group
interactions.  Describe some of the observers' written comments
(without identifying any observer by name) and ask for comments
on them.  Guide the discussion so that it stays focused on the
marketing applications of this type of exploratory research.</p>

marketing problems.  Because computers make it so easy to
collect, analyze, and disseminate information, the result has
been an information explosion, a vast abundance of information
suddenly made available that previously would not have been
accessible to most people.  As people become more dependent on
computers at work, home, and play, their impact on society and
business will steadily increase.</i>

<p>2.  What do computers have to do with the information explosion?
<i>They are directly responsible for the vast abundance of
information that is available to help in making marketing
decisions and solving marketing problems.</i>

<p>3.  Distinguish between computer hardware and software.  <i>The term
"computer hardware" means the computer itself, its case, central
processing unit, chip, keyboard, and screen, along with printers,
scanners, fax modems, and associated devices.  "Computer
software" are programs run on computers, including spreadsheets,
word processing programs, database management programs, and
statistical analysis packages.</i>

<p>4.  Explain what is meant by the term marketing information
system.  <i>A marketing information system (MIS) is a process by
which people manage information for use in making marketing
decisions and solving marketing problems.  The system requires
information collection, information analysis, and information
dissemination.</i>

<p>5.  Describe the three common sources of information collected by
marketers.  <i>Information collection in a marketing information
system uses such common sources of information as internal
company records, external information, and the results of
marketing research.</i>

<p>6.  Contrast primary and secondary data, and primary and
secondary research.  <i>Primary research is conducted to solve an
original problem and primary data are collected specifically to
answer the primary research question.  Secondary research is
conducted by evaluating existing research and existing data that
have been collected for other purposes.</i>

<p>7.  Describe the steps in marketing research.  <i>Marketing
research requires adherence to a series of required steps that
are designed to provide a systematic, objective, bias-free
inquiry that can withstand careful scrutiny.  The steps include
identifying the problem, developing a plan, executing the plan,
analyzing and interpreting the results, and reporting the
findings and recommendations. </i>

<p>8.  What three research considerations are very important to the
marketer and underlie his or her confidence in research results? 
<i>In order to have confidence in the value of the research
findings, researchers must ensure that their work meets standards
for validity, reliability, and generalizability.</i>

<p>9.  Why are customer surveys such a popular form of marketing
research?  <i>Surveys are popular for a number of reasons.  They can
be used for small numbers and large, from hundreds to thousands
of people or businesses.  Survey results can be obtained quickly
and relatively cheaply.  These results lend themselves to
statistical analysis.  However, there is a growing problem with 
people who are asked to complete a survey but refuse.  Response
rates are declining.</i>

<p>10.  What are some of the new technologies affecting marketing?   
<i>New technologies affecting marketing relate to advances in
computer technology or computer-related systems.  These include
electronic measuring devices, scanners, facsimile (fax) machines,
virtual reality, and the Internet.</i>
<br>

<h3>CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING</h3>

<h4>Check Your Understanding 6.1</h4>

<p>1.  What is information and how is it used in marketing? 
<i>Information is knowledge that can be used to solve a problem.  In
marketing, this can include deciding whether or not to market a
company's products in a particular market.  Information is used
to make decisions about products, prices, places (distribution),
and promotion.</i>

<p>2.  Explain this statement: "Marketing is information-intensive." 
<i>Because marketing occurs in volatile environments, it is
necessary to continually monitor the environment and collect
information that can be used in decision making.  Marketing
decisions and problem solving require information about
consumers, customers, the competition, and other environmental
factors.</i>
 
<p>3.  Why must marketers be concerned about managing information?
<i>Computers have greatly increased the amount of information that
is available to marketers.  Therefore, it is essential that
marketers manage information efficiently so it can be used in
effective decision making and problem solving.  Information must
be collected and made available when and where needed.</i>

<h4>Check Your Understanding 6.2</h4>

<p>1.  Describe what takes place in a marketing information system.
<i>A marketing information system (MIS) is a systematic process for
collecting information, analyzing it, and disseminating the
results and recommendations.</i>

<p>2.  Identify sources for information collected internally in an
MIS.  <i>Internal information comes from such sources as
salespeople, sales reports, accounting records, expense records,
profit statements, production and shipment schedules, salesperson
logs.</i>

<p>3.  Distinguish between commercial intelligence and espionage. 
<i>Commercial intelligence is the legal and ethical collection of
information about the competition from sources that are readily
available to the general public.  Commercial espionage is
stealing information that is not generally available.  It is
illegal and unethical.</i>

<h4>Check Your Understanding 6.3 </h4>

<p>1.  What is marketing research?  What are market and advertising
research?  <i>Marketing research is a systematic, organized process
that links the marketer and consumers, customers, and public
through information.  Marketing research is very broad and can
include research on any marketing activities.  Market research is
designed to answer questions about markets; advertising research
answers questions related to advertising.  The research methods
may be similar or the same; however, with marketing research, the
topics of interest are far broader than with the much more
narrowly focused market or advertising research.</i>

<p>2.  Identify the steps in marketing research.  <i>Marketing research
typically occurs in several well defined steps or stages.  These
are identify the problem, develop a research plan, execute the
plan, analyze results, and report recommendations.</i>
            
<p>3.  Compare and contrast primary and secondary data/research.  
<i>Primary research is original research that uses data collected
specifically for the research purpose.  Secondary research uses 
secondary data which was collected for other purposes.  Many
research designs use both secondary and primary methods and data.</i>

<h3>MINI-CASES</h3>
                                
<h4>Mini-Case 6.1: Vons Does it the Customers' Way</h4>

<p>Vons is an example of a retailer that has embraced computer
technology and research in order to gain a competitive advantage. 
Vons' management has kept its eye firmly on satisfying customers. 
This case can lead to a comparison of Vons with local
supermarkets and a discussion of how local retailers could use
marketing research to become more consumer oriented.

<p>1.  Could the Vons approach be used in all supermarkets?  <i>There
is a limitation, particularly because of the investment needed to
adopt the Vons model, in time and technology.  However, all
retailers would be wise to determine how well they are satisfying
consumers by conducting consumer research.</i>

<p>2.  Could Vons carry this customization process too far?  Explain
your answer.  <i>There is always a problem with too much of a good
thing.  In this case, if the costs of the process exceed the
benefits, then it has gone too far.</i>

<p>3.  Are there any consumer privacy issues involved in this case? 
Explain your answer.  <i>Yes, and this is an issue of growing
importance.  As more consumer information is accumulated, stored,
and disseminated, there is a greater change of misuse.  Many
consumers and marketing professionals are concerned about
consumer privacy and trying to ensure it.  This is also a problem
that will extend to the Internet which is a very insecure place
at this time.</i>

<h4>Mini-Case 6.2: Marketing Research Serves Different Needs</h4>
 
<p>Do religious organizations in your area use marketing?  This
is an interesting topic to explore with your students, discussing
personal experiences with marketing and marketing research in
religious organizations.

<p>1.  Many churches are using marketing research, advertisements,
and direct marketing to reach their markets.  Do you think there
is any opposition to churches using marketing?  What might be the
basis for this opposition?  <i>There is resistance to church
marketing by some church members as well as others who believe
that a distinction should be made between religious institutions
and marketing activities.  This opposition is directed more
toward profit centered, money raising activities than the use of
marketing to determine consumer satisfaction and opinions.</i>

<p>2.  If a church decides to use a marketing research survey to
determine its market's preferences, who should be surveyed? 
Should only current members be questioned?  Explain your answer. 
<i>It depends on the reason for conducting the research.  If the
research seeks to determine what prospective members want in a
church, then they must be included in the research.  Some
research will focus specifically on the needs and satisfaction of
existing members.</i>
                                
<h3>WHAT DO YOU THINK?</h3>

<p>Japanese marketing researchers are known for getting close
to customers who have already bought their products.  Have
students consider whether any American businesses use this
method.  If anyone has purchased a new automobile recently, they
may have experienced this type of consumer research, with follow-up telephone calls at various times post-purchase to evaluate
continuing satisfaction.  Are there other examples?

<h2><a name="internet">USING THE INTERNET</a></h2>

<p>The Internet is the place to find information.  It offers
vast stores of secondary information and some researchers are
conducting primary research there, primarily through interactive
Internet surveys.  As with all Internet activities, verify
Internet addresses and confirm the feasibility of an Internet
assignment before you make it.  Stress professional behavior and
responsibility to your students.  

<h3>Internet Assignments</h3>

<p>Isabelle Ono, from the chapter opening story, needs
information about Japanese consumer food preferences.  She must
answer a research question about whether or not Japanese
consumers will purchase health foods, like those made by
Isabelle's company.  This question probably can be answered best
by conducting primary research, collecting original data from
consumers that will answer this specific question.  However,
Isabelle can learn quite a bit about marketing in Asia, and Asian
consumers, on the Internet.  This type of consumer information is
bound to increase in the coming years as the Internet, and
particularly the World Wide Web, expands.           

<i><p>     Students can compare Asian and European marketing
     opportunities on the Internet by evaluating two sites.  The
     European site offers databases with information on business
     opportunities in the European Union (EU); the Asian site is
     similiar to the EU site, but for Asian countries, including
     Japan (Vine 1995).

</i>

<p>     As commercial sites on the World Wide Web (WWW) begin to
report greater profits, more marketers will be drawn to the Web
and the number of sites and products offered will increase
dramatically.  Students can research the question:  <i>What products
currently are being marketed on the WWW?</i>   It is impossible to
get an exact count of businesses on the Web because the Web is
virtually unregulated, thus there is no central "sign-in" point
for new Net businesses.  Also, the number of business home pages
and sites in multibusiness malls change daily.  However, students
can develop insights into Web commerce by conducting topical
searches and collecting commercial intelligence.  Assign student
teams the task of researching a product category to determine if
it is being marketed on the Web.  Let each team select a
different product category, preferably one that interests them. 
Previously, successful Web product searches have been conducted
for bicycles (mountain bikes), floral arrangements, guitars,
automobiles, advertising agencies, and real estate.  

<p>     Competitive intelligence is also readily available on the
Internet through mailing lists and newsgroups (Maloff 1995). 
However, because many schools limit student storage space,
students would find it difficult if not impossible to keep up
with the mailings from a very active list or newsgroup.  These
sources are best left for the marketing instructor to access.

<i><p>     Students can perform a topical search by using Lynx to get
     to jughead or veronica.  Initiate the search by typing in
     the name of the product category, for example

<p>     search: bicycles

<p>     Alternately, a search can be conducted using Yahoo or
     another powerful index.  

<p>     Yahoo

</i>

<p>     Small businesses can find valuable information on the
Internet that otherwise might be too expensive or too difficult
for them to collect.  Small business use of the Internet for
information retrieval and secondary research is expected to
increase. 

<i><p>     Students should already be familiar with the information
     available for small businesses from the federal government
     at

<p>     SBA On-line
<br><a href="http://www.sbaonline.sba.gov">http://www.sbaonline.sba.gov</a>

<p>     Another resource is the Lexis/Nexis Small Business Advisor,
     which has over 5,000 articles for small and home businesses. 
     There is no cost for the search; however, a nominal fee is
     charged to download articles.

<p>     If you wish to find a guest speaker to discuss how computers
and information technology are changing marketing, you may be
able to get help from a professional organization on the
Internet.  Several national professional organizations are
already there, others will doubtlessly join them.  These
organizations list their local chapters, which often is a good
way to locate guest speakers.

</i>
<p>    A number of najor marketing research businesses are on the
Internet.  Students can learn about the work of these businesses
by accessing their home pages.  Remind students that professional
behavior is expected at all times when they visit an Internet
site.  Some of these businesses ask visitors to take a survey, so
at the same time the visitor is collecting information at the
site, the business is collecting information from the visitor. 
An interesting topic for class discussion is how the Internet can
be used for consumer research.  There is at least one example of
the use of focus groups on the Internet, conducted by SRI. 
Research is being conducted about the Internet, as well as on the
Internet.

<p>     If you use the mystery shopper activity, you might consider
extending it to a collaborative project with students at other
schools.  This requires contacting other marketing instructors
through one of the marketing lists (see the List of Lists at the
American Marketing Association's MouseTracks site) and planning
for market basket price comparisons run by students in different
locations.  A simple market basket study would have student teams
track gasoline prices (three grades, three price points) over the
term.  Students at each school can record prices at multiple
stations once a week, then post the results to the Internet
student list.  If enough different student groups collaborated, a
broad picture of multicity, multistate, or multinational gasoline
pricing could be developed.

<h3>MARKETING APPLICATIONS</h3>


<h4>MARKETING APPLICATION 6.1</h4>

<p>The purpose of this Application is to have students consider
broadly the types of information a marketer needs in order to
make a market entry decision.  This is directly analogous to
making a market entry decision in international markets, so you
might note the commonality.  The goal is to make the best product
and market match; one that is low in cost and risk, while high in
demand and the potential for revenue and profit.  Although this
Marketing Application uses disposable diapers as a product
example, substitute another product if it is more applicable and
interesting to your students.  Likewise, if you prefer to use
states close to your own, please do so to personalize the
assignment.  Some alternatives are a marketer of

<ul>
<li> planned retirement communities
<li> financial planning seminars for professional women
<li> computer learning centers for small business owners 
</ul>

<p>Begin with internal sources that can provide information
about the potential markets (selected cities in three states). 
If the marketer is already offering the product in other cities
in these states, then useful comparative information can be
obtained from such sources as product sales in the cities,
scanner data (if applicable to the product type), reports on
competitors, and salesperson and supplier observations.  External
information should be collected for each potential market from
such sources as trade journals and professional publications,
state or regional publications, government reports and documents,
and commercial intelligence.  The marketer must predict demand
for the product, entry costs for each market, competitive
resistance, and the possible effects of other environmental
factors on costs and revenues.  

<p>The disposable diaper marketer must assess demographic
trends that will affect demand, particularly birth rate trends
and the number of women approaching childbearing age, as well as
the competitive environment, including competitors already in the
market, the breadth of product distribution, products offered,
and product prices.  Competition includes both disposable diapers
and diaper laundry services.  

<p>Information needs for the other marketers will vary
according to product type.  For example, the marketer for planned
retirement communities will need information about population age
structure in the potential new markets, in addition to the
information previously identified.  A marketer of financial
planning seminars for professional women will need information
about the population of working women in the new markets.  A
marketer of computer learning centers for small business owners
will need information about small businesses in the new markets.  
      

<h4>MARKETING APPLICATION 6.2</h4>

<p>This <b>Application</b> extends <b>Marketing Application 6.1</b> and
directly leads to a <b>Using the Internet</b> activity.  It assumes that
all needed internal information has been collected and now the
marketer must seek external information.  Often a business will
hire a outside research company to perform a market analysis,
which includes an in-depth study of the potential new markets and
entry recommendations.  If the research is to be performed in-house, then a good place to begin is with secondary information
that is readily accessible, timely, and often, free.  

<p>     The United States government is the most prolific data
collecting body in the world.  Many government publications use
data collected by the Census Bureau.  Census Bureau data can be
accessed in publications found in most public, college, and
university libraries.  It is available in universities that house 
federal government document depositories.  The United States
Government Printing Office (USGPO) sells many publications to the
general public.  Finally, a considerable amount of government
information is available on the Internet and data can be ordered
on-line.  

<p>     Age is a demographic variable that is often critical to
marketing decisions.  This <b>Application</b> can single out the age
variable for its descriptive and predictive value to the product
market matches for diapers, retirement communities, and financial
planning seminars.  To simplify the market match problem, which
is actually an extremely complex one, have students pretend that
age is the only relevant decision variable.  Stress that in real
life, no decision is ever this simple!  Students can evaluate age
tables for several cities in each state and make product market
match decisions based solely on age trends.  


<h4>MARKETING APPLICATION 6.3</h4>

<p>     This <b>Application</b> personalizes the marketing research process
for students.  It has them learn by doing.  Tally the anonymous
class survey scores and have student teams analyze the results,
comparing class scores to those of other Americans in 1983 and
1992.  Consider each question and determine whether or not your
students are like or unlike those who were surveyed in 1992. 
What trends emerge from these data?  What types of product
opportunities can be identified if we assume that the survey
results are generalizable?

<h3>CONSUMER INSIGHTS AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETING</h3>


<h4>CONSUMER INSIGHT 6.1</h4>

<p>Computers are an inescapable part of our daily lives, at
work, home, and play.  This Insight can be extended by the
complementary activity in Using the Internet in this chapter,
which examines computer usage in the United States.  Computer
literate consumers are of growing importance to marketers, both
as targets for computer-related products and because computers
are needed to take consumers to the Internet, where products of
all types are being sold.


<h4>INTERNATIONAL MARKETING REPORT</h4>

<p>     Have students consider some of the difficulties of
conducting marketing research abroad.  For example, many consumer
surveys in the United States are conducted by mail, but in many
developing countries, relatively few people may be literate.  Can
telephone surveys be conducted around the world with the same
ease as they are conducted in the United States?  What about
written surveys? </p>

<h3><a name="abstract">CHAPTER ABSTRACT</a></h3>


<p><b>1. Describe the two segments of consumers: business/organization
and personal use. </b> Consumers in the United States represent a
very large and profitable market.  They can be grouped into two
broad segments of unequal size, business/organization consumers
and personal use consumers.  The smaller business/organization
segment includes industrial, reseller, government, and not-for-profit consumer markets.  The larger personal use consumer market
includes over 260 million individuals.  Although many marketers
direct their offers toward a mass market, most group consumers
into segments, then target the segments with the greatest
purchase potential.  Consumer segments are formed by identifying
important shared characteristics.  These may be demographic,
psychographic, geographic, behavioral, or a combination of
characteristics.  Marketers try to influence consumers
perceptions of their products so that their brands will be
favorably positioned compared to the competition.  The goal is to
effectively use the marketing mix tools to satisfy consumers. 
Consumer satisfaction is a primary goal of marketing activities
in both business/organization and personal use consumer markets. 
Marketers must understand that not all consumer behavior is
rational or acceptable.  Deviant consumer behaviors represent a
variety of actions that are different from acceptable norms and
may also represent illegal behaviors.</p>


<p><b>2. Identify the characteristics of consumer purchase decisions. </b> 
Although it is not always easy to predict or understand consumer
purchase decisions, some aspects of the process are known.  Both 
business/organization and personal use consumers must decide
whether to make, lease, or buy products.  Some product purchases
are rebuys, others are modified rebuys, or new task buys.  Some
purchase decisions are made independently; more often they
involve others, often working together in formal or informal
buying centers.  Steps in the purchase decision process also
vary.  Most personal use consumer purchase decisions are far less
formal than those made by business/organization consumers.  The
latter often face greater risk and uncertainty in making a
purchase decision.</p>


<p><b>3. Describe influences on business/organization consumers.</b> 
Business/organization purchase decisions are influenced by many
factors.  Some influences are organizational, particularly the
priorities and strategies established for the buying unit. 
Others influences reflect organizational characteristics and
demand.  While most business/organization purchase decisions are
rational and objective, human emotions can affect the outcomes. 
Professional buyers are evaluated by the effectiveness of their
purchase decisions about the core product and such associated
services as terms of delivery, installations, and product
guarantees.</p>


<p><b>4. Recognize external influences on personal use consumers.</b> 
Consumer behavior is all the activities involved in selecting,
purchasing, evaluating, and disposing of products.  Personal use
consumers experience many different external influences on their 
behavior, and particularly their purchase decisions.  External
influences may affect many consumers concurrently and similarly. 
Some of the most important social influences are the family,
reference groups, and social class.  Consumers' culture and
microculture affect their behaviors.  Other external influences
are those applied by marketers, the buying situation, technology,
product supply, and even the weather.</p>


<p><b>5. Recognize internal influences on personal use consumers. </b>  
Internal influences are personal, unique, and not observable. 
These are psychological factors that sometimes can be inferred by
observing consumer behavior.  Powerful internal influences
include needs and wants, involvement, perception, learning,
attitudes and attitude change, and personality.  Marketers must
understand the nature of these influences in order to be able to
understand consumers and try to satisfy them.</p>   
          
<h2><a name="teaching tips">SOME TEACHING TIPS</a></h2>
    
<p> The emphasis in most introductory marketing textbooks is on
personal use consumers, while comparatively little attention is
given to business/organization consumers.  There are several
probable reasons for this myopia.  One reason relates to the way
that marketing instructors are educated.  Most have little formal
training in business-to-business, not-for-profit, or public
sector marketing, which makes teaching it more challenging for
them.  On the other hand, they often are required to take one or
more consumer behavior courses that focus on personal use
consumers. </p> 

<p> Because many introductory marketing students are not
marketing majors, they don't have a great need to study
business/organization consumers in depth.  This removes an
incentive for teaching the topic.  As for the marketing majors,
they typically will learn more about business/organization
consumers in advanced marketing classes.</p>  
     
<p>     Another reason for the emphasis on personal use consumers is
the relative size of the two broad consumer markets.  There are
many more personal use consumers (hundreds of millions) compared
to several million business/organization consumers combined. 
This is also reflected in student employment opportunities, where
there are more jobs available in personal use consumer marketing
activities.  It is shown in the numbers of different products
needed to serve this market, tens of thousands of products in a
neighborhood grocery store alone.  Finally, many students and
marketing educators find it easier to relate to personal use
consumers and more interesting to explore related marketing
activities because of shared personal experiences.</p>

<p>     If you haven't already used a mini-case in class, this would
be a good place to introduce one.  Select a mini-case from the
text or reproduce one from <b>PART IV ADDITIONAL MINI-CASES</b> in this
Manual.  A short introduction to using mini-cases in class is
provided for those instructors who have not used them previously
and for others who might benefit from another perspective on case
methods.</p>

<h4>Teaching Mini-Cases In Class</h4>

<p>     The first and perhaps most highly respected version of the 
case method was developed at Harvard University Law School in the
1880s.  The goal was to present a nondirectional way for students
to work independently.  Cases meant to encourage independent
thinking are widely used today in law, medicine, social work,
business, and other disciplines (Paget 1988).</p>

<p>     A business case can take different forms.  It may be a
fictional representation of a frequently experienced type of
business situation or an abbreviated version of a true story. 
Some cases are extremely complex, include detailed financial and
market information, and may extend for a hundred or more written
pages.  Students at the doctoral, master's or advanced
undergraduate levels may work for weeks or an entire term solving
these cases.  Advanced cases typically are team projects.</p>

<p>     Cases have many different titles.  There are vignettes,
critical incidents, and anecdotes, as well as long and short
cases.  The mini-cases in the text and PART IV in this Manual are
highly simplified, abbreviated marketing cases.  They are based
on actual contemporary marketing incidents and illustrate a
chapter topic.  Each is referenced so you can review the material
from which the case was developed and find additional background
information to add to class discussions.</p>

<p>     The goal in using mini-cases in <b><u>Marketing: Foundations and
Applications</u></b> is to use interesting examples that provide an
opportunity for students to analyze marketing situations and
solve marketing problems.  The cases are short intentionally 
because it is difficult to justify spending a great amount of
time on a highly detailed case in one area of marketing when
there is so much marketing to discuss in a term. </p>

<p>     The mini-cases are meant to be read, worked, and discussed
in class.  They classify as an interactive teaching method
because they are designed for students to work in twos (dyads) or
small teams, then discuss as a class.  Students are encouraged to
analyze, interpret, draw inferences, and relate the cases to
other marketing applications.</p>

<p>     A clear advantage of working through the case process is
that students are exposed to real marketing problems, which
broaden their experiences.  A limitation is that no matter how
long, detailed, and complex the case is, it cannot possibly
represent reality fully and with total accuracy. </p> 

 <p>    Some marketing instructors find it easier to use a straight
lecture method than assign cases.  This is because the instructor
must prepare for case instruction and be comfortable in providing
constructive, non-intrusive guidance.  Most of us use some cases
in class because they offer a rich learning opportunity for
students to develop their analytical and communication skills. 
Cases also promote active and often lively student discussions.</p>

<p>     My experiences using mini-cases in class have been very
positive.  Typically, I ask students to form themselves into
dyads (two-person teams) or small groups (no more than four
members).  Depending on available class time, students are
allowed several minutes to read the case, then approximately ten
to fifteen minutes to answer the case questions.  I often add 
information to the case and an additional question or two. 
Students write their analysis and prepare to present it.  If time
allows, the dyads or small teams are merged.  If you have dyads,
they form teams of four members; three-person teams form teams of
six.  Give the teams another ten minutes to debate a consolidated
team response.  At the end of that time, ask each team to briefly
present their analysis.  Useful class discussions are encouraged
by establishing class rapport and encouraging students to openly
express their opinions.  Perhaps the greatest challenge for the
marketing instructor is to encourage student comments and not
dominate the discussion with his or her own views.</p>

<p>     If you are using cases for the first time, start by
considering the reasons why you are using them.  Frey and Keyes
(1985, p.53), provide a useful list that includes

<ul>
<li>
  to give students experience in applying marketing concepts
  and principles to real world situations.

<li> to help students reason through problems.

<li> to improve students' communications skills, oral and
     written.

<li> to assist students in identifying key problems.</ul></p>

<p>     Be prepared to give special attention to students who need
it.  Some students never open their mouths in class and others
never shut them.  For the former, you can encourage participation
by drawing them out, ask several students for their opinions and,
unobtrusively include the shy student among them.  The chatterbox
may require an out-of-class conference.  You can devote a few
class minutes to discuss how developing good listening skills can
contribute to business success.  Since students read the case in
class, you'll avoid the problem of unprepared students.  Have
copies of the case available for students who forgot to bring the
text with them; sufficient copies for the entire class if you use
an additional mini-case from this Manual. </p> 
     
<h4>Other Teaching Suggestions For Chapter 3</h4>

<p>     If you use Mini-Case 3.1 in class, you can extend it by
asking students how a marketer of low- and no-fat cookies might 
segment the cookie market.  Some of the segments that can be
identified are</p>

<p>At the broadest level, the groups are
<ul>
<li><i>non-cookie eaters</i>, consumers who dislike sweets and never
     eat cookies

<li><i>cookie eaters</i>, consumers who like sweets and eat cookies</ul></p>

<p>Among the cookie eaters, the groups are
<ul>
<li>
<i> fat-free fanatics</i>, cookie-eating consumers who are dedicated
to controlling fats in their diets, eat <u>only</u> no-fat or very-low fat cookies, and if offered a good tasting, high fat
     cookie, will always refuse it

<li><i> wishy-washy eaters</i>, consumers who try to maintain control
     over the fats in their diets, but if they are offered a good
     tasting, high fat cookie, will eat it without remorse

<li><i> taste is everything fat-aholics</i>, consumers who believe that
     taste is everything, don't care about fats, pay absolutely
     no attention to fats, eat all good tasting cookies that are
     offered

<li><i>healthy eaters</i>, consumers who care about fats and also
     restrict their intake of sugars and sodium, they will only
     eat cookies that are low in all three ingredients</ul></p>

<p>     Which segment(s) are the best prospects for a low- and/or
fat-free cookie?  If this cookie also is extremely rich tasting,
could it be targeted to all segments?  If so, would this be mass
marketing?  What are the advantages of mass marketing in this
situation?  Could you satisfy all consumer segments through mass
marketing?</p>

<p>     You can go further with this thread by introducing the other
marketing mix elements.  Suspend your targeting decision for a
minute and talk about price.  Ask students if it is cheaper to
eat healthy (no-fat and low-fat foods) or eat for taste, without
concern about fats.  Personal observation suggests that consumers
often pay a premium for healthy foods.  If there is a greater
profit margin from healthy foods, how might price affect
segmentation and targeting decisions?  If the decision is made to
target.  Where would you place the products?  How would you
promote them?</p>

<h4>Segmenting Consumers On The Internet</h4>

<p>     Ask students to consider how consumers can be segmented on
the Internet (page 71 in the text).  The first grouping is one of
access, consumers who can Net-connect and those who cannot.  Is
this a volatile distinction that will change over time?  Is it
technological segmentation?</p>

 <p>    Next, group according to the broadest classification, that
of business/organization or personal use consumers.  What
generalization can be made about the potential size of these
segments?  Which segment will eventually be the largest and why? </p> 

<p>     Within the personal use consumer segment, consumers can be
grouped according to the types of products they are seeking on
the Internet.  For example, consumers looking for tangible goods
(particularly computer hardware and software), services
(particularly entertainment), social outlets (bulletin boards and
chat lines), or information.  </p>

 <p>    You can add insights from <b>Mini-Case 3.3</b> by suggesting a
segmentation grouping by gender.  How do men and women differ in
their use of computers?  Might this extend to their use of the
Internet?  Is this a potentially meaningful way to segment
consumers?</p>  

<p>    Pose a marketing problem that relates to these topics.  If
you were marketing computer hardware and software on the
Internet, which segment(s) would you target?  If you target men,
particularly those men who like computers and find them
entertaining, how would you manage the marketing mix variables to
appeal to this profitable segment? </p> 

<h4>Deviant Consumer Behavior</h4>

<p>     A particularly troubling aspect of consumer behavior
involves deviant behaviors.  Unfortunately, the incidence of
retailer-directed deviant behaviors is growing.  Consider the
statement on page 75 of the text, "As many as 60 percent of all
personal use consumers may shoplift at one time or another."  Ask
students what they think of this figure.  Can it possibly be
correct?  What are some of the reasons people shoplift?  What are
some retailer responses?  Is shoplifting a victimless crime?  If
not, who suffers and how?</p>

 <h2><a name="outline">CHAPTER OUTLINE</a></h2>  

I.   Describe the two segments of consumers:
     business/organization and personal use
<ol>
<li>
Business/organization consumers are classified into
          groups by standard industrial classification (SIC) code
          which describe people buying products for thousands of
          businesses and organizations, for use in production, to
          operate their business/organization, or for resale 
<ul>
<li>
 These consumers include the industrial market,
               reseller market, government market, and
               nonclassified institutional market

<li> There are far fewer business/organization
               consumers than personal use consumers</ul>

<li>Personal use consumers are the hundreds of millions of
          people purchasing products for their own use, for
          family, or friends
<ul>
<li>
Marketing segmentation means breaking a large
group of consumers into smaller groups that are
similar to one another and different from others
because of shared characteristics

<li>Targeting means directing a market offer at
selected segments that represent the greatest
purchase potential

<li> Positioning is how consumers mentally compare
 products; marketers try to help consumers form
 preferential positioning for their products </ul>

<li>Consumer satisfaction means narrowing the gap between
what the consumer expects and values and what the
marketer delivers

<li>Some consumers demonstrate deviant consumer behaviors
including shoplifting, writing bad checks, and other
actions that deviate from generally accepted societal
norms</ol>
<p>
II.  Identify the characteristics of consumer purchase decisions 
<ol>
<li>
 Understanding consumers is critical to marketing
  success, but it is rarely simple or easy to do so

 <li> There are many similarities between the two broad
segments of consumers, particularly the type of
purchase decision made - whether to make, lease, or buy

<li>Buying decisions fall along a continuum from unchanged
          repeat purchases to new purchases
<ul>
<li>
           Straight rebuys are repeat purchases of products
               bought and consumed on a regular basis

         <li> Modified rebuys are purchases that reflect some
               deviation from the previous buy

        <li>  New task buys are first time purchases</ul>

<li>Participants in the purchase decision often reflect the
          magnitude, importance, and risk of the purchase; many
          involve people making purchase decisions in buying
          centers
<ul>
<li>
Buying centers are very common in businesses and
               organizations

<li>Personal use consumers, and particularly families
               and households, also form informal buying centers

<li>Buying center roles include the initiator,
               gatekeeper, influencer, buyer, and user</ul>

<li>Many business/organization purchases follow formal
          procedures, as illustrated by government contracts;
          most personal use consumer purchases require less
          formal decision steps</ol>


<p>III. Describe influences on business/organization consumers
<ol>
<li>
 Business/organization purchase decisions are influenced
by its mission, goals, and strategies
 <li>Demand, particularly derived demand, is a powerful
 influence on business/organization purchase decisions
<ul>
<li>
Elastic demand means that a change in price
stretches demand, price and demand change in
opposite directions

<li>Inelastic demand is common for essential products
so that when price rises, demand may not change 

<li>Fluctuating demand reflects economic conditions</ul>

<li>Other influences on purchase decisions relate to the
          nature of the purchase situation</ol>

<p>IV.  Recognize external influences on personal use consumers
<ol>
<li>
Consumer behavior is all of the activities involved in
selecting, purchasing, evaluating, and disposing of
products

<li>Other people exert social influences on personal use
          consumers
<ul>
<li>
Family is the social influence closest to the
consumer and it is often the most powerful
external influence on purchase decisions

<li>Reference groups are both groups of people that
consumers want to be like and those that they
don't want to be like; both influence consumer
purchase decisions

<li>Social class is not as potent an influence in the
United States as it is in other countries, but it
still can influence consumer purchases

<li>The microcultures a consumer is part of and the
larger culture of the entire country influence
purchase decisions

<li>Marketers influence consumer purchase decisions
               particularly through promotions and the other
               marketing mix variables

<li>Situational influences are nonmarketing factors
               like the weather, technology, buying purpose, that
               influence purchase decisions</ul></ol>

<p>V.   Recognize internal influences on personal use consumers
<ol>
<li>
Internal influences are individual and unique

<li>Needs are gaps between reality and a desired state that
          create a tension that is often satisfied through a
          purchase

<li>Involvement indicates the level of personal important
          that influences a purchase decision

<li>Perception is how consumers select, organize, interpret
          and give meaning to information related to purchase

<li> Almost all consumer behavior is learned; marketers seek
          to help consumers learn in order to influence their
          purchase decisions

<li> Attitudes are learned predispositions, marketers seek
          to establish positive attitudes toward their products

<li>Personality, the unique totality of traits that
          distinguish individuals, has not been shown to be a
                    strong influence on purchase behaviors</ol> 
 
<h2><a name="answer">SUGGESTED ANSWERS TO CHAPTER QUESTIONS</a></h2>

<h3>DISCUSSION QUESTIONS</h3>                

<p>1.  Explain why you think consumer behavior is such a puzzle to
many marketers.  <i>Consumer behavior is a puzzle to many marketers
because there are so many different consumers, behaviors, and
influences on both.  Because of this, many marketers don't bother
trying to understand consumers; they feel it's impossible to
figure out why consumers behave as they do.  Others operate on
the belief that one offer will appeal to almost all consumers, so
as mass marketers they aren't concerned with understanding
variations in behaviors.</i> </p> 

<p>2.  Can someone be both a business/organization and personal use
consumer?  Explain your answer.  <i>Absolutely, yes.  In fact, all
professionals making purchases for their business or organization
are also personal use consumers when they are not making purchase
decisions professionally. </i> </p>

<p>3.  What is deviant consumer behavior?  Why is it important that
marketers be aware of such behaviors?  <i>Deviant consumer behaviors
are behaviors that are contrary to socially acceptable norms
and/or are illegal.  They include such behaviors as not reporting
billing and change errors, shoplifting, switching price tags, and
other retailer-directed behaviors.  They are important because
they cost retailers and consumers hundreds of millions of dollars
annually, as much as 2% of all U.S. retail sales!</i></p>

<p>4.  Explain the difference between a make, lease, or buy decision
by both consumer segments.  <i>Fundamentally, they are much the
same.  Both personal use and business/organization consumers must
decide whether to make, lease, or buy products.  People make
purchase decisions, but for business/organization purchases, the
products will be used in production, to operate the business or
organization, or for resale.  There are differences in risk,
volume, cost, and timing.</i></p>

<p>5.  Pretend that your school is purchasing its first-ever
schoolwide computer system.  This system will be used for
academic, administrative, research, and teaching purposes.  Who
should sit on the school's buying center committee? 
<i>Representatives from each group that will be affected by the
purchase, including teachers, administrators, researchers, and
students, as well as the school's purchasing agent.</i></p>

<p>6.  Of the following product purchases, which has the highest
financial risk, the highest physical risk, or the highest social
risk?

<ul>
<li> 
New clothes to wear on a first date - social risk

<li>New 486SX personal computer - financial risk,
     particularly if it is being bought for a business and its
     use will affect profitability

<li>Fifteen-year old used car - physical risk, but because it
     is a used car, the financial risk is far less than it would
     be with the purchase of a new car</ul></p>

<p>7.  Jim is walking through Cherry Blossom Mall.  A pair of boots
in a store window attract his eye.  He doesn't need boots, but
decides to try them on.  He likes them so much, he purchases
them.  Is than an impulse purchase?  Explain your answer?  <i>Since
Jim had not planned to buy boots and doesn't need them, it is an
impulse purchase.  This is like impulsively buying candy in a
grocery check-out lane, just because the wrapper attracts your
eye, you smell the chocolate, or you are tired and think
chocolate can give you a quick energy lift.  You don't
necessarily need it, didn't plan to buy it, but on impulse do so.</i></p>

<p>8.  What is the baby boom generation?  Why is it of such interest
to marketers?   <i>Baby boomers are people born between 1946 and
1964 in the boom years immediately following the end of World War
II.  This population bulge has affected the economy and marketers
through each of its life stages.  When boomers crowded into
elementary schools, there were so many of them that new schools
had to be built.  When they reached college age, new teachers had
to be hired and programs expanded.  Marketers are now looking to
the days when they boomers begin to retire.  This will drive
increased demand for such age-related products as retirement
communities, recreational activities, and home health care
specialists.</i></p>

<p>9.  Who influenced your choice to attend school?  What were your
internal influences?  Your external influences? <i> Although answers
will vary, internal influences should be such things as the need
for a job that requires a degree, the satisfaction of completing
a degree program, or wanting to learn at a higher level. 
External influences include family, friends, society, and class
expectations.</i> </p>

<p>10.  What is a multigenerational family?  What different opinions
might members of such a family give when faced with a decision
about a family vacation?  <i>A multigenerational family includes
members of different generations, for example children, parents,
grandparents, aunts, uncles, and even great grandparents.  Each
may prefer a different type of family vacation based on their
perception of what constitutes a good vacation.  For example, the
kids want Disney World, mom and dad prefer San Francisco, grandpa
and grandma want Branson, Missouri.</i></p>

<h3>CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING</h3>

<h4>Check Your Understanding 3.1</h4> 

<p>1.  Why do some marketers prefer to mass market their products? 
<i>Primarily because they believe that their product has mass
appeal.  Alternately, because it is too expensive, time
consuming, and/or too much trouble to differentiate the product
and the other elements of the marketing mix in a targeted
strategy.</i></p>

<p>2.  How are business/organization consumers classified?  <i>They are
classified into 1 of 11 major groups by Standard Industrial Code
(SIC) that includes the industrial market, the reseller market,
the government market, and the nonclassified institutional
market.</i></p>

<p>3.  Explain why consumer satisfaction is so important to
marketers.  <i>There are several million business/organization
consumers and hundreds of millions of personal use consumers. 
The competition to sell products to these markets is intense. 
Therefore, for a marketer to be competitive, consumer
satisfaction is essential.  A dissatisfied consumer won't
purchase or repurchase, which means the marketer doesn't generate
revenue or contribute to profit. </i></p>

<h4>Check Your Understanding 3.2 </h4>

<p>1.  Describe these alternatives: make, lease, or buy.  <i>Consumers
who make a product must gather materials and supplies, then use
their talent and labor to create a product.  A lease is a
contract to rent a product for a period of time, often with an
option to buy the product at the end of the contracted period.  A
buy decision transfers product ownership from the seller to the
buyer.</i></p>

<p>2.  Contrast rebuy and new task buying decisions. <i> A rebuy is a
repeat purchase without modification, therefore it requires
little if any additional information or search for alternatives.  
A new task buy requires information search because it is a
purchase made for the first time, which implies that there is
little history or prior knowledge of the product.</i></p>

<p>3.  What is a buying center?  <i>A buying center is a more or less
formal group of people who work together to make a purchase
decision.  Families often act as buying centers.</i></p>

<h4>Check Your Understanding 3.3 </h4>

<p>1.  How can a mission statement direct purchase decisions? <i> A
mission statement sets goals and establishes priorities for a
business or organization.  It affects purchase decisions by
establishing a broad framework for purchase decisions.</i>  </p>

<p>2.  Explain the terms: Derived, elastic, and inelastic demand. 
<i>Demand exerts a powerful force on purchase decisions made by
businesses and organizations.  Derived demand occurs when demand
for one product increases demand for others.  This is much like a
domino effect.  Elastic demand means that a change in price
stretches demand, so that when price falls, demand rises; when
price rises, demand falls.  Price and demand move in opposite
directions.  Inelastic demand describes many essential products
so that a change in price does not have a corresponding change in
demand.  Consumers are willing to pay the price or have no choice
but to do so.</i></p>
            
<p>3.  Describe other purchase factors that influence
business/organization consumers.  <i>The state of the economy
influences their purchase decisions.  Other influences are a
product's price, costs, product quality, associated terms, and
sometimes, personal interactions between purchasing agents and
product sellers.</i></p>

<h4>Check Your Understanding 3.4</h4>

<p>1.  Describe the types of external influences on personal use
consumer purchase decisions.  <i>Social influences are very
powerful.  These include family, reference groups, social class,
microculture and culture.  Other external influences are
marketers, the purchase situation, technology, and even the
weather.</i></p>

<p>2.  How can life stages influence a family's purchases?  <i>The
stages family's move through are important because each stage has
different purchase needs.  For example, young family expecting a
first child makes child-related purchases.  A retirement-aged
couple downsizing their living accommodations makes different
purchase decisions based on their needs and wants.</i></p>

<p>3.  Explain how roles, reference groups, and opinion leaders
influence personal use consumers. <i> All of these external
influences exert pressure on consumers to make acceptable
decisions.  The consumer often must interpret the pressure, which
can distort the message.  However, depending on how vulnerable
the consumer is to these pressures, the influence on his or her
purchases can be significant.</i></p>


<h4>Check Your Understanding 3.5</h4>

<p>1.  What are needs?  How are they related to motives? <i> Needs are
internal influences on consumer behavior.  They are gaps between
reality and a desired state that create a tension that can be
released by a behavior.  A motive is a need that has been
energized and directed toward a goal.</i></p>

<p>2.  How does involvement influence perception?  <i>Involvement is
the level of interest that a consumer has in a particular object,
activity, or idea.  It also is an internal influence on consumer
behavior.  How deeply involved a consumer is with something
affects their interest in purchases related to the involvement
object.</i></p>

<p>3.  What is an attitude?  Can consumer attitudes be changed? <i> An
attitude is a lasting feeling, an overall like or dislike.  A
consumer attitude can be changed, but often it requires
considerable skill and consumer knowledge to do so successfully.</i></p>

<h3>MINI-CASES</h3>

<h4>Mini-Case 3.1: What Has Happened to the Fat-Conscious Consumer? </h4>  
              
<p>     Although many consumers say they are watching their fat
intake, their behaviors tell a different story.  The market for
fat-free and low fat foods is growing, yet so are markets for
rich ice creams and loaded cheeseburgers.  This apparent
contradiction underscores the difficulty of understanding
consumers and predicting their behaviors.</p>

<p>1.  What do you think is happening to consumers' commitment to
eating healthy?  <i>It takes considerable commitment to maintain a
low fat diet, along with a willingness to sometimes pay more. 
This is a fad for some consumers, a temporary involvement with a
way of eating that will not last.  For other consumers, it is
lasting and signals a deep commitment to controlling their diets. 
Many Americans talk about their diets and exercise programs, yet
easily fall off the good food wagon.</i></p>

<p>2.  If you were a marketer of a line of healthy foods, would you
abandon the healthy food market?  <i>With a market as large as the
United States, a small segment could easily include several
million consumers.  If I were marketing a healthy food product
line, I would stick with it and explore the possibilities of also
promoting the line for its good taste.</i></p>

<p>3.  Do you think this trend toward more flavorful foods will
last?  Why or why not?  Can you explain your answer in terms of
demographics?   <i>As baby boomers age, they will probably become
more health conscious.  This has very good implications for an
expanding market for healthy foods.</i></p>

<h4>Mini-Case 3.2: Gender Differences Show Up in Consumer Behaviors</h4>
 
<p>     Gender differences in consumers show up in many different
consuming situations.  Certainly it is reflected in some gender-specific products.  It is evident in the way men and women
grocery shop, use computers, and approach business travel.  An
understanding of these differences can lead to profitable target
marketing.</p>

<p>1.  Do you think social pressures could have anything to do with
these gender differences?  <i>Social influences on consumer
behaviors are very powerful.  There is no doubt that they could
also influence the specific consumer behaviors identified in this
mini-case.  On the other hand, particularly in the case of how
the genders approach computers, there is some evidence that the
differences lie in the way that men and women process
information.  Brain structure and chemistry may be more important
in explaining these gender differences.</i></p>

<p>2.  Are these gender differences important to marketers?  Explain
your answer.   <i>Absolutely!  They can provide powerful consumer
insights that marketers use to better target their market offers. 
For example, knowing that men are generally more prone to impulse
purchases suggests that marketers of impulse-type products should
target men and use signage and other promotion tools to attract
male consumers.</i></p>

<p>3.  Will some of these differences change as (1) more men have to
do the grocery shopping and (2) more women have to use computers?
<i>Not necessarily.  If the differences are internally influenced,
then usage rates probably won't have much effect.  However, if
they are externally moderated, then changes may occur.</i></p>

 <h3>WHAT DO YOU THINK?</h3>

<p>     The green consumer movement ebbs and flows.  A sudden, well
publicized crisis, like an oil spill or a decrease in the
atmosphere's ozone layer, sparks fear and increases consumer
interest in environmentally friendly actions and products.  Other
times consumer interest in and support of the environment appears
to subside.  Many, but not all, consumers remain convinced that
protecting the environment is a good thing.  However, they don't
necessarily follow-through with their behaviors.  Sometimes it is
because environmentally friendly products are more costly to
purchase and not available in convenient places.  In the case of
clothing, which has social as well as price considerations,
environmentally correct may not be fashionable.  This is a
complex issue that can be used to stimulate a class debate about
the viability of environmental targeting, as well as the
mysteries of consumer behaviors.</p>  
            
<h2><a name="internet">USING THE INTERNET</a></h2>

<p>     Several Internet applications may be used to complement the
topics developed in Chapter 3.  Remember to check addresses and
paths before you assign them to confirm that addresses are still
accurate and operational.  Likewise, stress professional student
behavior on the Internet at all times, along with Net-cautions. </p> 

<h3>Internet Assignments</h3>

<h2><a name="marketing">MARKETING APPLICATIONS</a></h2>
<h4>MARKETING APPLICATION 3.1</h4>

<p>     If you have some non-traditional students in class, ask if
any of them make purchase decisions for their employers.  Even
some of the traditional students may be able to contribute with
their experiences as purchasing agents.  Contrast some of these
purchases with those made by personal use consumers. 
Alternately, invite a purchasing agent from your school to speak
to your class.  Have them describe the different ways that
purchases are made.  In particular, ask them to contrast straight
rebuys from new task.</p>


<h4>MARKETING APPLICATION 3.2</h4>

 <p>    Many print advertisements use fear appeals.  In addition to
tire ads, there are fear appeals for products designed to reduce
aging, facial lines, or body fat; eliminate perspiration odor or
bad breath; and provide immediate access to repairs should your
car break down.  Assemble the students' fear appeal ads and have
everyone analyze them.  Which are the most effective?  Why?  What
is the most extreme of the appeals?  Is there a risk in making a
fear appeal too realistic?</p>


<h4>MARKETING APPLICATION 3.3</h4>

<p>     A role inventory can be an intriguing activity for many
students, particularly non-traditional students who are currently
balancing the demands of many different roles.  In order to
illustrate these differences, have students form themselves into
dyads or small teams with members mixed between traditional and
non-traditional students.  Have them compare their roles and the
influences on them.  What conclusions can they draw from their
analysis?  Are these results generalizable?  Is there a
commonality of roles that can be used as a basis for grouping
consumers?  You can find many print advertisements that answer
this question; one appears on page 90 of the text (Photo 3.7). 
Bring other examples to class to illustrate how marketers are
making use of this consumer insight.</p>

<h4>MARKETING APPLICATION 3.4 </h4>

<p>     Have students bring their observations to class, compile the
results, and arrive at a class consensus on the multicultural
influences in your city.  How do these results compare
proportionally to your city's ethnic composition?  Are some
ethnic restaurants preferred?  Discuss how a marketing researcher
might determine whether the restaurants have altered their
products to conform to local tastes of your city.  </p>


<h4>MARKETING APPLICATION 3.5</h4>

<p>     This assignment usually sparks considerable student interest
because it always seems as if someone in the class is in the
middle of car shopping.  In addition to the listed sources, have
them visit some automobile sites on the Internet to determine the
type of information available there.  Many credit unions will
provide printouts of the list price on specific car models.  This
can be cited as an information source that is often used in
arming consumers to enter into car price negotiations.</p>



<h2><a name="consumer">CONSUMER INSIGHTS AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETING </a></h2>
<h4>CONSUMER INSIGHT 3.1</h4>

<p>     It is important for students to develop an understanding of
the comparative size of each of the two broadest consumer
segments, business/organization consumers and personal use
consumers.  In this Consumer Insight (page 72 of the text), some
recent numbers are provided for the business/organization market. 
These numbers do not change significantly from year to year.  In
order to place the numbers in perspective, assign the Internet
activity in this chapter and have them bring the results to class
for discussion.</p>


<h4>CONSUMER INSIGHT 3.2</h4>

 <p>    This Consumer Insight (page 74 in text) focuses on an
important insight that is guiding many advertising campaigns. 
Have students look for print advertisements for products directed
at older Americans.  What age groups are the most likely targets
for the products?  Now, carefully examine the people pictured in
these advertisements.  Are they younger looking than you might
expect for product users?  What can explain this discrepancy?</p>


<h3>INTERNATIONAL MARKETING REPORT</h3>

<p>     Should children be the targets of advertising?  Should
children be seen in advertisements promoting products?  These
questions are more negatively answered in many other countries
than they are in the United States.  We have some of the most
liberal rules government advertising to and with children.  If
you have international students in your class, use this
opportunity to ask them to comment on how their country stands on
this issue.  You can invite international students or other
teachers to visit your class to discuss this issue.  Alternately,
students can content analyze print advertisements in periodicals
from other countries to determine trends in advertising to and
with children.  This can also be the topic for a lively class
debate.</p>

<title>CHAPTER 7: UNDERSTANDING PRODUCT</title>
</head>
                                
<h1><center>CHAPTER 7</h1>
<h1>UNDERSTANDING PRODUCT</center></h1>
                                
<h2>CHAPTER ABSTRACT</h2>


<p><b>1. Recognize the nature of product.</b>  Product is a focal point for
decisions involving the other marketing mix variables of price,
place, and promotion.  A product is anything offered to buyers to
satisfy their wants and needs in exchange for something of value. 
Product is a complex bundle of benefits.  Marketers use the
marketing mix variables to differentiate their products from
others and establish a competitive advantage.  Products are
classified in order to promote understanding, establish
relationships, and determine how successful marketing strategies
can be used for similar products.  Two important product
classifications identify the nature of products (goods and
services) and product target markets (personal use and
business/organization consumers). 


<p><b>2. Describe the total product concept.</b>  Products are often
represented as having three parts.  The core is the basic
product.  The augmented product is what the consumer expects
beyond the core and the seller adds to make the core product
more attractive and differentiate it from the competition.  This
is also called the extended product.  The potential product is
what might be added to further enhance the product and add to the
value of the product for consumers.


<p><b>3. Identify different perspectives on product.</b>  Many different
individuals and groups hold important views about products and
their perspectives affect product marketing.  Government views
product as something to be monitored to ensure consumer safety
and free market competition.  The competition views product as
something to closely observe, sometimes dissect and copy, and 
threaten their own profitability.  The members of a product's
distribution system view product as their reason for being and
source of profit.  Within a business, product can elicit
differing and sometimes opposing views.  To the consumer, product
solves needs and satisfies wants.


<p><b>4. Explain the issues involved in making product decisions.</b> 
Marketers must make a number of important decisions about
products.  These decisions contribute to the development of a
product strategy.  Among them are decisions about product
features, lines and mixes, quality, design, branding, legal
protection, packaging, labeling, and at the end of the product
life cycle, the product termination decision.


<p><b>5. Describe how product assets are protected.</b>  Legal protection
is essential to defend product assets.  Packaging protects goods
physically, as well as contribute to product image and promotion. 
A label provides information that consumers need to make informed
product decisions.

<h2><a name="teaching tips">SOME TEACHING TIPS</a></h2>

<p>Chapter 7 begins the discussion of the marketing mix
variables with product, the focus of many important marketing
decisions.  To personalize the topic of product, ask students to
consider what their lives would be like without such contemporary
products as color televisions, personal computers, video games,
automobile air bags, microwave ovens, cellular telephones, and
video cassette recorders.  These products either were not
invented or were not available as personal use consumer products
in 1950, nearly half a century ago.  While we certainly could
live our lives without these products, ask whether anyone wants
to do so.

<p>Continue personalizing the product topic by asking the
Chapter 7 opening question, "What product opportunities will
emerge in the next century?"  Answers will doubtlessly vary. 
However, analysts suggest that three broad product categories
will become increasingly important in the next century.  These
are entertainment and leisure products, information technology
and dissemination products, and products related to health care,
health maintenance, and elder care.

<p><b>A Product Challenge: Building An Egg Delivery System</b>

<p>I introduce the egg delivery system activity at this point
in order to build a foundation for the discussion of product, as
well as provide a reference for later discussions of price,
place, and promotion.  The origin of this activity is obscure,
however, it was recently distributed to the MKTTEACH list on the
Internet.  Variations have appeared elsewhere, particularly in
colleges of engineering across the country.  Local newspapers
often publish stories about engineering students who build egg
delivery systems patterned after shoes, windmills, helicopters,
and space ships.  The students contest which delivery system can
withstand a several story drop and deliver an unbroken egg to the
cement below.  They rarely work as expected!

<p>Ask your students to form 3 to 4 person teams.  Set up a
scenario, something like the following, or add embellishments, as
desired.  Tell the teams that you, the customer, have a problem. 
You live in an apartment building and hate to cook.  You do make
scrambled eggs, so you always have eggs in the refrigerator. 
Luckily, your downstairs neighbor is a great cook, and she likes
to share what she cooks.  The only bad part is that she is very
absent minded and is always running out of eggs.  You're happy to
provide her with eggs, particularly since you enjoy her cooking. 
To save time and energy, you deliver the eggs your downstairs
neighbor needs by leaning out over your balcony railing and
dropping the eggs into her hands, as she leans out over her
balcony railing.  This works most of the time, but sometimes you
miss and she gets egg all over herself and her balcony!  You have
seen some egg delivery systems in a specialty catalog but they
are too expensive.  Instead, you want each team to make an egg
delivery system that will delivery an unbroken egg to your
downstairs neighbor.  

<p>Give each team the following materials 

<ul>
<li>30 straws
<li>one long strip of masking tape (about a yard in length)
<li>a half sheet of poster paper or an 11" x 14" sheet of paper
<li>crayons or marking pens
<li>an uncooked egg
</ul>

<p>Since you want to complete this activity in one class
period, set a time limit of about 50 percent of the class period
for students to design and build the egg delivery system.  The
remaining time will be used to have each team describe their
marketing strategy and test their product.  Explain the time
frame in which they must work.  Also, tell them that each team
may ask you one question if they need clarification.

<p>In addition to building the product, each team must

<ul>
<li>decide on a company name
<li>decide on a brand name (may be the same or different from
     the company name)
<li>set a price for the product
<li>identify a distribution strategy, where the product will be
     sold
<li>sketch a print advertisement for the product that provides 
     product, price, and place information, and a unique selling
     proposition (UPS) that gives consumers a good reason to buy
     the product
</ul>

<p>When the design and production phase is complete, ask each
team to briefly present their product, the company name, brand
name, pricing and distribution strategy, and the print
advertisement with its selling proposition.  I run the delivery
system test in the classroom, however, you may prefer other
alternatives.  We move the classroom chairs out of the way, cover
the floor at the center of the room with cut-open plastic yard
bags, and place a ladder in the middle of the bags.  Two student
volunteers hold the ladder and another student volunteer acts as
head tester.  Each delivery system is first tested at the three-foot drop level.  Surviving systems go to the five-foot drop;
then, the six and eight foot drops.  Take all necessary
precautions to secure the ladder and keep the room clean.  I
always bring extra eggs because some team inevitably gets overly
excited about they're doing and crushes their egg during the
design phase.

<p>Students enjoy this activity and it usually attracts outside
observers, lured by the laughter coming from your classroom.  The
activity itself establishes a firm conceptual anchor for your
class discussions of product, price, place, and promotion.  For
example, considering how the product line can be extended to
include related items such as delivery systems designed for rainy
weather or extreme cold; the price points that should be
established to satisfy different consumer preferences for luxury
or economy models; or the different types of promotions that can
be used to inform and persuade consumers to buy this product.  It
also can be referred to when you're discussing such topics as
customer satisfaction, inventory control, packaging, and
distribution strategies.


<h2><a name="outline">CHAPTER OUTLINE</a></h2>

I.   Recognize the nature of product
<ol>
<li>A product is anything offered to buyers to satisfy
          their wants and needs in exchange for something of
          value
<li>Product differentiation means using the marketing mix
          variables to make a unique product offer that stands
          out from the competition
<li>Products are classified in order to facilitate
          understanding, establish relationships, advance the
          field, and aid in making decisions about similar
          products
<ul>
<li>Some products are tangible goods, physical
               products that can be felt, stored, inventoried,
               mass produced, transported, tested in advance of
               purchase, and controlled for quality
<ol>
<li>Durable goods are long lasting and infrequently replaced
<li>Nondurable goods are replaced frequently
</ol>
<li>Services are intangible and cannot be stored,
               inventoried, mass produced, transported, tested in
               advanced, or controlled through standardized
               quality checks
<li>Personal use consumer products are often
               classified by how consumers buy them and include
               such goods classifications as convenience,
               shopping, specialty, and unsought goods
<li>Business/organizational products include goods and
               services, with goods categorized as
               materials/parts, capital items, and
               supplies/services
</ul>
</ol>          


II.  Describe the total product concept
<ol>
<li>The total or whole product offer is often represented as the sum of three parts
<ul>
<li>The core is the basic product
<li>The augmented product is the added value of the product beyond the core and what differentiates it from the competition
<li>The potential product is what could be added
</ul>
<li>Marketing opportunities also exist for product disposal and recycling
</ol>

III. Identify different perspectives on product
<ol>
<li>Many people and organizations have different
          perspectives on product
<li>Government views product as something to be monitored
          and encouraged to advance competition
<li>To the competition, product is something to be closely
          observed, sometimes dissected and copied, other times
          product is something to be driven from the market
<li>To the marketer, product is something designed to bring
          success, reach goals, generate revenue
<li>To consumers, product is something to fill a gap,
          satisfy needs and wants
<li>To the distribution channel, product is something to be
          moved from producer to consumer in order to generate
          profits
<li>To other operational units of the company, product has
          variable meanings
</ol>

IV.  Explain the issues involved in making product decisions
<ol>
<li>Marketers are responsible for making important product
          decisions and developing a product strategy
<li>Decisions about product features reflect what the
          product is and does
<li>Product line decisions determine what different related
          products will be offered while product mix decisions
          are about what different lines will be offered
<li>Product quality in production means conformity to
          standards; to consumers it often is a mixture of
          tangible and intangible product characteristics that
          indicate how well a product satisfies valuable criteria
<li>Design refers to those elements that determine how a
          product functions to solve a consumer problem, from
          making the product easier to wear, or better
          performing, to being aesthetically pleasing
<li>Branding is an identification of product ownership
          through a name, symbol, design, or other element
<ul>
<li>Brand decisions can be highly complex, ranging
               from distribution strategies to naming,
               cobranding, and brand extension
<li>Cannibalizing means stealing market share from a
               company's own brands by another in the same

</ul>
<li>Product termination is among the most difficult product
          decisions
</ol>

V.   Describe how product assets are protected
<ol>
<li>Unique product attributes are usually protected legally
<li>Packaging is an important product decision because it
          is protects the product physically, is the product's
          delivery system, helps to project brand image, and
          promotes the product
<li>The label, which is often incorporated into the
          package, offers important information about the brand
          and product contents
</ol>

<h2><a name="questions">SUGGESTED ANSWERS TO CHAPTER QUESTIONS</a></h2>

<h3>DISCUSSION QUESTIONS</h3>

<p>1.  Explain the concept of product as core, extended, and
augmented parts.  <i>The core is the basic product; the augmented or
extended product includes all the features that differentiate one
product from another including brand name, package, warranties,
special features.</i>

<p>2.  Identify some tools used to differentiate products.  <i>Some of
the tools used to differentiate products are branding, quality,
image, product features, packaging, location, promotion,
innovation, and different service levels.  The marketing mix
variables (price, place, and promotion) are powerful tools used
to differentiate products.</i>

<p>3.  Why is it important to distinguish among various types of
products?  <i>Product classification interests marketers more than
consumers.  However, it is important to distinguish among
products in order to understand them better, establish
relationships, extend marketing knowledge (advance the field),
and establish commonalities so that similar products can benefit
from the same types of successful marketing mix strategies.</i>

<p>4.  Describe Copeland's classification system and explain its
importance to a marketer.  <i>Melvin Copeland was the first to
present a classification system for merchandise sold in retail
stores.  His system is based on buyer habits and differentiates
convenience, shopping, specialty, and unsought goods.  These
classifications are often extended to products.  They are
important to marketers because they serve to distinguish between
product types (see question number 3).</i>

<p>5.  Discuss the types of product decisions that a marketer must
make.  Are all of the decisions made solely by marketers? 
Explain.  <i>Types of decisions are about product features, product
lines, quality, design, branding, legal protection, packaging,
labeling, and product termination.  Not all the decisions are
made solely by marketers.  For example, many decisions about the
core product and product features and design are made primarily
by production and manufacturing, with important contributions
from marketers.</i>

<p>6.  What is a product line?  Give an example of one.  <i>A product
line is a group of related products that accommodate different
levels of consumer needs.  For example, the Bayer Select product
line of analgesics for headache, arthritis, menstrual, sinus, or
nighttime pain.</i>

<p>7.  Compare and contrast: product line, product category, product
mix.  <i>A product line is a group of related products that
accommodate different levels of consumer need.  A product
category describes items in different but related product lines
or in the same product line but with different features.  A
product mix is all of the products offered by a business,
including lines and items.  The mix is the broadest description
of different products offered; the line is the narrowest
description.</i>

<p>8.  What is value?  Why is it important to the consumer?  To the
marketer?  <i>Value is the eye of the consumer.  It is the
consumer's evaluation of the relationship between a product's
relative price, quality, and image.  It is important to the
consumer because consumers make value comparisons between
products and will favor products that have the right combination
of price, quality, and image.  To the marketer, it is critical to
determine what consumers value in order to provide products that
consumers will purchase.  Value differentiates the product from
the competition, so it is a potent factor in establishing
competitive advantage.</i>

<p>9.  If you were marketing national manufacturer's brands, how
might you feel about private-label brands?  <i>It depends.  Some
national manufacturers use a mixed branding strategy, offering
products under their own national brands, as well as under store
brands.  However, if I were solely marketing national brands (no
mixed branding strategy) I wouldn't necessarily like store
brands, particularly if they held a large market share.  I would
want to differentiate my national brand from store brands,
probably by strongly emphasizing quality and value differences.</i>

<p>10.  What is cobranding?  <i>If you like Heath Bars, you'll probably
love Ben & Jerry's Heath Bar-flavored ice cream.  That's what
marketers count on, that by uniting two or more popular brands,
the consumer will find double- or triple-branded products
irresistible.</i>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING</h3>

<h4>Check Your Understanding 7.1</h4>

<p>1.  Explain this statement: "The T-shirt is the Big Mac of the
international clothing industry."  Do you agree or disagree?  <i>The
Big Mac is close to becoming a global product, offered worldwide,
with some modifications to accommodate cultural differences.  As
an article of clothing, the T-shirt may actually eclipse the Big
Mac in distribution because the tee is already worn globally,
from trendy parts of London to tribal Africa and rural South
America.  The basic article of clothing is unchanged while the
design offers opportunities for endless variation.</i>

<p>2.  Provide your own definition of product.  <i>Answers will vary,
but essentially a product is anything that a seller offers and a
buyer wants and is willing to exchange something of value for it. 
It is a complex bundle of benefits that can mean different things
to different consumers.</i>
 
<p>3.  Distinguish between the nature of goods and services, and
personal use and business/organization products.  <i>Goods and
services are distinguished by the former being products that can
be felt, stored, inventoried, mass produced, transported, tested
in advance of purchase and controlled for quality.  Services are
the opposite.  Many products are a combination of goods and
services.  Personal use products are those that are used
primarily by end use consumers and often are classified by buyer
habits as convenience, shopping, specialty, or unsought products. 
Business/organization products are bought for use in production,
for resale, or to operate a business or organization.</i>

<h4>Check Your Understanding 7.2</h4>

<p>1.  What is the core product?  <i>The core product is the basic
product, without any additions.</i>

<p>2.  What is the augmented product?  <i>The augmented or extended
product is what is added to the core product to make it more
attractive to consumers and add value.  This includes brand name,
packaging, delivery terms, installations, guarantees, and
features.</i>

<p>3.  What is the potential product?  <i>The potential product is what
might be added to increase the value of the product for
consumers.</i>

<h4>Check Your Understanding 7.3</h4>

<p>1.  What product perspective should a business take?  Explain
your answer.  <i>A business must consider all product perspectives
because all of them can influence product marketing.  However,
for business that operate according to the marketing concept
philosophy, the customer's philosophy should be paramount, all
things being equal.</i>

<p>2.  What is the government's perspective on product?  <i>The
government desires to maintain and encourage competitiveness and
consumer safety and well being.</i>
            
<p>3.  Explain why there may be different perspectives on product
within a business.  Why might this result in conflict?  <i>Different
functional areas within a business have different
responsibilities, therefore, their perspective of product will
vary according to what they expect product to do.  This can
result in conflict when different product expectations collide.</i>

<h4>Check Your Understanding 7.4</h4>

<p>1.  Discuss the types of product decisions that must be made. 
<i>Many different important product decisions must be made,
including decisions about product features, lines, mixes,
quality, design, branding, legal protection, packaging, labeling,
and product termination.</i>

<p>2.  Explain the difference between national manufacturer's
branding and store branding.  <i>A national manufacturer's brand is
one that is designated by the manufacturer and used nationally. 
A store brand is associated with a retailer and not the producer. 
Some businesses use a mixed branding strategy, where the same
product may be both nationally branded and have various store
brands.</i>

<p>3.  Discuss the difficulty of defining quality.  <i>For tangible
goods, quality in production can be defined on the basis of
product specifications and how well the product meets those
standards.  To the personal use consumer, quality is less
tangible and more difficult to define.  It relates to how well
the product meets consumer expectations for valued features. 
Quality differs according to the product.</i>

<h4>Check Your Understanding 7.5</h4>

<p>1.  Why is it important to protect product assets?  <i>Their
protection is very important because product assets are valuable
to a company in terms of establishing competitive differentiation
and advantage.  A distinctive look, taste, or feature establishes
a unique value for consumers which translates into profits.</i>
 
<p>2.  Why is packaging often called the "last five seconds of
marketing?"  <i>This is primarily the case because many businesses
do not spend more than a relatively short time considering
packaging.  For many businesses, packaging is given very little
attention.  However, it is very important because packaging
protects, as well as helps establish a brand image and passively
promotes the product on the shelf.</i>

<p>3.  What does a label do for consumers?  <i>Labels provide valuable
information that consumers need to have in order to make good
decisions.  The recent change in food labeling has made it easier
for consumers to identify the ingredients used in prepared foods.</i>


<h3>MINI-CASES</h3>
                                
<h4>Mini-Case 7.1: The Best Brand In The World?</h4>

<p>What brands do your students think are "tops?"  Ask them to
list what they think are the top 10 quality brands sold in the
United States.  These are brands that they consider to be the
best quality in any product categories.  Evaluate the lists and
compare them with the list in this Case.  How similar are they? 
Do your student include Coca-Cola?  Should it have been included
in the EquiTrend list?  If you have international students in
your class, ask them how Coca-Cola is sold in their countries. 
Is there a social benefit to offering guests a Coke in their
country ?

<p>1.  What value is there to a brand in being named to a top 10
list like EquiTrend's?  <i>The most obvious benefit comes from the
brand equity that is associated with being on this list.  The
brand equity comes from consumer recognition of product quality. 
Being on the list simply confirms what consumers already know.</i>

<p>2.  Explain Coca-Cola's popularity worldwide.  <i>Advertising and
sales promotions account for much of Coca-Cola's success, along
with its being available almost anywhere.  The association of
Coke with American culture is extremely valuable in most
countries and helps explain the product's social benefits for
consumers who want to demonstrate their familiarity with America.</i>

<p>3.  Discuss possible meanings for the statement, "Coca-Cola is
the best brand in the world.  <i>"Best brand" can have several
meanings, depending on whether it refers to market share, name
recognition, social acceptance, revenues, profits, or
distribution.</i>

<h4>Mini-Case 6.2: Buyers and Marketers Beware: Fakes Flood Markets</h4>
 
<p>Counterfeit products are a serious problem.  Local
newspapers often report instances of counterfeit products being
sold at country fairs, court days, or flea markets.  Some of your
students may have experienced this problem.  Producers of branded
products get a double slap from counterfeits because they lose
revenue since no licensing fee is paid, and if the products are
shoddy (which they often are), their reputations suffer.

<p>1.  Who should bear the responsibility for defective fake
products - the owner of the brand name or the counterfeiter? 
<i>Technically, the counterfeiter, but many brand name manufacturers
will accept some product responsibility if only to protect their
good name.</i>

<p>2.  Why might some consumers want product counterfeiting to
continue?  <i>Low cost counterfeit products, even if they are of
inferior quality, are cheaper than the originals.  Some consumers
prefer price over quality and want the products.</i>

<p>3.  What, if anything, can governments do to stop the flow of
counterfeit products?  <i>The United States government threatened
trade sanctions against China if that country didn't crack down
on counterfeiters.  Governments can exert considerably more
pressure than individual businesses or even industry
associations.  However, there has to be a willingness on the part
of the government where the counterfeiting is occurring to crack
down on the perpetrators, otherwise no long term relief can be
achieved.</i>
                                
<h3>WHAT DO YOU THINK?</h3>

<p>Is more of a product always better?  How will your students
react to "movies on demand?"  How many television channels are
available in your area?  Will more channels frustrate viewers or
benefit them?  Students can discuss this question or broaden the
exercise to include others who can be asked the question.

<h2><a name="internet">USING THE INTERNET</a></h2>

<p>Considerable opportunities exit on the Internet to compare
products and learn about the product decisions that marketers
must make.  Remember to verify Internet addresses and confirm the
feasibility of an Internet assignment before you make it.  Remind
students to practice responsible, professional Net-etiquette at
all times.

<h3>Internet Assignments</h3>

<p>The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has an
extensive home page that offers information about its own
operations as well as links to other related sources.  Students
can visit this site to explore

<ul<
<li>how product assets are legally protected
<li>a searchable index of the Trademark Acceptable
     Identification of Goods and Services Manual
<li>information on important patent law changes
<li>The Copyright Office at the Library of Congress (link)
<li>the World Intellectual Property Organization (link) 
</ul>

<p>At the end of the USPTO home page, there is a link to a
tabulation of weekly statistics on use of the Patent and
Trademark Office Web server.  For example, total accesses for the
week of Sunday, June 18, 1995 was 39,623.  This number represents
"hits" or visits.  While it is unknown how many of these are
duplicate visits, for the time being, this is the typical method
for registering activity at a Web site.

<p><a href="http://www.uspto.gov">http://www.uspto.gov</a>


<p>Businesses that market information products are expanding
their product mixes into shopping products on the World Wide Web. 
For example, The Chicago Tribune's on-line service is also
offering a grocery delivery service, the New York Times is
developing a system to offer on-line purchases of theatre and
movie tickets, and Gannett Co. is planning to extend its product
offers into travel, entertainment, and possibly products offered
in its USA Weekend supplement (Reilly 1995).  At the Gannett Co.,
Inc. home page, students can learn about one of the largest news
and information product marketers in the United States.  Gannett
is a highly diversified company with extensive holdings in
newspapers, broadcasting, outdoor advertising, and other
ventures.

<h3>MARKETING APPLICATIONS</h3>


<h4>MARKETING APPLICATION 7.1</h4>

<p>The consumer needs being solved by each of the products in
the list (automobile, microwave oven, telephone answering
machine, automobile insurance policy, videocassette recorder,
automobile air bags) are clear, while the success of each is open
to debate.  Students may have differing opinions on how well each
product satisfies a need.  Dyads or small teams can consider each
list or part of a list, then report to the class on their
deliberations.  This research can be extended by having the class
develop a short questionnaire for one or several of the products,
then administer the questionnaire to others and report the
results to the class.  


<h4>MARKETING APPLICATION 7.2</h4>

<p>This Application calls for students to design a simple
exploratory survey, administer it, then discuss the results. 
When it comes to product difficulty, electronic products rate
high, particularly when it comes to programming videocassette
recorders.  The videocassette recorder is often the one product
most widely identified as being least satisfactory in satisfying
consumer needs.  Ask students to consider recommendations for
product design improvements based on consumer opinions.  What do
they suggest?


<h4>MARKETING APPLICATION 7.3</h4>

<p>High quality products often are associated with high cost. 
You can make this point by setting up a perceptual map on the
chalk board patterned on the following sketch.  Use price and
quality as the two key dimensions and ask students where they
would place certain well-known brands within the map, associating
the brands with high to low price, and high to low quality.  With
very few exceptions, price and quality will associate very
closely in most consumers' minds.  For example, if you use
automobile brands, your map will show such brands as Lexus at the
high end of quality and price, while the Hundai is at the low end
of quality and price.  

<p><b>A Perceptual Map: Price/Quality Association</b>

                                     |
                                     |

<h4>MARKETING APPLICATION 7.4</h4>
                                      
<p>Product naming is a difficult task, as students will find as
they brainstorm a name for the revolutionary heating and cooling
microwave oven.  Another alternative is to have them try their
hand at naming a food product.  For example, El Paso Chile Co.
brainstormed names for their brands that would make them stand
out on the grocery shelf.  Some of their choices include Hellfire
& Damnation hot sauce, Sweet Texas Fire jalapeno honey mustard,
and Snakebite Salsa (Block 1995).  Considering the competition
for shelf space, a food brand name must offer a quick hook to
grab  consumer's attention.  Have students survey a grocery shelf
of Salsa or hot sauce.  Which names stand out?  Alternately, have
students brainstorm a name for a barbecue sauce that would be
attractive to local consumers.  These sauce brand names are often
associated with a place or a local personality, such as Texas
Jack or Pistol Pete.  Why?

<p><b>Reference</b>
<p>Block, Toddi Gutner (1995), "Mother Knew Best," Forbes (July
     3): 52-53.


<h4>MARKETING APPLICATION 7.5</h4>

<p>Most consumers find the new food labels to be informative
and easy to read.  However, there still are problems particularly
when it comes to such ingredients as MSG, which can be listed
under a variety of names.  For consumers with MSG allergies, the
new food labels don't go far enough.  Have students bring to
class labels taken off foods they have recently eaten.  Evaluate
the labels and determine which are the most informative and
helpful to consumers making product decisions.      
<h3>CONSUMER INSIGHTS AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETING</h3>


<h4>CONSUMER INSIGHT 7.1</h4>

<p>The Dodge Ram truck's "rolling office" design is an
excellent example of collecting information about consumers and
then using it to make a product to satisfy them.  Students can
probably identify others, such as the snake light flashlight with
its flexible neck that can be anchored to nearby objects and
provide light while freeing the user's hands for other tasks.


<h4>CONSUMER INSIGHT 7.2</h4>

<p>Students can find out more about the J.D. Power and
Associates quality surveys as well as the Malcolm Baldridge
National Quality Award.  If a nearby businesses has been
recognized for high quality products, ask them to provide your
class with a guest speaker who will talk about their quality
control processes and the marketing advantages of being
recognized for a quality award.


<h4>INTERNATIONAL MARKETING REPORT</h4>

<p>Store brands are growing in importance internationally.  If
you have international students in class, ask them about the use
of store brands in their country.  This question can be
incorporated into cross-cultural interviews. </p>

<h1><center>CHAPTER 8</h1>
<h1> PRODUCT PROCESSES</h1>
</center>

<h2>CHAPTER ABSTRACT</h2>

<p><b>1. Explain how businesses obtain products.</b>  New products are
called the lifeblood of a company.  However, newness is a matter
of perspective.  A product may be new to the business offering
it, to consumers, an industry, or even a country.  Product
newness is often classified according to whether the product is
revolutionary, evolutionary, or somewhere between the two. 
Product strategies are developed so that products can achieve the
business goals set for them.  Some frequently used product
strategies designed to obtain new products are to revitalize
existing products, extend them, acquire new products, duplicate
existing products, cooperate with others to jointly develop
products, and generate new products through research and
development processes.


<p><b>2. Characterize the new product development process and explain
the importance of new products.</b>  Some businesses spend millions
on research and the development of new products in the hope that
they will gain profits, market leadership, and a competitive
advantage.  New product development typically proceeds through a
series of steps.  In some cases, consumers are involved with new
product development from the start of the process.  Development
steps include opportunity scanning, idea generation, idea
screening, concept testing, market analysis and marketing plan
development, product production, test marketing, and
commercialization.  Product development requires teamwork.  New
product failure rates are high.  As a result, some businesses are
taking aggressive steps to reduce the failure rate.


<p><b>3. Recognize the methods used to describe consumer responses to
products.  </b>It is important for marketers to understand and
describe consumer responses to products.  The product adoption
process describes how consumers proceed from awareness of a new
product, ultimately to a product purchase.  Innovations diffuse
through a society, with some consumers rushing to be among the
first to purchase a new product.  The majority of consumers hold
back, waiting to see how well the product is accepted by others
before they adopt it.  The product life cycle is a descriptive
device for characterizing generally how consumers respond to
products over time.  The international product life cycle model
suggests that product life cycles can be extended by introducing
a product to international markets where it may be new, even as
the same product is maturing or declining in the home market. 
Product positioning is another important consumer response that
explains how consumers mentally perceive products and compare
them on valued features.  Sometimes a product must be
repositioned, often because the initial consumer positioning was
unfavorable or because of changes in the competition or
environment.


<p><b>4. Compare different product management strategies.  </b>Once a
product is launched, it must be managed in order to gain and
sustain profitability.  No single form of product management is
effective for all businesses or products.  Some businesses use
brand managers, others use category managers, or form business
groups to manage products.


<p><b>5. Identify contemporary product issues.  </b>Some important product
issues confronting marketers are complaints about planned product
obsolescence, consumer rights, product recalls, and product
liability.

<h2><a name="teaching tips">SOME TEACHING TIPS</a></h2>

<p>     The Chapter 8 opening question asks, "If new products are so
crucial to business success (if not survival), why do so many of
them fail despite efforts to ensure their success?"  The new
product failure rate is estimated by some marketers to be
approaching 90 percent!  While there are many different causes of
product failure, from poor quality to high price, some blame lies
with the proliferation of products, as highlighted in the
Consumer Insight (page 237 of the text).  Students can check the
extent of product proliferation with Marketing Application 8.2
(page 241 of the text).  This activity can be expanded to include
look-alikes in such product categories as deodorants, shampoos,
dry cereals, cookies and crackers.  Keep in mind that while
marketers may not be happy with product proliferation, consumers
often are because it gives them a greater choice among products
and between prices.

<p><b>Fads</b>

<p>Fads are another product issue to consider and discuss. 
They include such things as pet rocks, wacky wall walkers,
volcano lamps, and pop rock candies.  Why do consumers buy such
products?  Ask your students.  It is likely that some have
purchased one or more of these products and can probably identify
other fad product purchases.  The question, "What influences
consumers to purchase a fad product?", can lead to a discussion
of consumer variety seeking behavior and the influence of
referent others on purchase decisions.  Do fad product purchases
undermine the economic concept of the rational consumer?  Do
successful fad products encourage competition, and if they do,
what is the risk to the late market entrant?  If possible, bring
examples of fads to class as visual aids.  A demonstration of a
wacky wall walker or one of its look alike imitators can enhance
a class discussion. 

<p>     Are clear products a fad?  Ask students what they think of
clear products.  If anyone has tried or currently uses a clear
deodorant, ask what they think of the concept and the result.  Is
there a gap between expectation and delivery, or are they
satisfied?   What product extensions could be developed from a
clear deodorant?  For example, might some consumer segments
prefer 

<ul>
<li> a clear and unscented deodorant
<li> a clear, unscented, and spray dispensed deodorant
<li> a clear, unscented, spray dispensed, and antiperspirant
     deodorant
</ul>

<p>     What product categories are most appropriate for a clear
product feature?  Have students debate the probable value to
consumers of a 

<ul>
<li> clear cooking oil
<li> clear gasoline
<li> clear perfume
<li> clear tea
</ul>

<p>     Of the strongly marketed clear beverages introduced in 1993,
only Coors' Zima Clearmart appears to have excited consumers
(Triplett 1994).  Crystal Pepsi, Coke's clear Tab, and Miller
Clear have not been so fortunate.  Perhaps one reason for Zima's
popularity is that Coors didn't rely just on the clear feature to
market the product.  Instead, their focus was on drinkability,
freshness, and light taste.  The Zima home page can be visited on
the Internet (see <a href="#internet">Using the Internet</a> in this chapter). 

<p><b>     Reference</b>
<p>     Triplett, Tim (1994), "Consumers Show Little Taste for Clear
     Beverages," <i>Marketing News</i> (May 23): 1-2.

<p><b>New And Improved Products</b>
 
<p>     Many consumers distrust marketers because of the abundance
of product claims about "new and improved" formulations that, in
reality, have no clear advantage over the original.  This is a
serious ethical issue that students can research and debate. 
Marketing Application 8.1 (page 239 of the text) considers this
problem by having students evaluate several grocery product
categories for the use and overuse of this claim.  Broaden the
discussion by examining other product categories where "new and
improved" claims are often made.  For example, students can
perform a content analysis of print advertisements for
automobiles in current popular magazines to determine whether
this is an automobile selling point.  What are the marketer's
legal and ethical responsibilities to be truthful about "new and
improved" claims?  What are the options open to consumers who
believe that these responsibilities have not been met?       

<p><b>Product Strategies</b>

<p>     The product line extension strategy can be illustrated by
bringing examples to class.  For example, Dial Corporation has
been highly successful in extending its popular Dial bar soap to
other products in the body soap line, hand soap line, shampoo,
and deodorant lines.  Ask students why Dial has been well
received by consumers.  Point out that 

<ul>
<li> Dial began with a strong, respected brand name, positive
     brand image, and good brand equity,
<li> the product extensions are appropriate, reasonable, and
     credible, and
<li> it has a profitable, brand loyal market segment that
     provides a solid market base on which the extension product
     strategy can be developed
</ul>

<p>Could Dial have extended the line as successfully to bread,
cookies, pasta sauce, or canned fruits?  If not, why?  What other
products and lines could Dial develop with a great expectation
for success?  

<p>     A product extension discussion lends itself to presentation
as a decision tree.  For example, begin with the original Dial
soap as the main trunk, then extend major branches to other
soaps, shampoos, deodorants, and related products.  Some branches
may lead to risky product extensions, in categories far removed
from the business' original competency in soaps.  Keep the focus
on the core competencies that a business brings to the line
extension strategy.  Usually the most successful extensions are
the ones that build on a company's principal competencies.

<p>     Other examples that can be used are Healthy Choice cookies,
crackers, breakfast dry cereals, and breakfast bars; and Jell-O
dry pudding, pudding and pie filling, prepared pudding pops, pie
mix.  Students can suggest other cases that also illustrate this
product strategy.

New Product Development     

     If you used the Egg Delivery System in Chapter 7, relate it
to the steps in the new product development process in Chapter 8. 
If you didn't assign it for the last chapter, you might consider
doing so here.  As an alternative, use the Wooden Pencil project,
which requires less preparation and cleanup.  

<b><p>     The Wooden Pencil Project</b>

<p>     Ask students to form small work teams and give each team 
<ul>
<li> a wooden graphite pencil with an eraser for each team member
     (if possible, use old fashioned yellow school pencils)
<li> a half sheet of poster paper (or an 11 by 14 inch sheet of
     white paper)
<li> marking pens or crayons
</ul>

<p>     Each group acts as a new product development team.  You have
come to them with an opportunity (the opportunity scanning step). 
Your salesforce has determined that consumers, personal use and
business/organization, increasingly are requesting products made
from natural materials.  They are rejecting synthetic products,
like plastic, and seeking natural alternatives, like wood.  You
forecast great profit opportunities if the teams can develop new
products, using the ubiquitous wooden pencil, that will tap into
this emerging market.  

<p>     Since the opportunity has been identified, the first team
task is to brainstorm ideas for new uses for the wooden pencil
(the idea generation step).  Give each team member 5-10 minutes
to <b>individually</b> brainstorm ideas and write them down.  New
product ideas can be for a single pencil or many pencils, joined
by a natural material, such as animal or plant fibers.  Point out
that opportunity scanning and idea generation often occur
concurrently. 

<p>     At the conclusion of the individual brainstorming time,
allow each team 10-15 minutes to brainstorm together.  Begin by
having team members alternately contribute ideas.  Set firm
guidelines that no idea can be discarded or criticized at this
stage, and everyone must contribute.  Encourage team members to
piggyback product ideas and elaborate on previously offered
ideas.  The goal is to generate as many different uses for the
wooden pencil as possible.  One team member should written down
ideas as they are presented.

<p>     Next, the teams must evaluate the ideas, rank them, and
identify the ones with the greatest potential (the idea screening
step).  For example, a recent list generated by a student new
product development team included such new uses for wooden
pencils as

<ul>
<li> chopsticks
<li> houseplant stem supports (used individually or in a trellis
     form)
<li> back scratchers
<li> ladies' hair pins
<li> hot mats (several pencils woven together by natural fibers
     into a square mat designed to a hot pot or cup)
<li> hair brush cleaners (to remove hairs from brush bristles)
</ul>

<p>     Students must decide what product features are most
important in order to be able to rank the ideas.  They should
consider each idea's marketability, produceability, and profit
potential.  Once a "top" product idea is identified, the concept
should be tested on potential consumers (the concept testing
step).  Since the goal is to complete this activity within a
single class session, it would be counterproductive to actually
conduct a concept test.  Instead, ask each team to describe 

<ul>
<li> how they would conduct the concept test
<li> what market segment should be used in the test
<li> what questions should be asked
</ul>

<p>     Assume that the concept test is a rousing success and a
market analysis and test market indicate that the product should
be commercialized.  Conclude the simulation by asking each team
to

<ul>
<li> decide on a company name
<li> decide on a brand name (may be the same or different from
     the company name)
<li> set a price for the product
<li> identify a distribution strategy, where the product will be
     sold
<li> sketch a print advertisement for the product that provides 
     product, price, and place information, and a unique selling
     proposition (UPS) that gives consumers a good reason to buy
     the product
</ul>

<p><b>Consumer Resistance To Change</b>

<p>     Many new products fail or diffuse very slowly because
consumers resist change.  Change is frightening to some people,
and marketers must take this into consideration.  Use the
<b>Consumer Insight</b> (page 250 of the text) as an example of a
product innovation that some consumers will resist, even if it
proves to be more effective than existing alternatives.  Explore
other recent product innovations that consumers have purchased,
but are not using to the product's full potential, such as
microwave ovens, videocassette recorders, and personal computers. 
What might account for this situation?

<p><b>Test Marketing</b>

<p>     Many marketers are turning away from the traditional test
marketing of new products.  They cite serious problems associated
with traditional test marketing, including the

<ul>
<li> high cost of setting up, running, and evaluating a test
     market,
<li> time required,
<li> probability that competitors may try to sabotage your test
     market results by running counter promotions on similar
     products at the same time you are running the test market
<li> advance notice given competitors about your new product,
     which gives them time to react and plan strategies to combat
     the new product rollout.
</ul>

<p>     An alternative to traditional test marketing is to use a
simulated test market (STM), a computer-based system that tests
consumer responses to new products.  Some popular simulations are
ASSESSOR, LITMUS, and Visionary Shopper.  

<p>     The Visionary Shopper computer system lets consumers who are
participating in the test market "walk" through a virtual store
presented on a computer screen.  Consumers see products as they
would actually appear on the self.  They can use a mouse-like
track ball to have the computer take a product off the shelf to
be examined, and even rotate a product to see all sides.  Product
prices and promotional offers are manipulated so test subjects
are exposed to a real-life simulation of the factors considered
by consumers as they make a product choice.  While traditional
test markets can cost in the hundreds of thousands to millions of
dollars to implement, this system costs around $40,000 (Grocer
1995).  Simulated test markets using virtual reality run best
with certain product categories and poorly with others.  Goodyear
Tire & Rubber was the first company to purchase and pilot test
Visionary Shopper (Rickard 1993).  Goodyear Tire & Rubber can be
visited on the Internet (see Using the Internet in this chapter).

     Shopper for Market Research," <i>Advertising Age</i> (October 25):
     24-25.

<p><b>Secondhand Product Markets</b>

<p>     Even a resold or secondhand product is new to the most
recent purchaser.  Considerable marketing effort goes into the
resale market.  Marketers run the gamut from luxury resellers
such as Christie's and Sotheby's, which sell works of art,
antiques, and unique articles; to used car and furniture dealers
listed in your local telephone directory; garage sales that
individuals have at their homes on weekends; and secondhand
clothing and furniture consignment shops.  Students can evaluate
the extent of such marketing activity locally by performing a
content analysis of garage sale listings, estate auctions, and
used car sales in your weekend newspaper, and checking product
listings in the yellow pages of the telephone directory.    
    
<p><b>Product Recalls</b>

<p>     If your students are unfamiliar with product recalls, have
them check current issues of Consumer Reports to see the variety
of products that can be recalled.  It is quite likely that one or
more have participated in a product recall.  If so, how was it
handled and were they satisfied with the results?  Botched
recalls that leave consumers dissatisfied can be devastating to
future sales and a company's reputation, at least in the short
term.  

<p>     How should a business handle a recall?  Students can debate
this issue by researching examples of recent recalls and
evaluating what went wrong.  Two companies that received poor
reviews for their recent handling of product recalls are General
Motors and Intel Corp. (Bissell 1995).  Instead of facing their
product problems head on and communicating directly with affected
consumers, there were denials and attempts to negotiate
settlements and avoid recalls.  Recent recalls extend across
product categories and include zippered beanbag chairs,
computers, tax software, and flammable brushed fleece clothing.

     20): A1.

<p><b>Product Liability</b>
     
<p>     Another product issue that lends itself to student debate is
that of product liability.  A rapid increase in product liability
suits in the United States has made this issue one of growing
concern.  Part of the problem in getting a grasp on the issue
involves the maze of different liability laws in different
states.  Responding to business concern over liability damage
awards in the millions of dollars, Congress is debating a product
liability reform bill (Hoffman 1995).  Some states are already
acting to restrict awards for product liability damages (Jones
1995).  In the meantime, this is a topic that concerns consumers
and marketers, and affects the welfare of both.

<p>     Product liability extends internationally.  European product
liability laws have been broadened recently so that company
directors are now liable to criminal prosecution if their
company's products are proven dangerous and have harmed
consumers.  The European Directive on Product Liability holds
producers and distributors liable.  This Directive also covers
secondhand products (Edgar 1994).  Information on the European
Union can be found on the Internet (see Using the Internet in
this chapter).

<h2><a name="outline">CHAPTER OUTLINE</a></h2>

I.   Explain how businesses obtain products
<ol>

<li>New products are the lifeblood of a company, but
          product newness depends on whose perspective is taken,
          a business, consumers, an industry, or even a country
<ul>
<li>Continuous product innovations differ only
               slightly from existing products
<li>Discontinuous product innovations are
               revolutionary new products
<li>Dynamically continuous product innovations fall
               between the two extremes, products different from
               existing ones, but not dramatically so
</ul>
<li>Businesses alter marketing mixes for products in order
          to reach goals for growth, profitability, or market
          share protection; they also obtain new products through
          different strategies
<ul>
<li><i>Revitalize </i>means reformulating, repackaging,
               and/or relaunching an old product, typically as
               "new and improved"
<li><i>Extend </i>means stretching a popular brand name to
               include other products in the same line, products
               in a related line, or sometimes, a different
               product category
<li><i>Acquire</i> means buying a business for its branks
<li>Duplicate means copying an existing product, with
               or without modification
<li><i>Cooperate </i>means entering into a joint venture with
               others to jointly develop new products and share
               the costs, risks, and profits
<li><i>Generate</i> means developing a new product, which
               often is the costliest, riskiest, and most
               profitable product strategy
</ul>
</ol>

II.  Characterize the new product development process and explain
     the importance of new products
<ol>

<li>A successful new product development can mean big
          profits and a sustainable competitive advantage, at
          least temporarily
<li>Product development typically proceeds through a series
          of interrelated steps
<ul>
<li>Opportunity screening
<li>Idea generation
<li>Idea screening
<li>Concept testing
<li>Market analysis and marketing plan development
<li>Product production
<li>Test marketing
<li>Commercialization
</ul>
<li>Product development requires teamwork and often
          includes professionals from many different business
          functional areas
<li>New products fail for many reasons, from problems with
          product quality or high prices, to redundancy and
          product proliferation
<li>Many businesses are aggressively attempting to reduce
          the new product failure rate, particularly by
          consulting customers at every stage of the development
          process
</ol>

III. Recognize the methods used to describe consumer responses to
     products
<ol>
<li>Marketers must be able to describe and understand how
          consumer react to products, for example, through the
          product adoption process that represents purchase
          patterns when consumers are faced with new products
<li>The product life cycle model is a descriptive
          generalization about the pattern of market acceptance
          for products over a period time, from their
          introduction through their decline and eventual
          termination
<li>The international product life cycle describes how the
          life cycle of a product can be extended by introducing
          it to international markets where the product is new
<li>Product positioning refers to how consumers perceive
          brands comparatively and develop mental perceptual maps
          which locate products (particularly brands) in relation
          to one another on key attributes, as judged by the
          consumer
<li>Product repositioning is required when the initial
          positioning needs alteration, or changes in the
          competition or environment affect consumers' perception
          of the product
</ol>

IV.  Compare different product management strategies
<ol>
<li>Once a product is launched, it must be managed in order
          to achieve profitability and business goals
<li>No single management strategy is equally effective for
          all businesses
<li>Widely used management techniques include the use of
          brand managers, category managers, and a
          multifunctional business group
</ol>

V.   Identify contemporary product issues
<ol>
<li>Planned product obsolescence is a problem that
          frustrates consumers and marketers must heed, because
          consumers increasingly value durability and reliability
          in many different product categories, which is
          reflected in their purchase decisions 
<li>Consumer rights and government protection of those
          rights is an issue of continuing tension in the
          marketplace
<li>Product recalls are often undertaken voluntarily by
          producers but sometimes must be mandated by government
<li>Product liability is a complex and confusing issue
                    because liability laws differ among the states
</ol>
                    
<h2><a name="questions">SUGGESTED ANSWERS TO CHAPTER QUESTIONS</a></h2>

<h3>DISCUSSION QUESTIONS</h3>

<p>1.  Why is product newness a matter of perspective?  <i>Product
newness depends on whose perspective is taken because a product
may be new to a business, an industry, consumers, or even a
country.</i>

<p>2.  Compare and contrast the three levels of product newness.  <i>A
continuous product innovation is a product that differs only
slightly from existing products.  A discontinuous product
innovation differs radically from existing products.  In between,
dynamically continuous product innovations differ from existing
products, but not dramatically.</i>

<p>3.  What are the ways businesses obtain products?  <i>Businesses
obtain products through such strategies as revitalize, extend,
acquire, duplicate, cooperate, and generate. </i>

<p>4.  Why would a business copy other businesses' products?  <i>A
business may copy products because it saves the costs associated
with research and development, as well as the risks associated
with new product introductions.  Many businesses are content to
collect less profits in return for less cost and risk.  </i>

<p>5.  Describe the product strategy with the greatest inherent
risk.  <i>New product development carries the greatest risk, but
also the greatest potential for profit and competitive advantage.</i>

<p>6.  Compare and contrast idea generation and idea screening. 
<i>Idea generation is a new product development step that calls for
offering as many different ideas as possible, without judging
their relative value.  In the idea screening step, ideas are
judged for their marketability, produceability, and potential
profitability.</i>

<p>7.  How are product concepts tested?  <i>Potential customers,
consumers who may purchase the new product and/or are purchasers
of similar products, are shown a model of the new product or
given a product description.  They are asked to respond to a
series of survey questions designed to determine their reactions
to the new product, particularly whether or not they would
purchase it.</i>

<p>8.  What is a test market?  <i>A traditional test market requires
selecting one or several test market locations, offering the
product there, evaluating consumer responses, and using that
information to project how the product may sell on a regional or
national basis.</i>

<p>9.  Why do so many new products fail?  What can be done to
reverse this trend?  <i>New products fail for a number of reasons,
including poor quality, high price, redundancy, bad timing, and
selecting the wrong target market.  One important way to combat
this problem is to get consumers (current or potential customers)
involved in the development process from the start, providing
their input so that product problems can be eliminated or reduced
before commercialization.</i>

<p>10.  Compare and contrast such consumer responses to products as
adoption, diffusion, and positioning.  <i>Consumers adopt (purchase)
products according to a process that includes awareness,
interest, evaluation, trial, decision, and adoption.  Innovations
diffuse through a market as different groups of consumers adopt a
new product, beginning with the innovators, then the mass market
(early and late adopters), and ending with the laggards. 
Positioning is a mental process where consumers develop mental
comparisons of products based on their perceptions of how 
products (brands) compare on valued attributes.  Marketers
influence consumer product positioning by providing information
and cues about product attributes for consumers to use in
establishing the mental comparisons.</i>

<h3>CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING</h3>

<h4>Check Your Understanding 8.1 </h4>

<p>1.  Why are new products called the "lifeblood of a company?" 
<i>Because they promise profits, growth, and even survival. 
Consumers want new products and marketers deliver them.</i>

<p>2.  Explain this statement: "Newness is a matter of perspective." 
<i>Newness depends on who or what is evaluating the product.  A
product may be new to a business, an industry, a consumer, or a
country.</i>
 
3.  Discuss the different ways a business may obtain products.
<i>Businesses obtain products through such strategies as revitalize,
extend, acquire, duplicate, cooperate, and generate.</i>

<h4>Check Your Understanding 8.2 </h4>

<p>Identify the steps in the new product development process and
explain what happens in each step. 

<ul>
<i>
<li> Opportunity scanning - determining gaps in the marketplace
<li> Idea generation - brainstorming new product ideas
<li> Idea screening - ranking the ideas for their marketability,
     produceability, and potential profitability
<li> Concept testing - trying out the concept on consumers
<li> Market analysis and marketing plan development - evaluating
     the marketability of the product and developing a marketing
     plan
<li> Product production - making enough of the product so that it
     can be test marketed
<li> Test marketing - testing the product on consumers in one or
     several test market locations
<li> Commercialization - if the test market results are good,
     launching the product 
</i>
</ul>

<h4>Check Your Understanding 8.3 </h4>

<p>1.  What advantages do multifunctional development teams have in
the development of new products?  <i>Interactions between
professionals representing different business areas can cut
development times and lead to greater development effectiveness.</i>

<p>2.  Provide several explanations for why products fail.  <i>Products
fail for many reasons, including poor quality, high price,
redundancy, bad timing, and market size and target market
identity miscalculations.</i>

<p>3.  What steps can be taken to ensure product success?  <i.Perhaps
the most important thing a business can do is get consumers
involved in the development process from the beginning, listen to
their comments, take their suggestions, and integrate this
information into the development of the new product.</i>

<h4>Check Your Understanding 8.4</h4>

<p>1.  Describe the product adoption process. <i>The individual becomes
aware of the product, becomes interested in it, evaluates it,
tries the product, decides whether to like it, then adopts
(purchases) the product.  Post-purchase confirmation determines
whether or not it was a "good" purchase.</i>

<p>2.  What is the product life cycle?  <i>The product life cycle
describes generally a process where products move through stages
from pre-introduction to introduction, growth, maturity, and
decline.  These stages reflect market adoption of the process
through purchase and repurchase.</i>

<p>3.  Explain the concept of product positioning and repositioning. 
<i>Product positioning is how consumers mentally perceive products
(brands) in relation to one another on several key attributes.
Marketers help consumers develop these perceptions through use of
price, place, and promotion, particularly advertisements,
personal selling, and sales promotions.  Repositioning is
sometimes needed, particularly when the original positioning
wasn't beneficial or when conditions change.</i>

<h4>Check Your Understanding 8.5</h4>

<p>1.  Why do products need to be managed?  <i>Guidance is needed to
introduce the product, guide it in the marketplace, and ensure
profitability.  Managers make decisions about products, price,
place and promotion.</i>
 
<p>2.  Discuss the difference between a brand manager and a category
manager.  <i>A brand manager is responsible for managing a brand; a
category manager manages many brands within a category.</i>

<p>3.  Identify several contemporary product issues.  <i>Contemporary
product issues that concern marketers include consumer complaints
about planned product obsolescence, consumer rights, product
recalls, and product liability.</i>


<h3>MINI-CASES</h3>
                                
<h4>Mini-Case 8.1: Gillette's "Sensor for Women" Takes a Big Slice of the Market</h4>

<p>    This is an example of a company that did things right in the
development of a new product.  This product is so good that even
some men prefer using the Sensor for Women to other products! 
Students can collect consumer insights about Sensor and its main
competition, Warner-Lambert's Schick Silk Effects and Bic for
Sensitive Skin.  Survey the class and others about their
experiences with the Sensor, Schick, or Bic.  Have they tried any
of these products?  If so, how do they rate the products? 
Students can observe Sensor and its competitors on retailer's
shelves.  Are Schick and Bic serious threats to Sensor?  

<p>1.  Most new products "wear out" after a relatively short time,
particularly when their reign as market leader is threatened by
knockoff me-too products.  What can Gillette do to extend the
success of the Sensor for Women and repel knockoffs?  <i>What
Gillette can do is listen to consumers, find out what they want,
and continue to develop products to satisfy them.  They certainly
were successful with the original Sensor for Women, and it
appears they are successfully maintaining their brand leadership,
at least for the time being.</i>

<p>2.  If a brand life cycle were drawn for Sensor for Women, what
stage would it be in?  Explain your answer.  <i>From the information
provided in the case, it is still in its growth phase as
described by its continuing sales growth, but with the
competition heating up, it may soon enter into maturity when
sales level off. </i>

<p>3.  Considering the brand's market share, where is it in both the
adoption and diffusion of innovations processes?   <i>Judging from
its market share dominance, a majority of the target market has
purchased it and it has diffused to the mass market.</i>


<h4>Mini-Case 8.2: Brands Have Personalities, Too</h4>
 
<p>     Some brand personalities are obvious, particularly as
illustrated in print advertisements.  For example, a cleaning
product whose advertisements show the product's bottle dressed as
a knight in shining armor.  Many brands are heroes, at least in
the eyes of their brand managers!  Naturally, all brands need a
positive image to convey to consumers.  This is certainly the
case with personal use consumer products, far less so with
business/organization products. 

<p>     Have students collect print advertisements that show a
brand's personality.  Evaluate how these advertisements can help
consumers mentally position the brands in relation to the
competition.  Some successful brand personalities to look for are

<ul>
<li> Jello-O brand products' fun, playful, childlike personality
<li> Charmin bathroom tissues' soft, tender image
<li> Michelin tires' protecting, strong personality
<li> Mazda Miata's sporty, youthful personality
</ul>

<p>     Are there some brand personalities that don't make sense or
fail to match the product's characteristics?  Might these cases
call for repositioning the brand?  How could a brand manager
reposition the brand for consumers?

<p>1.  Why should a brand's personality be managed?  What might
happen if it were not managed correctly?  <i>Brands must be managed
successfully in order for them to be competitive in the
marketplace and gain profits.  If they are not managed well, they
can fail.</i>

<p>2.  Brands are also associated with colors.  Can you think of
some brands that are associated with certain colors?  <i>Kodak has
received legal protection for its distinctive colors, as has
Coca-Cola.  Print advertisements are an excellent source of
insight into colors that are used to identify products.</i>

<p>3.  For each of the following brands, think of one adjective that
describes the brand's personality (use stream-of-consciousness
thoughts to select the first adjective that pops into your mind): 
Coca-Cola, Jell-O, Mr. Coffee, Betty Crocker, IBM, Apple
Computer, and Disney.  <i>Student answers will vary, but some past
responses include</i>

<ul>
<li> Coca-Cola is friends, fun, good times
<li> Jell-O is fun, feel good, taste good
<li> Mr. Coffee is reliable, dependable
<li> Betty Crocker is sweet, warm, smells good
<li> IBM is strong, serious
<li> Apple Computer is friendly, fun, helpful
<li> Disney is for kids, good times, sharing
</ul>

                                
<h3>WHAT DO YOU THINK?</h3>

<p>     Procter & Gamble (P&G) is first and foremost a soap company. 
It has developed many market leading consumer workhorse brands
that are the polar opposites of luxury brands.  P&G is taking a
considerable risk marketing brands that cannot benefit from the
company's core competencies and image.  However, if P&G limits
its visible association with the luxury perfume brands and
maintains their European names, Laura Biagiotti's Venezia and
Ferragamo, the company's marketing expertise can make them
winners.  Have students debate this issue and if possible,
evaluate the brands as they are being sold at different
retailers.  How are the brands displayed?  Are they close to P&G
perfumes or are they physically located near other, European-imaged brands?  Is there such a thing as establishing an image by
association?

<h2><a name="internet">USING THE INTERNET</a></h2>

<p>     Many of the Internet suggestions from Chapter 7 can also be
applied to this chapter.  It is extremely important that you
verify Internet addresses and confirm the feasibility of an
Internet assignment <b>before</b> you make it.  No guarantee of any
Internet address or information can be verified past the
publication date of this <b><i>Manual</b></i>.  Be sure to impress on your
students the importance of professional behavior on the Net, at
all times.

<h3>Internet Assignments</h3>

<p>     Products of all kinds are offered on the Internet.  A recent
jughead search, using the word products, resulted in 24 computer
screens of product directories!  These screens provide links to
directories with menus of consumer products, shopping malls,
business in cyberspace, a product registry, and store fronts.  A
search with the words new products results in one screen of links
to new product directories.

<p>     Students can perform new product searches in different
product categories on the Internet through directories identified
in the jughead search, by searching with other search engines
(Yahoo, WebCrawler, Global Network Navigator) or by going
directly to the home pages of competing businesses to evaluate
their new product offers.

<i>
<p>     Access jughead and at the search URL

address for the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC)
must be checked for accuracy.  If it cannot be reached by gopher,
try fedworld or one of the search engines.  At the CPSC site,
students will find a description of what the agency does, as well
as a public calendar of CPSC activities, publications, and
hotline information.  Students might find some of the press
releases interesting.  For example, Release #95-135 reports on a
sharp increase in injuries suffered by in-line skating.  The
Commission estimates 105,000 in-line skating related injuries in
1995, which represents a 184 percent increase in two years.  It

<h3>MARKETING APPLICATIONS</h3>


<h4>MARKETING APPLICATION 8.1</h4>

<p>     New and improved claims are common on grocery products in
certain categories, particularly laundry detergents and other
cleaning products.  The current interest in fat-free and low-fat
foods has led to a flurry of product revitalizations,
particularly in snack foods, deserts, and cereals that are "new
and improved".  This Application can also be used for gasoline
and pharmacy products.  Because of a recent federal regulation
that requires the addition of cleansing ingredients to gasoline
that will reduce air pollution, many gasoline brands are claiming
new and improved products.     


<h4>MARKETING APPLICATION 8.2</h4>

<p>     Private labels that mirror national brands are common in
many product categories.  Most consumers seem to like the look-alikes because they are usually cheaper than the originals. 
Other consumers are brand loyal and refuse to purchase look-alike
products, even if they are cheaper.  Students can debate the
benefits and costs of knock-offs, as well as relate their own
personal experiences with these products.  Have they mistakenly
purchased a look-alike and been pleased to discover that it
performs as well or better than the original?  Or, have they been
disappointed?


<h4>MARKETING APPLICATION 8.3</h4>

<p>     This informal survey of consumer adoption patterns for
microwave ovens, videocassette machines, cellular telephones,
personal computers, hand-held calculators, and fat-free cookies
can be extended to include others who may be more likely to have
purchased these products.  A survey of mostly traditional
students may provide limited insights into consumer adoption
processes because students may not have the discretionary income
to purchase most of the products.  However, this can lead to a
discussion of the relationship between product price and
involvement, and consumer adoption.  Ask how a consumer's
involvement (interest) can affect their adoption of new products,
and how their financial situation moderates the adoption process. 
In some cases, a consumer's need to be an innovator is the
strongest influence on new product adoption.  All of us probably
know at least one person or family that has to purchase every
electronic gadget the minute it is marketed.  A popular network
television situation comedy features just such a person, who has
a passionate interest in power tools that also extends to
household appliances.  He is a pushover for these new products
and has accumulated a large collection that gathers dust after
the newness has worn off.


<h4>ARKETING APPLICATION 8.4 </h4>

<p>     If you didn't assign the perceptual map in Chapter 7, then
you might want to use it here.  Substitute other car types, if
preferred.  Prices for these cars can be found on the Internet
using any of the search engines.


<h3>CONSUMER INSIGHTS AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETING</h3>

<h4>CONSUMER INSIGHT 8.1</h4>

<p>     What has happened to clear colas?  They were really hot when
they were first introduced, but the marketing push appears to
have fallen off considerably.  Have students perform a quick
product inventory at several local retailers to determine the
current state of clear colas and relate this to the topic of fads
and product proliferation.


<h4>CONSUMER INSIGHT 8.2</h4>

<p>     Not all innovative new products come from large
multinational corporations.  Many outstanding product ideas are
generated by observant small businesspeople who recognize an
opportunity and seize on it.  For example, in my hometown a 
warehouse owner recognized an opportunity to market his 176,000
square foot space as a mini-mall.  The previously vacant
warehouse is adjacent to a major state university.  Retailers
with products that appeal to teens and college age consumers are
flocking to rent space.  New tenants in this highly successful
location include a nightclub, a new and used compact disc shop, a
comic book and gaming store, tanning salon, laser game center,
and several restaurants (Pack 1995).

<p><b>Reference </b>
<p>     Pack, Todd (1995), "Center's Businesses Focus on Teens,
     College Students," <i>Lexington Herald-Leader</i> (June 29): C9.


<h4>INTERNATIONAL MARKETING REPORT</h4>

<p>     The Russian market is still highly risky.  While many
Western businesses are profiting there, others are pulling back
or out, unwilling to continue trying to cope with the
disorganization, uncertainty, and bureaucracy.  Product newness
in international markets has initial advantages; however, the
benefits must outweigh the costs.</p>

<title>CHAPTER 15: MANAGING MARKETING</title>
</head>

<h1><center>CHAPTER 15</h1>
<h1>MANAGING MARKETING</h1>
</center>

<h2>CHAPTER ABSTRACT</h2>

<p><b>1. Explain the role of the marketing manager.  </b>Marketing managers
guide marketing programs and people in the many different
activities associated with offering products to markets. 
Marketers are information conduits, communicating information
about products to personal use and business/organization
consumers, and bringing information back to the business about
consumers, the competition, and other important factors in the
environment.  There is no single marketing organization structure
that fits all businesses equally well.  Recent trends toward
flattening corporations, reducing the number of layers of
bureaucracy, gives greater power to individuals to take
responsibility for their jobs and make decisions.  In
multibusiness corporations, marketing management begins at the
top with a corporate level vice president for marketing.  Some
marketing managers are responsible for marketing in all of the
corporation's businesses.  At lower levels, category managers
oversee the marketing of entire categories of products with their
many different brands.  Brand managers are responsible for
managing the marketing of one or several related brands.  Other
forms include marketing managers for geographical territories,
consumer targets, or different operations such as personal
selling or new product development.  Marketing managers are often
called mini-general managers because they perform many of the
same tasks as a general manager, but only for marketing
activities.  Marketing activities are also managed in small and
mid-size businesses.  Marketing management means making decisions
about people, money, technology, and materials through the
interlinked processes of planning, implementation, and control. 
The marketing program is all the various operating marketing
plans and activities that represent the total marketing effort at
any particular time.


<p><b>2. Explain the role of the marketing plan.  </b>The marketing plan is
the blueprint for what marketing is to accomplish over a period
of time, usually one year and sometimes two.  The marketing plan
must be compatible with and complement plans for other
operational areas.  Marketing plans specify product-market
matches, marketing mix tactics, evaluation and control
mechanisms, and resource allocations.  A marketing plan for a
small business usually is less formal and complex than a
marketing plan for a large company.  A large company may have
hundreds of different marketing plans operating at one time; a
small business may have only one marketing plan.  There are many
advantages to marketing planning.  One is that it forces
marketers to systematically address issues that affect business
success and possibly, survival.  The planning process calls for
evaluating the business's customer base.  This often reveals that
relatively few customers are responsible for most of the sales. 
This is the 80-20 Rule, where 80 percent of sales are generated
by as few as 20 percent of the customers. 


<p><b>3. Describe implementation activities.  </b>Marketing plans are
meaningless unless and until they are implemented. 
Implementation is the activation of a marketing plan, when
people, money, technology, and materials are brought together to
execute marketing mix tactics and achieve marketing objectives. 
Implementation requires organizing people to perform marketing
activities.  Good implementation cannot save a flawed marketing
plan.  Three key activities involved in implementation are
organizing, staffing, and supervising employees.  Implementation
often is difficult because it involves change and people have a
tendency to resist change.  Other implementation problems
frequently are the result of communication problems and internal
disputes over resources.  


<p><b>4. Explain the function of marketing control.  </b>Control is the
evaluation of marketing performance and outcomes in order to
learn whether or not marketing goals have been met, and, if not,
why not.  Controls provide information that can be used to change
marketing plans and their implementation.  Control is extremely
important when the competition is intense because good controls
can lead to a competitive advantage by improving the efficiency
and effectiveness of marketing activities.  Control tracks
performance and outcomes using such measures as sales, market
share, costs, and customer satisfaction.  Many businesses use a
marketing audit to determine how effectively marketing is being
managed.  This audit of the business's marketing activities is
usually conducted by impartial external consultants hired for the
purpose.


<p><b>5. Describe how control results may be applied in marketing.</b>
Control results may indicate that things are running smoothly and
only slight corrections are needed.  In other cases, control
results may show that there are serious problems, so a more
drastic response may be needed.  Some U.S. companies faced with
quality control problems have turned to Japanese quality control
methods.  This includes kaizen, a commitment to continual
improvement that seeks to make products and processes better, and
thereby enhance quality.  Control results may indicate that
changes should be made in product and market mixes or in
strategies designed to grow the business.  Product portfolio
models may be used to differentiate the relative market share or
profit contribution of different products to the business.  While
product portfolio models may have descriptive value, their
prescriptive value is dubious.  Growth decisions in products and
markets can be categorized within a product/market opportunity
matrix.  The four cells of the matrix include a market
penetration strategy which calls for increasing sales of existing
products among current target markets without changing the
products or markets.  A market development strategy calls for
entering new markets with the same products.  A product
development strategy calls for changing products, or adding new
ones, to existing markets.  Diversifying means offering new
products to new markets.

<h2><a name="teaching tips">SOME TEACHING TIPS</a></h2>

<p>     The chapter opening questions ask: What does it take to
manage marketing successfully?  Why is it sometimes so difficult
to do?  Being a successful marketing manager is like being a
successful manager in any profession.  Some of the skills
required for good management are general, shared by managers in
many different professions.  Other skills are specific to the
marketing activities in which the manager is engaged.  Some of
the most important general skills involve people, communications,
and decisions.  Good managers must be able to work effectively
and productively with other people, including peers, superiors,
and subordinates, whether inside or outside the business.  Good
managers must be able to communicating clearly and decisively. 
They must make good and timely decisions after carefully weighing
all the facts and considering possible outcomes.  These decisions
often involve people, resources, technology, and time.
 
<p>     Good marketing managers also must have good marketing skills
that are specific to the marketing activities in which they are
engaged.  This means that if they are involved in marketing
research, they must have solid skills in being able to plan,
implement, and evaluate research results, and apply outcomes to
marketing problems.  If they are involved in retailing,
wholesaling, or any of the myriad activities that comprise
marketing, they must possess relevant skills in these area, as
well as the general skills required of any manager.

<p>     Even when a marketing manager has both general and specific
skills, circumstances can compromise his or her ability to
manage.  Marketing is not conducted in a vacuum.  The environment
is volatile and the competition doesn't sit around waiting for
your next move.  Sometimes dissension within the manager's own
company can play havoc with decisions and plans.  Squabbles over
resources and turf conflicts over power and control can undermine
even the best manager.  Consequently, considering all of the
factors that can compromise good marketing management, it is
probably a wonder that so much good marketing management occurs.

<p><b>Wrapping Up The Consumer And New Product Letters</b>

<p>     If you assigned the consumer and new product letters at the
beginning of the term, this is a good point to evaluate the
results of those efforts.  Ask any student who has not previously
brought a response to class, to do so now.  I usually spend about
20 to 25 minutes on this concluding activity.  Each student is
given an opportunity to restate the nature of their letter,
identify the product and company, and describe any response that
was received.  Students are encouraged to consider whether or not
they have changed their opinion about their target company based
on the outcome.  Sometimes they are disappointed that they
received nothing or only a cursory form letter.  Other times they
are so impressed with the response that as a result, they form a
new and better image of the company.  Ask the question: How does
good customer service affect the positioning of the product in
the consumer's mind?  This can be answered from the perspective
of student consumers who have received good or bad customer
service.  Ask students to consider what this has to do with
relationship marketing.  

<p><b>Guest Speakers</b>

<p>     The topics covered in this, the final chapter, lend
themselves to guest speakers, experienced marketing managers who
can add new perspectives based on years of observation and
personal experience.  In addition to asking any guest to speak
about their area of expertise, you might want to also ask them to
share their perspectives about career opportunities in their
professional specialty and specific skills that entry level
employees must hold.  Brand and category managers; advertising,
sales, and promotions are among the specialists that you might
consider inviting to class.

<p><b>Developing Student Self-Marketing Skills</b>

<p>     Even if a student does not intend to major in marketing or
become a marketer, he or she can use the skills learned in your
class to market themselves to prospective employers.  This is a
topic in Appendix C of the textbook and is addressed in the Study
Guide.  Encourage your students to develop a self-marketing plan. 
The process of systematically addressing each of the questions
outlined in a self-marketing plan will help them realistically
assess their strengths and weaknesses, as well as their
opportunities and the threats to their landing the job that they
really want.  

<p>     From my experience, students typically wait until the last
minute to start their job search.  At the end of every term, I am
approached by students who are nearing graduation and have
panicked because they don't have a job waiting for them.  Their
excuse for delaying the job hunt usually is that they've been too
busy!  Unless they're very luck, if you meet them in the next few
months, they are still looking for a job.  The competition is too
intense and the job market too volatile for most students to
blithely walk directly from the classroom to the office without a
considerable and lengthy effort.

<p><b>Business Etiquette</b>

<p>     If your school is like mine, there is no room in the
curriculum for students to learn about business etiquette.  This
is an area that should be discussed because it has grave
implications for how others perceive the recent graduate, as a
polished beginning professional or as someone prone to
embarrassing mistakes in business protocol.

<p>     This topic can be introduced as a complement to discussions
of customer service and relationship marketing.  When identified
with these activities, it becomes clear why proper business
behavior is very important to marketing success.

<p>     Some of the areas where students must be wary of business
faux pas are

<ul>
<li>in telephone communications, taking too long to return calls
     or not returning them, being abrupt or impolite with
     callers, failing to name yourself and your business, not
     apologizing for dialing wrong numbers, speaking indistinctly
     or too loudly, letting distracting background noise
     (including music on an office radio) interrupt the
     conversation

<li>in shaking hands, using the bone crushing grasp, a slap, or
     an overly gentle shake.  For men, failing to shake hands
     with a professional woman or holding a woman's hand too
     long.  For women, failing to shake hands at all

<li>in using first names, calling a customer or a manager by
     their first name, which is inappropriate unless told to do
     so by the person 

<li>in thanking people, failing to do so or waiting too long to
     call or send a thank you note

<li>in meetings, not paying attention to other speakers, reading
     mail during the meeting, doodling, coming late to meetings
     or leaving early without reason
</ul>

<p>     As you think about your experiences with businesspeople, you
will probably think of many other suggestions to pass on to your
students.  If you have non-traditional students in class, ask
them to share some of their observations on the importance of
business etiquette and faux pas they have experienced.

<h2><a name="outline">CHAPTER OUTLINE</a></h2>

I.   Explain the role of the marketing manager
<ol>
<li>Marketing managers guide marketing programs and people
          in the diverse activities associated with offering
          products to markets
<ul>
<li>Marketers act as information conduits, bringing
               information from outside into the business;
               transmitting information about products outside,
               to consumers
<li>There is no single marketing organization
               structure that is best suited to all businesses
<li>A recent trend in management is to reengineer the
               business and adopt the flattened hierarchy of the
               horizontal corporation in order to eliminate
               barriers between employees, improve processes that
               add value to products, and ultimately better serve
               consumers
</ul>
<li>In multibusiness corporations with traditional
          organizational structures, the top marketing manager
          usually is a vice president who reports directly to the
          CEO, the corporation's top manager
<ul>
<li>Some marketing managers are responsible for
               marketing activities in all of a corporation's
               strategic business units (SBU); others may manage
               marketing in one SBU     
<li>Category managers manage the marketing of an
               entire category of products, typically with many
               different product lines
<li>Brand managers are responsible for marketing a
               single brand
<li>Other organizational marketing management forms
               include having marketing managers for different
               operations like sales force, promotion, and
               marketing research; marketing managers for
               different geographical operations; and marketing
               managers for different target customer groups
<li>Marketing managers may focus on only one part of
               the entire organization, marketing, but they often
               are regarded as mini-general managers because they
               perform the same tasks as general managers,
               although in a smaller, more concentrated, focused
               operational area
</ul>
<li>Marketing activities also must be managed in small and
          mid-size businesses
<ul>
<li>In a small business, marketing management often is
               mostly sales force management because the sales
               force represents the largest part of the workforce
<li>Marketing management in a small business differs
               in formality and complexity from marketing
               management in a large organization; however, what
               a small business marketer lacks in resources can
               be overcome through creativity and quick responses
               to changes in the environment
</ul>
<li>Marketing management means making decisions about
          people, money, technology, and materials through the
          interlinked processes of planning, implementing, and
          control, specifically through
<ul>
<li>Formulating marketing strategies
<li>Planning marketing activities
<li>Implementing marketing programs
<li>Supervising and leading marketing personnel
<li>Allocating resources
<li>Evaluating marketing outcomes
</ul>
<li>The marketing program is all the various operating
          marketing plans and activities that represent the total
          marketing effort at a particular time
</ol>

II.  Explain the role of the marketing plan
<ol>
<li>The marketing plan is the blueprint for what marketing
          is to accomplish
<ul>
<li>It typically covers a one year period, but
               sometimes may be written for two years
<li>The marketing plan must be compatible with and
               complement plans from other operational areas
<li>Marketing plans specify product-market matches,
               marketing mix tactics, evaluation and control
               mechanisms, and resource allocations
</ul>
<li>The small business marketing plan usually is not as
          detailed or formal as marketing plans written in large
          businesses
<ul>
<li>The value of planning is that by addressing each
               of the marketing plan's sections, the business is
               forced to confront issues that are key to its
               future success, if not survival
<li>By evaluating its customer base during the
               planning process, it may be found that a large
               volume of sales is generated by a small number of
               customers, this often follows the 80-20 rule,
               where 80 percent of the revenue is generated by 20
               percent of the customers
</ul>
</ol>


III. Describe implementation activities
<ol>
<li>Marketing plans by themselves are meaningless, unless
          and until they are activated
<ul>
<li>Implementation is the activation of a marketing
               plan, when people, money, technology, and
               materials are brought together in an organized way
               to execute marketing mix tactics and achieve
               marketing objectives
<li>Implementation requires organizing people to get
               marketing done, as well as filling in the details
               of the work they are to perform, and providing
               sufficient money, materials, technology, and
               leadership so they can do their jobs well 
<li>Good implementation cannot save a flawed marketing
               plan
</ul>
<li>Three key activities associated with implementation are
          organizing, staffing, and supervising
<ul>
<li>Leadership is an important ingredient in
               successful implementation because it has a direct
               impact on performance
<li>Many contemporary marketing managers are
               empowering employees to made decisions and take
               responsibility for their work
</ul>
<li>Implementation is not always easy because people often
          resist change and sometimes, implementation requires it
<ul>
<li>Other implementation problems are associated with
               communication problems
<li>Internal disputes over resources can distract
               attention from implementation activities
<li>Marketing managers must identify threats to
               implementation before they can begin to resolve
               them
</ul>
</ol>

IV.  Explain the function of marketing control
<ol>
<li>Control is the evaluation of marketing performance and
          outcomes in order to learn whether or not marketing
          goals have been met and, if not, why not
<ul>
<li>Controls can provide useful information that can
               lead to changes in marketing plans and
               implementation activities
<li>Control is particularly important when the
               business faces intense competition, because an
               effective control system can be a way to achieve
               competitive advantage
<li>Control must be systematic
</ul>
<li>Control tracks performance and outcomes using such
          common measures as sales, market share, costs, and
          customer satisfaction
<li>A marketing audit is an unbiased, comprehensive
          examination of the business's marketing activities that
          is conducted periodically by impartial auditors as a
          control activity
</ol>


V.   Discuss how control results may be applied in marketing  
<ol>
<li>Control results are meaningless unless they activate a
          response
<li>When faced with control results that indicate quality
          problems, some U.S. businesses adopted the Japanese
          philosophy of kaizen, a commitment to continual
          improvement that seeks to make products and processes
          better, and, thereby enhance quality
<li>Control results may indicate that product and/or market
          changes are needed
<ul>
<li>Product portfolio models have descriptive value
               but often result in dubious prescriptions of what
               to do with a portfolio of products 
<li>Growth decisions in products and markets may be
               placed in the context of a product/market growth
               opportunity matrix
<ol>
<li>A market penetration strategy calls for
                    increasing sales of existing products among
                    current target markets without changing the
                    products or markets
<li>A market development strategy calls for
                    entering new markets with the same products
<li>A product development strategy calls for
                    changing products, or adding new ones, to
                    existing markets
<li>Sometimes, the strategy calls for
                    diversifying, offering new products to new
                    markets
</ol>
<li>Other product decisions include maintaining the status quo, divestment, and product termination
</ul>
</ul>

<h2><a name="questions">SUGGESTED ANSWERS TO CHAPTER QUESTIONS</a></h2>

<h3>DISCUSSION QUESTIONS</h3>

<p>1.  Why are marketers called boundary spanners?  Do you think
this is an appropriate designation?  <i>Marketers are boundary
spanners because they connect the business with its external
environments and facilitate exchanges between the business
(through its products) and consumers.</i>

<p>2.  Contrast the jobs of category manager and brand manager.
<i>Category managers are marketing managers who are responsible for
marketing a business unit's related product lines, as in laundry
detergents, diapers, or deodorants.  A brand manager is a
marketing manager who is responsible for marketing one or more
related brands.</i>

<p>3.  How are the jobs of general manager and marketing manager
alike? <i>A company's general manager is responsible for the
operations of a business or a business unit.  Broadly this
manager accomplishes organizational goals through planning,
organizing, directing, and controlling organizational resources. 
A marketing manager performs the same kinds of tasks, but in a
more focused, concentrated way, to manage marketing activities.</i>

<p>4.  Why are small businesses important to the economy and
marketing?  <i>Small businesses create new jobs, generate employee
salaries, produce revenues, and contribute to the general running
of the economy.  They help balance supply and demand, and clear
the market.  Small businesses operate in retailing, wholesaling,
and services.</i>

<p>5.  What is the marketing program?  Why does it require careful
coordination?  <i>A marketing program is all the various operating
marketing plans and activities that represent the total marketing
effort at a particular time.  To keep everything operating,
without duplications and conflict, requires careful coordination
of people, resources, and activities.</i>

<p>6.  Discuss the interrelationship and interdependence of
planning, implementation, and control. <i>These interlinked
processes are the way that marketing activities are managed, by
marketing managers who make decisions about people, money,
technology, and materials.  Plans must be implemented before they
can be of value to the business.  Once implemented, they must be
controlled in order to determine shortcomings and successes, and
collect feedback that can be used to modify marketing activities
and make new marketing plans.</i>

<p>7.  Explain why ignoring the 80-20 rule can be a serious mistake
for the marketing manager.  <i>This rule, which is an observation,
states that 80 percent of a business's revenue often is generated
by only 20 percent of its customers.  Ignoring this rule can be
costly, particularly if excessive marketing effort is directed at
the 80 percent of customers who account for only 20 percent of
the revenue.</i>

<p>8.  Compare and contrast authoritarian and participative
management styles.  <i>Traditional authoritarian management styles
usually fit pyramid shaped organizations where power and control
are top down and people do what they are told.  In a
participative management system, employees participate in
decision making and are empowered to make decisions for
themselves, take responsibility, and develop ways to work more
productively.</i>

<p>9.  Could a business exist for long without some controls? 
<i>Controls are essential to a business, for they determine whether
or not implemented marketing plans are meeting their goals.</i>

<p>10. What role does marketing play in the consumer's life?  In
society?  <i>Marketing plays a very important role in the life of
consumers and society.  Some of the ways that marketing
contributes is by </i>

<ul>
<li>providing products that consumers need and want

<li>offering products at prices that consumers find acceptable

<li>placing products where consumers want them, when they are
     wanted
<li>informing consumers about products, prices, and places

<li>employing millions of people in the United States and abroad

<li>contributing to the economic health of the nation by
     encouraging competition and the free market

<li>bringing supply and demand into balance

<li>helping clear the market of excess supply

<li>generally contributing to the high quality of life that most
     people enjoy
</ul>

<p>     Marketing is also criticized for many shortcomings,
including contributing to excessive consumption, cluttering
society with too many products and promotions, and engaging in
questionable practices, some of which are illegal and others are
both illegal and unethical.  
<br>

<h3>CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING</h3>

<h4>Check Your Understanding 15.1 </h4>

<p>1.  What is the role of the marketing manager?  <i>Marketing
managers guide marketing programs and people in the diverse
activities associated with offering products to markets. They
make critical decisions involving people, resources, technology,
materials, and time.  They plan, implement plans, and control
them. </i>

<p>2.  Why are marketers called mini-general managers?  <i>Because the
tasks that they perform in marketing management are a small scale
equivalent of the tasks performed by general managers for the
entire business, strategic business unit, or corporation.</i>
 
<p>3.  What tasks are performed by marketing managers?  <i>They plan,
implement, and control marketing activities.  </i>


<h4>Check Your Understanding 15.2 </h4>

<p>1.  How do marketing plans differ in large and small businesses? 
<i>Large businesses and corporations will typically have formal,
complex marketing plans.  They may have hundreds or even
thousands of marketing plans running concurrently.  Marketing
plans in a small business are less formal, less complex, and
there may be one marketing plan for the entire business.</i>

<p>2.  Explain how implementation activates the marketing plan.
<i>Implementation begins with the marketing plan, then brings
people, money, technology, and materials together in an organized
way to execute marketing mix tactics and achieve marketing
objectives, as defined in the plan.</i>
 
<p>3.  What are some implementation problems that marketing managers
may experience?  <i>Good implementation cannot save a flawed
marketing plan.  Communications problems and internal conflicts
over resources can undermine implementation activities.  Another
problem is when implementation requires change and many people
resist change as a threat.</i>


<h4>Check Your Understanding 15.3 </h4>

<p>1.  Explain the use of marketing control systems.  <i>Marketing
control systems evaluate marketing performance and outcomes,
identify deficiencies and problems, then suggest places for
improvement.  Control also collects feedback information that can
be used in the formulation of new marketing plans.</i>

<p>2.  What is a marketing audit?  <i>A marketing audit is like an
accounting audit, only of marketing activities.  It is usually
performed by an external consultant, someone who can be objective
in evaluating how well the organization is implementing the
marketing plan and achieving marketing goals.</i>
            
<p>3.  How may control system results be used? <i>Control results can
be used to make corrections in the implementation process and as
feedback to new marketing plans.  Sometimes control results
indicate that changes must be made in the products that a company
offers.  If the company has growth goals, control results can
indicate whether growth strategies are working and if changes
should be made.</i>


<h3>MINI-CASES</h3>
                                
<h4>Mini-Case 15.1: China Coast Restaurants - Coast To Coast</h4>
    
<p>    Restaurants, like any retail business, need marketing.  Large
restaurant operations have marketing managers who are responsible
for planning, implementing, and controlling the company's
marketing.  Identify a restaurant or chain in your area that
actively markets itself.  If possible, invite its marketing
manager to speak to your class about managing the restaurant's
marketing program.  

<p>1.  Explain how marketing managers may use planning,
implementation, and control in determining whether or not to
expand the China Coast chain nationwide. <i>They will have to
construct a marketing plan for the chain, and plans for each of
the initial outlets.  Approved plans must be implemented. 
Implemented plans must be controlled.  This means monitoring
marketing activities to determine if marketing goals and
objectives are being met.  Control activities provide feedback
which can be used to make needed alterations in implementing the
marketing plan(s).  The information collected through control
activities can be used in developing new marketing plans.</i>

<p>2.  General Mills is trying to grow a new business.  <i>Where would
this fit in the product/market growth opportunity matrix shown in
Figure 15.7 (i.e., what strategy is it?  Explain your answer. The
company already has other restaurant chains, so this is not
diversification.  The restaurants will probably be located in the
same markets as other General Mills restaurants, so it is not
market development.  Since the new restaurants can be considered
changes from existing company products (its other restaurants),
the strategy is product development.</i>


<h4>Mini-Case 15.2  Managing Marketing And The Information Revolution</h4>

<p>     Marketing managers can realize many advantages from the
effective use of information technology.  However, the abundance
of information that is readily available can also be
overwhelming.  If you have a marketing manager come to class as a
guest speaker, include this issue among the topics he or she is
asked to address.  How is the information revolution and new
technologies affecting marketing management in his or her
company?  Are the new technologies making workers more productive
or are some of the technologies actually impeding them?

<p>1.  How can the information revolution help marketing management?
<i>The information revolution can help marketing managers if the
information is used effectively in getting people to work more
productively.  Productivity is an issue of great significance, 
and businesses must continually seek new ways of increasing
productivity in order to stay competitive.  Many new technologies
offer the hope of improving information management and therefore,
improving the ability of workers to do their jobs effectively.  </i>

<p>2.  How can the information revolution frustrate marketing
management?  <i>The volume of information that is now available at
people's fingertips can be overwhelming.  Instead of helping
people make better decisions and work more productively, this
information clutter can make it more difficult to sort through
and find usable information.  Therefore, instead of being a help,
it can be a hindrance.</i>

<h3>WHAT DO YOU THINK?</h3>

<p>     How much of a contribution do small businesses make in your
city?  You can research the size and composition of your local
population of small businesses by contacting the chamber of
commerce or a Small Business Development Center.  If any of your
students currently work for a small business, ask them to share
their observations about how small businesses improve their
productivity.  Are they using some of the strategies identified
in this chapter?  Are they working?

<h2><a name="internet">USING THE INTERNET</a></h2>

<p>     Please verify all Internet addresses and confirm the
feasibility of an Internet assignment <b>before</b> you make it.  No
Internet address or information can be guaranteed past the date
of this <b><i>Manual's</b></i> publication.  Be sure to insist that students
demonstrate professional conduct at all times on the Internet. 
If they seek job information, urge them to be cautious in
evaluating information and job offers; be extremely wary of "get
rich quick schemes."  The safest course is to concentrate on
information from universities, well known businesses, government
offices, and established Internet job information providers.

<h3>Internet Assignments</h3>

<p>     Traditional students who aspire to become marketing managers
must take the same first step, they must obtain an entry level
job.  Non-traditional students who wish to change career paths
also must become job seekers.  The Internet can help both types
of job seekers.  The Net is emerging as a rich resource for job
and career information.  You can help your students find their
way through the maze of Internet addresses by checking sites in
advance.  The following suggestions are starting points that can
lead to career and job sites that may prove of value to you and
your class.

<p>     A job hunt can proceed along many different Internet paths.  
    A Yahoo search provides links to many sources of career and
     job information.

<p>   Many large companies have job information at their sites on
     the World Wide Web.  Students can visit these sites to
     determine if the listed employment opportunities are
     appropriate to their interests and level of training.  Use
     the URLs for any companies previously identified, or run a
     search for a specific company through one of the primary
     search engines.

<p>    Two government publications provide information about
     careers and employment trends.  There are many different
     paths to these publications.  The publications to look for

<h4>Japanese Management</h4>

<p>     U.S. marketers must learn about their competition, and in
many product categories, strong competition comes from the
Japanese.  American business also has learned from the Japanese
about quality, team work, and inventory control methods.  You can
learn more about Japan by visiting Yahoo or searching with one of
the search engines.

<h3>MARKETING APPLICATIONS</h3>

<h4>MARKETING APPLICATION 15.1</h4>

<p>     As with any small sample study, students must be cautioned
that because their study involves small numbers, their
observations on the job creation situation locally are tentative
and exploratory, at best.  These data cannot be used to form
generalizations about job creation.  However, that said, their
findings should spark a good discussion about where new jobs are
being formed and the types of skills they require.  Do the
students' results indicate that there is greater job creation in
higher technology companies?  Are computer skills being sought? 
What about the demand for people with good communication skills? 
Local information about job creation often can be obtained from
the city government, chamber of commerce, or state department of
labor.


<h4>MARKETING APPLICATION 15.2</h4>

<p>     A panel of marketers can provide a more lively discussion
than a single speaker.  Discuss with your class the type of
format that would facilitate good coverage of the marketing
management topic.  Each speaker could be allowed several minutes
to make a presentation, or each could be asked to address several
questions about marketing management.  Your students can develop
questions to ask the panel.  Marketers representing different
professional backgrounds will provide a glimpse of the wide
variety of forms of marketing management that occur today. 
However, their presentations will also show that, despite the
differences, they perform the same basic type of job when it
comes to managing marketing, people, and resources.


<h4>MARKETING APPLICATION 15.3</h4>

<p>     Contraseasonal marketing is one tactic to support a market
penetration strategy.  What are some others?  While students are
working to identify other contraseasonal tactics, they can also
think more broadly and consider other tactics that can be used to
penetrate markets.  Market penetration means growth through
stimulating sales in the existing markets.  This includes getting
consumers to stock up.  From their own experiences, what
marketing tactics get them to stock up, i.e., purchase a greater
than normal amount of a product?  What would a fast food
franchise do to grow through market penetration?  What about a
bookstore, a carpet cleaning company, or a florist?  

<h3>CONSUMER INSIGHTS AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETING</h3>


<h4>CONSUMER INSIGHT 15.1</h4>

<p>     To learn more about small businesses nationally, students
can investigate the Using the Internet section in this chapter.


<h4>CONSUMER INSIGHT 15.2</h4>

<p>     Staffing is an important part of marketing management, in
both large and small businesses.  Your school placement or career
office may be able to provide information on differences in
hiring practices between the two extremes, the large corporation
and the small business.  Seek answers to such questions as

<ul>
<li>How do small businesses and large corporations recruit?

<li>Where can you find information about them?

<li>What is the selection process like for an entry level
     employee?  

<li>What type of interview are they likely to use?

<li>Who does the recruiting, interviewing, and selecting?

<li>What kind of training can be expected?
</ul>


<h4>INTERNATIONAL MARKETING REPORT</h4>

<p>     How are other U.S. businesses doing in Japan?  While U.S.
automobile companies are struggling, others are doing quite well. 
For more information on Japan see Using the Internet in this
chapter.</p>

<title>CHAPTER 11: PLACE: DISTRIBUTION AND WHOLESALING</title>
</head>

<h1><center>CHAPTER 11</h1>
<h1>PLACE: DISTRIBUTION AND WHOLESALING</h1>
</center>

<h2>CHAPTER ABSTRACT</h2>

<p><b>1. Explain how distribution facilitates the flow of products from
producer to consumer.  </b>The modern channel of distribution is
composed of individuals and businesses that cooperate to
facilitate the movement of products from producers, at the point-
of-production, to consumers, at the point-of-sale.  Distribution
expedites marketing exchanges.  Many producers engage in dual
distribution, using dual channels to get products to consumers;
some use more channels.  Most product purchases require the use
of intermediaries.  Agents are intermediaries with legal
authority to act in the name of a manufacturer.  Brokers directly
bring sellers and buyers together.  A wholesaler is an
intermediary who sells to other intermediaries, most often to
retailers, the last member of the channel of distribution at the
point-of-sale to personal use consumers.  Both goods and services
must be distributed.  Distribution provides the utilities of
place, time, form, and possession.  Distributors perform such
marketing activities as exchange, physical distribution, and
servicing functions.


<p><b>2. Identify the factors that influence the development of a
channel structure.  </b>Channel structure is the form that a channel
takes, its length, arrangement, and size.  Some channel
structures are characteristic of a particular industry.  Most
channels are a function of company attributes, product type,
markets, competitors, custom, and conditions in the marketing
environment.  Channel structure is also influenced by
distribution strategy, how broadly or narrowly a product is
distributed.  The three principal strategic distribution
alternatives are intensive, selective, and exclusive
distribution.  Channels must be managed in order to run
efficiently and to avoid conflict and encourage cooperation. 
While manufacturers were at one time typically the captains of
their channels, considerable power has shifted to large
retailers.  Some channel members exert control over their
channels by buying other members through a process called
vertical integration.  Others buy out competitors at the same
level, through horizontal integration.  Just-in-time systems are
an attempt to make channels more effective and efficient. 
Reverse channels work to return products to producers for recall,
repair, or for recycling.


<p><b>3. Describe the different perspectives on channels of
distribution.  </b>Channels of distribution are changing due in large
part to the widespread use of sophisticated computer technology,
new information management techniques, and the blurring of
channel member roles.  Like most aspects of marketing, there are
many different perspectives on channels of distribution. 
Consumers sometimes complain about the added costs from
distribution, yet are unwilling to accept stockouts.  Large
retailers view channels as ways for them to achieve cost savings
and increase profitability by forcing members to be more
efficient.  Smaller retailers may believe they are at a cost
disadvantage in a channel because of the domination of large
retailers who exert their power to their own advantage.  
Efficient wholesalers view channels as their source of profit. 
Large manufactures realize that their days of unchallenged
channel power are over, now they must work to cooperate with
other channel members and particularly with powerful retailers.


<p><b>4. Explain the role of wholesalers.  </b>Wholesalers are channel of
distribution members that provide retailers with the products
they need.  They expedite the distribution of manufacturer's
products, and provide other businesses and organizations with
products.  Wholesalers undertake marketing tasks such as
purchasing, sorting, accumulating, storing, transporting, and
financing products.  Wholesaling is an important part of the U.S.
economy.  Wholesalers are typically classified as merchant
wholesalers, brokers and agents, and manufacturer's
representatives.  There are many subclassifications within the
types.  Wholesalers make decisions about products, prices,
promotions, and markets.


<p><b>5. Characterize the logistics/physical distribution functions.
</b>Some people make a distinction between logistics and physical
distribution.  Others consider them two functions within the same
general physical distribution process.  Physical distribution is
the marketing activity that moves raw materials and supplies into
production and finished products from producer to point of sale. 
Transportation is a large part of physical distribution, but it
also includes other activities such as packaging, order
processing, inventory control, and servicing.  Physical
distribution is expensive, so marketers must carefully decide
what level of service they need.  Several factors influence
physical distribution decisions including company resources,
product characteristics, and geography.

<h2><a name="teaching tips">SOME TEACHING TIPS</a></h2>

<p>     The chapter's opening question is, "If distribution is so
important a marketing function, why is it so invisible to most
personal use consumers?"  This is a problem for marketers,
because distribution adds value to the marketing exchange and
benefits consumers, yet most consumers are ignorant of the tasks
that distribution performs for them.  Have students consider the
question and decide whether it is important for marketers to
educate consumers about the role of distribution as it benefits
them personally.  Should consumers be educated about distribution
as it contributes to a smoothly operating business and, at the
level of the national economy, as it facilitates the clearing of
the market by keeping product supply flowing to accommodate
demand?  

<p>     Continue the discussion of the opening question by exploring
whether distribution is equally invisible to business and
organization consumers.  Should it be invisible or should a
business or organization be concerned about distribution and how
efficiently it is performed?  What are the risks if a business or
organization ignores its channels of distribution?  Consider this
question both from the standpoint of products needed at the
point-of-production and at the point-of-sale.

<p>     Because most students will not be familiar with distribution
activities, this is a good place to bring a guest speaker to
class.  Speakers may be found through a local American Marketing
Association chapter, other resources identified in Part V of this
<b><i>Manual</b></i>, or your local newspaper's business section, where the
dates and locations of professional meetings are listed.  You can
use this list to identify a distribution-related professional
organization to contact.  A guest could discuss distribution
generally, explaining how distribution adds value and serves
consumers, marketers, businesses, and the economy.  Alternately,
the discussion could be specific to a distribution topic, several
of which are identified in the following sections.  Suggestions
on planning for a guest speaker are offered in Part V of this
<b><i>Manual</b></i>.

<p><b>     The Distribution Of Flowers</b>

<p>     Channels of distribution for flowers are an interesting and
somewhat unusual topic to explore.  Flowers are big business in
Europe and parts of Asia for their cultural significance, as
gifts, and for aesthetic reasons.  Plant businesses are growing
in importance in the United States, particularly as plants are
used to enhance property value.  Many business opportunities
exist for marketers of cut flowers and houseplants, and in
related fields such as property landscaping.  Efficient
distribution of floral materials is critical because of their
perishability.  Students can research this topic on the Internet
(see <a href="#internet">Using the Internet</a> in this chapter).  A discussion of
channels of distribution for flowers also provides an opportunity
to introduce the broader topic of agricultural marketing, which
often is ignored in traditional marketing classes.

<p><b>     Real Estate Brokers</b>

<p>     Some of your students may be real estate brokers; others may
have family or friends who work in this field.  Brokers work as
mediators, bringing buyers and sellers together and helping them
negotiate a mutually satisfying exchange.  They perform highly
specialized functions and are usually paid primarily by
commission.

<p>     Real estate, like other products, is being offered on the
Internet (see <a href="#internet">Using the Internet</a> in this chapter).  Students can
investigate Internet real estate sites even without a graphical
browser, although the experience is much richer if they can view
the properties being offered using Mosaic or NetScape.  Can the
Internet replace real estate brokers?  This topic can be explored
by a guest speaker.  Ask this professional to discuss recent
innovations in the marketing of real estate, including cable real
estate television programs that show viewers homes that are for
sale, and marketing real estate on the Internet.  

<p><b>     Entertainment Distribution</b>

<p>     Another topic that usually interests students is the
distribution of entertainment products, such as music and motion
pictures.  The film industry has its own unique distribution
system, which has been featured recently in popular business
magazines.  Students can research the topic and report their
results to the class.  Faculty in a film or drama department at
your school may be able to provide a contact in the film
industry.  Alternately, try your local American Marketing
Association chapter or Chamber of Commerce for suggestions.  If
there is an independent movie theater in your city, the owner
might be able to share some insights on the difficulty of booking
films in competition with major theater chains.

<p><b>     Automobile Distribution</b>

<p>     In almost every introductory marketing class, there seems to
be at least one student who currently works for an automobile
dealer or has worked for one in the past.  This is another
channel of distribution system that interests students, often
because of the job opportunities it offers and because most of
them have experience at the automobile point-of-sale.  How does
the American automobile distribution system work?  Who dominates
an automobile channel of distribution?  For insights on
automobile distribution, contact a prominent auto dealer in your
area who can provide insights into how the automobile
distribution system is under pressure to change.

<p>     If you have international students in your class, ask them
to share their observations about automobile distribution in
their countries.  In many countries, automobile distribution is
quite different from distribution in the United States.  For
example, in Japan, automobiles are sold door-to-door, a very low
tech type of distribution in a very high tech society.  About
half of all automobiles are sold this way, often to the housewife
who traditionally makes most of the family's financial decisions
(Reitman 1994).  Japan is the world's second largest market for
automobiles, yet the United States has less than one percent of
the market.  Although Japan is about the size of California,
Toyota Motor Corp. by itself fields 100,000 salespeople, many of
whom walk door-to-door selling cars.  This example also
illustrates the importance of relationship marketing.  Japanese
automobile salesmen excel at building trust and long term
relationships with their customers, something American car makers
will find almost impossible to counter in the Japanese market.

<p><b>     Reference</b>
<p>     Reitman, Valerie (1994), "Toyota Calling: In Japan's Car
     Market, Big Three Face Rivals Who Go Door-To-Door, <i>The Wall
     Street Journal</i> (September 28): A1,6.
     

<p><b>     Franchise Distribution</b>

<p>     Many small businesspeople own franchises, such as a
McDonald's, KFC, or Dairy Queen.  Some franchise owners complain
about being captives of their franchisor's distribution system. 
Many are bound to the tight restrictions of a contracted system
where they must make product purchases from the owner of the
system.  While many franchise owners are happy with their
distribution system, others are not.  Students may be able to
share observations based on their experiences working in a
franchise.  If not, you might consider this as a topic for a
guest speaker to address. 

<p><b>The Internet And Distribution</b>

<p>     The Internet offers a serious potential challenge to
traditional distribution systems.  It takes very little effort
for a producer to set up a home page on the World Wide Web and
sell products, often delivering them by Federal Express (FedX) or
United Parcel Service (UPS).  Store retailers and wholesalers can
be eliminated in the process.  Production can be on-demand as
customer orders are received, which reduces inventory, storage,
and holding costs.  

<p>     If you have been assigning Internet activities throughout
the term, students should have developed a fairly sophisticated
perspective about Internet commerce.  The threat of the Internet
to traditional channels can be developed as a topic for class
debate.  One side can prepare the position that the Internet will
not alter traditional channel structures; the other side can
argue the opposite.  Two key questions should be addressed: 
(1) How do consumers benefit from Internet distribution?
(2) How do businesses benefit from Internet distribution?

<p><b>Adding Value Through Distribution</b>

<p>     A business that has a competitive advantage is able to
deliver better value to consumers than the competition.  Most
businesses seek to establish a competitive advantage because that
means that consumers value its products and will purchase and
repurchase them.  Through these purchases (exchanges) the
business collects revenues and, assuming that it is run
efficiently, earns profits at greater than the industry average. 
It is essential for the marketer to determine what consumers
value, in product performance and price, then deliver it at the
lowest possible cost.  Only when the competitive advantage is
sustained over time can it be defined as a strategic competitive
advantage.

<p>     A value delivery system can be conceptualized as having
three component processes: choosing the value, providing the
value, and communicating the value (Czepiel 1992).  To choose the
value means selecting the value that benefits consumers and the
businesses' own competencies.  To provide the value means
focusing every subsequent activity throughout the business on
delivering that value.  Finally, to communicate the value means
informing consumers about the value through effective promotional
activities.  The value chain is all of the processes required to
deliver value, from determining what consumers value, to product
design and production, through distribution and promotion.

<p>     Value is added when raw materials and supplies are brought
into production and transformed into finished products.  The
processing of materials and supplies adds value, but it also adds 
costs.  Value is added as different product forms, sizes, colors,
or models are produced.  The variations are designed to satisfy
different consumer segments.  Product differentiation adds value
for the consumers who will benefit from them; it lessens their
value for consumers who will not benefit from them.  Generally,
greater differentiation also means greater costs.

<p>     Value is added when products are made available for
consumers when and where they need them.  Like product
differentiation, distribution differentiation also adds costs. 
Channel value is the value added by the physical transportation
of products to various points in the delivery system; by 
accumulating, sorting, and assorting products so that the
appropriate selection of products is routed to other middlemen;
through taking and filling orders, financing, inventory control,
storage, and the assumption of risk.  The retailer contributes to
channel value by making good location decisions, providing a
trained staff, offering credit, stocking and restocking, pricing,
and performing the marketing functions needed in order to bring
the right products to the point-of-sale.
    
<p>     Distribution adds value from point-of-production to point-of-sale.  It also adds costs, which explains why distribution can
become a key factor in determining strategic competitive
advantage.  The channel that operates at the greatest efficiency
and lowest cost often creates a competitive advantage that others
will have great difficulty matching, as shown by Wal-Mart. 

<p>     Consumers have grown accustomed to broad product assortments
and well stocked shelves, yet for the most part they remain
unaware of what it takes to deliver place utility.  Students
should learn about value chains both as future business people
and as consumers.  This can be personalized by asking them to
identify value driven retailers.  For example, supermarkets that
recognize how much some consumer segments value fresh produce and
salad bars.  Many supermarket chains are allocating more space to
value added salads and fruits in an attempt to satisfy consumers
and raise revenues (De Santa 1995).  

<p>     What do your students value as consumers?

<ul>
<li>How do they feel about the value of double pizzas for the
     price of one?

<li>Do they agree with a recent survey of almost 3,000
     restaurant consumers that the chains delivering the best
     value are Wendy's (hamburgers), Pizza Hut (pizza), Chi-Chi's
     (Mexican food), and Baskin-Robbins (sweets)? (McDowell 1995) 
     
<li>What do they perceive as the value of a 10-minute oil
     change?  

<li>What is the value added at a laundry that washes, dries, and
     folds your clothes?  

<li>What about the value added at a supermarket that has baggers
     who carry your groceries to your car?

<li>How much do they value a car dealer who provides free rides
     to work for customers bringing in their cars for service?

<li>Do they value a car rental business that will deliver your
     rental car to your home or office?
</ul>

<p>     Stress the point that in each case, while some consumers
will value the product (good or service), others will not!  How
do members of the channel of distribution accommodate different
value perceptions?

II.  Identify the factors that influence the development of a
     channel structure
<ol>
<li>Channel structure refers to the form a channel takes,
          its length, arrangement, size, and ownership
<li>A channel's structure is a function of different
          factors, including
<ul>
<li>Company attributes
<li>Product type
<li>Markets
<li>Competitors    
<li>Custom
<li>The marketing environment
</ul>
<li>Distribution strategy (intensive, selective, or
          exclusive) also influences channel structure
<ul>
<li>Intensive distribution, where products are made
               available in as many different places as possible      
<li>Selective distribution, where a limited number of
               distribution points are used
<li>Exclusive distribution, which restricts
               distribution to a few exclusive places
</ul>
<li>Channel management is not always easy, and sometimes
          channel members disagree and dissolve the channel
<ul>
<li>Channel power is often vested in a captain, a
               powerful member who sets channel policy and often
               dictates terms
<li>Businesses often buy up other channel members and
               become vertically integrated in order to exert
               greater control 
<li>When a channel member purchases others at the same
               level, often competitors, it is horizontal
               integration
<ol>
<li>Just-In-Time systems are a process for
                    cutting delivery times, reducing inventory
                    time, and reducing distribution costs
<li>Reverse channels are the backward
                    distribution of products to the producer or
                    to another business for reprocessing, recall,
                    or repair
</ol>
</ul>
</ol>

III. Describe the different perspectives on channels of
     distribution
<ol>
<li>Channels of distributing are changing, pushed by
          computer technology, automation, demands for
          efficiency, and changing roles in distribution
<li>There are many different perspectives on channels of
          distribution, and sometimes they conflict
<ul>
<li>Consumers may not appreciate channels, yet they
               complain when channels don't work right
<li>Retailers vary in their views of channels, with
               the larger ones viewing channels as a way to wring 
               out cost savings by removing inefficiency and
               waste; smaller retailers may experience cost
               disadvantages because they cannot exert control
               over channel members
<li>Efficient wholesalers can profit handsomely by
               being efficient and advancing with the technology
<li>Some manufacturers, who once controlled channels
               of distribution, now work more closely with
               powerful retailers to produce products that
               retailers want to stock
<li>Government wants channels to run efficiently,
               competitively, and fairly
</ul>
</ol>

IV.  Explain the role of wholesalers
<ol>
<li>A wholesaler is an intermediary that provides retailers
          with products, only rarely selling to the public; they
          transport, redirect, and often transfer title
<li>Wholesalers perform many tasks that benefit
          manufacturers and retailers, these include
<ul>
<li>Purchasing
<li>Sorting
<li>Accumulating
<li>Storing
<li>Transporting
<li>Financing
</ul>
<li>Wholesaling contributes to the U.S. economy by
          providing over 6 million jobs and an annual payroll of
          over $183 billion
<li>Wholesalers are categorized by their job
          characteristics, most are small, family businesses
<ul>
<li>Merchant wholesalers are independent
               businesspeople who take title to the merchandise
               they handle and assume the risks of ownership
<li>Brokers and agents do not take title to the
               merchandise they handle although sometimes they
               may take possession; mainly they facilitate the
               exchange between buyers and sellers
<li>Manufacturer's representatives are employed by one
               or several producers to represent their products
               and distribute them to retailers
</ul>
<li>Wholesalers make decisions about products, prices,
          promotions, and markets
</ol>

V.   Characterize the logistics/physical distribution functions
<ol>
<li>Logistics and physical distribution are often used
          interchangeably to identify the distribution of raw
          materials and supplies into production and the
          distribution of completed products from producer to
          point of sale and includes such tasks as
<ul>
<li>Packing
<li>Order processing
<li>Inventory control
<li>Transportation
<li>Service
</ul>
<li>Physical distribution can be very expensive and the
          extent of the need for physical distribution depends on
          the nature of a business
<li>Physical distribution decisions are influenced by such
          factors as company attributes and resources, product
          characteristics, and geography
</ol>
     
<h2><a name="questions">SUGGESTED ANSWERS TO CHAPTER QUESTIONS</a></h2>

<h3>DISCUSSION QUESTIONS</h3>

<p>1.  What is the role of distribution in marketing?  <i>Distribution
is an essential marketing activity, responsible for getting
products from production to the point of sale.</i>

<p>2.  Why are intermediaries also called middlemen?  <i>If you think
of a chain reaching from the producer to the point of sale,
intermediaries are in the middle of the chain, which explains the
name middlemen.</i>

<p>3.  Are retailers members of the channel of distribution?  <i>Yes,
they are the final member of the channel at the point of sale,
where the exchange is made with the consumer.</i>

<p>4.  Discuss the utilities provided by distribution.  <i>Distribution
provides 
<ul>
<li>place utility - making products available where they are
     wanted
<li>time utility - making products available when they are
     wanted
<li>form utility - making products available in the quantities,
     colors, sizes, and shapes wanted
<li>possession utility - providing mechanisms by which others
     can take possession of the products
</ul>
</i>

<p>5.  How may the marketing environment affect channel structure? 
<i>Channel structure is the form that a channel takes, its length,
arrangement, size, and legal characteristics.  Marketers facing
stable marketing environments often have relatively stable
channel structures; marketers facing volatile, rapidly changing
environments often have channels that can and often must change
rapidly in order to maintain their profitability.</i>

<p>6.  Explain how intensive, selective, and exclusive distribution
influence the number of middlemen needed in a channel.  <i>Broad
distribution in an intensive distribution strategy typically
involves far more middlemen than exclusive distribution, which
distributes products to a very few places.  Selective
distribution is between the two extremes.</i>

<p>7.  What is JIT?  <i>Just-in-time (JIT) is a system that tracks
inventory and directs supplies and materials to receivers just as
they are needed.  This reduces holding costs and delays by
reducing the handling of products and the time spent in
inventory.  It has been adopted by diverse industries including
automobiles, groceries, and mass merchandisers.</i>

<p>8.  How does wholesaling serve retailing?  <i>How does it serve
producers?  Wholesaling serves retailing by getting the right
products to retailers when and where they are needed. 
Wholesaling serves producers by moving their finished products
through the channel to the point-of-sale, where sales generate
revenue and profit.</i>

<p>9.  Describe the various perspectives on distribution.
<i>Perspectives on distribution vary.  Consumers sometimes complain
that distribution adds costs to the products they purchase, but
they are not willing to forgo distribution and experience
stockouts.  Large retailers see channels as ways to reduce costs
by demanding efficiency, while smaller retailers may believe they
are experiencing cost disadvantages because they cannot exert
power over their channels.  Efficient wholesalers see channels as
their source of healthy profits.  Large manufacturers have seen
their power over channels diminish as retailers have exerted
control.  From the government's perspective, channels must be
efficient, competitive, and fair in order to maintain the healthy
operation of the free market.</i>

<p>10. What are the tasks of wholesaling?  What are the tasks of
physical distribution?   <i>Wholesalers offer many important
services to retailers and manufacturers.  They purchase, store,
accumulate, sort, transport, and finance products.  Physical
distribution includes the marketing activities that transport
products (supplies and raw materials) to the point of production
and bring finished products from the producer to the point of
sale.</i>

<h3>CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING</h3>

<h4>Check Your Understanding 11.1 </h4>

<p>1.  What is a marketing intermediary?  <i>A marketing intermediary
is a member of a channel of distribution that is responsible for
getting products from the point-of-production to the point-of-sale.</i>

<p>2.  Identify the utilities provided by distribution. 
<i>Distribution adds value to products through such utilities as
place, time, form, and possession utility.</i>
 
<p>3.  Describe the marketing functions associated with
distribution.  <i>Marketing functions associated with distribution
are exchange, physical distribution, and servicing.  Exchange
includes purchasing products, collecting an inventory, making
selections from that inventory, communicating information about
the products, and facilitating exchanges for the products.  The
physical distribution functions include transporting products,
storage, carrying inventory for various periods of time, sorting,
and delivering products.  Finally, servicing involves promoting
products, performing research about markets, and providing
financial services to other channel members.</i>


<h4>Check Your Understanding 11.2 </h4>

<p>Identify some of the factors that influence channel structure.
<i>Channel structure refers to the form a a channel takes, including
its length, arrangement, and size.  The structure of a channel
may be a function of the industry and types of products it
serves.  For example, automobile distribution is fairly standard
throughout the industry.  Most channels are designed to respond
to company attributes, product type, markets served, competitors,
custom, and conditions in the marketing environment.  Because
channel structure can change, there are not hard and fast rules
about the "best" form for a channel to take.</i>


<h4>Check Your Understanding 11.3 </h4>

<p>1.  Compare and contrast the three distribution coverage
alternatives: intensive, selective, and exclusive distribution. 
<i>Intensive distribution requires placing products everywhere
possible; at the other extreme, exclusive distribution restricts
the number and characteristics of places where products are
distributed.  Somewhere between the two is selective
distribution, which is more limiting than intensive yet makes
products more available than exclusive distribution.</i>

<p>2.  Are all channels managed smoothly?  Explain your answer. 
<i>Absolutely not!  Many articles have been written about the fights
occurring between members in a feuding channel.  Often the fights
are about power and control.  The channel member that controls
the other members exerts a level of power than can sometimes lead
to considerable dissension.  Channels are like marriages, some go
on happily of years, others undertake messy divorces.</i>
            
<p>3.  Discuss the use of reverse channels of distribution.  
<i>Reverse channels of distribution reverse the flow of products
back to the producer.  Sometimes this occurs because of a product
recall or need for repair.  Increasingly it is a result of
efforts to reuse materials and recycle worn products. </i>


<h4>Check Your Understanding 11.4</h4>

<p>1.  What is the role of wholesaling in product distribution? 
<i>Wholesalers provide retailers with products, expedite the
distribution of producers' products, and provide products for
other businesses and organizations.</i>

<p>2.  Describe the different wholesale tasks.  <i>Wholesalers
purchase, sort, accumulate, store, transport, and finance
products for the businesses and organizations they serve.</i>

<p>3.  Identify the different types of wholesalers. <i>There are three
broad categories of wholesalers: merchant wholesalers are
independent businesspeople, often small businesses, that usually
take title to the merchandise they handle and assume risks of
ownership.  There are general merchant wholesalers and specialty
wholesalers; some offer a full-line of services and others offer
limited services.  Brokers and agents do not take title, though
they may take possession of products.  They are facilitators,
representing the products and often matching sellers and buyers. 
Manufacturer's representatives are employed by one or more
producers to represent their products and facilitate their sale.</i>


<h4>Check Your Understanding 11.5</h4>

<p>1.  Describe the types of decisions wholesalers make. 
<i>Wholesalers make many different kinds of decisions.  In general,
their decisions focus on such topics as what products to carry,
what prices to charge (within industry standards), how to sell
the products (personal selling), and what markets to serve.</i>
 
<p>2.  What is the role of physical distribution?   <i>Physical
distribution, which includes logistics, is the overall process of
transporting products from producer to point-of-sale.  Most
broadly, the process also includes bringing products to the
point-of-production, as well as from production to point-of-sale.</i>

<p>3.  Discuss the different tasks of physical distribution. 
<i>Physical distribution activities include packaging goods for
shipment, processing orders, controlling inventory,
transportation, and servicing.</i>


<h3>MINI-CASES</h3>
                                
<h4>Mini-Case 11.1: A Tasty Case Of Worldwide Distribution            </h4>
    
<p>    Are your students familiar with some of the foods of CPC
International Inc.?  If you have international students in class,
ask whether they have noticed any differences between CPC foods
distributed in the United States and in their home countries. 
Often students can identify obvious differences in packaging,
sometimes in names, and less frequently in taste.  Distribution
of food products obviously can be more difficult than
distributing consumer durables.  Ask students to consider the
challenge of distributing nondurable and perishable products
internationally, as well as the potential for escalating costs
and risks.  Some students may have experience working in 
distribution and if they do, perhaps they can share their
observations with the class.  Because the activities of channel
of distribution members are relatively hidden from consumers,
this is a good topic for a class speaker.  To arrange for a
speaker, contact a local American Marketing Association Chapter
or one of the national associations of professionals in
wholesaling, manufacturers' agents, manufacturers'
representatives, or wholesalers-distributors (see Part IV of this
<b><i>Manual</i></b> for contacts).

<p>1.  What advantage is there for CPC in using the distribution
channels of brands it acquires in other countries?  <i>Obviously the
greatest advantage to CPC is in acquiring effective, efficient
channels that are successful and well established.  Through these
established channels, CPC can begin to distributed its other
brands.  CPC avoids having to go into established markets and
form new channel partnerships in order to introduce its products.</i>

<p>2.  Why should food products in particular require adaptation to
local tastes?  <i>Food is an integral element in culture and is
often a principal way that culture is perpetuated.  Therefore,
food product marketers must be cautious in introducing new food
products to a market because of the strength of cultural
associations.  </i>

<p>3.  Could this strategy of worldwide marketing synergy in
distribution be used by other businesses?  <i>What types of products
might lend themselves to this strategy?  This is a strategy that
lends itself to related products, in CPC's case, food products. 
By staying within the range of the company's competencies, it
uses its strengths to establish a presence in new markets.  If a
company dramatically changes direction, perhaps acquiring a food
line and its distribution system but intending to introduce
automotive parts, it would find the food distribution system
incompatible with its plans.</i>


<h4>Mini-Case 11.2  Ito-Yokado, Lojas Americana SA, And Wal-Mart </h4>

<p>     Can Wal-Mart work its magic as successfully internationally
as it has domestically?  Many marketers believe that a reason for
Wal-Mart's great success is its state-of-the-art distribution
system.  If any students have worked for Wal-Mart, perhaps they
can comment on this.  Many articles have appeared recently in
popular business journals about the problems Wal-Mart is
experiencing in Mexico.  Students can research this topic, read
the articles, then write a brief analysis (in memo form) of Wal-Mart's potential for short- and long-range success in Mexico and
other markets.  Another direction for this discussion to take is
to research the Japanese market and the complaints against closed
Japanese distribution systems for automobiles and film.  Will
Wal-Mart experience the same kinds of problems or will it avoid
them by joint venturing with Ito-Yokado?

<p>1.  Wal-Mart is the first American retailer to open stores in
Argentina and Brazil.  It is also moving aggressively into Japan
and Asia.  What are the risks of extending its distribution
system beyond North American?  <i>Wal-Mart has an extremely
efficient, sophisticated distribution system in the United
States.  It runs the risk of stretching the system too far and
encountering serious problems in meeting its commitments
internationally.  </i>

<p>2.  How is Wal-Mart countering this risk?  <i>Wal-Mart is countering
this risk by taking on joint venture partners who are already
successful in their home countries.  These partners will share
Wal-Mart's profits, but also its risks.  They should ease the way
for Wal-Mart to become successful.</i>

<p>3.  Do you think Wal-Mart is on the way to becoming as widely
distributed as Coca-Cola, McDonald's, and KFC?  Explain your
answer.  <i>Coca-Cola, McDonald's, and KFC offer far fewer products
than Wal-Mart.  They are intensively distributed while Wal-Mart
has been much more selective in its distribution strategy. 
However, while Wal-Mart will never be as intensively distributed
as the others, barring unforeseen problems, it will doubtless be
highly successful because it is an extremely well run company.</i>
                                
                                
<h3>WHAT DO YOU THINK?</h3>

<p>     CompDesign is a small business with big potential.  Are
there other small businesses that began as retailers and expanded
into wholesale?  Wholesaling lends itself to small businesses. 
Draw on student experiences for observations about small or mid-size businesses that have expanded from retail into wholesale, or
vice versa.  Alternately, invite a speaker from a local small
business, the Small Business Administration, or the American
Marketing Association to discuss the importance of small
businesses to channels of distribution.

<h2><a name="internet">USING THE INTERNET</a></h2>

     Please verify all Internet addresses and confirm the
feasibility of an Internet assignment <b>before</b> you make it.  No
Internet address or information can be guaranteed past the date
of this <b><i>Manual's</b></i> publication.  Be sure to insist that students
demonstrate professional conduct at all times on the Internet.   

<h3>Internet Assignments</h3>

<p>     This chapter begins with an opening story about roses.  Lots
of flowers are being offered on the Internet, on home pages and
in malls.  Flower retailers on the Internet can be tracked using
a search tool such as Yahoo, WebCrawler, or jughead.  This is a
product search that definitely benefits from a graphical browser. 
Students should consider how effectively flowers can be
distributed on the Internet while the majority of consumers still
use a text-only browser.  

     In searching the Internet for flowers, I recommend that you
look for a flower case about the Dutch flower auction, The World
Wide Flowers Project.  This is an extremely interesting
multimedia case that is accessible by the World Wide Web.  It
appears to be one of the first efforts to present a multimedia,
interactive case worldwide on the Internet for Netizens (Net
citizens) to access.  The case provides valuable insights into
how flower auctions work as part of the distribution process,
adding value to the product by ensuring that a wide, fresh
assortment is available to consumers worldwide.  The whole case
will be sent on request by contacting the e-mail address in the
document.  The case is listed in a WebCrawler search query
flowers or by searching for the case name.

<h4>Dual Distribution On The Internet</h4>
 
<p>     Some of your students are probably familiar with Sear's
craftsman tools, a very popular and highly regarded brand.  These
tools are sold in stores and on the Internet at the Cybermall. 
If some of your students are knowledgeable about tools, ask them
to share their observations about the relative advantages of
store and Internet tool distribution.  Will dual distribution
using the Internet affect store distribution?

<h4>Real Estate Brokers On The Internet</h4>

<p>     A search for real estate on the Internet using Yahoo
uncovers 24 pages of listings.  A WebCrawler search provides
several hundred documents.  The Global Network Navigator (The
Whole Internet Catalog) has an extensive list of real estate
brokers.  Students can determine the types of real estate brokers
using the Internet and their product assortment, but without a
graphical browser, they will be limited in their ability to
evaluate the value of these sites to potential customers.  Most
of the searches will uncover real estate brokers internationally,
nationally, and locally.  Mortgage brokers and other real estate-related businesses usually are included with a real estate
search.  How can consumers use the real estate sites?  What value
do they add to the consumer's search?

<h4>Personal Computers Distributed On The Internet</h4>

<p>     As you might expect, the Internet is a very appropriate
place for the distribution of personal computers.  Consumers can
compare prices and product descriptions directly from
manufacturers or through wholesalers or retailers.  Perhaps this
product category more than any other shows the value of the
Internet for members of the distribution channel as well as
consumers.  Two-person student teams or small groups can evaluate
how effectively various producers and retailers are using the
Internet to communicate with consumers, promote their products,
and facilitate exchange.  Any of the search tools can be used
along with home pages for such major computer producers as IBM,
Dell, Gateway, Hewlett Packard, Packard Bell, Compaq, and Apple.

<h4>Other Channel Members</h4>

<p>     Students can research other channel members on the Internet. 
This includes performing searches for wholesalers, shipping
companies, truckers, and warehousers.

<h4>Automobiles On The Internet</h4>

<p>     This is a product category that often surprises people by
the extent of Internet listings.  From family sedans to exotic
cars and antiques, a search of automobiles will return a large
number of links to both new and used car dealers.  Look for
DealerNet, an extensive site for new car purchases.


<h4>The Economic Impact Of Wholesaling</h4>

<p>     Students can visit the United States Bureau of the Census to
analyze the economic impact of wholesaling.  They will find data
on the numbers of firms, their employment, and annual payrolls. 
These data are for the wholesale trade, retail trade, real estate
firms, and transportation.

<h3>MARKETING APPLICATIONS</h3>


<h4>MARKETING APPLICATION 11.1</h4>

<p>     Conflict between channel members is quite common.  Some of
your students may have observed channel conflict while employed
by a retailer, wholesaler, or other channel member.  If so, ask
if they can share their observations with the class.  If some of
your students have worked or are working for a computer retailer,
ask how that retailer counters the problem of producers selling
their product directly, through catalogs, and large discounters. 
The problem identified in this <b>Application</b> lends itself to
discussion by small groups of students, brainstorming to develop
ways to resolve the conflict.


<h4>MARKETING APPLICATION 11.2</h4>

<p>     Education distribution is a topic that often provokes
polarized opinions.  Some favor a public distribution systems,
others prefer private distribution.  Regardless of who does the
distributing, is there a difference between the two other than in
the context of what is being taught?


<h4>MARKETING APPLICATION 11.3</h4>

<p>     Four products are identified for students to consider in
developing a channel of distribution.  This problem can be set up
as a decision tree, with alternative branches for distributing
the products.  For example, in the case of custom made jewelry,
it can be distributed exclusively in a highly restricted number
of retailers, by catalog, or on the Internet.  Alternately, it
can be distributed selectively, perhaps in up-scale department
stores and better jewelry stores.  Finally, it can be distributed
intensively.  Ask students to explain why this would not be an
alternative used for high quality, expensive jewelry.


<h4>MARKETING APPLICATION 11.4 </h4>

<p>     Instead of having students contact local retailers to
determine what wholesalers do for them, you can identify a
retailer to invite as a guest speaker.  The topic can be related
to a general discussion of how the retailer gets products through
various types of wholesalers.  Several suggestions for guest
speakers are made in the <a href="#teaching tips>Teaching Tips</a> section of this <b><i>Manual</i></b>.

<h3>CONSUMER INSIGHTS AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETING</h3>


<h4>CONSUMER INSIGHT 11.1</h4>

<p>     Vending machines are an important mechanism for distributing
products.  What products are distributed in vending machines? 
The list often surprises students, because vending machines
provide distribution for products ranging from alcohol to
umbrellas.  In other countries, including Japan, vending machines
are used even more widely than they are in the United States.
There are vending machines that dispense frozen steaks, beer and
hard liquors, and clothing.  Are there products that students
would like to have distributed in vending machines?


<h4>CONSUMER INSIGHT 11.2</h4>

<p>     Home delivery is very important to Japanese consumers and it
is growing in popularity in the United States.  Takuhaibin is
widely used by personal use and business/organization consumers
alike.  Ask your students if there are equivalents in the United
States?  Think of the types of home delivery they value,
particularly of pizza.  What else is home delivered?  How does
the Internet fit into this picture?  Could it accelerate the
movement toward greater use of home delivery?  Is there a product
opportunity here for small businesses to determine what types of
home delivery consumers value (that are not currently being
offered or not offered well), then fill that gap?


<h4>INTERNATIONAL MARKETING REPORT</h4>

<p>     Distribution in Russia is a challenge far greater than in
most other industrialized countries.  This <b>International
Marketing Report</b> (page 348 of the text) illustrates how difficult
it is to get automobiles delivered to car dealerships in Moscow
and other large Russian cities.  Compare the cost of distribution
automobiles in Russia with the cost in the United States. 
Although distribution costs are far less in the U.S., many new
car buyers complain about destination charges listed on the
invoice.  If you invite a guest speaker to class from the
automobile industry, ask about distribution costs and their
impact of the final price of a new car.  Will the Internet change
the distribution of automobiles?  Can it reduce distribution
costs?</p>

<h1><center>CHAPTER 14</h1>
<h1>EXTENDING MARKETING: MARKETING SERVICES AND NOT-FOR-PROFIT MARKETING</h1>
</center>

<h2>CHAPTER ABSTRACT</h2>

<p><b>1. Explain the differences and similarities between goods and
services.  </b>Goods and services are both products.  They are both
marketed to personal use and business/organization consumers. 
Marketing decisions for goods and services are about product,
price, place, and promotion.  A service is an intangible,
perishable product of variable quality whose production and
consumption are inseparable.  Services are offered by businesses,
governments, and not-for-profit organizations.  Products often
are made more tangible through promotion and other marketing
tools in order to provide a visible anchor for consumers to
perceive and use in making product evaluations.  Because a
service is perishable, it is particularly susceptible to demand
fluctuations.  As a result, efforts are made to even out demand
through practices such as peak period pricing, temporary
employees, and automation.  Service production is inseparable
from its performance, so considerable attention must be paid to
the service provider, who represents the business to consumers. 
This includes careful selection, training, and management. 
Because services are affected by many factors related to its
delivery, there is variability in service quality.  Service
quality lies in the consumer's evaluation of the performance. 
Services are classified by product attributes, consumer targets,
provider training, delivery system, and contact closeness.  There
has been a shift to services.  Services dominate the national
economy for a variety of reasons including the number of women
entering the full-time out-of-home workforce, dual income
families with the income to pay and the need for services, the
aging of the population, loss of manufacturing jobs, and the
stresses and time constraints of contemporary life.  Service
providers should be trained to deliver good performance in order
to establish relationships with consumers.  This means ensuring
that service providers have the capacity to perform, the
willingness to perform, and the opportunity to perform.  Service
businesses often undertake internal marketing programs directed
at employees in order to emphasize the importance of their role
as service providers.  In close contact services, the service
consumer both contributes to and evaluates the quality of the
service provided.


<p><b>2. Describe the Four Ps in services and the service advantage.   </b>
A service is a product whose characteristics must be determined
before it can be offered to consumers.  Product decisions
frequently include a service and its associated goods.  Pricing a
service calls for a careful analysis of what is being priced and
its value to consumers.  An equipment-based service can be priced
like a tangible good.  Pricing a people-based service often
requires considering service image, service provider reputation
or credentials, and the price charged by a market leader and the
competition.  Place is important in services because many retail
services are store based, which requires location decisions. 
Channels of distribution exist for financial and other services. 
Service promotion often involves personal selling and advertising
designed to make the product tangible and establish a positive
brand image.  Services marketing requires the formulation of
strategy and the development of tactics to achieve the goals set
for service products by the business.  A service advantage is
often enjoyed by businesses who use service as the key factor in
differentiating their product offers from the competition.


<p><b>3. Recognize the characteristics of not-for-profit marketing. </b>
The not-for-profit designation indicates that earning a profit is
not a primary organizational goal.  However, when it comes to
marketing, there are great similarities between the two.  For
many years not-for-profits wanted little to do with marketing
because they believed that marketing didn't fit their
organizational image.  However, now that competition has
increased and funding is scarce, many not-for-profits are using
sophisticated marketing activities to raise funds and gain
support for their programs.  Marketing in the not-for-profit
sector involves public and private organizations as diverse as
governments, charities, hospitals, politicians, unions, religious
groups, zoos, social causes and activist groups.


<p><b>4. Discuss some other for-profit extensions of marketing.  </b>Many
contemporary marketing applications make sophisticated use of
marketing tools.  Health care marketing is growing in importance
as for-profit and not-for-profit hospitals and clinics, as well
as physicians and other medical professionals, compete for
clients and revenues.  Health care organizations use marketing
techniques to measure customer satisfaction and develop programs
designed to satisfy consumers.  Many people are their own
product.  Marketing is used to market professional athletes,
artists, entertainers, medical professionals, lawyers, and
others.  Entertainment marketing is used by symphony orchestras,
authors, movies, music companies, and leisure activities.  Place
marketing attracts tourists and economic development.  Some of
the events being marketed are sports extravaganzas (Super Bowl,
World Cup), holiday celebrations, trade shows, and conventions. 
Educational institutions market themselves to students, parents,
alumni, faculty, and potential donors.  The information age has
ushered in the marketing of many different kinds of information
services.  


<p><b>5. Characterize the marketing concept in services and not-for-profits.  </b>The marketing concept is an operating philosophy that
has customer satisfaction at its core.  It requires the
integration of all organizational operations in a business to
focus on consumer satisfaction.  The marketing concept is being
applied successfully in both the service and not-for-profit
sectors.  However, there is always room for improvement.  When it
comes to the societal marketing concept, not-for-profits practice
what many for-profits are still debating.

<h2><a name="teaching tips">SOME TEACHING TIPS</a></h2>

<p>     Ask your students to comment on the chapter opening
question, Is there anything that cannot be marketed?  Marketing
is defined by the American Marketing Association as the process
of planning and executing the conception, pricing, promotion and
distribution of ideas, goods and services to create exchanges
that satisfy individual and organizational objectives (see
definition of marketing in chapter 1).  This definition is
extremely broad and includes businesses as well as governments
and organizations.  Given the breadth of the definition, few
activities are excluded from being appropriate for marketing.  At
the same time, some things should not be marketed and some not-for-profits choose not to market.  

<p><b>Services Intangibility     </b>
 
<p>     In order to illustrate how advertising is used to
tangibilize services, collect print advertisements for various
services, such as insurance (Traveler's, Met Life, Prudential),
credit cards (Visa, Master Card, American Express), banks and
other financial services (Charles Schwab, Quick and Reilly). 
Bring these advertisements to class and use them to illustrate
how marketers seek to establish a visual and perceptual anchor
for consumers to use in defining their services.  Are some more
successful at tangibilizing services than others?  Bring print
advertisements to class that show the smiling faces of the
employees who deliver service.  Are these people representative
of the ones who actually will be delivering the service?  What is
the purpose of showing people in these advertisements?  Is it
tangibilizing and personalizing at the same time?

<p><b>Coping With Demand Variability</b>

<p>     Ask if any of your students have ever worked as a temporary
employee.  If they worked in customer service, did they receive
training in how to work successfully with customers?  If so, was
it helpful, or did they "learn on the job?"  While hiring temps
has been traditional in seasonal businesses, such as amusement
parks and swimming pools, and in fast food restaurants that
experience demand peaks in the summer, the number of temporary
employees working full-time, year round has increased
significantly in the past decade.  Downsizing and restructuring
are blamed for much of this movement from full-time permanent to
full-time temporary status.  What effect can this have on service
businesses whose survival depends on their ability to deliver
good customer service?  Does it make it easier or harder to
ensure that all parts of the business, and certainly customer
contact employees, adopt the marketing concept philosophy and
work effectively to implement it?

<p><b>Automation And Demand Fluctuation</b>

<p>     Are vending machines the only automatic substitutes for
human customer contact employees?  What do your students think of
automatic telephone answering programs, where callers have to
listen carefully to the instructions, then punch the appropriate 
numbered keys to complete the call.  How much does the caller
contribute to service performance?  Can consumers' failure to
perform as desired undermine service delivery?  Do some consumers
become irritated by these automatic systems?  Why?  What are the
risks of an English-only automated telephone system and what
could be done to avoid problems caused by such a system? 

<p><b>Do Service Employees In The United States Deliver Good Service?</b>

<p>     If you have international students in class, or students who
have traveled extensively, ask them to share their observations
and experiences with services abroad and in the United States. 
As described in the International Marketing Report (page 456 of
the text), customer service in other countries can be much worse
than in the United States; sometimes it's better.  However,
American service providers often disappoint in their inability to
communicate in a language other than English, or sometimes
Spanish.  This is less of a problem in international airports and
tourist destinations.  However, in many parts of the country,
it's English, only.  Should a greater effort be made generally to
have multilingual service providers available for international
customers?  Is this a serious problem in your city?  Are there
particular types of services where it is more important to have a
multilingual person on staff?  What are the alternatives (human
and automated) to a multilingual service provider?  Considering
the growing diversity in U.S. society, might having a
multilingual service provider be a competitive advantage in some
situations?

<p><b>Testing Service Quality Using Comment Cards</b>

<p>     Have any of your students completed a customer comment card? 
Most of us have, at one time or another.  Who is more apt to
complete a card, a customer who is angry about bad service or one
that thinks the service was acceptable?  What incentive might a
business offer customers to get more of them to take the cards
more seriously and complete one?  Are there other and perhaps
better ways of determining how satisfied customers are with the
service they receive?

<p><b>I'll Take The Internet And An Espresso</b>

<p>     A new service business is springing up on both the east and
west coasts.  It's a coffee shop/Internet service, where
customers can log onto the Internet for a nominal charge per hour
of connect time, drink coffee, and have sandwiches and cakes, all
in a congenial atmosphere.  The shops offer their patrons the
opportunity to use a home page and post messages, poetry, art,
and music, as well as furnish mail boxes for their e-mail.  Would
this type of service do well in your city?  Describe by
demographic and psychographic characteristics the types of
consumers who might find this service irresistible.  Could
Internet connect service be offered in malls or other locations? 
Have students brainstorm extensions for this type of new service
business.

<p><b>The Shift To Services For Older Consumers</b>

<p>     A significant population age shift is occurring as the
leading edge of the baby boomers enter their 50s.  Students can
visit the U.S. Census Bureau's home page on the Internet to
examine national population projections (see Using the Internet
in this chapter).  A table of population projections for 1995,
2000, and 2005 is presented on the next page.  The data indicate
how the numbers of baby boomers will affect age segments as they
enter their senior years.

</pre>
  
<p>Note:   All population numbers are in thousands for the resident  
        population.

<p>     Students can study national or state data to see how the
shifts occur.  It is extremely interesting to look at the data
for the oldest old (80+) broken down by gender for these years. 
Ask students to consider some of the effects these age shifts
will have on services marketing in the years to come.  What
opportunities may emerge in services?  Is there a market for
services offered on the Internet?  What will be the appeal of the
Internet for older consumers?  What needs and wants can the
Internet serve for older people?

<p><b>Service Consumers</b>

<p>     When service performance goes bad, the provider usually gets
blamed.  However, it's important to appreciate the vital role
that the service consumer plays in close contact services.  The
example in the text (page 464), of bank services at a teller
window, illustrates a close contact service where consumer
performance affects service delivery.  Ask your students to think
of other situations where the service provider's performance
depends to a greater or lesser extent on the consumer's
performance.  For one or two examples, identify what should be
done to help the consumer perform more effectively.  Then, assess
how this can be implemented.  Is it feasible?  

<p><b>Pricing A Service</b>

<p>     Students can make service price comparisons, just as they
can make price comparisons for tangible goods.  Ask them to
consider how they would go about performing a price comparison
for

<ul>
<li>a permanent in a beauty salon
<li>shortening trouser legs at an alteration shop
<li>a manicure
<li>a 1-hour tennis lesson for a beginner
<li>having your teeth cleaned
<li>30-minutes with a marriage counselor
<li>an oil change
<li>tax preparation for a 1040 form 
<li>dry cleaning a suit
<li>grooming a small, short haired dog (regular grooming, no fur
     knots, no fleas)
</ul>

<p>     What are some differences between gathering competitive
intelligence for services and goods?  Are prices more variable
for some services?  Why?  

<p><b>Not-For-Profit Marketing</b>

<p>     Do any of your students currently work for a not-for-profit
that engages in marketing?  If so, ask if they would be willing
to share their observations about how the marketing is performed
and the goals that are set for marketing to accomplish.  You
might find an interesting guest speaker from a not-for-profit in
your area that actively uses marketing.  Investigate the
marketing of zoos, museums, symphony orchestras, and theater
groups.  Students can learn about organizations such as the
United Way, American Red Cross, and American Cancer Society and
their marketing activities.  Who performs their marketing?  Is it
a professional trained as a not-for-profit marketer?

<p><b>Place Marketing </b>

<p>     Most states and many cities engage in place marketing.  Have
students find out about economic development, tourism, and
educational marketing in your state.  Who does it and how is it
performed?  What results has been obtained from the marketing
effort?  Are the results satisfactory?

<p><b>Health Care Marketing</b>

<p>     Many health care providers have actively adopted marketing
practices.  If you have a large hospital or medical clinic in
your area, investigate the extent of the marketing they perform. 
What are their goals?  Do they market specific services, such as
a birthing, sleep disorder, obesity, or wellness center?  How
widely do they target their services?  A guest speaker who
markets health care services can provide valuable insights on how
the services are marketed.

<p><b>Educational Marketing</b>

<p>     Does your school actively market itself?  If so, invite your
school's marketing director to class to discuss higher education
marketing in general, and your school's marketing efforts in
particular.  What are some of the environmental trend factors
that are driving higher education marketing efforts?  How does
your school define its target markets?  Does it market to alumni
as well as prospective students?  How does it promote to these
markets?  Who are the school's major competitors and how are
their marketing efforts tracked?

<p><b>The International Marketing Of Services</b>

<p>   Can services be marketed internationally?  This is an
interesting question to ask your students.  Their first reaction
may be to say that services can't be exported.  If so, ask them
to consider whether or not the following services can be exported
and if so, how can it be done.

<ul>
<li>consulting services

<li>investing services

<li>marketing research services

<li>credit card services

<li>computer services (training, set-up)

<li>medical services

<li>educational services
</ul>

<p>     They can check on the international marketing of services on
the Internet (see <a href="#internet">Using the Internet</a> in this chapter) by visiting
directories and home pages in other countries using one of the
primary search engines.  They will see many familiar names, U.S.
companies marketing their services worldwide.

<p>     Since there is close personal contact in many services,
would this present special problems for the international service
marketer?  What specific cultural problems might arise?  How
could they be overcome?

I.   Explain the differences and similarities between goods and
     services                     
<ol>
<li>A service is an intangible, perishable product of
          variable quality whose production and consumption are
          inseparable; it may or may not be associated with a
          tangible good
<li>Services are characterized by their intangibility,
          perishability, inseparability, and variability
<ul>
<li>Intangibility means a product that is not
               palpable, properties that cannot be felt
<li>Perishability refers to the fleeting nature of
               services, which cannot be stored, inventoried, or
               stockpiled
<ol>
<li>Services are prone to the effects of demand
                    fluctuation, where demand shifts between
                    various levels that sometimes are not
                    predictable
<li>Strategies for dealing with demand
                    fluctuating include peak period pricing,
                    temporary employees, and use of alternative
                    service delivery systems such as automated
                    teller machines
</ol>
<li>Inseparability means that the service cannot be
               separated from the service deliverer, so that
               consumption occurs at the same time as service
               performance
<li>Variability in service performance means that
               differences may occur in the quality of the
               service delivered 
<ol>
<li>Service quality lies in the consumer's
                    evaluation of service performance
<li>Customers often are surveyed to determine
                    their perceptions of service quality
</ol>
</ul>
<li>Marketers attempt to classify services; however, it's
          not easy to do because of service variety and the ease
          with which services can be changed
<ul>
<li>Services are classified by product attributes,
               particularly how much a service is associated with
               a tangible good
<li>Services are classified by consumer targets,
               whether personal use, business, or organization
               consumers
<li>Services are classified by the extent of provider
               training required
<li>Services are classified by delivery system,
               whether people- or equipment-based, or both
<li>Services are classified by contact closeness, the
               level of personal interaction between service
               provider and consumer in the service encounter
</ul>
<li>Services have grown in importance during the latter
          half of the 20th century for several reasons
<ul>
<li>Increased numbers of women in the out-of-home
               workforce
<li>Time demands and complexities of contemporary life
<li>Changing population demographics, with growing
               numbers of older people who require more services
<li>income families with the discretionary income
               to have others perform tasks they don't like or
               haven't the time to do for themselves
<li>Expanded services means greater employment in
               service industries
</ul>
<li>Every service employee who makes contact with a
          consumer represents the business to that consumer
<ul>
<li>The concept of the lifetime value of a customer is
               growing in importance 
<li>Service providers must be able to deliver good
               quality service in order to ensure customer
               lifetime loyalty and patronage
<ol>
<li>Service providers must have the capacity to
                    perform good service
<li>Service providers must have the willingness
                    to perform
<li>Service providers must have the opportunity
                    to perform
</ol>
<li>Service businesses often use comprehensive
               internal marketing programs to market the business
               to its employees in order to develop their
               understanding of the importance of their role as
               service provider
</ul>
<li>Consumers both contribute to the service encounter and
          evaluate the quality of the service provided
</ol>

<ol>                         
<li>The marketing mix variables of product, price, place,
          and promotion are as important in marketing services as
          they are in marketing goods
<li>A service is a product whose characteristics must be
          determined before it can be offered to consumers
<li>Pricing a service requires a careful analysis of what
          is being priced and its value to consumers, and often
          it means following a price leader
<li>Place is important in services, both as services are
          distributed and as place conveys cues to consumers
          about the service being offered there
<li>Service promotion often involves personal selling and
          extensive advertising
<li>Marketing services requires formulating strategy and
          developing tactics to achieve the goals set for
          services to achieve
<li>A service advantage is often the only way that a
          business or organization can differentiate itself
</ol>

III. Recognize the characteristics of not-for-profit marketing    
<ol>       
<li>The designation not-for-profit means that earning a
          profit is not a primary organizational goal
<li>Marketing in the not-for-profit sector involves public
          and private organizations, causes, people, events, and
          places
<ul>
<li>Many not-for-profits engage in fund raising, using
               marketing strategies and tools to develop and
               harvest revenue sources in order to run a positive
               cash flow, cover operating expenses, and support
               benevolent activities

<li>Often a not-for-profit organization will hire a
               for-profit business to run its fund raising
               programs
</ul>
</ol>


IV.  Discuss some other for-profit extensions of marketing
<ol>
<li>Health care organizations are using marketing to offer
          niche services, behavior change activities associated
          with wellness goals, recruit staff, and measure
          customer service and satisfaction
<li>Some people actively market themselves, for profit,
          including athletes, lawyers, and medical professionals
<li>Entertainment marketing is big business and includes
          the marketing of individual entertainers as well as
          movies, books, and orchestras
<li>Leisure activities and places are marketed
<li>Events are marketed and include a wide array of
          activities, including trade shows, conventions,
          seminars, holiday celebrations, trade missions, and
          world class sports competitions
<li>Educational institutions market themselves in order to
          attract students, investors, and faculty
<li>The marketing of information services has become highly
          competitive and includes on-line computer services and
          telecommunications giants
</ol>

V.   Characterize the marketing concept in services and not-for-profits
<ol>
<li>The marketing concept is an operating philosophy that
          has customer satisfaction at its core, it requires the
          integration of all organizational operations in this
          effort
<li>The marketing concept is being applied successfully in
          goods and services, for-profits and not-for-profits
<li>When it comes to the societal marketing concept, many
          not-for-profits already practice what most for-profits
                    only think about
</ol>
                    
<h2><a name="questions">SUGGESTED ANSWERS TO CHAPTER QUESTIONS</a></h2>

<h3>DISCUSSION QUESTIONS</h3>

<p>1.  In your own words, discuss the characteristics that make
services unique.  <i>Answers will vary, but should mention
intangibility, perishability, inseparability, and variability.</i>

<p>2.  In the continuum of goods and services, where would an
automobile tune-up be placed?  A skating lesson?  Five-pound bags
of flour?  Explain your answers.  

<i>
<ul>
<li>An automobile tune-up varies.  If no tangible goods are
     replaced on the automobile, then it is a pure service. 
     However, if examination reveals that something must be
     replaced, the tune-up becomes mixed, a service that also
     includes the provision of a tangible part.

<li>A skating lesson is a pure service.

<li>Five-pound bags of flour are tangible goods.
</ul>
</i>

<p>3.  What might a college do to combat demand fluctuations during
the summer?  <i>Most colleges face declining demand for classes,
dormitory rooms, food, and teachers during the summer.  A growing
number of colleges keep running during the summer by offering
summer school classes, special short courses, summer sports
camps, cheerleading camps, and elder hostels, summer academic and
social programs for people in their late 50s and older who come
to campus for about a week, live in the dormitories, attend
classes and special programs.</i>

<p>4.  Explain how a consumer may affect the outcome of the service
encounter.  <i>A consumer both contributes to many services and
evaluates the outcomes.  In many services, their success depends
on the consumer's contribution and help in getting the job done. 
For example, a patient going to a medical clinic for special
tests is told not to eat anything for 12 hours before the tests. 
If the patient disobeys, does not cooperate with the
instructions, the tests may not yield the expected results.  If
this happens, the patient may become angered at having to repeat
the process.  While blaming the clinic for incompetence, the
patient may not realize how much he contributed to the tests'
failure.   </i>

<p>5.  Compare and contrast the evaluation of quality in a good and
service.  <i>Quality in a good often can be determined by its
deviation from standards, how often it has to be repaired, and if
the repairs are serious.  The quality of a tangible good can
usually be judged more objectively and measurably than a service.
Service quality is in the eye of the beholder.  It is the
consumer's subjective judgment of how well the service met her
expectations.</i>

<p>6.  Discuss the reasons behind the economy's shift to services.
<i>The economy has shifted to being dominated by services for many
reasons, these include

<ul>
<li>the large number of women who are now working full-time out
     of their homes

<li>dual income families who pool their resources and have more
     discretionary income for such things as eating out and
     getting help with jobs that they no longer want to do

<li>the lack of time many people feel because they are commuting
     longer, working harder, and have less time to perform
     services for themselves

<li>increased stresses of modern life have provided
     opportunities for services that help people cope

<li>many manufacturing jobs have left the country

<li>the aging of the population, as the population bulge of the
     baby boomers nears retirement, more services will be needed
     to help older people care for themselves and stay in their
     homes as long as possible to avoid costly stays in nursing
     homes
</ul></i>

<p>7.  What dimensions affect a service provider's performance?
<i>Service provider performances are affected by their capacity to
perform, willingness to perform, and opportunity to perform.</i>

<p>8.  Why did not-for-profits avoid marketing for many years?  Why
are so many using marketing now?  <i>The reason many not-for-profits
avoided marketing was because the for-profit focus of marketing
activities was not compatible, in their view, with a not-for-profit image.  Many are using marketing now because they have to
compete for scarce funding.  They also realize that while their
core function may be not-for-profit, they have to be successful
in fund raising and building a sound financial base or they, too,
can go out of business.</i>

<p>9.  What are some forms of people marketing?  Give both
for-profit and not-for-profit examples.  <i>For-profit people
marketing includes entertainers, professional athletes, artists,
and professional people like lawyers, doctors, and dentists. 
Not-for-profit marketing of people includes politicians and
political parties.</i>

<p>10. Discuss whether or not the marketing concept applies to
services.  <i>It certainly does and is at the core of service
activities that try to satisfy consumers.</i>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING</h3>

<h4>Check Your Understanding 14.1 </h4>

<p>1.  What is a service?  Is a service a product?  <i>A service is a
product that is intangible, perishable, inseparable, and variable
in its quality.</i>

<p>2.  Describe the unique characteristics of services.  <i>Services
are not tangible (cannot be felt); they are perishable (cannot be
inventoried, stored); inseparable (production and consumption
take place simultaneously); and vary in their quality due to
fluctuations in service performance.</i>
 
<p>3.  Discuss why a marketer's and a consumer's perception of
service quality may differ.  <i>Both come to the service encounter
with different expectations, thus while the marketer may think
that a good service has been performed, a consumer may be
dissatisfied.  Since each is serving their self-interest, it is
easy to see where a conflict can occur.</i>


<h4>Check Your Understanding 14.2</h4>

<p>1.  Explain why services have become so important to consumers
and the U.S. economy. <i>Services have become so important because
society and the country have changed, more women work out-of-home, dual income families have the discretionary money to
purchase services, growing numbers of older people need more
services, people feel pressures from not enough time and too much
stress and seek services to help, and many manufacturing jobs
have left the country.</i>

<p>2.  What is the role of the consumer in the service encounter?
<i>The consumer assists in the performance of the service, therefore
can also contribute to the outcome.  </i>
 
<p>3.  Discuss the importance of employee capacity, willingness, and
opportunity in the effective delivery of services.  <i?These three
dimensions are extremely important in determining whether or not
the service performer does a good job.  Capacity and willingness
are well know contributors to work performance.  However, in
services in particular, it is important to consider whether or
not the service provider also has the tools and equipment,
materials and supplies to do a good job.  This dimension includes
having the authority to make decisions that will contribute to a
good service outcome.</i>


<h4>Check Your Understanding 14.3 </h4>

<p>1.  Explain some of the ways that services are priced.  <i>Cost-based pricing is often used for equipment-based services. 
People-based pricing often uses competitive pricing or a
consideration of the service provider's image as a factor in
setting price.  Others may just follow a price leader.</i>

<p>2.  Can services be promoted?  Explain your answer.  <i>Promotion is
very important to services, for the same reasons as they are
important to goods but also because promotion helps establish
tangibility for services.  For example, the association of a
service with visual symbols in advertising gives the service an
image and tangibility.  This is the case for credit services
(tangible cards), telecommunications (pins), and insurance
services (umbrellas, rocks).</i>
            
<p>3.  Can a service provide a sustainable competitive advantage for
a business?  <i>For many tangible products that have no other point
of differentiation from competitive and indistinguishable
products, service may be the one factor that sets them apart. 
For example, most gasoline stations are almost identical and have
prices that vary only within pennies of each other.  However,
some stations differentiation themselves by offering customers a
free car wash service with a fill-up.  If others can't or won't
duplicate this service, it can become a competitive advantage.   </i>


<h4>Check Your Understanding 14.4</h4>

<p>1.  Explain how profit and not-for-profit marketing differ.  <i>The
difference lies primarily in the profit motive.  Earning a profit
is not a primary organizational goal of not-for-profit
organizations, whereas it is for most for-profit businesses. 
Other than this, the marketing process is quite similar.</i>

<p>2.  Identify some types of not-for-profit marketing.  <i>Not-for-profit marketers include such public and private organizations as
governments, charities, hospitals, politicians, unions, religious
groups, zoos, social causes, and activists.</i>

<p>3.  Are there any not-for-profits that shouldn't market?  <i>Many
noncommercial organizations are marketed.  However, any not-for-profit that believes marketing activities are bad for its image
should not market itself, even if this is not the case.  </i>


<h4>Check Your Understanding 14.5</h4>
<p>1.  Identify some of the newer applications of marketing. <i>Some of
the newer marketing applications include health care, people,
entertainment, leisure activities, places, events, educational
institutions, and information services.</i>
 
<p>2.  Do all lawyers agree that the marketing of legal services is
desirable? <i>No, this is still an issue that lawyers and the legal
profession have not resolved.</i>

<p>3.  Are the marketing concept and societal marketing concept
applicable to service businesses and not-for-profit organizations
that engage in marketing?  <i>Services are products and the
marketing concept is directed at all products.  It applies
equally well to not-for-profits, many of which are designed to
satisfy and serve consumers.  When it comes to the societal
marketing concept, many not-for-profits are successfully applying
it when for-profits are still talking about it.</i>


<h3>MINI-CASES</h3>
                                
<h4>Mini-Case 14.1: Mail Room Outsourcing: A Big Service Business  </h4>
    
<p>    Most people rarely spend time thinking about how their mail
gets delivered in a business or organization.  However,
considering its volume and importance, this is an important
service that few businesses or organizations could stand to lose. 
Financial institutions and businesses that must transmit valuable
documents often are more concerned about mailroom efficiency and
security.  Is this important in other types of businesses and
organizations?  Will increased use of the Internet (e-mail), fax
machines, and other telecommunications types lessen the
importance of the traditional mailroom?  Could this service be
ripe for greater automation?

<p>1.  What do you think of the rationale behind Burn's service
proposition?  <i>Answers may vary, but Burns's mailroom business
bundled with its security expertise should make it a highly
attractive service for many consumers.</i>

<p>2.  Do you agree with it?  <i>Yes, it makes good sense to increase
efficiency and security in locations where both may be lacking.</i>

<p>3.  Where else might Burns target its services?  Explain your
answer.  <i>Other targets for Burns's service might include
hospitals, medical centers, and educational institutions.     </i>


<h4>Mini-Case 14.2  Turmoil And Opportunity In Health Care Marketing</h4>

<p>     Health care marketing is big business in the United States. 
Health care insurance is a product that most consumers agree is
essential but some consumers believe is too expensive for them to
afford.  An alternative to traditional health care is offered
through health maintenance organizations that offer a wide array
of health care services to their members.  Where competition
between health care providers is intense, marketing can provide a
competitive advantage.  

<p>In the highly competitive health care market, insurers like
Prudential of America, Aetna Life & Casualty, and the various
Blue Cross/Blue Shields are rivals that seek to sign up
consumers, either through self-purchased health insurance or
employer-purchased insurance.  Do you think that marketing
differs between the for-profit and not-for-profit payors?  For
the most part, the goals and the methods are much the same. 
Differences between the two have blurred.
                                
<h3>WHAT DO YOU THINK?</h3>

<p>     Typically, burial services are unsought products.  Although
more consumers are prearranging funerals, most burial services
traditionally have not been arranged in advance.  If students
think this is an interesting issue to pursue, contact the funeral
homes in your city and ask for information on how they market
advance burial service plans.  You may locate a funeral home
director who will discuss funeral home marketing with your class.

<h2><a name="internet">USING THE INTERNET</a></h2>

<p>     Please verify all Internet addresses and confirm the
feasibility of an Internet assignment <b>before</b> you make it.  No
Internet address or information can be guaranteed past the date
of this <b><i>Manual's</b></i> publication.  Be sure to insist that students
demonstrate professional conduct at all times on the Internet.   

<h3>Internet Assignments</h3>

<p>     One of the most successful Internet class activities that I
have used with introductory marketing students is the "Better
Mousetrap" assignment.  

<p>     Using an Internet search engine, search for sites that are
     selling a product of your choice.  For example, you may want
     to select a product that you already know is being sold on
     the Internet, like automobiles, music, or computers. 
     Alternately, you may be interested in searching for service
     products in your major, such as financial services,
     accounting services, advertising services, or real estate
     services.  Whatever you select, please use a product that
     interests you because it will make the search more involving
     and fun.

<p>     Find three to four sites that sell your product.

<ol>
<li>Identify the URL location of each site by gopher or
          http address, or provide a description of links so I
          can visit the sites.

<li>Describe and critique (compare and contrast) the sites.

<li>Imagine that you are the marketing manager for a
          competing product.  You are getting ready to launch
          your product on the Internet and you want to learn from
          your competition (their strengths and weaknesses on the
          Net) so that your product will be more effectively
          marketed in cyberspace.
<ul>

<li>Design a home page (no more than 3 computer
               screens) and identify the information that will be
               in each hypertext box.  Explain why you have used
               these boxes (why this information is important to
               your customers).

<li>Describe how consumers can pay for your product.

<li>Describe how you will establish a long term
               relationship with customers.

<li>Explain what it will take for you to sustain a
               competitive advantage over the competition.
</ul>
</ol>

<p>     This activity can be assigned to individuals or small
student teams of no more than two or three members.  I place no
restrictions on product type and many students select services. 
Past product choices include accounting, real estate, and
financial services, and music event marketing, along with such
tangible goods as guitars, automobiles, bicycles, and computers. 
Results are reported in memo form and an oral presentation to the
class that includes transparencies of their home pages.  

<p>    Any of the primary search engines can be used to identify 
sites, however Yahoo is particularly well suited to this task. 
Extensive listings can be located for almost any product type. 
For example, the Yahoo home page has topic category links to
subcategories with other links to documents and directories (see
below).
  
<ul>
<li> Art
<li> Business
<li> Computers
<li> Economy
<li> Education

<li> Law
<li> News
<li> Politics
<li> Reference
<li> Regional Information
<li> Science
<li> Social Science
<li> Society and Culture
</ul>

<p>     If a student clicks on Events, it leads to links for such
events as conferences, sports and games, festivals, and other
gatherings.  A click on * Entertainment leads to such topics as
amusement parks, aviation, books, comics, contests, cooking,
dance, fashion, and many others.

<i><p><a href="http://www.yahoo.com">http://www.yahoo.com</a></i>


<p>     Many other services can be investigated on the Net, even
services that generally are unsought, such as burial services. 
The WebCrawler and World Wide Web Worm can lead to such links by
using the search query funeral homes.  The home page sites
currently available are extremely informative.  One site suggests
that with our contemporary mobile society, the Internet is a link
for expressing condolences, irrespective of geographical
boundaries.  Is there a marketing opportunity here, for a service
that sends flowers, a condolence card, and even prepared foods to
the family of the recently deceased? 

<p>     Along with specific product information, these sites offer
information about bereavement.  This includes links to news
groups that help others cope with their loss, information on
grief and loss, frequently asked questions (FAQs) about coping
with chronic illness, children and grief, and support for parents
in their time of grief.  There are definitions of a funeral, and
information about burial insurance.

<p>Population Demographics And Services

<p>     For students who are researching population trends in order
to identify service product opportunities as the population ages,
the U.S. Census Bureau is the most comprehensive site to visit. 
This site includes both national data and state data.

<h4>State Services Marketing</h4>

<p>     Is your state on the Internet?  Most are, and they are
marketing their parks and other tourist attractions, as well as
their educational facilities, quality of life, and value as a
site for economic development.  For example, a visit to the
Commonwealth of Kentucky Web Server contains a message from the
governor, along with links to colleges and universities, the
Churchill Downs Virtual Backside with information about the
Breeders' Cup, visitor centers in various cities, state parks,
the Kentucky Horse Park, major businesses, and a virtual tour of
the state.

<h3>MARKETING APPLICATIONS</h3>


<h4>MARKETING APPLICATION 14.1</h4>

<p>     Some service encounters are extremely pleasant; others are
not.  A marketer who is trying to establish long term
relationships with consumers should be concerned about the
quality of the encounter.  Examples that students often cite of
poor service encounters involve car mechanics, bank tellers,
grocery store checkers, retail salespeople, and hotel desk
clerks.  Their responses on how to improve the service encounter
should begin with the employees involved in customer contact and
service delivery.  Improvements are a function of selecting,
training, motivating, rewarding, and managing customer contact
employees.  Having the right people at the contact point with
consumers is critically important, as is making sure that they
have the tools and equipment to do their jobs well.  Other
improvements are associated with the environment within which the
encounter occurs.  For example, in a car repair waiting room,
providing free coffee, current magazines, comfortable chairs,
soothing music, and a generally pleasant place to wait can make
the wait more bearable.  In a dentist's office, cheerful pictures
and humorous cartoons on the ceiling, where patients leaning back
in the dental chair can see them, soothing music and colors, can
help reduce tension.  


<h4>MARKETING APPLICATION 14.2</h4>

<p>In a typical day, most people will encounter a mixture of
services, and not stop to think about how the services are
classified, for example as people- or equipment based, or
targeted, to personal use, business, or organization consumers. 
The point of this Application is to make students more aware of
the variety of services they use and from which they benefit. 
Have them contrast the services by such factors as

<ul>
<li>extent of need -- are these services essential or are they
     wanted, but not really needed?

<li>frequency -- how regularly is the service used?

<li>pleasure derived -- does the consumer typically enjoy the
     delivery of the service, or is it something to be endured?

<li>level of participation -- how actively must the consumer
     participate in the service being delivered? 

<li>scheduling -- can the service be performed without advance
     notice, as when a consumer drives up to a bank teller
     window, or must it be scheduled in advance?

<li>price -- how expensive is the service to most consumers; can
     it be paid for with pocket change or is it a "big ticket"
     item that must be paid off in installments?
</ul>


<h4>MARKETING APPLICATION 14.3</h4>

<p>     Responses will vary, but you should be prepared with your
own critical incident experiences to add to the class discussion. 
Critical incidents are used in social science research to capture
people's perceptions about situations in which they were
participants and/or observers (participant observers).  Critical
incidents can be used, as they are in this Application, to
recount consumers' experiences in the service encounter. 
However, in this case, students are taking dual roles, of
participant observers recounting critical incidents of service
delivery, and as marketers seeking to analyze what went wrong in
low-quality service examples.  Small teams of students can take
specific examples of poor service and consider ways to improve
the delivery.  
     
<p>     Alternately, students can consider their examples of high-quality service to find commonalities in what distinguishes the
services.  Often, the most powerful factor in high-quality
service is the effort made by the service provider.  Sometimes,
even when the eventual service outcome may be disappointing, the
service encounter is perceived as pleasant because of the extra
effort involved.  For example, a consumer goes to a bank to get a
home mortgage loan.  The bank loan officer works really hard with
the consumer to get the lowest possible interest rate on the
loan.  However, right before they lock in the loan, the Federal
Reserve unexpectedly raises interest rates, mortgage companies
follow, and the home loan comes in at the slightly higher rate. 
The consumer is disappointed in the final rate.  However, she is
impressed by how hard the loan officer worked to get the lower
rate and that he got the bank to reduce its closing costs in
light of the situation.  As a result, the consumer decides to
move her checking and savings accounts to this bank.


<h4>MARKETING APPLICATION 14.4 </h4>

<p>     Rather than have students perform the research needed to
determine how effectively your local government uses marketing,
invite a guest speaker to class to address this issue. 
Information about city government marketing can be addressed to
the office of the city manager, mayor, or director of economic
development.  A city ombudsman or information office may be able
to provide the information and a contact person.  If you are near
state or federal government offices, you may find a guest speaker
there. 

<h3>CONSUMER INSIGHTS AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETING</h3>

<h4>CONSUMER INSIGHT 14.1</h4>

<p>     Total customer service, as it is practiced at the Phelps
County Bank (PCB), is a model for other banks.  How do banks in
your city compare?  Are they as focused on customer service? 
Students can perform participant observations of their own
banking experiences to answer this question.


<h4>CONSUMER INSIGHT 14.2</h4>

<p>     Do you have a laundry/bar like Duds 'n' Suds near a local
college?  There is one adjacent to our largest state university
and it is very popular with students and area residents.  What do
your students think of the idea of bundling services together in
this way?  Are there other services that have been successfully
bundled?  Are there some that could be bundled?  Do they present
a promising opportunity for an entrepreneur?


<h4>INTERNATIONAL MARKETING REPORT</h4>

<p>     The first McDonald's in the former Soviet Union was a
popular subject of newspaper and magazine articles in the early
1990s.  Students can easily find these articles and learn more
about this remarkable story.  Many Russians resettled in the
United States when the Soviet Union collapsed.  You may be able
to find a recent immigrant through an English As A Second
Language program in your public school system.  If possible, ask
that a contact be identified who can speak to your class about
services in the former Soviet Union and contrast his or her
experiences with services in the United States. </p>

<h1>PLACE: DISTRIBUTION AND WHOLESALING</h1>
</center>

<h2>CHAPTER ABSTRACT</h2>

<p><b>1. Explain how promotion works.  </b>Promotion is persuasive,
purposive marketing communication about products.  Promotion
performs many tasks.  It informs consumers, helps build a brand
image, persuades consumers to make a purchase, reminds them about
products, and even entertains them.  Promotion works by breaking
through the clutter and presenting a brand as a champion that can
solve a consumer's problem.  Promotions are used to establish
long term relationships with consumers that focus marketing
activities on getting close to and connecting with them, and
satisfying their needs and wants.  Marketing communications are
described by the communication process model where a source
encodes a message that is transmitted through a communication
channel to a receiver, who decodes the message and provides
feedback.  Noise can come from anyplace, including mechanical,
technical, human sources.  Noise can undermine if not prevent
communication.  Marketing promotion is performed by businesses,
as well as government, organizations, and individuals. 
Integrated marketing communication (IMC) is designed from the
consumer's perspective and uses many promotion types to deliver
integrated, unified, coordinated messages and incentives.  It is
finely targeted to receptive audiences using information obtained
from databases.


<p><b>2. Discuss promotion decisions.  </b>Promotion decisions are about
which types to use (advertising, sales promotions, personal
selling, public relations/publicity, direct marketing), how to
use them, when and for how long, using what media.  Decisions
about promotions are designed to determine how to get the
consumer to act, most often to make a purchase.  The hierarchy of
effects model is used to describe how consumers are moved from
awareness to purchase.  It is more effective for understanding
how consumers are moved from awareness to purchase high
involvement products.  Consumers control promotions in many
different ways, including such activities as selectively
perceiving promotions, changing channels when advertisements
appear, requesting removal of their names from direct mail lists,
using call screening on their telephones to block sales calls,
and refusing to buy products whose promotions irritate or offend
them.


3. Identify the steps in a promotion plan.  The promotion plan is
a blueprint for action that sets objectives for promotion to
achieve and provides a roadmap for doing so.  Promotion planning
is affected by product characteristics including stage in the
life cycle, price and place; the competition; target audience
characteristics; the channel of distribution; and what is
happening in the environment.  Steps in the planning process
include identifying promotion goals, making promotion
assignments, formulating promotion strategy, identifying target
audiences, developing the message, selecting the promotion types,
allocating the budget, and implementing, evaluating, and making
modifications to the promotion plan, as needed.



<p><b>4. Describe promotion budgeting practices.  </b>There are many ways
that promotion budgets are set, including such methods as
percentage of sales, competitive parity, all that's left, seat of
the pants, objective and task, and the use of sophisticated
computer models.



<p><b>5. Address criticisms of promotion. </b>Promotion is the element in
the marketing mix that blatantly calls attention to itself.  It
is criticized for being very costly, which adds to product
prices.  The intensity of promotion and its pervasiveness
encourage consumer materialism and conspicuous consumption. 
Promotion is criticized for being devious and untruthful,
misleading, deceptive, overly harsh, and blighting the landscape. 
Advertising is criticized as being misleading, tasteless, and
toxic.  Promotion is also blamed for invading consumers' privacy. 
In defense of promotion, it provides information that can
increase competition and lower prices.  It subsidizes a free
press and provides a public service through public service
announcements.  Millions of people throughout the world are
employed in promotions.

<h2><a name="teaching tips">SOME TEACHING TIPS</a></h2>

<p>     The chapter's opening questions are "How will marketers
promote their products in the next century?  Will promotion as we
know it today via mass media (television, radio, newspapers,
magazines) be as prominent?"  If you have been using Internet
assignments, your students will have a more personal
understanding of the implications of rapid technological change 
for marketers communicating with target audiences.  Ask students
to consider these questions and relate them to their experiences
on the Internet.  What can they conclude about the possible
impact of Web commerce on traditional promotion delivery systems? 
What will be more likely to change, the message or the delivery
system?  Will this mean the death of mass advertising and other
promotions aimed at the mass market?  Will the Internet
accelerate the movement toward mass customization which, in this
case, will be the mass customization of promotion messages and
delivery systems.

<p><b>Planning Promotions For The Egg Delivery System</b>

<p>     This is a good point to refer back to the egg delivery
system and relate the product to its promotion.  How should the
product be promoted?  What factors must be considered in making
promotion decisions?  How important is it to plan promotions from
the consumer's perspective?  This is particularly relevant to the
egg delivery system because the target audience may be quite
small.  Ask the same student teams that designed the egg delivery
system to develop a simplified promotion plan for the product. 
This includes an analysis of the value that promotion adds to
this product, particularly as it informs consumers about product
benefits.  Their results can be reported in memo form or through
brief oral presentations to the class.

<p><b>Ethics And Promotions: An Oxymoron?</b>

<p>     Because of the weight of criticism about promotion, this
chapter provides an opportunity for students to debate the value
of promotion to marketers, consumers, and society.  Many
professional organizations have codes of ethics that state
guidelines for professional behavior in promotions.  Students may
examine some of these codes and decide for themselves whether or
not the codes are comprehensive and helpful to marketers facing
serious ethical dilemmas, or not.  

<p>     Students can evaluate problem areas in promotions by
collecting examples of criticisms as exemplified in print
advertisements, outdoor promotions, and on television.  If each
student brings one example to class, it will provide a good
starting point for determining whether the criticisms are serious
or frivolous.  Consider whether the value that promotions add is
greater than the weight of the criticisms.

<p>     Many current articles describe problems in promotions. 
Students can research such problems as telephone deceptions,
invasions of consumer privacy, sales fraud, and the glut of
television commercials.  Invite a guest speaker from the local
Better Business Bureau to class for a first-hand perspective on
problems in promotions.
     
<p><b>Promoting An Innovative Product To U.S. Consumers</b>

<p>     A search of current business publications will reveal
examples of new product introductions and their promotion plans
that you can use in class discussions.  For example, some of your
students may have been part of the target audience for promotions
introducing Jergens Refreshing Body Shampoo to American consumers
in late 1994.  

<p>     Cincinnati based Andrew Jergens Co. is owned by Kao Company,
Japan's leading detergent business.  Kao is the Japanese market
leader for such personal use consumer products as diapers,
shampoos, and soaps, with worldwide 1994 sales of over $7
billion.  It is also successfully marketing floppy disks,
chemicals, and other products in the United States.

<p>     Despite their successes elsewhere in the world, most
Japanese soaps, cosmetics, and toiletries marketers have not been
very successful in the U.S. market.  Many believe it is because
the Japanese have failed to develop consumer insights about their
target marketers.  They fail to understand the American
mentality.

<p>     Kao calls its new product an innovation for the American
market.  It is a liquid body soap, more expensive than bar soap,
but also longer lasting.  It comes with its own blue and white
application sponge.  Consumers pour a small amount of body soap
into a small depression in the sponge, then squeeze the lather
onto the body.  The liquid soap comes in two formulations, mild
clean scent and deodorant-fresh clean scent.

<p>     Japanese consumers love this type of product, which fits
their perception of a bath as a serious part of a daily cleansing
ritual.  By comparison, American personal cleansing habits are
"... more a frivolous indulgence," according to the senior vice
president of marketing for Jergens (Ono 1994, p.B8).  Moreover,
American consumers prefer showers to baths and hard bar soaps
comprise 97 percent of body cleansing products.  

<p>     In addition to magazine print advertisements and television
commercials, Jergens direct mailed product samples and discount
coupons to consumers in selected zip codes across the country
(zip code demographics).  Trial sizes were offered at discount
prices in retail stores.  The promotional message claimed that
the liquid soap, called a body shampoo system, won't dry skin
like bar soap, is quick to lather, provides a massage through the
action of the sponge, rinses easily, and leaves no soapy film.

<p>     Students can be drawn into a discussion of this case by
asking whether or not they received one of the initial free
samples, have seen the advertisements, and/or have used or
currently use the product.  Bring a sample of the product to
class as a visual aid so students can relate case details to the
physical product.  Questions to discuss include

<ul>
<li>Is this product as innovative as the company claims?

<li>What are the chances that American consumers will change
     their bathing habits and abandon bar soaps for a liquid body
     shampoo?

<li>What promotions could be used to develop consumer awareness
     of this product?

<li>Based on consumer insights about American bathing habits,
     what message(s) should be used to counter initial resistance
     to the product?

<li>What incentive(s) should be offered?

<li>Is this a gender-specific product (more acceptable to one
     gender than the other)?  If so, what are some barriers to
     making it more acceptable to both?

<li>Once the product is introduced and sales begin to grow, what
     promotions should be used during the maturity stage of the
     life cycle?

<li>Can good promotions save a good product that consumers don't
     want?
</ul>

     U.S. Market," <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> (August 8): B1, 8.

<p><b>Guest Speaker</b>

<p>     A guest speaker from a local professional organization or
promotions business can be invited to class to talk about the
issues introduced in this chapter.  If possible, identify a guest
from an agency engaged in integrated marketing communication
services.  Find out how they develop a promotion plan, implement,
evaluate, and control it.

<p><b>International Promotion</b>

<p>     International promotion environments often differ
substantially from the environment in the United States.  In
addition to the complexities of cross cultural communication,
marketers also have to deal with legal restrictions, delivery
system access problems, and protectionism.  Consider that

<ul>
<li>Australia has strict local content laws restricting where
     television commercials can be filmed

<li>Alcohol and tobacco advertisements are strictly banned in
     many European countries

<li>In countries with large Moslem populations, women must be
     covered, and unmarried couples are not to touch in print or
     television advertisements

<li>In many countries, sales promotions are banned because they
     are thought to give large business, that can afford to offer
     them, advantages over smaller competitors

<li>Illiteracy is common in Africa, Asia, and parts of South
     American, which severely limits the use of written messages
</ul>

<p>     Ask students to find other examples of differences in
promotion environments worldwide.  International students may
contribute to this discussion with observations from their homes
as well as their travels.

<h2><a name="outline">CHAPTER OUTLINE</a></h2>

I.   Explain how promotion works
<ol>
<li>For promotion to work, it must first break through the
          clutter of promotions that bombard consumers on a daily
          basis

<li>Promotion works by establishing a product as a hero,
          able to solve consumer's problems, and by helping to
          form a relationship with consumers, showing how the
          product can solve their problems over a long period
<li>There are different perspectives on promotion
<ul>
<li>Promotion is communication, holding a conversation
               with consumers, usually from a distance, using the
               communication process
<ol>
<li>In the communication process, a source
                    originates a message then encodes and
                    transmits it through a delivery system, where
                    a receiver decodes the message into
                    understandable thoughts
<li>A receiver usually provides feedback
<li>Noise can occur anywhere in the process and
                    often distorts, interrupts, or cancels the
                    process
</ol>
<li>Some promotion is personal, as in personal selling
<li>Promotion is used to stimulate word-of-mouth
               distribution of a message
<li>In order for promotion to work, it must be
               designed for the target audience at which it is
               directed
<li>Promotion must be built around consumer insight in
               order for it to achieve the goals set for it
</ul>
<li>Integrated marketing communication (IMC) is promotion
          designed from the "outside in" that begins with
          consumer insight, relies on databases to finely target
          appropriate messages and incentives, and calls for
          coordinating promotion types so that a consistent,
          unified voice cuts through marketplace clutter
</ol>

II.  Discuss promotion decisions
<ol>
<li>Marketers must decide what promotion types are best for
          each situation
<li>The promotion mix includes advertising, personal
          selling, sales promotions, public relations/publicity
          and direct marketing
<ul>
<li>Advertising (mass and direct) is the use of 
               nonpersonal messages usually paid for by an
               identified sponsor using electronic, print, and
               other media
<li>Sales promotions add value to products by offering
               purchase inducements on a temporary basis to
               stimulate consumer demand, build store traffic, or
               encourage the trade to move products through a
               channel of distribution
<li>Personal selling is the most personal type of
               promotion and involves face-to-face, telephone,
               and other forms of contact 
<li>Public relations/publicity has the goal of
               generating a favorable image and goodwill, and
               providing information without necessarily
               identifying the sponsor
<li>Direct marketing includes a wide array of
               promotion forms that direct highly targeted
               promotional messages and incentives at selected
               consumers
</ul>
<li>Promotion works in mass advertised, high involvement
          products by getting consumers to act through a series
          of steps that move them from awareness, through
          knowledge, liking, preference, and conviction, to
          purchase
<li>Consumers control promotions in many ways, including
          such actions as deciding whether or not to pay
          attention to them, removing their names from direct
          mail lists, changing television channels, and
          boycotting brands whose advertisements irritate or
          offend them
</ol>

III. Identify the steps in a promotion plan
<ol>
<li>A promotion plan is a blueprint for action that sets
          specific objectives for the promotion program to
          achieve over a designated time period
<ul>
<li>Different promotion goals can be identified during
               a product's life cycle, from informing consumers
               when the product is first introduced, to
               persuading and reminding them to purchase the
               product when it is in its maturity
<li>Other influences on promotion planning are such
               factors as price, place, characteristics of the
               product, the competition, channels, and what is
               happening in the economy
</ul>
<li>Generally, promotion planning proceeds through several
          steps, some of which may occur concurrently
<ul>
<li>Identify promotion goals
<ol>
<li>What the promotion is expected to accomplish
<li>By defining promotion goals, outcomes can be
                    measured against the goals to determine
                    promotion effectiveness
</ol>
<li>Make promotion assignments
<ol>
<li>Promotions can be planned and implemented
                    internally, externally, or using both in-house and external promotion professionals
<li>The advantages of these alternatives must be
                    considered before making a decision on
                    promotion responsibilities
</ol>
<li>Formulate promotion strategy
<ol>
<li>Strategy involves making decisions about how
                    to achieve promotion goals
<li>Promotion delivery systems and targets vary
                    according to whether the distribution channel
                    strategy is push, pull, or mixed
<ul>
<li>A push strategy directs promotion at the
                         trade in order to push products through
                         channels; it is often heavily weighted
                         toward personal selling, price deals,
                         and sales promotions
<li>A pull strategy promotes directly to
                         consumers in order to build demand and
                         get consumers to pull products through a
                         channel; it is often heavily weighted
                         toward advertising and sales promotions
<li>A mixed strategy uses both push and
                         pull, and the promotion types identified
                         with them 
</ul>
</ol>
<li>Identify target audiences
<ol>
<li>Effective promotion is built on consumer
                    insight
<li>Information used in targeting includes
                    demographics, psychographics, and past
                    purchase records collected in computer
                    databases
</ol>
<li>Develop the message
<ol>
<li>Two major types of message strategies are
                    emotional and rational appeals
<li>The message must be appropriate to the target
                    audience and the spokesperson must be
                    credible
</ol>
<li>Select the promotion types
<li>Allocate the budget
<li>Implement, evaluate, and make modifications
<ol>
<li>Implement means launching the promotion
                    program and managing it
<li>Evaluating means comparing promotion goals to
                    outcomes
<li>Modifications may be needed when feedback
                    indicates that the promotion needs adjustment 
</ol>
</ul>
</ol>

IV.  Describe promotion budgeting practices
<ol>
<li>The promotion budget specifies how much money can be
          spent on promotion
<li>Allocations are the amounts set aside from the budget
          for specific promotion activities
<li>There are many ways to set a promotion budget,
          including such methods as percentage of sales,
          competitive parity, all that's left, seat of the pants,
          objective and task, and the use of computer-based
          models
</ol>

V.   Address criticisms of promotion
<ol>
<li>Promotion is the marketing mix variable that openly
          calls attention to itself, which often leads to intense
          scrutiny and criticism
<li>Promotion is criticized for many reasons
<ul>
<li>It is costly and critics believe that these
                    costs add to product prices
<li>Promotions are devious and untruthful
<li>Promotions are blamed for encouraging
                    consumers to purchase products they don't
                    need and can't afford
<li>Promotions are criticized because of
                    promotion scams; competitive advertising that 
                    gets hostile; outdoor promotions that lead to
                    visual blight; misleading, tasteless, and
                    even toxic advertisements; and invasions of
                    privacy 
</ul>
<li>Promotion is defended for providing important product
          information that increases competition and lowers
          prices, subsidizing a free press, and supporting many
          worthwhile public causes through public service
          announcements and pro bono (donated) work
<li>Promotion is monitored and regulated by government at
          all levels; through laws, agencies, and professional
          self-regulation through such organizations as the
          American Marketing Association, American Association of
          Advertising Agencies, Direct Marketing Association,
          Council of Better Business Bureaus and local Better
          Business Bureaus
</ol>

<p>1.  If consumer demand exceeded product supply, would there still
be a need for promotion?  Explain your answer?  <i>Yes, even if
demand was greater than supply, promotion would still be needed
to inform consumers about products.  Obviously, a greatly reduced
amount of promotions would be required if demand exceeded supply,
unless it became necessary to demarket products.</i>

<p>2.  What is promotion clutter?  Identify some sources and explain
why it is a problem.  <i>Clutter refers to the often excessive
number of promotion contacts a consumer experiences in a time
period, such as a day, week, or month.  Some of the clutter comes
from obvious product promotions, such as advertising, sales
promotions, personal selling, direct marketing, and
publicity/public relations.  Other clutter comes from more subtle
communications about products through such things as labels on
clothing, product placements in motion pictures, and product
packaging.  It is a problem because consumers become overwhelmed
by the volume and screen out most of the communications in self-defense.  This makes it harder for the marketer to break through
the clutter and consumers' perceptual screens to capture
consumers' attention.</i>

<p>3.  Discuss the simple model of the communication process. 
Explain the importance of this model to promotion.  <i>Marketing
communication is described within a simplified model of the
communication process.  This model states that a source
constructs a message (encodes it), then transmits the message
through a delivery system (the communication channel or medium)
to the receiver, who decodes the message.  The receiver often
sends feedback to the sender (source).  Noise may occur
throughout the communication process and includes everything from
technical interference (radio static, television transmission
problems) to people interrupting the process.  This model is
important because it helps explain how communication occurs and
why communication problems can occur. </i>

<p>4.  Why is relationship marketing of concern to marketers?  Can
it benefit consumers?  <i>Marketing promotions are used to establish
relationships with consumers.  It is important for marketers to
establish a long term relationship in order to build customer
loyalty and facilitate repeat purchases and cross selling.  It is
important to consumers, because when marketers concentrate on
developing a long term relationship, there is a greater
probability that consumer needs will be identified and served.</i>

<p>5.  Compare and contrast integrated marketing communication (IMC)
and traditional promotion.  <i>Integrated marketing communications
develops promotions from the consumer's perspective, creating
unified, coordinated messages and delivery systems based on
information derived from past purchase patterns.  IMC calls for
managing promotion types together, so that all promotions are
unified.  Because the promotions speak with one voice, they can
have greater impact and break through the promotions clutter. 
Traditional promotion is more likely to be designed from the
inside out, from the marketer's perspective.  All promotion types
are not necessarily used or integrated, nor do they always
deliver a unified message.</i>

<p>6.  How is consumer insight important to promotions?   <i>Like all
marketing activities, promotion must be based on knowledge about
consumers, their needs, preferences, and purchase behaviors. 
Consumer insight should be the basis on which relevant messages
are developed, attractive incentives are offered, and appropriate
promotion channels (media) are selected.</i>

<p>7.  What are some of the promotion decisions that marketers must
make?   <i>Marketers must make decisions about which promotions to
use, whether individually or together.  Promotion decisions are
designed to determine how to use promotions to get consumers from
awareness to action.  Decisions are made about when to promote,
how to promote, how much to promote, and for how long.</i>

<p>8.  Identify the types of promotions in the promotion mix. <i>The
promotion types typically identified as elements in the promotion
mix are advertising, sales promotions, personal selling, public
relations/publicity and direct marketing.</i>

<p>9.  What are the steps in promotion planning? <i>Promotion generally
proceeds through several steps, some of which may occur
concurrently.  They include identifying promotion goals, making
promotion assignments, formulating promotion strategy,
identifying target audiences, developing the message, selecting
the promotion types, allocating the promotion budget,
implementing, evaluating and making modifications. </i>

<p>10. Discuss some of the criticisms and defenses of promotion.  
<i>Promotion calls attention to itself far more than the other
marketing mix elements.  It is criticized for costing too much
and adding to product prices; encouraging wasteful consumption;
exaggerating the truth; being deceptive; offending through
hostile competitive advertising; causing visual blight;
delivering misleading, tasteless, and toxic advertisements; and
invading consumers' privacy.  Promotion is defended because it
provides information that encourages competition which lowers
prices; supports a free press; provides employment for millions
of people worldwide; and contributes public service time and
space.  </i>
<br>

<h3>CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING</h3>

<h4>Check Your Understanding 11.1 </h4>

<p>1.  Describe the role of promotion in marketing.  <i>Promotion is
persuasive, purposive marketing communication about products. 
Promotion informs, persuades, reminds, and even entertains
consumers.  Promotion can differentiate a product from its
competition.  Promotion contributes to sales and revenues through
these processes.</i>

<p>2.  What is relationship marketing?  Why is it important? 
<i>Relationship marketing calls for establishing a long term,
mutually beneficial relationship with consumers.  It is important
because it builds consumer loyalty, encourages repurchases, and
provides opportunities for cross selling.  Because a relationship
is based on consumer insight and understanding, it enables the
marketer to provide products and offers designed to benefit
consumers.</i>
 
<p>3.  Explain how integrated marketing communication differs from
traditional promotion activities.  How are they alike? 
<i>Integrated marketing communications (IMC) and traditional
promotional activities use the same promotion types (advertising,
personal selling, sales promotions, public relations/publicity,
and direct marketing).  However, IMC uses many promotion types in
an integrated, coordinated, unified way to develop messages and
incentives using a database of consumer purchase behaviors. IMC
is developed from the consumer's perspective.  Traditional
promotions are developed from the marketer's perspective, do not
necessarily use more than one promotion type, and are not
necessarily integrated, coordinated, and unified.</i>

<h4>Check Your Understanding 12.2 </h4>

<p>1.  Can good promotion save a bad product?  Can bad promotion
kill a good product?  Explain.  <i>The best promotion cannot save a
truly bad product, because consumers will act in their self-interest and not repurchase.  They may be fooled once, but rarely
twice.  Bad promotion can kill a good product because it will
fail to give consumers information about the product's benefits,
will not build awareness or persuade consumers about the
product's value.  If consumers don't purchase the product, it
will eventually be removed from the market.</i>

<p>2.  What is the hierarchy of effects model?  Does it always
accurately describe consumer responses to promotions?
<i>This model suggests that promotions, particularly mass
advertising, move consumers through a series of steps that climax
with exchange.  These steps are awareness, knowledge, liking,
preference, conviction, and purchase.  It doesn't always
accurately describe consumer responses, because it is a high
involvement model.  Also, not all consumers will be moved to act. 
However, it does offer insights into what happens when consumers
respond to promotions for mass market, highly involving products.</i>

<p>3.  Explain some of the ways that consumers control promotions.
<i>Consumers control promotions using many different methods, some
of which are more effective than others.  Consumers control
promotions because they selective perceive them, consciously or
unconsciously screening out some promotions while attending to
others.  Consumers also control promotions to the extent that
they refuse to purchase products whose promotions irritate or
offend them.  When sales and revenues fall, or complaints rise
because of a widespread reaction to offensive promotions,
marketers often respond by removing or replacing the offending
promotion.  Consumers can control direct mail messages by having
their names taken off direct mail lists.  They can screen out
telephone sales calls by using call screening.  Consumers use
remote controls to change television channels and avoid
advertisements.</i>

<h4>Check Your Understanding 12.3 </h4>

<p>1.  Why is planning an important part of promotions?  <i>A promotion
plan is a blueprint for action for promotions.  It lays out a
roadmap for promotions, from goals to outcomes, and causes the
planners to consider what must be done to accomplish the
promotion goals.  Planning can help marketers avoid costly
mistakes and take advantage of opportunities when they appear. </i>

<p>2.  Describe the steps in promotion planning.  <i>Promotion planning
requires such steps as identifying promotion goals, making
promotion assignments, formulating promotion strategy,
identifying target audiences, developing the message, selecting
the promotion types, allocating the budget, and implementing,
evaluating, and making modifications to the promotions, as
needed.</i>
            
<p>3.  Compare and contrast several promotion budgeting methods.
<i>There are many promotion budgeting methods, including percentage
of sales, competitive parity, all that's left, seat of the pants,
objective and task, and using computer-based statistical models.</i>

<h4>Check Your Understanding 12.4</h4>

<p>1.  What are some of the criticisms of promotion? <i>Promotion is
criticized for many reasons, including such things as its costs,
untruthfulness and deception, encouragement of conspicuous
consumption, scams, hostile competitive advertising, visual
blight, and tasteless, misleading, and toxic advertising.  There
also are growing concerns about promotion and the invasion of
consumer privacy.</i>

<p>2.  What are some of the positive things associated with
promotion?  <i>Promotion informs consumers about products, which
reduces prices.  Promotion encourages competition and the
effective operation of the free market.  Promotion supports a
free press and provides free time and space for public service
announcements.  It provides employment for millions worldwide.</i>

<p>3.  Describe some of the controls on promotion. <i>Promotion is
monitored and regulated by government, laws, and self-regulation
through professional groups.</i>


<h3>MINI-CASES</h3>
                                
<h4>Mini-Case 12.1: Promoting Through Sports Sponsorships             </h4>
   
<p>    Sports sponsorships extend from professional sports
sponsorships and the Olympics to your local soccer or baseball
leagues.  Some sports would find it difficult to survive without
sponsors.  Your students may have experience with sports
sponsorships, because their business is a sponsor or they are on
a sponsored team.  Ask about the pros and cons of sports
sponsorships, from their own perspective and that of the business
sponsor.  How do they feel about Philips Electronics' Ten
Commandments of Sponsorship?  Do all the statements apply at the
local level?  

<p>1.  Is sports sponsorship a good idea for every business?  <i>It is
a good idea for many businesses.  There will always be
exceptions, however, and a business must decide whether or not
sponsorships in general, and a specific team sponsorship is an
appropriate activity.</i>

<p>2.  The Gay Games IV, which were held in New York City, involved
11,000 athletes, had over a half million out-of-town spectators,
and pumped over $100 million into the New York City economy.  In
the United States, there are estimated to be 13 to 14 million
adults who identify themselves as gay or lesbian.  As a group,
they are well educated with higher disposable incomes than
straight consumers; gay consumers are five times more likely to
earn over $100,000 a year.  The next Gay Games will be held in
Amsterdam in 1998.  What are the benefits/costs of being a
business sponsor for the Gay Games?  <i>The benefits for many
businesses come from reaching a desirable target market.  The
costs, in addition to the sponsorship, come from the business
being associated with an activity that bothers some consumers and
raises strong opposition in others. </i>

<p>3.  Was 1994 World Cup sponsorship a good promotion idea? <i>It
certainly promoted sponsors worldwide more effectively than in
the United States, where professional soccer remains relatively
unsupported.  Soccer is the number one sport in the world, but
not in the United States.</i>


<h4>Mini-Case 12.2  Wilma!  A Blowout Of Promotions</h4>

<p>     What do your students think about movie promotions?  <i>Perform
a simple class survey to determine how many have made a recent
purchase decision based on their desire to take advantage of a 
sales promotion linked to a popular movie.  For example, students
with young children may have chosen one fast food restaurant over
another because of a special sales promotion that appealed to
their children.  If this is the case, would it indicate that the
sales promotion has been effective?  </i>

<p>1.  Some members of the film industry are very critical of movies
being reedited for marketing promotion purposes.  How do you feel
about it?  <i>Answers will vary, however, many students will
probably express resentment for the intrusion of marketing into
film decisions.  Others won't find it offensive, as long as they
enjoyed the movie.</i>

<p>2.  Have movie sales promotions and product placements and
product placements become intrusive or are they effective ways to
sell products?  <i>Again, student answers will vary.  Some product
placements are more offensive than others, particularly when the
placement is inappropriate, intrusive, or detracts from the film. 
Other students may believe that having contemporary brands in
contemporary films adds a touch of reality.</i>

<p>3.  Can sales promotions like Barq's and Marlboro's build the
brand?  <i>Many believe that a successful sales promotion can
contribute to brand building; others believe that sales
promotions destroy brand loyalty.  It depends on the brand, the
promotion, and the competition.  This is still a controversial
issue.</i>
                                
<h3>WHAT DO YOU THINK?</h3>

<p>     U.S. tobacco companies carefully monitor the environment for
changes that affect them, which in the case of Canada, means
support for a ban on all tobacco advertising.  Tobacco use in the
United States has declined significantly in the latter part of
the 20th century.  However, tobacco remains a highly
controversial topic with many different facets fueling public
debate, from health aspects to tobacco subsidies.  Students, like
most consumers generally, probably have strong opinions about
tobacco use and marketing.  Students can debate the pros and cons
of tobacco advertising and sponsorships.  Because of the
continuing controversy, students will find many current articles
about tobacco marketing that can be used to develop debate
topics.

<h2><a name="internet">USING THE INTERNET</a></h2>

<p>     Please verify all Internet addresses and confirm the
feasibility of an Internet assignment <b>before</b> you make it.  No
Internet address or information can be guaranteed past the date
of this <b><i>Manual's</b></i> publication.  Be sure to insist that students
demonstrate responsible conduct on the Internet at all times.   

<h3>Internet Assignments</h3>

<p>     A search using any of the tools previously identified
reveals many useful documents that students can use to search for
more information about marketing promotions.  For example, the
following queries on WebCrawler (tm) uncovered interesting and
varied links to related topics.  These include

<ul>
<li>advertising (over 2,800 documents)
<li>public relations (over 1,500 documents)
<li>sales promotions (over 270 documents)
<li>coupons (over 70 documents)
</ul>

<p>     Students can evaluate statements by various professional and
business organizations about promotion ethics and acceptable
behaviors by visiting the Web sites for the American Marketing
Association, American Association of Advertising Agencies, and
Council of Better Business Bureaus.  At the Council of Better
Business Bureaus, students can learn about the services offered
by the Bureaus, including advertising self-regulation,
marketplace complaints, and scam alerts.  A directory of all BBB

<h3>MARKETING APPLICATIONS</h3>


<h4>MARKETING APPLICATION 12.1</h4>

<p>     Personal clutter audits will doubtlessly uncover many
promotion contacts with obvious sources, such as television,
radio, and newspapers.  However, by directing students to focus
on promotion clutter, they will become more aware of it and the
variety of clutter sources.  This illustrates the power of
selective perception because most consumers must be selective in
what they attend or risk serious sensory overload.  Develop a
class clutter audit by asking students to contribute to a class
list of clutter types and their sources.  Consider how consumers
defend themselves against clutter yet tune in to promotions that
are important and involving.


<h4>MARKETING APPLICATION 12.2</h4>

<p>     When it comes to promotions that cut through the clutter,
consumers often disagree about which promotions are successful at
cutting through the clutter and the reason why.  This reflects
individual involvement and perception, although segments of
consumers will share both.  A lively class discussion can develop
over why certain promotions are so good at cutting through the
clutter, and others fail.  While some students may think a
particular advertisement or sales promotion is extremely
effective, others will think it boring, stupid, or insulting, as
well as ineffective.  Without fail, over the past several years,
the Energizer Bunny has surfaced as one of my students' most
hated or most liked advertisements (print and television); it
cuts through the clutter because it is so unfunny or funny, take
your pick!  


<h4>MARKETING APPLICATION 12.3</h4>

<p>     A simply class survey of how consumers perceive advertising
in relation to promotions will most likely demonstrate the
inability of consumers to differentiate between the two, and
their lack of concern about it.  There is a similar inability to
distinguish between marketing and selling.  Students can consider
whether or not this is a problem, either for consumers or
marketers.  The blurring of marketing and selling is more serious
than that of advertising and promotions, principally because it
reflects a failure to recognize the importance of marketing
activities other than selling.  An added problem is that many
consumers lack respect for selling, which spreads to marketing in
general if the two are equated.


<h4>MARKETING APPLICATION 12.4 </h4>

<p>     Small student teams can consider this Application, develop
their promotion tactics, then report them in memo and/or oral
form.  Each team can consider a different client, the florist,
candy store, or diet center.  If several teams consider the same
client, have them develop a consensus program that can be
reported to the class.


<h4>MARKETING APPLICATION 12.5</h4>

<p>     Student opinions about celebrities in this Application
usually are surprisingly consistent.  Students often agree about
what characteristics contribute to an effective spokesperson and
they often name the same celebrities.  For example, a celebrity
spokesperson for home repair tools is often identified with a
popular television situation comedy that involves tools; home
exercise equipment is identified with a successful female
exercise video celebrity.  Try the flip side of this Application. 
Ask students to identify the celebrity who would be the least
credible and effective.  Have them examine the basis for their
selections.


<h3>CONSUMER INSIGHTS AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETING</h3>


<h4>CONSUMER INSIGHT 12.1</h4>

<p>     Do your students use advertising circulars?  What types of
circulars are most used?  The answer depends on many factors,
such as consumer age, financial condition, purchase situation,
and timing.  One type of advertising circular that is extremely
popular is the supermarket circular that identifies weekly
specials and often provides product discount coupons.  You'll
often see consumers with circulars in their hands as they walk 
supermarket aisles.  What value is the circular to consumers who
use it?   Other popular circulars arrive in time for back-to-school sales and around Christmas.  Can your students identify
other popular seasonal circulars?


<h4>CONSUMER INSIGHT 12.2</h4>

<p>     Ask students to bring to class representative samples of
direct mail they have received recently.  Evaluate these samples
for their compliance with the writing tips offered in this
Consumer Insight.  How do they compare?  How effective are these
samples for promoting a purchase? 


<h4>INTERNATIONAL MARKETING REPORT</h4>

<p>     If you have international students in class, they may be
interested in sharing their observations about how different
cultures influence promotions and particularly, mass advertising. 
Students from Europe can contrast advertising in their country
with the United States and if possible, with advertising in other
countries in the European Union.  Even though many observers
believe that Europe is moving toward greater economic
integration, cultural integration is far slower.  As a result,
products with few cultural implications may benefit from
standardized promotions, while culturally associated products may
not.</p>

<title>CHAPTER 10: PLACE: THE ROLE OF RETAILING</title>
</head>

<h1><center>CHAPTER 10</h1>
<h1>THE ROLE OF RETAILING</h1>
</center>

<h2>CHAPTER ABSTRACT</h2>

<p><b>1. Describe the evolution of retailing in the United States.  </b>The
earliest retailers were general merchandisers, stores offering
products of many different unrelated lines in a scrambled
merchandise strategy.  Specialty stores evolved as alternatives
to general stores offering a limited line but greater depth of
products.  Contemporary scrambled merchandise stores are often
extremely large, with considerable width and depth.  Retailing is
a dynamic activity that continues to change because of intense
competition, the volatility of consumer demands, and changes in
the environment.  Several theories of retail development try to
explain why and how retailers change.  These include the wheel of
retailing and accordion theories.  The development of many new
retail types illustrates how retailers are trying to satisfy
consumer demands for alternative shopping arrangements.  These
new types include such forms as outlet malls, superstores,
warehouse clubs, hypermarkets, and resale shops.


<p><b>2. Explain the contribution of retailing to the U.S. economy. 
</b>Retailing is an important part of the U.S. economy.  It is
relatively easy to become a retailer, but many retailers fail.  
Retailers in the United States generate over $2 trillion in
annual sales and provide almost 20 million jobs.  Retailing as a
whole is expected to grow slowly into the next century. 
Retailers are categorized by the U.S. government as durable goods
stores, nondurable goods stores, and nonstore retailers.


<p><b>3. Identify the retailer's tasks and the decisions they make. </b>
Regardless of retail type, retail tasks are similar to those that
were performed in the general store.  They include buying,
selling and leasing products; communicating information about 
products, their prices, and where they can be obtained; and
negotiating product exchanges with consumers.  Because of the
intense competition among retailers, they often must change in
order to survive.  Retailers must make long-range strategic
decisions, as well as short-range tactical decisions.  One of the
most important decisions retailers make is that of location.


<p><b>4. Recognize some of the common ways of classifying retailers. </b>
Many different retailers typically operate in any geographical
area.  They range in size and product assortment, as well as
along other attributes.  One important attribute is that of store
atmospherics, the tangible and intangible elements that
communicate to consumers what the store is like and the type of
products it sells.  Store image is how consumers mentally
perceive the store.  Pricing philosophy signals consumers about
the retailer's prices.  Service level and form of ownership are
other important factors that provide useful information to
consumers, as well as competitors.


<p><b>5. Discuss the future of retailing.  </b>Some marketers wonder
whether or not there is a future for store retailers.  While
store retailing is very volatile and certainly will change in the
next century, it is extremely doubtful that stores will
disappear.  While store retailing has its ups and downs, nonstore
retailing is thriving.  Many consumers prefer direct selling
because they can make their purchases from home, which saves
time, energy, and expense.

<h2><a name="teaching tips">SOME TEACHING TIPS</a></h2>

<p>     The discussion of the place marketing mix variable begins
with retailing rather than with a broader presentation of the
channel of distribution.  This placement of topics is consistent
with the premise of the textbook, namely that learning about
marketing can be made easier and more relevant if it is
personalized.  Since students will have far greater familiarity
with retailing than with the other distribution activities, as
consumers and possibly employees, retailing is introduced first.  
     
<p>     Chapter 10 poses a question that is troubling to many store
retailers, "How will retailing change as more consumers gain the
ability to shop from home through the electronic marriage of
television, computers, and telephones?"  What do your students
think about shopping?  Do they enjoy it or is shopping a
burdensome chore?  Poll students to determine their feelings
about retailing and whether or not they use nonstore retailers. 
If they do, for what product types?  Their observations and the
class discussion can be used to gain insight into consumer
responses to retailing. 

<p><b>Most U.S. Retailers Try To Satisfy Consumers</b>

<p>     Retailing in the United States is highly consumer oriented,
to a great extent because of the intense competition retailers
face from store and nonstore retailers alike.  For example, a
growing number of local retail banks are opening Saturday
mornings and early weekday evenings; bank branches are springing
up in supermarkets and shopping malls.  Bank retailers deal with
an increasingly competitive environment as they vie for customers
with rival store banks, banking by mail, and electronic banking
on the Internet.  As a result, retail banks are making a greater
effort to be open at the hours consumers want, where consumers
shop, delivering services that consumers expect.  

<p>     Many Wal-Marts are open 24 hours a day, as are supermarkets
and gasoline stations.  Often these retailers bundle their
products with others, for example many Ashland Oil gasoline
stations now house Taco Bell restaurants; Wendy's and Baskin
Robbins are joining forces in some locations under a single roof;
many Wal-Marts also house a McDonald's franchise.  A growing
number of supermarkets are carving out prime store space for
retail bank branches.  Students may be able to add to the list of
retailers bundling under one roof.  Are these retailers in the
forefront of a movement toward micromalls, miniature versions of
large shopping malls conveniently housed under one roof,
available in locations that consumers prefer?  Are there some
retailers who shouldn't bundle because their products and target
markets are incompatible?  Can students identify some retailers
who they believe would gain customers if they bundled?  What
retailers other than fast food franchises might attract consumers
to gasoline stations located beside major interstate highways? 
Could a micromall concept turn some consumers away instead of
attract them?  Why?

<p>     Sears, Roebuck & Co. is taking a different approach, yet
also seeking an alternative to large shopping malls.  As the
number of shoppers at malls has declined since 1990, Sears has
mounted an aggressive effort to establish a presence off the
malls (Chandler 1995).  Sears set a goal for 1995 of opening 50
new freestanding Sears Hardware Stores in urban areas and small
towns, at strip malls and commercial strips.  By the turn of the
century, Sears plans to have 500 hardware stores and 250 of its
Homelife furniture and mattress stores open across the country. 
By 2000, it will have opened 800 independently owned rural
stores.  

<p>     What are some of the other ways that retailers seek to
establish a competitive advantage over their competitors in
pleasing consumers?  Will Sears be able to withstand the
established competition in hardware and furniture?  Students can
discuss these questions and compile a list from their own
experiences and observations of what contemporary retailers are
doing to satisfy consumers.

<p>     While service is a key competitive approach in the United
States, this is not always the case in other countries.  Germany
is notorious for bad customer service in everything from Deutsche
Telekom AG, the national telephone monopoly, to stores and
restaurants.  For example, stores close Saturday afternoon and
don't reopen until Monday morning, many German restaurants won't
accept credit cards, and some consumers must wait years for
Telekom to install their telephone (Steinmetz 1995).  Why do
German consumers put up with the situation?  Many believe it is
because they don't know any better.  How long can this retailer
insensitivity to consumers continue?  Ask your students what will
change it?

<p><b>Relationship Marketing And The Life Time Value Of A Customer</b>

<p>     Retailers, like other marketers, want to keep their good
customers because they recognize the life time value of a
customer and the high cost of finding new customers.  Brand
loyalty extends to retailers as well as products like colas and
automobiles.  Many retailers are implementing programs to ensure
that enduring relationships are established with important
customers.  They collect names and addresses of their best
customers, develop in-house computer lists, and work these lists. 
Retailers make regular mailings to list members, notifying them
about special sales for preferred customers, providing
information about new products, and sometimes letting special
customers know when new items in their favorite product lines
have been received.  Frequent contact is one of the keys to
building a long term, profitable retailer-customer relationship.

<p>     In retail banking, relationship marketing has a long history
as a key tactic in holding and expanding a good customer base. 
Since much of retail banking relies on personal selling, bank
salespeople can establish lasting personal relationships with
important accounts and cross-sell them other bank services.  For
example, a consumer comes to a bank to open a checking account. 
That one service can be expanded through effective relationship
marketing to include selling a safety deposit box, savings
account, money market account, home mortgage, escrow and home
equity accounts.  In the near future, banks will probably also be
able to offer their customers a brokerage account for stocks and
bonds.  Through successful relationship marketing, banks and
other retailers can add value to the customer's retail
experience, strengthen the ties that bind retailers and
consumers, and develop a life time exchange relationship.

<p>     Relationship marketing depends on collecting usable
information about consumers and using a well-trained salesforce
armed with that information to cater to customer needs.  However,
what the retailer considers catering may seem to some consumers
as an invasion of their privacy.  This raises a troubling
question about how far marketers should go in collecting consumer
information.  If consumers perceive that retailers have gone too
far, they will react.  An incident was reported recently where a
consumer unexpectedly received a postcard from a store announcing
a shirt sale.  This was the same store where the consumer had
purchased a shirt by credit card the previous week.  The
consumer, upset that the store had used an independent company to
track his address from his credit card number, vowed to never
shop the store again (Silverman 1995).  

<p>     Savvy retailers train their salespeople to be sensitive to
consumers and not press for information if consumers seem
reluctant.  Students have probably encountered situations where
they have been asked for information and been uncomfortable.  Did
the salesperson back off or were they pressed to provide the
information?  How can a retailer collect information that is
needed in establishing a relationship with customers and not
scare the customer off?

<p>     Students should not be left with the impression that only
large retailers collect information about consumers.  More small
and large retailers are taking advantage of cheap personal
computers to set up information tracking systems.  Small mail
order operations track customer orders by computers, just like
giants Sharper Image and L.L. Bean.  A five store bagel retailer
has developed a customer comment database built on a word
processing program's database capacity.  It is used to track
feedback, complaints, and suggestions.  Information in the
database has even led to personalized service for one customer
who repeatedly complained that the store's bagels weren't salty
enough.  With a day's notice, this customer gets a specially
baked batch of extra salty bagels (deJong 1995).

<p><b>U.S. Catalog Sales Booming In Japan</b>

<p>     While the Yen has strengthened against the dollar, U.S.
catalog retailers have experienced a boom in sales to Japanese
consumers.  Direct marketers have a clear shot into Japanese
homes, avoiding the distribution problems that have plagued other
U.S. marketers of products such as automobiles and photographic
film.  Catalog retailers in the United States maintain 24-hour
toll-free telephones and fax lines to accommodate different time
zones.  They can deliver overseas orders quickly.  To the
Japanese, U.S. catalog retailers are almost always cheaper than
store retailers in Japan.  U.S. catalog retailers avoid Japanese
tariffs on imported goods and can take advantage of counter
cyclical demand patterns.  For example, back-to-school shopping
occurs in the United States in August and September; in Japan, it
occurs in March (Updike and Kuntz 1995).  Some of the catalog
retailers successfully cracking the Japanese retail market are
L.L. Bean, Lands' End, Eddie Bauer, and the Franklin Mint.  Most
offer consumers Yen-denominated, Japanese language catalogs.

<h2><a name="outline">CHAPTER OUTLINE</a></h2>

I.   Describe the evolution of retailing in the United States
<ol>

<li>Retailing includes a wide range of marketing activities
          designed to present products to consumers for them to
          purchase in stores as well as through nonstore mediums
<ul>
<li>The roots of modern retailing go back to the late
               1700s and early 1800s when general stores offered
               a scrambled merchandise assortment of products to
               consumers
<li>Specialty stores evolved as a retail alternative
               that offered a limited line, but many choices
               within the line
<li>Today, many different types of retailers coexist
               and profit in the same town
</ul>
<li>Retailing is a highly dynamic marketing activity that
          continues to change because of intense competition, the
          volatility of consumer demands, and changes in its
          environments
<ul>
<li>The wheel of retailing is a theory of retail
               development that suggests that as retailers
               prosper, they tend to trade up, grow larger, and
               become higher priced competitors
<li>Other theories explain retail change as a response
               to competitive pressure, or as a cyclical series
               of reactions to opportunities
</ul>
<li>Retailing has changed dramatically, which has resulted
          in the appearance of many new types, including such
          retailers as outlet malls, superstores, warehouse
          clubs, hypermarkets, and resale shops
</ol>

II.  Explain the contribution of retailing to the U.S. economy
<ol>

<li>It is extremely easy to become a retailer, but the rate
          of failure is high
<li>Retailing is big business in the United States, with
          payrolls of over $247 billion annually and almost 20
          million jobs
</ol>

III. Identify the retailer's tasks and the decisions they make
<ol>

<li>Retailers perform marketing activities related to the
          exchange function, this means that retailers must
<ul>
<li>Obtain a desirable assortment of products to offer
               consumers
<li>Inform consumers that the products are available
<li>Ensure that their location is appropriate, safe,
               and convenient
<li>Make products available at convenient times
<li>Take delivery of the products ordered, unpack,
               label, and display them
<li>Make payment arrangements and inform customers
               about them
<li>Sometimes offer associated delivery services
<li>Hire, train, and supervise retail employees
<li>Offer additional services as needed and/or desired
</ul>
<li>Retailers make long-range strategic decisions, as well
          as short-range tactical decisions
<li>Some people believe that the most critical decision a
          retailer makes is about location
</ol>

IV.  Recognize some of the common ways of classifying retailers
<ol>
<li>Many different retailers compete in the same area
<li>Retailers are characterized by their attributes
<ul>
<li>Store atmospherics are a very important attribute
               that communicates information to consumers about
               the retailer and the products it sells 
<li>Store image is the mental perception consumers
               have of a retailer
<li>Product assortment, pricing philosophy, and
               service levels also characterize retailers
</ul>
<li>Ownership form is less important to consumers than it
          is to retailers
</ol>

V.   Discuss the future of retailing
<ol>
<li>in the United States and other industrialized
          countries faces many challenges
<li>Some wonder whether or not there is a future for store
          retailers
<li>The future for nonstore retailers looks bright
<ul>
<li>Direct selling is growing in popularity, as
               products are brought directly to the consumers
               home
<li>Direct response marketing uses various approaches
               to interact with consumers through such devices as
               mail orders, telemarketing, catalogs, direct
               response advertising, and the Internet
</ul>
</ol>

<h2><a name="questions">SUGGESTED ANSWERS TO CHAPTER QUESTIONS</a></h2>

<h3>DISCUSSION QUESTIONS</h3>

<p>1.  What was retailing like in the early days of this country?  
<i>Retailing was primarily in general stores, which had scrambled
merchandise strategies, and in specialty stores, which
concentrated on a limited line but at a greater depth.        </i>

<p>2.  Describe some of the new retail types. <i>Retailing is
constantly changing, therefore many new retail types have evolved
recently.  These include outlet malls, superstores, discounters,
supermarkets, warehouse clubs, hypermarkets, television shopping
networks, electronic retailers, interactive kiosks, and resale
shops.</i>

<p>3.  What is the significance of retailing for the U.S. economy?
<i>It contributes an annual payroll of over $247 billion and employs
almost 20 million people.  It is an important part of the U.S.
economy.  Retailing is expected to grow slowly into the next
century.</i>

<p>4.  Describe a retailer's tasks.  <i>Regardless of the type of
retailer, there are certain tasks that must be completed.  These
tasks are related to the exchange function of marketing.  This
includes buying, selling, and leasing products; communicating
information about the products, their prices, and where they can
be obtained; and negotiating product exchanges with consumers.</i>

<p>5.  Compare and contrast a general and a specialty retailer.  <i>A
general retailer offers many different products in many product
lines.  A specialty retailer focuses on a limited number of
related lines, but offers greater product depth.</i>

<p>6.  What is a category killer?  Explain the name, and give
examples.  <i>Category killers are extremely large retailers, such
as Home Depot and Toys R Us, that are so big that they can
overwhelm local competitors with their deep discounts and
extensive inventories.  They typically specialize in product
categories, like toys, office supplies, or home repair products.</i>

<p>7.  What factors are often used to classify retailers?  <i>Retailers
are classified by their product assortment, pricing philosophy,
service level, form of ownership, site, and such attributes as
store atmospherics.</i>

<p>8.  Explain what is meant by the term product assortment. <i>A
product assortment is the mix of products that a retailer offers
consumers.  This includes the number of product lines and their
width and depth.</i>

<p>9.  Compare and contrast the operations of store and nonstore
retailers. <i>Store retailers and nonstore retailers are alike in
many ways, except with a nonstore retailer, the consumer doesn't
have to leave home to shop.</i>

<p>10.  What kinds of retailers will be successful in the next
century?  Why?  <i>Indications are that nonstore retailers will be
highly successful in the next century.  However, this does not
mean the disappearance of store retailers.</i>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING</h3>

<h4>Check Your Understanding 10.1 </h4>

<p>1.  Describe how retailing has evolved in the United States. 
<i>General stores and specialty stores existed even in the earliest
history of the United States.  They exist today, with
considerable variations.</i>

<p>2.  Compare and contrast the retail strategies of scrambled
merchandising and specialty merchandising.  <i>Scrambled
merchandising is a general approach to retailing with many
different product lines offered to consumers, but usually in
limited assortments.  Specialty merchandising allows the retailer
to focus on one or several related product lines and offers
greater depth to consumers.</i>
            
<p>3.  Explain the wheel of retailing theory.  <i>This is a widely
known theory about the evolution of retail organizations.  The
wheel of retailing suggests that retailers change as they
prosper, grow larger, offer more services, stock a better quality
of products, and trade up.</i>


<h4>Check Your Understanding 10.2</h4>

<p>1.  Identify several new retailer types.  <i>Retailing is
continuously changing, which is reflected in the many new retail
types that are common today.  These types include outlet malls,
superstores, discounters, supermarkets, warehouse clubs,
hypermarkets, television home shopping networks, interactive
kiosks, and resale shops.</i>

<p>2.  What is a resale agent?  <i>A resale agent is a retailer who
accepts used products from sellers in order to resell them,
typically in a store.  Sometimes these products are accepted on
consignment, where the reseller does not take title to the
products, but instead acts as an agent for the seller, accepting
a commission when the products are sold.</i>

<p>3.  Explain the importance of retailing to the U.S. economy. 
<i>Retailing is very important to the U.S. economy because it
employs almost 20 million people and represents sales of over $ 2
trillion.  Retailing is expected to grow slowly into the next
century.</i>


<h4>Check Your Understanding 10.3 </h4>

<p>1.  Describe the types of tasks assumed by retailers. <i>Regardless
of the retailer type, all perform similar tasks related to the
exchange function of marketing.  This includes buying, selling,
and leasing products; communicating information about the
products, their prices, and where they can be obtained; and
negotiating product exchanges with consumers.</i>

<p>2.  Discuss the types of decisions made by retailers.  <i>Retailers
make many decisions, some are long-range strategic decisions,
others are short-range decisions.  Location is one of the most
important decisions a store retailer can make.</i>
 
<p>3.  Explain the importance of retail location decisions. 
<i>Location is a critically important decision because where a store
is located determines to a great extent the type of consumer who
will be drawn to shop there.  </i>


<h4>Check Your Understanding 10.4</h4>

<p>1.  What are store atmospherics?  <i>Why are they important and to
whom?  Store atmospherics are the tangible and intangible
attributes that communicate information about the store to
consumers.  They are important to consumers because they indicate
store type.  They also are important to the retailer, because
store atmospherics make a statement on behalf of the retailer
about the nature of his or her business. </i>

<p>2.  Describe the major ways of classifying retailers.  <i>Retailers
are classified by many different factors, including their product
mix, pricing philosophy, service level, ownership form, and site.</i>

<p>3.  What advantages might a retailer achieve by offering products
both in a store and through nonstore means? <i>This strategy, of
using both a store and nonstore approach, covers all bases.  By
mixing strategies, the retailer should appeal to different types
of consumers, both those that enjoy store shopping and consumers
who prefer to shop at home.</i>


<h4>Check Your Understanding 10.5</h4>

<p>1.  Compare and contrast the major forms of store retailers.
<i>Major forms of store retailers are general merchandise, mass
merchandise, and specialty merchandise groups.  The general
merchandise group includes department stores, variety and general
stores.  The mass merchandisers are the workhorses of modern
retailing.  They include such retailers as catalog stores,
warehouse clubs, discount stores, and supermarkets.  The
specialty merchandise group is made up of specialty retailers,
such as limited-line and single-line stores.</i>
 
<p>2.  Why do you think nonstore retailing is growing so fast? <i>There
are many reasons for the growth in popularity of nonstore
retailing.  Consumers and retailers both like the nonstore
alternative.  The consumer saves time and effort shopping a
nonstore retailer; the nonstore retailer saves the time and
expense of having to deal with other marketing intermediaries. </i>

<p>3.  Is vending machine shopping going to be popular with all
consumers?  Explain your answer.  <i>No form of retailing is going
to be popular with all consumers.  Some consumers will like this
alternative, because of its convenience; others will prefer store
retailers or other forms of nonstore retailing.</i>


<h3>MINI-CASES</h3>
                                
<h4>Mini-Case 10.1:  Wal-Mart: Small Retailers' Nightmare?   </h4>

<p>    Wal-Mart is a giant among mass merchandise discounters.  Most
consumers have heard of Wal-Mart; many have highly polarized
opinions about the world's largest retailer.  Wal-Mart Stores is
ranked the 4th largest Fortune 500 company in terms of sales and
revenues; the 12th largest in terms of profits.  Wal-Mart is
innovative and demanding of its suppliers.  Like many large
corporations, it has had its share of ups and downs.  The downs
include the embarrassment of being exposed for selling
merchandise labeled US-made that wasn't, and various lawsuits
charging unfair pricing practices.  Wal-Mart provides an
interesting topic for students to debate.  Information about Wal-Mart can be found on the Internet (see <a href="#internet">Using the Internet</a> in this
chapter), as well as in popular and business magazines and
journals. 

<p>1.  Should Wal-Mart be admired as a well-run corporation or
criticized for squeezing the life out of small town retailers? 
<i>Responses may vary, however, Wal-Mart is the largest and fastest
growing retailer in the United States and the largest retailer in
the world.  It deserves to be admired for the efficient way that
the corporation is managed and the high level of consumer
satisfaction it maintains.  However, many small town retailers
have not found a way to compete with Wal-Mart and as a result,
consumers' available retailer choices have been seriously reduced
in many communities.  Like most topics in marketing, there are
two sides and both have merit.</i>

<p>2.  What do you think of the "niche around" policy?  Will it
work?  <i>It has worked for many well-managed small businesses.  A
poorly managed business probably wouldn't survive long with or
without Wal-Mart.  The "niche around" policy recognizes the
opportunity presented by Wal-Mart's product depth gaps.  It makes
good marketing sense; however, the challenge is in successfully
implementing it.</i>

<p>3.  Is there room enough for both a Wal-Mart and small retailers
in the same town?  <i>Absolutely, as has been demonstrated in the
small towns where Wal-Mart has opened.  Many small businesses
thrive, despite and because of Wal-Mart.  After all, Wal-Mart is
a magnet for many consumers, attracting them to a shopping area
where they might not ordinarily visit.  Therefore, there is
always an opportunity for a small business to capitalize on this
influx of shoppers and capture some of the spillover.</i>


<h4>Mini-Case 10.2: Saving Sears:  A Retailing Challenge</h4>
 
<p>     Sears is definitely reinventing itself, but it is doing so
by returning to its original success, in retailing.  Sears is
returning to its core competencies and early signs indicate that
this is a smart move.  This is still a major company, ranked 33rd
by profits on the Fortune 500 list, and 9th by sales and
revenues.  Students can debate Sear's retailing strategy using
information found on the Internet (see <a href="#internet">Using the Internet</a> in this
chapter), as well as in popular magazines and business journals. 

<p>1.  How important is image to Sears?  <i>Image is extremely
important to Sears, because the image that consumers form of the
retailer will influence their shopping.  If consumers perceive
that Sears' image is compatible with what they want in a
retailer, then they will shop Sears.  Sears' problem is to decide
what image to project, up-scale or mid-scale, a tool store or a
fashionable but reasonably priced clothing store.</i>

<p>2.  What part does store atmospherics play in establishing a
store image?  <i>Store atmospherics contributes considerably to the
formation of image.  It includes the cues that consumers
interpret when forming a store image that will guide their
purchase decisions.</i>

<p>3.  J.C. Penney is challenging Sear's up-scale image remake in
both the United States and Mexico.  If these companies, as well
as other department stores like Dillard's, Saks Fifth Avenue, and
Bloomingdale's, are also entering the Mexican market, what do you
think are the chances that this market will also become
overbuilt?  <i>The Mexican economy is volatile and unstable, as
shown by the peso devaluation in early 1995.  There are
differences in shopping patterns between Americans and Mexicans,
and the Mexican middle class is vastly smaller than the middle
class in the United States.  Therefore, there are fewer consumers
with the purchasing power needed to shop these retailers.  These
retailers, and others who join them, will probably overestimate
the size of the Mexican market and there will be a shakeout as
some leave Mexico, at least temporarily.  A Wal-Mart might have
greater initial success in Mexico, at least in the short-term,
than up-scale retailers.</i>
                                
<h3>WHAT DO YOU THINK?</h3>

<p>     Supermarket slotting fees are highly controversial.  Some
manufacturers consider them extortion; most supermarket retailers
think they're a good source of added revenue.  What do your
students think?  Some have probably worked for a grocery store or
supermarket that charges slotting fees.  If possible, have them
share their insights with the class.  A comprehensive body of
articles exists about slotting fees.  It is a topic that usually
provokes student reactions and can be used for a class debate.

<h2><a name="internet">USING THE INTERNET</a></h2>
     
     Please verify all Internet addresses and confirm the
feasibility of an Internet assignment <b>before</b> you make it.  No
Internet address or information can be guaranteed past this
<b><i>Manual's</b></i> publication date.  Be sure to impress on your students
the importance of professional behavior on the Net, at all times.


<h3>Internet Assignments</h3>

<p>     Some major national retailers are already on the Internet;
others are making plans to join them.  Sometimes they have a dual
presence, both at a <b>corporate home page</b>, where information about
the company is presented, and as a <b>Net store or catalog site</b>,
where products can be evaluated and purchased.  Some of the
largest retailers in the country, by annual profits and
sales/revenues, are listed below.  As of the publication date of
this <b><i>Manual</b></i>, the retailers marked with an asterisk (*) were on
the Internet.  The search query for a retailer on the Net is
provided beside the company name.

<ul>
<li>Wal-Mart Stores*         - search: Wal-Mart Stores
<li>Sears Roebuck & Co.*     - search: Sear's Tools
<li>McDonald's
<li>J.C. Penney*             - search: J.C. Penney
<li>Toys R Us
<li>Dayton Hudson*           - search: Target Stores
<li>KMart
<li>Spiegel*                 - search: Cybermart - Spiegel
<li>Service Merchandise*     - search: Service Merchandise
</ul>

<p>     Two-person student teams or small groups of students can
select a retailer, then use their Internet search skills to
identify paths to information about the retailers, corporate home
pages and Net store sites, as well as business references on
retailers.  A corporate home page often will have links to the
retailer's Net store or Net catalog.  Sometimes these store sites
are located within Net malls.  The results of their research can
be communicated in a written memo and/or a brief report to the
class.

<p>     J.C. Penney, Sears & Roebuck Co., and Wal-Mart Stores are 
examples of major national retailers on the Internet.  They can
be located in several different ways.  


<p>1.   J.C. Penney can be reached through a WebCrawler search query
     for J.C. Penney.  Enter the J.C. Penney Co. link.  This site
     has documents about the company, its mission, and
     shareholders information.  Penney's, along with other
     retailers, is also in the Yahoo site Business: Corporations:
     Retailers.

<br>     select  * Corporations
<br>     select  * Retailers     
</i>

<p>2.   Sears & Roebuck Co. can be found by using a WebCrawler
     search query for Sear's Tools.  The link is to the Shopping
     2000 mall home page directory.  The Sear's mall store lists
     Craftsman products, provides descriptions and contacts.

<p>3.   Wal-Mart Stores can be found through a WebCrawler search or
     by going directly to the Wal-Mart home page.  It is an
     extensive and well documented site with information about
     the company, career opportunities, store locations, and a
     current Wal-Mart circular with products and prices.

</i>


<p>     National retailers often can be located by running a query
through a search engine such as WebCrawler or the Global Network
Navigator, or by "trolling" for a Web site.  This requires
opening a URL and searching for a site by typing in your educated
guess about a company address.  For example, to troll for a
company named XYZ, you could try http://www.xyz.com  -- or -- 
http://xyz.com.

<p>     Alternately, students can search for business references
about retailers on the Internet.  For example, information about
retailers, as well as other businesses, can be located at the
site of the Fortune 500.  Links from this site can be searched
for business profiles of different companies.

<i>
<p><a href="http://webcrawler.com">http://webcrawler.com</a>
<br>search: Fortune 500
<br>select  Fortune 500
</i>


<p>     Specialty retailers also are flocking to the Internet. 
Their numbers and the variety of product assortments they offer
are growing daily.  Students can find an abundance of information
about retailers of specific product types by using Yahoo,
WebCrawler, and other search tools.  A recent search using the
query "retailers" identified 413 documents covering 21 computer
screens.  The types of retailers represented included on-line
book retailers, apparel retailers, general shopping malls,
automobile retailers, bicycle shops, travel malls, computer
hardware and software retailers, and various retailer home pages. 
A Yahoo search found specialty retailers along with large catalog
retailers, discounters, and others.

<p>     On-line shopping malls are springing up daily.  Some offer
single product lines; others are mixed, offering a scrambled
product assortment.  Mall shopping on-line is not the same as it
is in stores, although virtual electronic shopping approximates
walking down a mall, looking in store windows, and browsing store
shelves and displays.  

<p>     The Internet Mall is cleverly modeled after a multi-story
store shopping mall.  Automotive and related retailers are
located in the Space Garage.  Space floors one through six offer
such product lines as books, magazines, and media (1st floor),
computer hardware and software (3rd floor), clothes and sporting
goods (5th floor), and food and beverages in the Space Top Floor. 
This Mall is an exciting place to visit and provides a very
sophisticated example of on-line retailing.  It is a heavily
trafficked Internet site.

<i>
<p>The Internet Mall
<br><a href="http://www.mecklerweb.com">http://www.mecklerweb.com</a>
</i>

<p>     There are several advantages to retailers who establish
their presence on-line in a mall.  The costs are far less in a
mall than they would be to set up and maintain an independent Web
site.  If the mall is product line specific, for example a travel
mall, computer mall, or automotive mall, then it will draw
consumers specifically interested in those product lines.  If the
mall is registered with the major search engines, consumers will
use them to find directions to the mall and its retailers from
multiple starting points.  

<p>     There also are drawbacks to on-line malls.  On-line malls
are not like store malls where shoppers can browse and window
shop many stores, and a synergy is built between stores, food
courts, and movie theaters.  On-line malls don't have the same
kinds of attractions.  Few consumers wander Web malls like they
wander store malls.  If they are connected to the Internet by a
commercial service, they have to pay for on-line service, so
wandering an on-line mall can become expensive.  The second
problem relates to how they connect.  Net surfers with a text-only browser can browse a mall's stores more quickly, but they
can't receive graphics or product pictures.  Graphical browsers,
while they can see products visually, take much longer to receive
information and download pictures, particularly with the slow
modems that most consumers use (less than 14,400 baud).

<p>     Because commercial use of the Internet is so new, retailers
are still trying to figure out how to use it.  Although consumers
are just beginning to shop the Net, their numbers will surely
grow.  The consumers who currently Net shop are very desirable
target markets because they generally are younger and have 
higher educations, incomes, and buying power.  Some marketers
believe that for a Net mall to be successful, it must

<ul>
<li>offer quality information about its stores, products, and
     prices

<li>be accessible in a reasonable time frame so that consumers
     can download information without long waits

<li>offer some entertainment value, along with interesting links
     to other sites

<li>have a limited number of stores, avoiding the "overkill" of
     a megamall that is so large it discourages consumers from
     entering

<li>be registered on all of the search engines and as many other
     places as possible, including mentions in hardcopy print
     publications
</ul>


<p>     Students can visit and compare different Internet retail
malls.  This activity is most effective if assigned to two-person
student teams or small groups of students.  They should document
URL addresses so you have a record of their trips and can later
see for yourself what is at the malls.  The results of their
shopping trips can be reported in memo form as well as to the
class in a brief oral presentation.


<h4>Used Product Retailers On The Internet</h4>

<p>     Used product retailers are using the Internet to sell
everything from antiques to used books.  Searches can be run
using any of the following queries.  Students can compare the
results of a search of used product retailers (resellers) locally
(<b>Marketing Application</b> 10.2 on page 310 of the text) with used
product retailers on the Internet.

<ul>
<li>search:  used products
<li>search:  consignment sales
<li>search:  used cars
<li>search:  used furniture
<li>search:  used books
<li>search:  antiques
<li>search:  auctions
</ul>


<h4>Retailing Statistics</h4>

<p>     Students can research retailing statistics through the U.S.
Census Bureau, the source for retailing data in the textbook. 
They can study Table 1281 Retail Trade - Sales, by Kind of
Business, in the Statistical Abstract of the United States at the
Census Bureau site.  Information on small business retailers may
be found at the Small Business Administration site.

<h4>Retail Factors That Consumers Value</h4>

<p>     Ask students to review the retail factors listed in Figure
10.2 (page 317 of the text), then have them modify the items so
they are appropriate to Internet shopping.  For example, the time
factor on the Internet can indicate the time required to find the
retailer, locate a product, and download product information. 
The price factor on the Internet can be restated to include
whether or not prices are current, how easily they are found, and
what type of payment process is offered.  Any of the search
engines can be used to find products and retailers on the
Internet.


<h3>MARKETING APPLICATIONS</h3>


<h4>MARKETING APPLICATION 10.1</h4>

<p>     Students can perform a local retailer inventory using the
Yellow Pages Index of your telephone directory.  Alternately,
they can evaluate product offers from retailers in on-line malls
that offer the same products.  Have them consider whether or not
they would prefer shopping for the product in a store, a catalog,
or on-line.  What are the advantages and disadvantages of each?


<h4>MARKETING APPLICATION 10.2</h4>

<p>     Resale retailers of clothing, automobiles, furniture, and
other products are growing in popularity in many places around
the country.  Resale products are also offered on the Internet
(see <a href="#internet">Using the Internet in this chapter</a>).


<h4>MARKETING APPLICATION 10.3</h4>

<p>     Students can contrast store atmospherics of two retailers
for same product category by conducting careful on-site
observations.  If they compare a national retailer, the
probability is high that they will also be able to find that
retailer on the Internet.  This activity could be extended to
having students compare store and on-line atmospherics for the
same retailer.  However, this is best accomplished using a
graphical browser such as Mosaic or NetScape, since a text-only
browser will not provide the visual images needed to make the
comparisons.  At the least, students can address the issue of how
retailers can establish atmospherics over the Internet and help
consumers form a positive store image.


<h4>MARKETING APPLICATION 10.4 </h4>

<p>     In addition to polling the class for their retail
experience, your local American Marketing Association or other
professional group may be able to provide a guest speaker who can
address a retail topic.  Popular themes are employment
opportunities in retailing, trends in retailing, retail services,
and the future of retailing.  

<h3>CONSUMER INSIGHTS AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETING</h3>


<h4>CONSUMER INSIGHT 10.1</h4>

<p>     Time is a major factor for most consumers, which helps
explain why malls are losing shoppers.  It takes more time to
shop in a mall than in a free-standing retailer in a strip mall,
by catalog, or increasingly, on the Internet.  Malls suffer from
congested parking lots and consumer concerns about safety. 
Consumers often believe that prices are higher in malls because
retailers have to pay a steeper rent for their stores.  What
complaints do your students have about mall shopping?  Do they
visit malls for purposes other than shopping?  Can they forecast
changes in malls so that they become destinations in themselves,
as social and entertainment centers?


<h4>CONSUMER INSIGHT 10.2</h4>

<p>     Avon is a master retailer that uses a direct sales force to
establish a long term relationship with consumers.  Have any of
your students had experience with Avon, as a purchaser or an Avon
lady?  If so, ask them to share their observations about how this
giant retailer has used relationship marketing to its advantage. 
Do they believe that the use of catalogs and advertising will
dilute Avon's impact on consumers?  Will it affect the
salesforce?       


<h4>NTERNATIONAL MARKETING REPORT</h4>

<p>     American retailers are going abroad, and some foreign
retailers are highly successful in the United States.  Students
can investigate the progress being made by U.S. retailers.  Many
articles have appeared recently about U.S. retailers entering the
Mexican market, as well as markets in Europe and Japan.  If you
have international students in class, ask them to share their
observations of American retailers in the United States and in
their countries.  </p>

<title>CHAPTER 13: THE PROMOTION MIX: ADVERTISING, SALES PROMOTIONS, PERSONAL SELLING, PUBLIC RELATIONS, AND DIRECT MARKETING CHAPTER ABSTRACT</title>
</head>
<body background="/gifs/back/sandpapr.gif">
<h1><center>CHAPTER 13</h1>
<h1>THE PROMOTION MIX: ADVERTISING, SALES PROMOTIONS, PERSONAL SELLING, PUBLIC RELATIONS, AND DIRECT MARKETING CHAPTER ABSTRACT</h1>
</center>

<p><b>1. Describe the role of advertising in product promotion. </b>
Advertising is nonpersonal persuasive marketing communication,
mostly conveyed in the mass media and paid for by an identified
sponsor who controls the message.  Advertising informs,
persuades, reminds, and entertains.  It is used to build brand
image, establish goodwill, and convey public service
announcements.  Advertising is often classified by coverage
(local, national, international, global), task (commercial,
noncommercial, corporate, public service), media type (indirect
response, direct response), and consumer target (personal use,
business, organization).  Many new forms of advertising are
challenging the dominance of traditional mass advertising.  An
advantage of mass advertising is its relatively low cost in
reaching large numbers of consumers.  Advertising provides
information and image signals that help consumers position
competitive products.  Annual advertising spending worldwide is
almost $500 billion.  Advertising has been around since ancient
times.  The invention of the printing press (mid-1400s) and
advances in technology during the Industrial Revolution
contributed to the growth of advertising.  Advertising has become 
more sophisticated and widely used throughout the world in the
latter part of the 20th century.  The three parts of the
advertising triad are the advertiser (pays for it), the
advertising agency (makes it), and the media (delivers it). 
Advertising decisions involve budgeting, developing a creative
strategy, developing the media strategy, producing the
advertising, implementing and evaluating the results.


<p><b>2. Explain how sales promotions are used.  </b>A sales promotion adds
value through short-term inducements to take action, such as
purchase a product, move it through a channel of distribution,
build store traffic, and increase sales.  Sales promotions may be
directed at personal use consumers, business/organization
consumers, or both.  More is spent on sales promotions than on
advertising, almost half of a typical business's promotion
budget.  Sales promotions can rapidly generate revenue by
providing incentives that increase store traffic and sales.  Some
critics contend that sales promotions undermine brand loyalty by
making consumers more price sensitive.  Not-for-profit
organizations and governments also use sales promotions. 
Effective sales promotion requires planning, a clear statement of
objectives, careful choice of appropriate sales promotion
alternatives, and good timing.  Cents-off coupons are popular
personal use consumer sales promotions.  Others include contests,
free samples, rebates, discounts, and premium incentives.  


<p><b>3. Explain the promotion advantages of personal selling.  </b>Unlike
other forms of promotion, personal selling establishes a personal
link with consumers.  Before the development of modern
electronics and telecommunications, selling was principally a
face-to-face activity, often conducted door-to-door.  Today,
personal selling is performed face-to-face, on the telephone, and
by facsimile machine, computer, and the Internet.  The
salesperson is a boundary spanner, bridging the gap between
company and consumer.  Salespeople can establish an immediate and
personal contact with consumers, counter objections, overcome
sales resistance, and develop long term relationships that can
lead to many cross selling opportunities.  A drawback to personal
selling is its expense.  It is not used to reach a mass market. 
Over 20 million people are employed in some facet of sales in the
United States.  Advances in telecommunications allows a growing
number of industrial salespeople to work at home, linked to their
offices by computer, facsimile machine, and cellular telephone. 
The sales force is an important strategic tool because it
establishes a critical selling link with consumers and has
accessibility to important information about the environment that
can be transmitted back to the business.  There are many
different types of salespeople and selling tasks.  Sales force
management involves recruiting, selecting, hiring, training,
motivating, evaluating, and sometimes firing salespeople.  Every
sales force, even if it is only one person, must be managed. 
Sales force compensation is often a difficult management task
because it involves sensitive matters that affect people deeply. 
Because it is costly to replace salespeople, the business should
be motivated to sustain a consistent effort to field a well
trained, supported, motivated, and compensated sales force.


<p><b>4. Characterize public relations/publicity activities.  </b>Public
relations is the promotion type that establishes a communication
link between a business/organization and various publics. 
Publics are groups of people who have some interest or
involvement in what the business does.  Public relations works to
build and maintain goodwill and a positive image.  Sometimes
public relations opportunities develop unexpectedly; other times
they must be planned and carefully implemented.  While many
marketers believe that public relations and publicity are
interchangeable terms, others believe that there is a significant
difference between them.  One difference is that public relations
activities are paid for, often by an identified sponsor, whereas
publicity is not.  There are many different targets for public
relations activities including employees, stockholders, potential
investors, government, distributors, and consumers.  This type of
marketing is under intense scrutiny for what some members of the
public perceive as visible and overly aggressive attempts to put
a positive spin on sometimes negative events.  Publicity appears
in the mass media encoded by an intermediary sender such as an
editor, reporter, commentator, or other third party.  Therefore,
the original event or information about it risks being distorted. 



<p><b>5. Identify the advantages of direct marketing.  </b>Direct marketing
is the promotion mix element that makes extensive use of computer
databases and lists to direct mail and telephone offers to
consumer targets.  It gives immediate response measurement
capacity to the mass media through direct print and electronic
advertising, can personalize messages and offers, refine
targeting, and reduce the waste of contacting nonreceptive
audiences.  It is measurable, which gives it a distinct advantage
over traditional mass advertising.  The tools of direct marketing
are catalogs, letters, telemarketing, brochures, direct
advertising, direct mail, and other forms.  It is criticized for
contributing to the promotion clutter, but it also suffers
because of it.  It is often criticized for invading consumers'
privacy through the compilation and distribution of lists that
contain intimate details of consumers' financial situation,
personal lives, and purchasing habits.  The computer database is
the backbone of the direct marketing industry.  A list is a prime
set of names and addresses identified by specific characteristics
in a database, set into order, and compiled in a mail or
telephone contact list.  The best list is the in-house list,
compiled from the names of current or past customers.  Other
lists can be compiled by the business or are available from
commercial list brokers.  Direct mail is growing in popularity
among consumers.  Catalogs are very popular for both personal use
and business/organization consumers.  Telemarketing is often
called the most irritating form of direct marketing.

<h2><a name="teaching tips">SOME TEACHING TIPS</a></h2>

<p>     The chapter question asks, "Do most consumers think
marketing and promotion are synonymous?"  This question has been
asked in different forms throughout the text because it reflects
a serious problem with consumer perceptions about marketing. 
While people familiar with marketing recognize the breadth and
importance of marketing activities, to consumers and even some
businesses and organizations, marketing is just advertising or
selling.  Granted, these are two of the most visible marketing
activities, but they certainly are not the only ones. 

<p><b>Developing An Integrated Marketing Communications Strategy</b>

<p>     The chapter opens with a lengthy description of the
promotion decisions facing Alicia Hernandez.  Small student teams
can consider the promotion alternatives and decide on several
choices.  What does Alicia want promotion to do for her business? 
What is the best mix of promotion types that will serve Alicia's
objectives?  What is an optimal integrated marketing
communications strategy for Alicia?  What makes it an integrated
marketing communications strategy?    Why should Alicia keep an
eye on the competition as she launches her promotion campaign? 
What other environmental factors should Alicia also monitor?

<p>     What is a promotion campaign and how does it differ from an
integrated marketing communications campaign?  In this case,
Alicia will be using a variety of different promotions focused on
the same theme over a period of time.  Since her stores are not
open year round, when should she begin and end her promotions? 
Should she maintain contact with customers during the period when
her stores are closed?  If so, which customers?  If she decides
that it is important to maintain awareness of her stores even
during the months when they are closed, how can she do it?  How
could she make this "reminder" activity an integral part of her
promotion campaign?

<p>     Is Alicia practicing relationship marketing?  Does the
nature of her business encourage the formation of relationships
with consumers?  If so, what can Alicia do to ensure that her
sales force actively contributes to the establishment of
relationships?  Can she use relationship marketing to communicate
with consumers about the value that she adds to their shopping
experience?

<p><b>Using Print Advertisements To Illustrate Advertising Types</b>

<p>     Rather than ask students to collect examples of different
advertising types, collect your own samples and bring them to
class for students to analyze.  If you do this over several
terms, you can assemble a collection of print advertisements that
clearly represent the points you wish to emphasize. I have built
such a collection over several years and find it very useful in
illustrating key points about advertising.  Because the print
advertisements are distributed in class, I mount them on poster
board and protect them with clear plastic that can be purchased
in an art supply store or most discount retailers (Wal-Mart,
Kmart, Target).  Most sell clear Contac paper by the yard.  

<p>     In addition to illustrating local (retail), national
(brand), international, corporate (institutional), public
service, and other advertising types, point out examples of
primary demand and selective demand advertising.  For example, a
print advertisement for milk sponsored by the National Dairy
Council is an example of a primary demand advertisement designed
to promote the generic product, milk, not identify a brand. 
Contrast this with a print advertisement for Sealtest milk, a
manufacturer's brand.  Other examples include primary demand for
Columbian coffee and selective demand for Folger's; primary
demand for beef and selective demand for Laura's Lean Beef.

<p>     Your collection of print advertisements should also include
examples of advertising directed toward other businesses, as well
as professionals.  Industrial advertising for raw materials,
supplies, and component parts can be found in specialty business
publications for the various trades as well as in general
business publications, for example Business Week, Inc., Forbes,
and The Wall Street Journal.  Professional advertisements
directed to doctors, lawyers, accountants, and others can be
found in trade publications.  Agricultural products are
advertised in publications directed at growers and
agribusinesspeople.  It is important to show advertisements for
these target audiences because students are less apt to be
familiar with them.

<p>     In examining your print advertisements, ask students to
consider advertisement target audiences and their
characteristics.  The matching of media characteristics with
message strategy can be illustrated by contrasting print
advertisements for the same brand in publications with obviously
different readerships.  For example, select an advertisement from
Modern Maturity, then locate a print advertisement for the
identical brand in a magazine targeted at a broader aged
audience.  It is likely that differences will show up between the
advertisements in the ages of the models used, the background
setting, and the message.  What does this indicate about the
magazines' readership?  How do the advertisements reflect
readership differences?  

<p>     How has the changing role of women been reflected in
advertising?  Students can perform a content analysis of current
print advertisements to determine the breadth of roles portrayed. 
Some print advertisements also show how men have assumed greater
roles in child rearing and household management.  Is advertising
reflecting changes in society or does advertising promote
changes?  This debate of the role of advertising as a mirror or
as a leader raises serious questions about marketing as change
agent.  If advertising is a mirror, what is it reflecting?  Bring
some high fashion advertisements to class in order to illustrate
this point.  It should be very easy to find print advertisement
examples of emaciated female models, a young woman being menaced
by a man, and groups of mean looking teens.  

<p>     In analyzing international advertisements, contrast the
standardized versus customized approaches.  Standardized
advertising strategy requires using a global approach, where
there is virtually no difference in message regardless of the
country in which the advertisement appears.  This assumes great
consumer comparability and disregards consumer differences.  On
the other hand, the customized approach requires adapting
advertisements to local markets.  While some brands may strive
for standardization, some adaptation will still be required, if
only in language.  How can an international advertiser reduce the
necessity of having to translate advertisements into the
different languages for each country market served?  Why would it
be easier to standardize the advertising internationally for a
carbonated cola drink than for a nutritious tomato-based beverage
containing 6 essential minerals and 5 vitamins, that is low
sodium, non-fat, and high in dietary fiber?

<p>     If you have international students in your class, or
domestic students who have traveled internationally, ask them to
share their observations about advertising internationally.  Have
they noticed differences between domestic advertising for U.S.
brands and the advertising internationally for the same brands? 
Have they seen popular advertisements, particularly U.S.
television commercials, reshot with local celebrities in other
countries?  This is a very popular way to extend the life of a
successful commercial.  For example, a number of years ago, Coca-Cola aired a television commercial starring a professional
football player, "Mean" Joe Green.  The commercial begins by
showing Mean Joe limping off the field into the tunnel under the
stands that leads to the team dressing room.  A little boy
follows him and shouts his name.  Mean Joe turns around and in a
dramatic gesture of friendship and sympathy for his injury, the
little boy gives the football player his Coke.  Mean Joe thanks
him by giving the boy his team jersey.  The smile on the child's
face could light up the sky!  The identical commercial was reshot
in several countries in Latin and South America, using national
sports celebrities in place of the U.S. football player.  They
were very popular advertisements, as much for the universality of
the themes of friendship and sharing, as for the interplay
between a tough professional athlete and a little fan.

<p>     Print advertisements can also be used to illustrate an
undifferentiated marketing strategy.  Undifferentiated marketing
ignores differences in markets and among consumers on the
assumption that one product can be offered to the mass market and
enough consumers will accept the undifferentiated product offer
for it to be profitable.  In most cases the costs of
differentiating the product outweigh the probable benefits.  For
example, Henry Ford believed that the only product he had to
offer consumers was a reasonably priced black Ford automobile. 
His competitors quickly proved him wrong.  While some
undifferentiated products are profitable, the trend is toward
greater differentiation as exemplified in the mass customization
approach.  Even Coca-Cola, which at one time had no product
alternatives, now comes in diet, cherry, decaffeinated, and other
product variations.  Contrast differentiated and undifferentiated
marketing strategies through examples in print advertisements. 
Have students suggest product examples that are undifferentiated
and enlist their help in finding print advertisements to
illustrate this strategy.  

<p><b>Segmentation, Targeting, And Positioning Through Promotion   </b>

<p>     Remind students of the importance of segmentation,
targeting, and positioning to marketing.  If necessary, review
what they are and how they work together in marketing products. 
Print advertisements can be used to illustrate these activities. 
Marketing segmentation is dividing up the market into definable
groups.  Print advertisements can be differentiated most easily
by such demographic segments as age, sex, family life cycle
stage, and race.  Examples can be brought to class of such
segmentation bases.  The targeting requires selecting markets to
receive advertising messages.  Contrast the targeting strategies
of such women's magazines as Family Circle and Cosmopolitan, or
such men's magazines as GQ and Playboy.  Positioning is using
advertising and other marketing activities to help consumers
establish a mental image of a product or brand in their minds.
What is the image of identical products advertised in these
magazines?  How is advertising helping readers of these magazines
establish a product position?

<p><b>Television Commercial Appeals</b>
     
<p>     Television commercials promote products in many different
ways.  Some of the alternatives commonly used in delivering a
message are 

<ul>
<li>presenting the facts, using a rational approach to provide
     product information, also called a straight sell

<li>showing a slice of life, a mini-drama about the product as
     it is part of contemporary life

     dramatizing a situation where the product may emerge as a
     hero

<li>offering a testimonial, often a real person telling how the
     product benefitted him or her

<li>showing humor, a funny situation or play on words involving
     the product

<li>demonstrating the product, showing how it works and solves
     consumer problems

<li>using animated characters, puppets, clay figures or computer
     generated characters to draw attention to the product

<li>comparing products, a comparative advertisement that often
     names competitive brands

<li>developing a fantasy including the product 

<li>using a combination of methods
</ul>

<p>     Ask students to note these types, then bring in examples of
one or more television commercials that represent them.  For
example, Energizer Bunny commercials use an animated character
and humor; various automobile commercials use a slice-of-life
approach to show how the product is used for vacations, to take
children to school, or for romantic rides in the moonlight; long
distance telephone companies are good examples of often cutting
comparative advertisements that don't pull any punches in naming
the competition.  Have students critique the commercials and
evaluate their effectiveness in promoting the products to
consumers.


<p><b>Media Measures</b>

<p>     The media are the delivery systems for advertisements, the
channels of distribution.  This is a general categorization and
includes such broad media types as broadcast media (television
and radio) and print media (newspapers and magazines).  A
specific media vehicle is a branded carrier, for example CBS
television, The Wall Street Journal newspaper, and People
magazine.

<p>     When an advertiser purchases time (for the broadcast media) 
or space (for the print media) it is important to know in advance
something about target audience characteristics and audience
numbers.  This type of information allows the advertiser and
media buyer to make comparisons between media vehicles and of the
same vehicle over time to determine trends and the relative
quality of different media purchases.  Some frequently used media
measures include

<ul>
<li>reach - unduplicated hits, the number of different members
     of a target audience exposed at least once to an
     advertisement transmitted in a specific media vehicle (or
     program) in a prespecified period of time

<li>frequency - duplicated hits, the total number of times a
     target audience member is exposed to an advertisement
     transmitted in a specific media vehicle (or program) in a
     prespecified period of time

<li>coverage - the number of target audience members that
     actually receive an advertising message transmitted in a
     specific media vehicle (or program) in a prespecified period
     of time

<li>gross rating points (GRPs) - a measure of the potential
     impact or weight of a particular media schedule, calculated
     by taking reach times frequency

<li>rating - a measure of television viewership, the percent of
     households in a location who could be viewing and are; one
     ratings point is one percent of the households in a location
     viewing a specific program.  On a national basis, each
     ratings point means that 917,000 households are viewing a
     program, so if a program pulls a rating of 10 points, it has
     9.17 million households viewing.  A top rated television
     program may pull ratings in the 20s. A 20 rating means 18.3
     million households viewing.

<li>cost per thousand (CPM) - a measure of the relative costs of
     different media alternatives, primarily print media, for
     their coverage at a cost per thousand reader contacts

<li>cost per ratings point (CPRP) - a measure like CPM that is
     used to compare costs for broadcast media, calculated at the
     cost per rating point
</ul>

<p><b>Ethical Problems In Advertising   </b>

<p>     As indicated in this chapter and the last, advertising is
often severely criticized for ethical shortcomings.  Ethical
problems relate to situations where advertising is believed to
violate the moral standards, values, and principles that society
accepts as limits for acceptable actions and decisions of
individuals and groups.  Ethical problems often differ from legal
problems, which are clear violations of laws and regulations. 
Many ethical dilemmas are not covered by a law or regulation, and
many situations involving advertising are unclear.  

     Some ethical problems in advertising relate to
<ul>
<li>controversial and harmful products

<li>sexually offensive and violent situations

<li>deceptive and misleading claims

<li>advertising to children

<li>fear appeals

<li>stereotyping
</ul>

<p>     Criticisms of advertising often focus on specific
advertisements and products.  Ask your students to identify
examples based on their own observations.  Their observations may
be supported by examples found in print advertisements or
descriptions of television commercials.  Their efforts to
identify and analyze ethical problems in advertising can form the
basis for a class discussion on the topic.     

<p><b>Public Service Announcements: Pro Bono Advertising</b>

<p>     Ask students to find examples of public service advertising
(PSAs) in print and bring them to class.  PSAs often are clearly
marked either as a public service announcement or as a product of
the Ad Council.  What public services are promoted in these
advertisements?  This is donated advertisements, by advertising
agencies and the media.  How does the quality of work in the PSAs
compare to other advertisements?  Are PSAs effective?

<p><b>Infomercials</b>

<p>     If your school has a video library, check to see whether
they have examples of infomercials.  If not, an infomercial often
can be obtained directly from the advertiser.  Show an
infomercial in class and have students evaluate the contents. 
Could consumers be deceived into thinking this is a television
entertainment program?  How effective is it in promoting the
product?  What format is used?  If there is an audience, ask
students whether or not they think audience members are real
people or actors.  Should infomercials be labeled as
advertisements on the screen?  Would this protect consumers?

<p><b>Invited Speakers</b>

<p>     A guest speaker from an advertising agency, a local media
representative, or a direct marketer can add considerable insight
to your students' understanding of promotion processes.  Contacts
can be made through professional organizations, the local chamber
of commerce, or the local telephone directory.

<h2><a name="outline">CHAPTER OUTLINE</a></h2>

I.   Describe the role of advertising in product promotion
<ol>
<li>Advertising is nonpersonal persuasive marketing
          communication, mostly in the mass media and paid for by
          an identified sponsor who controls the message
<li>There are many different types and classifications  of
          advertising
<ul>
<li>Classification by coverage refers to whether the
               advertising is local (retail), national (brand),
               international, and global markets
<li>Classification by task relates to whether
               advertising serves commercial, noncommercial,
               corporate (institutional), or public service
               purposes
<li>Classification by media type refers to whether
               advertising is indirect or direct response 
<li>Classification by consumer target identifies the
               target audience(s) for advertising, including
               personal use consumers, business and organization
               consumers
</ul>
<li>Although the traditional indirect response mass media
          has been dominant historically, direct response
          advertising is gaining ground 
<li>Almost $500 billion is spent yearly on advertising
          worldwide  
<li>Advertising has been around since ancient times
<ul>
<li>The invention of the printing press in the mid-1400s contributed to the spread of literacy, and
               the need for and use of written advertisements
<li>The Industrial Revolution produced many technology
               advances that contributed to the growth of
               advertising and new advertising forms and media
<li>Advertising has become increasingly more
               sophisticated since World War II, distributed
               through new media and using innovative techniques
</ul>
<li>The advertising triad is composed of the advertiser
          (pays for it), the advertising agency (makes it), and
          the media (distributes it)
<ul>
<li>Full-service advertising agencies provide broad
               services to their clients, including advertising
               planning, execution, placement, and evaluation of
               results
<li>Advertisers are businesses, organizations, or
               other sponsors who pay for the advertisement,
               control its contents, and are identified as
               sponsors
<li>The media are the delivery systems that distribute
               advertisements to an audience and include such
               media types as print (newspapers, magazines),
               electronic (radio, television), and outdoor
               (billboards, transit)
</ul>
<li>Advertising decisions are based on the goals
          advertising must accomplish, what the competition is
          doing, the product, company resources, and other
          environmental factors
<ul>
<li>An advertising budget must be set with specific
               amounts allocated to producing advertisements,
               buying media time and space, conducting research
               to evaluate consumer responses, and paying agency
               costs
<li>The creative strategy identifies the creative
               elements that will be used in an advertisement
<li>The media strategy identifies the media that will
               be used
</ul>
</ol>

II.  Explain how sales promotions are used
<ol>
<li>Sales promotions are a type of marketing promotion that
          add value through short-term inducements to take
          action, make a product purchase, move products through
          distribution channels, and ultimately increase sales
<ul>
<li>Sales promotions are popular because they can
               quickly get measurable results
<li>Sales promotions are also used by not-for-profit
               organizations and governments
</ul>
<li>Effective sales promotion requires planning and making
          sales promotion decisions
<ul>
<li>Set objectives
<li>Decide what sales promotions to use
<li>Time the promotion, set a beginning and end date
<li>Evaluate the results, make corrections as needed
</ul>
<li>Sales promotions can be targeted to personal use
          consumers, other businesses (including members of the
          channel of distribution), organizations, government
<ul>
<li>Cents-off coupons are perhaps the most familiar
               sales promotion to personal use consumers
<li>Discounts, trade deals, contests, sales meetings,
               and events are often used for
               business/organization consumers
<li>Channel members often receive incentives designed
               to get them to move more products, faster through
               the channel
<li>The sales force receives promotions designed to
               reward and motivate them to perform more
               effectively
</ul>
</ol>

III. Explain the promotion advantages of personal selling
<ol>
<li>Unlike the other forms of promotion, personal selling
          establishes a personal link with consumers in a direct,
          personal, often face-to-face interchange
<ul>
<li>The salesperson is a boundary spanner, bridging
               the gap between company and consumer
<li>Salesperson and customer comprise a selling dyad
</ul>
<li>Perhaps the greatest advantage of personal selling is 
          immediacy and personal contact with the buyer, which
          allows the seller to counter objections, negotiate
          terms, solve problems, and establish a long-term
          relationship
<ul>
<li>Personal selling is very costly, particularly in
               business/organization personal selling
<li>It is highly cost ineffective for reaching mass
               audiences
<li>Personal selling contributes significantly to the
               economy, employing over 20 million people in the
               United States
</ul>
<li>New technologies are being used to make personal
          selling more effective and efficient
<ul>
<li>Telemarketing allows salespeople to broaden their
               contacts by eliminating the need for face-to-face
               contact
<li>The personal computer, facsimile machine, and
               cellular telephone make it easier for a personal
               sales force to work out of their homes rather than
               from a central headquarters office
</ul>
<li>The sales force is a strategic tool, adding value to 
          products and consumer exchange
<li>There are many different types of sales people and
          sales tasks
<li>Effective sales force management is important because
          salespeople are critical to marketing success
<ul>
<li>Every sales force, whatever its size, must be
               managed
<li>Decisions in sales force management include
               identifying the purpose of the sales force,
               setting objectives, recruiting, selecting,
               training, compensating, motivating, evaluating, 
               and dealing with turnover
<li>One of the most difficult management tasks is
               sales force compensation because it deals with
               very sensitive, often highly emotional issues 
<li>Sales force motivation is an important concern
               because it directly affects sales and is often
               difficult to do right
<li>Sales force evaluation determines how well the
               sales force is doing its job
<li>Sales force turnover must be managed in order to
               retain good salespeople and reduce turnover costs
</ul>
</ol>

IV.  Characterize public relations/publicity activities
<ol>
<li>Public relations is the promotion type that establishes
          a communication link between a business/organization
          and various groups of people who have some interest or
          involvement in what the business does
<ul>
<li>There are many ways that public relations attempts
               to establish goodwill, through press conferences,
               the distribution of printed and electronic
               materials, lobbying, organizing events or
               sponsorships, and advising businesses and
               organizations on how to handle emergencies
<li>Confusion exists about the relationship between
               public relations and publicity, but although they
               have the same goals, public relations is paid for
               by a sponsor while publicity is not
</ul>
<li>Frequent targets of public relations include employees,
          stockholders, potential investors, government, and
          consumers
<li>Public relations/publicity is criticized for
          aggressively and visibly trying to present everything
          in a positive light, even when it is not
<li>Because a third party often conveys information in the
          publicity process, it is vulnerable to
          misinterpretation and misunderstanding
<li>Decisions in the public relations/publicity process
          must be made using complete knowledge of the business
          or organization involved, its environment, and what the
          promotion is expected to accomplish
</ol>

V.   Identify the advantages of direct marketing
<ol>
<li>Direct marketing is the promotion mix element that
          makes extensive use of computer databases and lists to
          direct mail and telephone offers to consumer targets,
          gives immediate response measurement capacity to the
          mass media through direct print and electronic
          advertising, can personalize messages and offers,
          refine targeting, and reduce the waste of contacting
          nonreceptive audiences
<ul>
<li>It is not easy to define because there are so many
               types and there is a controversy about what is or
               is not direct marketing
<li>It is both a cause and a victim of promotion
               clutter
<li>Because direct marketing relies on developing
               information about consumers that is maintained in
               computer databases, it raises serious consumer
               privacy questions 
</ul>
<li>The computer database of consumer information is the
          backbone of contemporary direct marketing and
          telemarketing
<ul>
<li>High speed computers with vast memory storage
               capacity provide tremendous potential for
               compiling lists based on highly personal consumer
               information
<li>An accurate, timely database can eliminate
               considerable waste in a mailing or telephone list
</ul>
<li>The best list is developed in-house from present or
          past customers
<ul>
<li>Lists are available from commercial list brokers
<li>A valuable list provides a reasonable quantity of
               names, accurate selections, and current
               information
</ul>
<li>Direct mail was the first form of direct marketing
<li>Telemarketing is often called the most irritating form
          of direct marketing, which refers more to out-bound
          telemarketing than to in-bound order taking
<li>Direct marketing decisions are somewhat different than
          other promotion decisions, principally because target
          market selection is a critical early step
</ol>

<h2><a name="questions">SUGGESTED ANSWERS TO CHAPTER QUESTIONS</a></h2>

<h3>DISCUSSION QUESTIONS</h3>

<p>1.  What are the tasks of promotion?  <i>The tasks of promotion are
to inform, persuade, remind, and often, entertain.  It is an
extremely varied part of marketing and a very important one,
because promotion communicates directly with target audiences. </i>

<p>2.  How did railroads, communication inventions, and mail
delivery contribute to the need for national mass advertising? 
<i>Railroads, when they finally reached from coast to coast, meant
that products from the west coast could be transported east, and
vice versa.  A national distribution system promoted the
establishment of national brands that could be marketed anywhere
in the country.  As a result, national mass advertising was
needed to inform consumers about nationally distributed, mass
marketed products.  Communications inventions, such as the
teletype and telephone, contributed to national communications
and the development of national mass media.  Universal mail
delivery meant that catalogs could be delivered anywhere in the
country, which promoted the development of direct marketing.</i>

<p>3.  What is an infomercial?  How does it differ from traditional
television commercials?  <i>An infomercial is an extended direct
response television advertisement that runs as long as a 30- or
60-minute program.  It differs from traditional television
commercials because it is delivered in a program format, is
designed to be entertaining, and runs far longer than the
traditional 15 to 30 second commercial.  Most infomercials are
played primarily at night, early morning, or at times when air
time is cheapest.  Most infomercials have live audiences
participating in the presentation and the audience, along with
the program format, sometimes fools viewers who fail to recognize
that this is an advertisement. </i>

<p>4.  Compare and contrast advertising and sales promotions. 
<i>Indirect mass advertising is primarily designed to build image
over a period of time.  Results are not immediately measurable;
effects may not be experienced for months or even years.  Sales
promotions are short-term incentives that expire in a
predetermined period of time.  They provide incentives for
consumers to act, now.  Their results are measurable almost
immediately.  For example, a long running television commercial
for the Energizer Bunny is designed to build the image of the
Energizer battery as long lasting and unstoppable.  The bunny
campaign has aired for years in order to keep reminding consumers
about Energizer.  A sales promotion for a local appliance
retailer promises 10 percent off every purchase and a free three-day Florida vacation for anyone purchasing a 27 inch television
set in the next week.  At the end of the week, the special offer
will be withdrawn.</i>

<p>5.  What groups may be sales promotion targets?  <i>Sales promotions
can be directed toward personal use consumers, salespeople,
members of the distribution channel, other businesses,
organizations, and governments.</i>

<p>6.  Explain the advantages and disadvantages of using:
<i>
<br>a. advertising.
<br>b. sales promotions.
<br>c. personal selling.
<br>d. public relations/publicity.
<br>e. direct marketing.
</i>
     
<p><b>a. advertising.</b>  <i>The advantages of advertising are that it can
reach a mass audience at a very low cost per contact; it can
successfully build brand image and goodwill; it can be highly
creative and entertaining, capturing consumers' attention; it
provides important information to consumers that they can use in
positioning products; and it is an important sector of the
economy, contributing billions of dollars in revenues and
directly creating hundreds of thousands of jobs in the United
States.  The disadvantages of advertising are that it can be very
expensive to create, produce, and distribute an advertisement; it
can be irritating and offensive, and contributes to promotion
clutter; mass advertising does not provide immediate feedback
with measurable results, therefore it can be a very long time
before results become obvious; and it is wasteful, reaching many
uninterested consumers in order to reach a target audience who
are interested in the message.   </i>

<p><b>b. sales promotions.</b>  <i>The advantages of sales promotions are that
they provide a short term boost for such outcomes as sales,
revenues, store traffic, or inventory flow; they provide
measurable results in a short time; personal use consumers like
them; they contribute to the economy with revenues and jobs; and
they are effective in motivating the salesforce and channel
members.  The disadvantages are that they can undermine brand
loyalty by making consumers price sensitive, sensitized to
incentives so that they will purchase any brand, as long as it is
on sale; sales promotions contribute to promotion clutter; they
are easy for the competition to match; and they can be expensive
to run.</i>

<p><b>c. personal selling.</b>  <i>The advantages of personal selling are that
salespeople establish personal relationships with consumers,
which means that over the period of the relationship, they can
better serve customer needs and cross sell them other products;
salespeople can counter objections, negotiate, and solve
problems; they contribute to the economy; and they can provide
feedback to their company about consumers, competitors, and what
is happening in the environment.  The disadvantages are that it
is very expensive to have a salesforce and maintain them,
particularly in industrial or business selling; a salesforce is
highly ineffective for reaching a mass market; and it is
difficult to manage a salesforce, particularly when it involves
compensation and motivation.</i>

<p><b>d. public relations/publicity.</b>  <i>The advantages of public
relations/publicity are that they can effectively promote without
always being directly sponsored, which often lends credibility to
information that comes from a third party; they are flexible
activities that can be used in emergencies and to take advantage
of unexpected opportunities; they provide jobs; and they can be
used to perform damage control in situations when the promoter
needs assistance.  The disadvantages are that the public is
becoming more critical of public relations professionals who
aggressively try to put events and organizations in a good light
when it is inappropriate; they add to the promotion clutter; and
they manipulate the media.  </i>

<p><b>e. direct marketing.</b>  <i>The advantages of direct marketing are that
by finely targeting its audience, it can eliminate much of the
waste experienced in other promotion types that are less
discriminating; it is more measurable than mass advertising and
results can be obtained rapidly; it is flexible and can be
changed quickly.  The disadvantages are that it adds clutter; is
believed to invade consumers' privacy; can be very irritating to
consumers; can be very expensive, particularly in postage; and
adds to environmental waste. </i>

<h3>CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING</h3>

<h4>Check Your Understanding 13.1</h4>

<p>1.  Compare and contrast indirect mass advertising and direct
action advertising.  <i>Traditional mass advertising is used for
long term brand image building and as a reminder.  Results may be
delayed months or even years.  Direct action advertising uses a
telephone number, mail card, fax number, or e-mail number to
collect immediate consumer responses.  This is measurable and can
be immediate.</i>

<p>2.  Describe some advertising types.  <i>There are many different
types of advertising, some advertising builds brand image, other
advertising builds goodwill, reminds consumers about a product,
or makes public service announcements.  Advertising is classified
by coverage, task, media type, and consumer target.  There are
many different elements within each classification, for example
in media type, there is indirect response which includes
electronic (radio, television), print (newspapers, magazines),
and outdoor (billboards, transit), and direct response which
includes telephone numbers, mail-in coupons, fax numbers, and e-mail addresses.</i>
 
<p>3.  Discuss some of the advertising decisions that must be made. 
<i>Advertising decisions are about setting goals that advertising
must achieve, setting a budget, developing a creative strategy,
developing a media strategy, producing and implementing
advertising, then evaluating the results.</i>


<h4>Check Your Understanding 13.2 </h4>

<p>1.  Who are the targets of sales promotions?  <i>Targets of sales
promotions are personal use consumers, business/organization
consumers, employees, and distributors.</i>

<p>2.  What are some sales promotion types?  <i>Types include sales
contests, cents-off coupons, refunds, premiums, events, samples,
discounts, and premiums.</i>
 
<p>3.  Describe what is meant by sales promotion strategy.  <i>A
strategy for sales promotions must state clearly what objectives
are set for the sales promotions and how they will be met.  </i>


<h4>Check Your Understanding 13.3 </h4>

<p>1.  Explain the meaning of the term dyad. <i>A dyad is the
connection between buyer and seller in a marketing exchange.  It
is the salesperson and the consumer interacting in a personal
contact to make a marketing exchange.</h4>

<p>2.  How are new technologies affecting personal selling?  <i>New
technologies such as the personal computer, cellular telephone,
and facsimile machine are giving salespeople greater flexibility
in how they do their work.  In a growing number of cases, it has
freed industrial salespeople from the office and allowed them to
work from their homes and cars.</i>
            
<p>3.  Identify some of the activities associated with sales force
management.  <i>Sales force management includes such activities as
recruiting, selecting, hiring, training, motivating, evaluating,
compensating, and sometimes firing.  It is important to
effectively manage a sales force both because it directly affects
sales and revenues, and because salesperson turnover is very
expensive.</i>

<h4>Check Your Understanding 13.4</h4>

<p>1.  Identify some public relations/publicity tasks.  <i>Public
relations/publicity works to build and maintain goodwill and a
positive image through such activities as news conferences,
distributing printed and electronic materials, lobbying,
organizing events and sponsorships, and advising businesses and
organizations on how to handle emergencies and take advantage of
unexpected promotion opportunities.</i>

<p>2.  Describe some criticisms of public relations/publicity.  <i>Like
the other forms of promotion, public relations/publicity suffers
from promotion clutter and contributes to it.  It is criticized
for contributing to clutter, putting a positive spin on
everything regardless of its merit, and manipulating the media.</i>

<p>3.  Contrast public relations/publicity and advertising.
<i>Advertising uses the mass media to deliver a message from an
identified sponsor.  While public relations also may use the mass
media to deliver a message, often the sponsor is not identified
and in the case of publicity, the sponsor does not control the
message.  Public relations is broader than advertising and
includes activities traditionally associated with sales
promotions, direct marketing, and personal selling.     </i>


<h4>Check Your Understanding 13.5</h4>

<p>1.  Why is it difficult to define direct marketing?    <i>Direct
marketing is such a broad set of activities that it is difficult
to define. This has led to controversy about what it is, even to
the extent that some marketers consider it distribution more than
promotion.</i>
 
<p>2.  How is a database used in direct marketing?  <i>Information
about consumers are collected in a database that is the source of
the contact list used in direct marketing.</i>

<p>3.  How are direct marketing lists generated?  <i>In-house lists are
the most valuable as they are composed of consumers who are
already customers or have been customers in the past.  A
generated list is usually purchased from a list broker.  It is a
list developed by capturing consumer names from many different
sources.  These sources include subscription lists, contributor
lists, mail order buyer lists, inquiry lists, and list generated
by public agencies.  These public lists include automobile
registrations, birth registration, and real estate transfers.</i>


<h3>MINI-CASES</h3>
                                
<h4>Mini-Case 13.1: "Mattress Mack's" Winning Ads</h4>
                 
<p>    Do your local television stations air commercials like those
aired by "Mattress Mack?"  If so, how many students have seen the
advertisements?  Of those who have, what do they think of them? 
Are they effective?  Obviously, Mattress Mack is doing well,
enjoying the success of increased sales due in large measure to
his visibility and ability to cut through the promotions clutter.
What is the risk of irritating or offending too many consumers in
an audience?  Is this a case of bad advertising or using very
shrewd consumer insights to embed a value image in the minds of
price sensitive consumers?

<p>1.  Can irritating advertisements be effective?  Explain your
answer?  <i>Actually, they can be effective, if they don't exceed a
threshold of being too irritating.  Because they irritate, they
may be remembered, which is a goal of advertising.  The
irritation threshold varies for different consumers, so what is
terribly irritating to some consumers is still acceptable to
others.  An advertiser will eventually find out if the
advertisements are too irritating and ineffective when sales drop
and there is no other reason for the decline.  Unfortunately,
this can be weeks or months after the advertisements first air.</i>

<p>2.  Which media seems to have more irritating advertisements than
the others?  What is irritating about these advertisements?  <i>Most
consumers are more irritated by television commercials than other
forms.  There are several reasons for this, including seemingly
endless repetitions, increased volume during commercials, and
messages that irritate and offend.  Television also irritates
because it involves more senses than most media, therefore it is
more vivid and engaging.</i>

<p>3.  Would most consumers sit through an irritating commercial? <i>It
depends on the consumer, the situation, the product, and the
degree of irritation the commercial causes.  Because consumers
differ, some will sit through an irritating commercial while
others may flip channels, leave the room, mute the volume, or
read a book until the program resumes.</i>


<h4>Mini-Case 13.2  Is There A Free Lunch?</h4>

<p>     Most grocery shoppers know when samples will be waiting for
them.  Some plan their trips around sample times because it adds
a little variety to a generally disliked chore.  Other consumers
become upset by the mess that sampling can make, the jammed
aisles around popular sampling locations, and piggy people who
eat more than their share of samples.  Research indicates that
there is a greater probability that a consumer will purchase a
product if they sample it first.  In-store food samples are
particularly effective in getting consumers to try new products
and possibly develop a liking for them based on the experience. 
What do your students think about sampling?  Have they ever
sampled food in a grocery store?  Did they follow up by making a
product purchase?  Is this an effective promotion type only for
grocery products or can it be used for other products?

<p>1.  Describe some reasons why consumers like free samples. 
<i>Sampling adds variety to a shopping chore that some consumers 
dislike.  Many shoppers like to munch on foods as they shop and
appreciate the opportunity to try new products to see if they
will like them.</i>

<p>2.  Is sampling a good idea?  <i>For many products, it is definitely 
an excellent idea because it gets consumers to try out new
products and provides an immediate opportunity for them to make a
purchase.  If cents-off coupons are provided along with the
sample, the incentive to purchase becomes even more powerful.</i>

<p>3.  Do any retailers other than supermarkets give away free
samples?  <i>Department stores display perfume bottles for shoppers
to sample.  Drug stores have cosmetic samples available for
shoppers to try lipstick and powder shades before making a
purchase.  Shoppers can sample music compact disks in music
stores and on the Internet.  Software retailers often let
consumers try out demonstration disks to make sure the product
suits the consumer's needs before they purchase a complete
version.  Candy shops and bakeries provide free samples to
customers. </i>
                                
<h3>WHAT DO YOU THINK?</h3>

<p>     Will consumers accept or reject the promotion innovations of
listening to commercials in order to get a free 25 cent telephone
call, and purchasing a diskette with 216 pieces of Absolut Vodka
art?  Ask your students whether or not they would do so.  What
situations or consumer characteristics would make a consumer more
likely to want to get a free telephone call, and therefore
willing to listen to the commercials in order to get it?  Why
would a consumer purchase a diskette of Absolut Vodka art?  What
type of consumer might do so?

<h2><a name="internet">USING THE INTERNET</a></h2>

<p>     Please verify all Internet addresses and confirm the
feasibility of an Internet assignment <b>before</b> you make it.  No
Internet address or information can be guaranteed past the date
of this <b><i>Manual's</b></i> publication.  Be sure to insist that students
demonstrate professional conduct at all times on the Internet.   

<h3>Internet Assignments</h3>

<p>     The Internet is being used for many of the types of
promotions described in this chapter.  For example

<ul>
<li>advertising  -  many home pages advertise products; many
     advertising agencies have Web home pages where they promote
     their traditional and Internet advertising expertise

<li>sales promotions - coupons are offered on the Internet,
     along with contests, free samples, and sales promotions

<li>personal selling - many sites, particularly those targeting
     business/organization consumers, offer e-mail contacts in
     order to service accounts 

<li>public relations/publicity - in addition to public relations
     agencies offering their services on the Internet, the Net is
     also used for publicity purposes.  For example, on the day
     that IBM Corp. sent a letter to Lotus Development informing
     them that IBM intended to initiate a hostile take-over, IBM
     posted the entire contents of the letter on its Internet
     home page to inform interested visitors about the company's
     actions and ensure that the correct information was
     available.  At the same time, Lotus Development posted on
     their home page a copy of the press release that gave their
     reply to the IBM letter. 

<li>direct marketing - some direct marketing companies are
     offering their services on the Internet, many catalogs are
     on the Internet
</ul>

<p>     Small teams of students can investigate the current status
of promotions on the Internet.  In addition to the search tools
already identified in this Manual, students should also learn to
use the 1994 Navigational Tool of the Year (from the World Wide
Web Hall of Fame), the World Wide Web Worm WWWW, developed at the
University of Colorado by Oliver McBryan.  The WWW Worm allows
the user to type in a keyword or phrase to direct the Worm search
engine to a hypertext link or URL address.  For example, a query
for newspapers and internet and a request for 50 matches returned
URLs for links to Newspapers on the Internet (three different
URLs), Internet newspapers, Campus Newspapers on the Internet
(four different URLs), and List of Newspapers on the Internet.  A
query of coupons returned URLs for links to Coupons to "Clip",
alt.coupons, Coupons, Money Saving Coupons, Airline Discount
Coupons, Frequent Flyer Coupons, and Tickets & Coupons - Printers
& Suppliers.

<i><p><a href="http://www.cs.colorado.edu/home/mcbryan/WWWW.html">http://www.cs.colorado.edu/home/mcbryan/WWWW.html</a></i>
       
<p>     Many advertising agencies are already on the Internet.  If
you have a graphical browser, visit some of these agencies to
gain insight into their creative philosophies.  Many offer visual
and sound galleries of some of their past and often prize winning
work.  Most provide a mission statement and a description of the
type of work that they do and clients they are serving.  Ask your
students to evaluate several sites graphically and decided
whether or not an advertiser might be able to find a creatively
compatible agency just by carefully screening their Web site. 
Use all of the search engines, plus others that you may have
found, to locate major advertising agencies.  

<i>
<p>     Yahoo
<br><a href="http://www.yahoo.com">http://www.yahoo.com</a>

<p>     WebCrawler
<br><a href="http://webcrawler.com">http://webcrawler.com</a>

<p>     Global Network Navigator - The Whole Internet Catalog
<br><a href="http://www.gnn.com">http://www.gnn.com</a>

<p>     WWWW
<br><a href="http://www.cs.colorado.edu/home/mcbryan/WWWW.html">http://www.cs.colorado.edu/home/mcbryan/WWWW.html</a>
</i>
      

<p>     Students can locate many different media on the Internet. 
In addition to the major national television networks (ABC, CBS,
NBC), there are magazines, newspapers, and yellow pages on the
Internet.  Some offer entertainment links on their sites, others
are more business oriented.  These sites can be located using the
search engines.

<p>     What media measures are being used on the Internet?  At
least for the time being, hits are being counted on Web sites. 
Each time a visitor arrives at a Web site, a hit is registered. 
This is only a measure of contact, not of the length of stay or
whether any follow-up occurred through e-mail, fax, or telephone.
Ask your students what is right and what is wrong with this
measure.  With each hit, the site can capture a visitor's e-mail
address.  Can this information be used in direct marketing? 
Should it be used or is this an invasion of privacy.

<h3>MARKETING APPLICATIONS</h3>


<h4>MARKETING APPLICATION 13.1</h4>

<p>     Rather than work independently in this Application, student
teams can divide up the task and each member collect an example
of a different advertising type.  When all of the examples have
been collected, ask the student teams to collaborate and
determine how effectively the advertisements reflect consumer
insight.  Are the advertisements effective enough to cut through
the clutter and get consumers to act?  What characteristics are
shared by the effective advertisements and by the ineffective
advertisements?


<h4>MARKETING APPLICATION 13.2</h4>

<p>     If time is running short, as the end of the term approaches,
instead of sampling other consumers, have students poll the class
as to their experiences with infomercials.  If a class member has
not seen an infomercial, ask them to do so.  Are infomercials
effective?  Students can research recent articles, particularly
in such publications as Advertising Age and AdWeek to determine
how well infomercials generate sales.


<h4>MARKETING APPLICATION 13.3</h4>

<p>     Student teams can be assigned the task of content analyzing
sources for a coupon check.  The results of their analysis can be
checked in recent business publications to determine the major
coupon categories by expenditure.


<h4>MARKETING APPLICATION 13.4 </h4>

<p>     In addition to using this Application as a means of
compiling participant observations of personal selling, it can
also be valuable for illustrating the variety of job
opportunities in this field.  


<h4>MARKETING APPLICATION 13.5</h4>

<p>     Small student teams can take either the cold pill or oil
tank rupture as their "product" and use it as the focus of their
public relations/publicity brainstorming.  Each team can report
the results of their work in memo form or as a brief oral
presentation.  Students can debate the merit of the different
approaches.


<h3>CONSUMER INSIGHTS AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETING</h3>


<h4>CONSUMER INSIGHT 13.1</h4>

<p>     There is a high probability your students, particularly if
they are 20 year olds, will not have seen the 1984 television
commercial.  Instead of referring to the 1984 commercial, ask if
they can recall a truly memorable commercial like it?  Can they
even recall a commercial that they saw yesterday?  What
commercials can they recall and why?  Does repetition encourage
recall for all commercials?  Does the irritation factor improve
recall?


<h4>CONSUMER INSIGHT 13.2</h4>

<p>     Telemarketing is a very important part of personal selling,
but it irritates many consumers and is often stressful for
telemarketers.  Contrast the roles of in-bound and out-bound
telemarketers.  Which job is more stressful and why?  Which type
of telemarketing is more irritating to consumers and why?


<h4>CONSUMER INSIGHT 13.3</h4>

<p>     College students are prime targets for direct marketers.  As
students near graduation, they often receive direct mail about
new cars, credit cards, clothing, and travel.  If your students
are approaching graduation, ask them to monitor the types of
direct mail they receive and its volume.  How do these direct
marketers get student names?</p>

<h1>PART V:   RESOURCE LIST</h1>

     

<h3><b>Introduction</b></h3>



This is a resource list of professional organizations in a variety of marketing specialities that may be helpful in providing specialized information about marketing, career and job information for your students, and suggestions on how to locate guest speakers in your area.  Some of the organizations have speaker's bureaus; many have local chapters in cities across the country.  Several have video films about their organization and profession that they loan to educational institutions.<p>



     While every effort has been made to provide the most current information, organizations like individuals can and do move.  If you have difficulty locating a forwarding address, try a library search of telephone directories or a directory of professional organizations.  In the next several years, as more professional organizations set up sites on the World Wide Web, you will be able to find them through an Internet search using any of the primary search tools cited in this Manual.  Internet addresses are provided for organizations that could be located on the Net in mid-1995.<p>



<b><h3><a name="guest">Guest Speakers</a></h3></b><p>



     Guest speakers can share interesting and valuable observations and experiences that will add a different perspective to class discussions.  They often are rich sources for information about careers in their professional areas.  The following suggestions are derived from personal experiences with hosting guest speakers.  I hope they help.<p>



<ul>

<li>Don't invite too many guests in one term.  Usually, one or two speakers at key points are sufficient to add variety to the class, but not too many to disrupt the class rhythm.



<li>Examine your marketing strengths and weaknesses, likes and dislikes.  If possible, invite guests to speak in areas you least prefer to teach or where your marketing knowledge needs expansion.  Few if any marketing educators are equally well prepared to teach every aspect of marketing.  Therefore, consider this an opportunity to bring variety to your class and learn from an expert.



<li>Ask your guest in advance whether he or she needs visual aids, computers, or other materials, and a lectern.



<li>Prepare the guest with a description of your class and student demographics.  Identify what you have covered thus far in the term that is relevant to the topic.



<li>Ask your guest for information, preferably written, that can be used for an introduction.  This should include present position, a brief description of job responsibilities, previous employment, professional training, and other relevant professional information.



<li>Send maps and parking stickers in advance, along with any special instructions about getting to campus or the meeting room.



<li>If you cannot meet your guest upon his or her arrival, ensure that someone else will guide the way to your classroom.



<li>Have a glass of water available for your guest at a convenient place near the lectern.



<li>Prepare your class in advance for the visit, provide the  name of the guest speaker, company or organization affiliation, and topic.  Ask students to be prepared to ask questions after the presentation and preselect several students to be ready to lead the way into a question and answer session.  Nothing is worse than asking for questions at the end of the presentation and being met with dead silence.



<li>At our school, we always give guest speakers a small gift from the student book store, usually an engraved school coffee mug, as thanks for taking the time and making the effort to visit with us.  If you plan to do the same, have it ready to present at the end of class, after all questions have been answered.



<li>Thank your guest in writing immediately after the presentation.  Always show courtesy and consideration for professionals who are willing to take time away from their business to talk with students.  Remember, they have to take time to prepare their remarks and sometimes there is a financial cost to their leaving the office.</ul>



<h3><b><a name="career">Career Information</a></b></h3><p>



     Students often enter the job market without a clear idea of the types of jobs available to them.  Many of the resources on this list can provide career information for you to relay to your class.  Sometimes they will send brochures and information sheets, on request.  For a brief description of the activities undertaken by these organizations, see <u>The Encyclopedia of Associations, 29th Edition</u>, or another directory.<p>

<title>Siegel IM - Part III - Transparency Masters</title>
</head>
Instructor's Resource Manual to accompany<br>
MARKETING: FOUNDATIONS AND APPLICATIONS<br> 
by Carolyn F. Siegel<br><p>

<h2>PART III --  TRANSPARENCY MASTERS FOR CHAPTER OBJECTIVES</h2>

<b>Introduction</b><p>

     Transparencies can be very helpful, if they are used
effectively.  The transparency masters in this section are keyed
to the chapter objectives that organize each text chapter.  They
are designed to:<p>
<ul>
<li> focus attention on key thoughts developed in each chapter<p>

<li> provide a framework and focus for student learning<p>

<li> provide a framework and focus for class discussion<p>
</ul>
     Transparencies can enliven class discussions, or they can
disrupt them.  They should focus attention on key points and
illustrate concepts.  However, if you use too many
transparencies, students may spend their time copying them and
not listening or contributing to class discussion. 
Transparencies can disrupt the flow of the class if you are
distracted by having to flip through a large pile of them.<p>

     I use chapter objective transparencies at the beginning of
each class.  I get to class a few minutes early and have the
transparency projected on the screen as students enter the room. 
This way they copy the questions before class begins.  The act of
writing the questions focuses students' attention on the day's
topics.  This settles everyone down and sets a businesslike tone
for the class.  When everyone has had a chance to copy the
questions, I turn the projector off.  It may be flipped on at
other times during the class, when a relevant point is
emphasized.  <p>

<b><a name="suggest">Suggestions For Using Transparencies</a>       
</b><p>
     The following suggestions reflect personal experience in
using transparencies and overhead projectors.  Please share them
with your students during the term if they are called on to make
a presentation that requires transparencies. <p>   
<ul>
<li> Get to class early to check the overhead projector. 
     Familiarize yourself with its operation, turn it on, focus
     it, and be sure that the bulb works and the mirror is clean.<p>
<li> Pull down the screen and anchor the end, as needed, to
     ensure that it is operable.  If the screen is broken, find a
     clear wall where the transparency can be projected.  This
     may require changing the direction of the projection.<p>

<li> With the transparency in place and the projector on, walk to
     various sections of the room and sit in the seats that will
     be occupied.  Make sure that the transparency can be read
     from all parts of the room.  If necessary, move the
     projector or adjust the image to improve readability.<p>

<li>Practice using the transparency by pointing to it on the
     projector and not on the screen.  Avoid turning around and
     pointing at the screen as this positions your back to the
     class, you lose eye contact and your voice becomes muffled.<p>

<li> Practice using a pencil or pen to emphasize points on the
     transparency.  Again, point to the transparency on the
     projector and not the screen.<p>

<li>The transparency masters in this section are very large and
     typed using large and small letters.  Transparencies cannot
     be read easily or sometimes at all, if they are made without
     enlargement from pica or elite type fonts.  It is easier for
     an audience to read broken type (large and small letters)
     than to read all capitals or all small letters.<p>   

<li>Never use reverse type!  This is light type on a dark
     background.  It is almost impossible to read anywhere other
     than the front row.<p>

<li> If you want to write on the transparency, use special
     marking pens designed for this purpose.  They come in both
     washable and indelible forms.  A highlighter or felt tip pen
     will not write effectively on a transparency.<p>
</ul>

<b>INSTRUCTOR'S RESOURCE MANUAL<br>
to accompany<br>
MARKETING: FOUNDATIONS AND APPLICATIONS</b><br>
by Carolyn F. Siegel of Eastern Kentucky University <p>            

<h2>PREFACE</h2><p>

Marketing is such an interesting, varied subject that some
aspect of it is bound to engage the interest of even the most
skeptical student.  Marketing is exciting to teach because what
students learn in the classroom can be applied almost immediately
to what they experience in their daily lives.  Marketing is
ubiquitous.  It is personal, yet also extremely important to
business and society.  Marketing is also a challenge to teach,
largely because there is so much content to deal with in a short
period, a 10-week quarter or 16 week semester.<p>  

Growing student diversity is another challenge facing the
introductory marketing instructor.  There are more non-traditional students today, adult learners with different needs, problems, and expectations.  Many are returning to school after
absences of years or even decades.  Often they work full-time in
addition to carrying a heavy class schedule.  Some have
significant work experience; others are exploring new career
directions.  The majority have home and family responsibilities,
beyond work and school.  Whatever their individual
characteristics, they often offer striking contrasts to the
traditional student, the twenty year old, who entered higher
education directly from high school and will complete degree
requirements within a relatively uninterrupted period.<p>

     Marketing instructors must also consider a third and equally
compelling challenge, this one from prospective employers. 
Employers expect higher education graduates to have good work
skills, particularly in communication, information retrieval,
decision making, team work, and change management.  Marketing
instructors can meet this challenge by using a variety of
teaching methods, particularly interactive, hands-on learning
methods that provide an opportunity for students to develop
effective work skills.<p>
        
     This <i>Instructor's Resource Manual</i> was written to address
these challenges, and others.  The goals are to make teaching the
introductory marketing course easier and more enjoyable, and make
learning about marketing more personal and meaningful for
students.  Strategies for achieving these goals include:<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Organizing</b> chapter objectives and summary statements by
     numbered sections, then similarly numbering associated
     sections in this <i>Manual</i>, the <i>Student Study Guide</i>, and the
     <i>Test Bank</i>.  Information that is systematically organized and
     presented is more apt to be usable to the teacher and used
     by the student.<p>

<li><b>Streamlining</b> the text so that it is shorter, yet covers all
     key marketing topics.  Many marketing textbooks are bloated. 
     These encyclopedic textbooks frustrate teachers, who can't
     complete all the chapters in a term, and students, who won't
     read them because of their size and copious detail.  A
     textbook purchased but not read is a bad investment,
     pedagogically and financially.<p>  

<li><b> Applying</b> marketing in interesting and uncomplicated
     activities that challenge students to see how marketing is
     an important part of their everyday lives.  Several hands-on
     Marketing Applications appear in each text chapter and
     suggestions for their use appear in this <i>Manual</i>.<p>  

<li><b> Contemporizing</b> marketing by using timely, interesting, and
     relevant examples, mini-cases, consumer insights,
     international marketing sections, and a completely new
     feature,<i> Marketing On The Internet</i>.  The text and this
     <i>Manual</i> are among the first to include information on the
     Internet, along with specific suggestions on how to use the
     Internet in the marketing classroom.  Soon the Internet will
     become even more important to marketers and marketing. 
     Students who have meaningful Internet experience should
     improve their employment potential.<p>
</ul>
This <i>Manual</i> includes teaching suggestions used successfully
in my classes, and in those of colleagues.  It also provides
references to other teaching resources, along with names and
addresses of useful sources for class enrichment materials. 
Please adapt any of the teaching suggestions to suit your own
needs and educational environment; improve on them, and share
your success with others.  I hope this <i>Manual</i> is of assistance to
you as you teach this important course.  Your comments and
suggestions on improving the <i>Manual</i> are very welcome, as are your
comments on the text itself.  Please share them with me at this

MARKETING: FOUNDATIONS AND APPLICATIONS<br>

Part I    Starting Points<br>

<h2>USING THE INTERNET IN YOUR MARKETING CLASS</h2>
     
     The Internet is a powerful new tool in the interactive
teaching method mix.  As more schools connect to the Internet
(Net-connect), students will use it routinely to explore
marketing on a personal level.  Marketing projects on the
Internet will take on new and exciting dimensions.  Even if your
school is not yet on the Net, take the time to read this section
and learn what is in store for you and your students.<p>

<b>The Internet</b><p>

     The Internet is a system of interconnected computer networks
linked together into one great global computer cooperative.  No
single government, organization, or administrative body directly
controls it.  The technical aspects of the Internet are managed
by the Internet Society (ISOC).  Operating costs are shared by
primary users (Hoffman and Novak 1994) and a growing number of
businesses.<p>

     The idea for a powerful, resilient interconnected computer
network can be traced back to the early 1960s, when the United
States Department of Defense decided that the country needed a
communication system able to provide command and control
capability even during a nuclear attack (Hoffman and Novak 1994). 
In response, the Rand Corporation designed a network based on
system redundancy and packet switching technology that could
deliver messages under the most extreme conditions, even if parts
of the system were off-line.<p>

     Technically, what we know as the Internet began in 1969 as
ARPANET, the Department of Defense's Advanced Research Projects
Agency network.  This technology also linked computers and
research scientists at UCLA and Stanford University (Sanford
1995).  Other shared computer links were formed later between
universities, the military, and defense contractors, with the
first international links made to Western Europe in 1973. 
ARPANET was decommissioned in 1990, the year that commercial
Internet mail service began (Sanford 1995).  The National Science
Foundation (NSF), which was principally funding the backbone of
the Internet, set a new use policy in November 1992 that cleared
the path for commercial access to the Net (Johnson 1993).  In
April 1995 the United States government officially turned the
cost of maintaining the Internet over to businesses and
disconnected the NSF Internet gateway (Stavrinou 1995).<p>  

<b>     Internet Demographics</b><p>

     Currently, the Internet connects 75 countries with full
Internet services and 77 more countries with e-mail service
(Verity and Hof 1994) through at least eleven thousand computer
networks (Sanford 1995).  Estimates of Internet size, growth
rate, and commercial activity change, almost daily.  The Internet
may be growing exponentially, doubling in size every year, adding
an estimated million new users each month, with approximately
27.5 million users as of October 1994 (Quarterman 1994).  Half
the Fortune 1000 companies have an Internet mail address;
commercial sites on the World Wide Web have grown from 9,000 in
1991 to over 22,000 in 1995, with even faster growth predicted
for the last years of the 20th century (Verity and Hof 1994).<p>  

     The annual total value of goods sold on the Internet is
estimated to be over $10 million and growing at 10 percent a
month (Solomon 1994).  Business-to-business Internet sales in
1993 were an estimated $20 to $30 billion through 200 to 300
Internet catalogs (Shermach 1995).  Although completely accurate
Internet sales figures are not available currently, what is
certain is that Internet users, sales, and service are all
increasing dramatically and rapidly.<p>  

     <b>Internet Layers<p></b>

     There are several different layers to the Internet.  The
layer of greatest interest to marketers is the World Wide Web
(WWW), which provides global access to information through
hypertext links.  The Web was opened in 1992 (Sanford 1995). 
Hypertext information links appear on screen as highlighted text

<b>How Can You Use The Internet In Your Marketing Class?</b><p>

     The Internet is a new factor for most marketers and
marketing instructors to consider.  Many schools still don't have
Internet access.  In other cases, marketing instructors are using
the Internet primarily for e-mail, but they haven't gotten their
students on the Net.  New and highly creative ways to use the
Internet in marketing classes are being developed by marketing
instructors around the world.  Some ideas for Internet activities
are provided in the teaching suggestions for each chapter in this
Manual.  Initially, your students can use the Internet to:<p>
<ul>
<li>retrieve information from sources that otherwise might be
     inaccessible to them<p>

<li>work together in teams via e-mail which allows for
     cooperation regardless of the time or the physical location
     of the team members<p>

<li>interact with business professionals and businesses that
     they would be unlikely to contact through conventional
     means<p>

<li>conduct cross-cultural marketing interviews with students in
     other countries<p>

<li>observe how marketing is evolving on the Internet<p>

<li>find new and useful information about marketing careers<p>

<li>develop communication and information retrieval skills that
     employers value and increasingly, expect from entry level
     employees<p>

<li>solve marketing problems and make marketing decisions<p>

<li>receive class assignments and submit completed ones<p>
</ul>

     The Internet is an exciting place and just cruising it,
looking for information and places to visit, can significantly
raise student interest levels.  For many students, class projects
on the Internet are a natural extension from their involvement
with video games and interactive television.<p>
<b>
How Can You Benefit From Using The Internet?</b><p>

     The first and most obvious benefit is that students who
actively participate in class projects typically are more
attentive, involved, and easier to teach.  From personal
experience, I can verify that students working on Internet class
projects become animated about the experience.  I launched two
classes on the Internet when it first became available at my
school.  The four Internet projects my classes worked on during
that first semester totally captivated my students.  Even the
non-marketing majors, who resented having to take a marketing
class at all, became attentive and involved participants in class
discussions and activities.  As a result, these classes were
among the easiest and most enjoyable that I have ever taught.<p>

     A second benefit is the time saved through use of the
Internet.  If you link a class through an e-mail distribution
list, it means that you can send a message to the entire class at
once.  If students are conscientious in checking their e-mail,
this communication link can bypass the need to distribute
assignments by written hard copy in class, where some student
absences can be expected.  You can alert students to a change in
class schedule, remind them about a coming quiz, refer them to a
just published article, or answer individual student's questions
without their having to visit your office.<p>

     There are other benefits to Internet use.  For example, the
marketing instructor can communicate with colleagues in distant
locations via e-mail.  You can sign on to marketing bulletin
boards that often provide interesting teaching ideas.  The
Internet opens a way for the marketing instructor to leave the
campus electronically and interact with business professionals
worldwide.<p>  

<b>Is There A Downside To Internet Use?</b><p>

     Yes, and it is important to fully recognize and plan for
some of the problems associated with Internet use.  Marketing
teachers have an obligation to ensure that their students do not
contribute to Net problems.<p>
<ul>
<li>The Internet is a time trap.  Before you realize it, you
     have spent hours in front of a computer screen cruising Net
     sites.  Students must stay focused on their marketing
     objective in using the Net.  It is an incredibly exciting,
     useful tool to help them learn to solve marketing problems
     and make marketing decisions, not a video game.<p>  

<li>The Internet is virtually unregulated, so behavior sometimes
     gets out of control.  Perhaps you have heard of flames,
     personal attacks by e-mail message that can be disturbing to
     receive and clog electronic (e-mail) boxes.  Students should
     not participate on unmoderated bulletin boards, unless they
     are willing to risk a flaming.  It may be wiser to tell
     students to avoid such places entirely.  They can be a
     terrible waste of time, and disturbing.  Provide your
     students with lessons in Net-etiquette, how to behave on the
     Net, so they can stay out of trouble.  From my personal
     experience, by participating only on moderated professional
     marketing bulletin boards, I have met wonderful, helpful
     marketing professionals who willingly provide their help to
     Newbies (New Net Users).  My students' experiences on the
     Internet have been positive, without incident.<p>

<li>There is no privacy or complete security on the Internet, at
     least, not yet.  Therefore, assume that any message can be
     read by someone other than the sender or receiver.  Advise
     students not to make a purchase on the Net using a credit
     card.  Similarly, they should not give out their address or
     telephone number.<p>

<li> Sex, alcohol, tobacco, and gambling on the Net offend some
     people; several politicians are even beginning to demand
     regulatory controls over Internet traffic content to protect
     children and adults.<p>  

<li>Many schools have limited Internet access points and
     sometimes students have difficulty getting to a computer
     connection.  Therefore, to avoid adding to the problem,
     students should be strongly cautioned to use their time on
     the Internet wisely, avoid entertaining but nonproductive
     side trips, and not become "net nuisances."<p> 
</ul> 
<b>
How Can I Get On The Internet?</b><p>
                 
     If your school provides you with Internet access, there will
be knowledgeable faculty and staff who can help you learn how to
Net-connect.  Once you learn the procedures, you can teach your
students.  Connection through an educational institution
typically is free of charge.<p>

     If your school does not provide free Internet access, you
can connect through a paid commercial service, such as Prodigy,
American On Line (AOL), CompuServe, or soon, AT&T and Microsoft. 
Prices for a monthly subscription to these services and hourly
access rates are decreasing.  Shop around for the best value;
compare their rates and hourly charges.  The commercial services
provide subscribers with the information needed to use their
services and get to the Internet.<p>

<b>What Do I Do First?</b><p>

     Before you can assign Internet marketing activities to your
students, you must become Net proficient.  Get on the Internet
and learn how to use it.  Browse your school or public library
for books on the Internet.  The best way of becoming comfortable
on the Internet is to spend some time in cyberspace.  Once you
become Net proficient, it will become much easier to get your
students on the Net and coach them through Internet assignments.<p>  

     Review the Internet activities in each chapter in this
Manual.  Use these activities as presented, or better yet, adapt
them to your class needs.  With a little time and experience,
you'll be developing your own class Internet marketing activities
and enjoying the experience.  See you on the Net!

<title>Siegel IM - Designing Your Syllabus</title>
</head>
<body background="/gifs/back/sandpapr.gif">
Instructor's Resource Manual to accompany<br>
MARKETING: FOUNDATIONS AND APPLICATIONS<br> 
by Carolyn F. Siegel<br>
Part I    Starting Points<br>
   
<h2>DESIGNING YOUR SYLLABUS</h2>

Many schools offer multiple sections of the introductory
marketing course during a single term (semester or quarter).  To
standardize the course, the instructors make a joint textbook
decision and use a shared syllabus.  In other schools, the
individual instructor is responsible for selecting a textbook and
designing a syllabus.  Whatever your situation, it is important
to plan ahead and schedule topics, assignments, examinations, and
class activities realistically to adapt to the time constraints
of the term, your teaching schedule, and your students'
schedules.<p>  

A syllabus provides important information about the class
that students will need throughout the term.  It is a plan, a
blueprint for how you intend to conduct the course.  It
emphasizes what you think is important and guides students
through their reading, studying, and learning.  A syllabus is a
statement to students about what they can expect, as well as what
is expected of them.  Be sure that every student has a copy of
the syllabus soon after the beginning of the term.  If changes
are made during the semester, as they often are, make sure that
all your students are informed.<p>

Although there are probably as many different syllabus
formats as there are instructors, some general suggestions follow
for the kind of information most often provided in a syllabus. 
For the instructor writing his or her first syllabus, space is
provided for you to follow this guide, enter information, and in
the process, construct a rough draft of a syllabus.  You may not
wish or need to provide all this information.  Decide for
yourself what will benefit your students, while also following
department and school policies on syllabus preparation.<p><p>

Projects = 250 points<br>
Grade:<br>
           A = 90% to 100%<br>
           B = 80% to  89%<br>
           C = 70% to  79%<br>

Human Anatomy is an electronic gallery of images used to simulate a laboratory cadaveric dissection.  The CD contains over 6,000 color photos of the human body in various stages of dissection along with hundreds of hand-drawn illustrations and photos from models and skeletons.  The images mirror the perspectives of the laboratory while supporting text leads the user step-by-step through the dissection process.  An  assessment and feedback  mode enables students to review what they have seen and test their comprehension in one of three methods.  There are  flash cards  which randomly present images of a selected region, a  self-evaluation  with random multiple choice questions about a region, chapter , or structure type chosen by the student, and a  graded exam  which chooses 50 images from a selected region.  The computer logs student responses and gives feedback accordingly.<P>

<BR clear=left>
<hr><i>Redox</i> reactions are among the most important and universal in chemistry. Redox, an
interactive videodisc, allows these extremely dangerous, traditionally expensive and
hard-to-demonstrate chemistry experiments to be safely reviewed as often as needed. 
Through the power of this videodisc, these experiments can be viewed and reviewed until
they have been mastered.  <P>
The videodisc provides students with images of reactions and laboratory equipments that are
not usually available for hands-on experiments.  <P>

The two-sided disc contains 57 experiments.  Among them are: Reaction of Hydrogen and
Chlorine Initiated by Light, Preparation of Oxygen from Mercury (II) Oxide, Ammonia
Oxidation Catalyzed by Platinum, Peroxyacetone Decomposition, Electroplating Chromium,
Vanadium Oxidation States, and Redox Potentials.  <P>

Included with this package is a barcode manual and descriptive listing of all experiments
included on the disc.  A computer     segment also is packaged with the product.

<title>Siegel IM - Some Observations on Teaching</title>

<body background="/gifs/back/sandpapr.gif">
Instructor's Resource Manual to accompany<br>
MARKETING: FOUNDATIONS AND APPLICATIONS<br> 
by Carolyn F. Siegel<br>
Part I    Starting Points<br>

<h2>SOME OBSERVATIONS ON TEACHING</h2>

All of us can learn to be better teachers.  We learn from
our colleagues, by participating in professional activities,
through reading, and perhaps what is most important, from our
students.  Some teaching tips I have learned include:<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Know Your Students</b>:  Whether you are teaching marketing for
     the first or fortieth time, analyze the students taking your
     class.  For many if not most, their first marketing class is
     also their last.  Marketing is a required course in most
     business schools for students from all business majors. 
     Students from non-business majors often take marketing as an
     elective.  Be prepared to teach an eclectic group of student
     majors.  Keep this in mind throughout the term, because this
     diversity of majors, and also the mixture of traditional and
     non-traditional students, and students from different races
     and cultures, will show up in differing student expectations
     about the course.  Be sure that you use examples that are
     meaningful to all students.  Bring in relevant current
     articles to stimulate their interest in marketing.  Give
     them an opportunity to share their observations and points
     of view.<p>  

<li><b>Vary Your Teaching Methods</b>:  Although many instructors
     prefer to use the lecture method of teaching, others have
     found greater success with more interactive methods,
     particularly individual and team projects.  A mixture of
     methods brings variety to the classroom.  Your teaching
     methods must be appropriate to class size, student
     characteristics, instructor preferences, and goals for the
     class.  While class size is an important factor in deciding
     teaching methods, it should not be the only factor.  One of
     the most lively class discussions I have observed occurred
     with an incredibly dynamic teacher and a lecture section of
     almost 300 students!  On the other hand, one of the dullest
     class sessions was an instructor reading straight from the
     textbook to a class of twenty students.  Students learn best
     by doing, which is why so many short, uncomplicated
     Marketing Application activities are presented in the text. 
     Assign the ones that are the most meaningful for your
     students and appropriate to your teaching situation.  Don't
     overwhelm your students with too many activities; don't deny
     them meaningful learning opportunities by scheduling too
     few.<p>  

<li><b>Show Enthusiasm</b>: You have a greater chance of getting
     students excited about marketing if you express your
     enthusiasm for the subject.  One suggestion for keeping your
     enthusiasm high is to stay up-to-date in the field.  Read
     current journals and periodicals to find interesting and
     timely marketing stories to bring to class.  Participate in
     professional meetings where you can share your experiences
     and learn from others.  Invite stimulating guest speakers to
     class.  Marketing professionals can enthrall students with
     their anecdotes and provide useful observations about
     marketing careers.  Whatever you do, don't get into a
     teaching rut where you teach the same thing, the same way,
     every term.  Be creative in how you teach.  Challenge
     yourself to try new approaches and seek fresh perspectives.<p> 

<li><b>Be Organized</b>:  Focus on what you want to accomplish in each
     class and for the term.  Come to class prepared!  Plan ahead
     and plan carefully what you will do in each class.  Clearly
     introduce the topic under discussion and remind students 
     what comes next.  Change your syllabus when necessary to
     reflect unexpected opportunities as well as scheduling
     conflicts.  Set aside enough time to grade student work
     promptly and provide students with meaningful feedback so
     they can learn from their mistakes.  Don't procrastinate and
     don't expect students to be organized if you're not.<p>  

<li><b>Get The Most Out Of Your Class</b>:  If you want to have lively
     class discussions and active student participation, then you
     have to establish an open, receptive class environment.  You
     stand a far greater chance of involving students in
     marketing if they feel comfortable expressing themselves in
     class.  Intimidation is not a good teaching method;
     coaching, mentoring, and positive encouragement will
     typically have far better results.  Know your role as an
     instructor and be comfortable with it.  Develop your own
     teaching style and continually improve it.  Hold high
     expectations for yourself and your students; you will both
     rise to the occasion.  Challenge your students to succeed
     and their success will reflect favorably on you.<p>

<I>Explorations in Health & Psychology</I> allows your students to actively investigate vital
processes as they should be explored with movement, color, sound, and interaction. Your
students will learn about the physical basis of drug addiction at the synaptic level by
exploring how cocaine directly affects a nerve.  This simulation lets the student vary the
amount and frequency of cocaine used and examine how patterns of drug use impact
addiction.
<a href="gifs/health2.gif"><img border=2 align=left hspace=15 vspace=10 src="smgifs/s_health2.gif"></a><P>
<I>Explorations</I> also features a module that enables the teacher or student to select activity levels
for the day, enter the foods to be eaten at each meal, then see the calories and total grams of
carbohydrates, proteins, and fats tallied.  Usage of this module determines how weight is
gained or lost by altering diet and activity patterns.

<h1>PART IV - ADDITIONAL MINI-CASES</h1>

<h3><b>Introduction</b></h3>

 Any mini-case in this section can be duplicated and used in your class
<ul>
<li>to substitute for a mini-case in the textbook<p>
<li>to complement a textbook mini-case<p>
<li>as a quiz or part of an examination<p>
<li>as an in-class, small team activity that can be used in case you are unexpectedly absent from school<p>
</ul>
At the beginning of each term, I write a mini-case that can be used in class in case I can't get to school.  My commute to campus in the winter is sometimes delayed or blocked because of icy road conditions.  Even though the weather may be dreadful, school is rarely cancelled because so many students live on or near campus.  Therefore, having a mini-case on hand for students to work in my absence means I am prepared, even if not physically present.<p>

     Each mini-case in this section has extra questions, which makes them more versatile and appropriate to different topical areas.  Add questions of your own to personalize the case and add immediacy to class discussions.<p>

<title>Mini-Case:Product Licensing</title>
</head>
<body background="/gifs/back/sandpapr.gif">


<h2>Mini-Case:  Product Licensing Is A Big Risk Business For Marketers </h2>
     
     At the Licensing Show, the product licensing industry's annual convention, the big question in 1995 meant trying to guess what would be the product licensing success of 1996.  Product licensing occurs when the owner of a patented product, such as a movie or a television character, grants another company the right to use it on their products.  An up-front licensing fee and a percent of sales and are paid to the patent owner.  The percent of sales typically ranges from five to 15 percent; licensing up-front fees can range from several thousand to hundreds of thousands of dollars.<p>  

     In case you're thinking that licensing is a silly part of marketing, consider the sales figures.  In 1994, licensed products in the U.S. and Canada accounted for $70 billion in sales, a 5 percent increase over the previous year.  Product licensing can mean millions of dollars in sales for many companies, and billions for the major players.  Walt Disney is the biggest winner in product licensing, with annual sales from licensed retail products of $15 billion.  Other licensed products typically have more transitory life spans, lasting for one or several years, then fading away.  For example, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles racked up sales of over $5 billion from 1987 through 1994, but by 1995 were no longer the really hot item of past years.  Estimates for other recent product licensing successes are Cabbage Patch, $4 billion, 1983-1994; Star Wars, $2.6+ billion, 1978-1983; and Simpsons, $2.0+ billion, 1989-1994 (Goldman 1995). <p> 
     
     Licensing has its risks.  Licensed products for movies that flop can seriously hurt sales.  Even though the Flintstones movie was aggressively marketed, fans stayed away and retailers were left with large amounts of licensed Flintstones products.  The same fate met "The Pagemaster" and "The Jetsons", whose licensed products were rejected just as children rejected the movies.  There is a risk to the patent holder, who must carefully guard against licensing shoddy or dangerous products that create a negative image or result in damage suits, and counterfeiters, that reduce licensing profits and often leave consumers with inferior merchandise.  Too many product tie-ins and fast food promotions can dilute profits and confuse consumers (Stanley 1995).  Demand can be overestimated and licensed characters can lose their allure, particularly if there is a delay in getting licensed products to market (Fitzgerald 1992).<p>

     Retailers who are considering stocking licensed products must carefully evaluate the products' profit potential.  They must also look at scheduling and how the products fit into seasonal merchandise selection.  Looking ahead, retailers must think about when markdowns will be needed and a product termination decision made (Lettich 1993).<p>

     While most Disney licensed products, and those linked to other recent successes, are targeted to a youth market, some marketers are trying to extend their success to adult markets.  Instead of lunch boxes, action figures, drinking glasses, puppets, sun glasses, and tee-shirts, adult product licensing can be much more costly and sophisticated.  The return of James Bond, with a new agent 007 in the movie "GoldenEye", also introduces a licensed $30,000 BMW roadster for adults who want to drive a Bond car just like the one in the movie (Warner 1995).  Licensing partners for the 007 film include BMW, Citgo gasoline, Perrier, and Yves Saint Laurent, who is introducing a spy line of cosmetics.  Other adult-oriented licensing movie tie-in ventures are for the exciting "Apollo 13" and the romantic "The Bridges of Madison County."<p>
     
     In Atlanta, Georgia, hosts of the 1996 Summer Olympic Games are hoping that licensed products will go a long way toward retiring the expected $1.6 billion that the Games will cost the host city (Goldgaber 1995).  Most retail sales of licensed Olympic products are expected to occur during the 17 days that the games run.  The U.S. Olympics Committee is aggressively stopping any unlicensed vendors trying to bootleg the Olympics to use on their products without authorization.<p>      

    
<b><a name="questionsb">Mini-Case Questions</a></b>
<ul>
<li>What types of products would you recommend for licensing with the romantic movie "The Bridges of Madison County?"  Explain your answers.<p>

<li>What types of products might license well with the exciting, heroic movie "Apollo 13?"<p>

<li>"Most children's licensed products are designed for impulse purchases."  Explain that statement.  Do you agree/disagree?<p>

<li>Compared to the amount of product licensing targeted to youth markets, there has been relatively little targeted to adults.  Why do you think this is so?<p>

<li>Why do product marketers seek licensing agreements from those who hold a patent?<p>

<li>Why do children like licensed products?<p>

<li>Why do movie studios like to license their products?<p>

<li>What makes a character, movie, event, or person marketable for licensing?<p>

<li>Product placement, where a business pays a movie studio to place its products visibly in a movie, is big business.  From the product marketer's standpoint, in the end does it accomplish the same thing (if it works) as product licensing?<p>

<li>Do you think some adults will feel that "cashing-in" on a movie like "Apollo 13" or "The Bridges of Madison County" will turn adult consumers away; that they will reject what they perceive as crass commercialism?<p>

<li>What is the marketer's role in promoting licensed products?  How are licensed products targeted at children promoted?  Take as your example PepsiCo's "Casper" promotions, McDonald's "Batman Forever" promotions, or any of the promotions for Disney's "The Lion King".<p>

<li>Consider the statement, "Children are the most unforgiving and fickle audience for licensed products."  Explain what this means to a marketer planning a promotion for licensed products targeted to children.<p>

<li>Can good promotions for licensed products, and the success of those products, help a movie that has been doing poorly at the box office?<p>

<li>What effect can bootlegged (unlicensed products that have illegally used a licensed character or image) products have on a licensee's profits?  On a retailer's profits? <p> 

<li>Do you think the Atlantic Olympic Committee will clear enough profits to retire the city debt from hosting the Olympics?  Explain why/why not.<p>

<li>Geographically, what locations will probably contribute the greatest profits for Olympic merchandisers?<p>

<li>Can Olympics' licensed products be sold worldwide?  What will affect their sales internationally?<p>

<li>Why do some licensed products fail to produce the volume of sales originally projected?<p>

<title>Mini-Case: Multilevel Marketing</title>
</head>
<body background="/gifs/back/sandpapr.gif">



<h2>Mini-Case:  Multilevel Marketing - Vilified Or Just Plain Vile? </h2>

Have you ever purchased Herbalife, Mary Kay Cosmetics, Tupperware, Amway, or other products from a friend, acquaintance, or business contact?  These products are among the hundreds, if not thousands, sold through a direct distribution strategy known as multilevel marketing.  Some critics think it is a legal, sanitized version of illegal pyramid schemes (Tillson 1994); others think it is a great way to realize their entrepreneurial ambitions and reap rewards far greater than they could realize working in an office (Dunkel 1995).  The Direct Selling Association estimates that there are over three million multilevel salespeople in the United States, an increase of 0.8 million since 1990 (Mehta 1995).  Amway is the largest, with a domestic sales force of about one million.<p>

     A multilevel marketing (MLM) program builds on personal contacts to extend the number of people selling a product.  Friends, family, business contacts, and even strangers are recruited to become distributors.  For each person the seller recruits, he or she gets a percent of the recruits' sales (a sales commission), as well as profits from their own sales.  The more recruits a person signs up, the more the profits.  Some distributors make more money from their commissions than from sales.<p>

     Although many laws prevent fraud and misrepresentation in MLM recruiting, it is difficult for law enforcement authorities to keep up with the growing numbers of MLM operations in the United States and Canada (Tillson 1994).  It is a controversial practice that is the subject of lawsuits and investigations (Mehta 1995).<p>

     Most MLM programs require their distributors to purchase a minimum quantity of products each month, so if a distributor fails to make any sales, their personal product inventory builds.  Some critics say these products are overpriced, which contributes to the general bad reputation of MLMs (Mehta 1995).<p> 

     Late entrants into an MLM operation in a specific geographic area often have difficulty making sales quotas and recruiting new distributors because they face a saturated market.  Therefore, while the MLM program's originators and early entrants at the top of the pyramid may profit enormously, later recruits at the base of the pyramid may gain few profits or even incur losses.<p>   

     Because multilevel marketing offers entrepreneurial opportunities, the number of college-educated women entering these businesses is increasing (Dunkel 1995).  Some MLM direct-sales distributors say that the programs give them an opportunity to be "self-responsible" for their own success (Coulombe 1994).  Others take up an MLM distributorship to gain free time and freedom, meaning control over their work situation.  Some prefer MLM marketing because they have difficulty working for large corporations.  Others enjoy the involvement in a company that offers a sense of belonging and regularly has sales meetings to bolster commitment and enthusiasm.<p>

     Multilevel marketing is expanding rapidly internationally.  In Japan, Nu Skin reports almost 70,000 distributors and Amway reportedly has over one million (Yarnell 1994).  Japan lends itself to MLM operations because of the importance of relationship marketing to the society and the widespread popularity of door-to-door sales.<p>

     What should a person look for if they are considering becoming a direct-market distributor?  Company characteristics are important, particularly if it is driven by income or equity concerns (Yarnell 1994).  The product should be unique and one that consumers will want to purchase.  The distribution should be solely through the MLM network and not competing with in-store sales.  Products that are sold through MLM programs include cosmetics, toiletries, vitamins and other health products, diet aids, pain relief gadgets, jewelry, plastic containers, long-distance telephone service, and satellite television services.<p>


<b><a name="questionsc">Mini-Case Questions</a></b>

<ul>

<li>Is multilevel marketing right for everyone?  Define some of the characteristics that you think a really successful MLM distributor should have in order to profit?<p>

<li>Is MLM legal; is it ethical?  Explain your answers.<p>

<li>What are some of the risks of MLMs?<p>

<li>What attracts some people to MLMs?<p>

<li>Do you think MLMs will succeed in other countries as well as they have in Japan?  Explain your answer.<p>

<li>Why are more people becoming MLM distributors?<p>

<li>Do you think an MLM distributor would be upset to learn that the MLM parent company plans to start offering its products in retail stores and mail catalogs?  Explain your answer.<p>

<li>Are there some products than could be sold in an MLM operation more effectively than others?  Explain your answer.<p>

<li>As more well educated people become MLM distributors, do you think this will change the current downscale image of MLM operations?<p>

<li>Why do MLM distributors at the bottom of the pyramid benefit the least?<p>

<li>Why do distributors at the top of the pyramid benefit most?<p>

<title>Mini-case: Internet Appeal</title>
</head>
<body background="/gifs/back/sandpapr.gif">


<h2>Mini-Case:  Internet Appeal, Is It For Everyone?</h2>

     Articles about the Internet seem to be appearing everywhere, in business magazines, on television and radio, and in the newspapers. The popular press is enthralled by what's happening in cyberspace.  Lots of people are buzzing around, but what happens when they tire of hopping from one Web site to another?  Does the Internet have "staying" power?  What will it take to get people to visit a Web site two, three, or more times?  More critically, what will it take to get them to make a purchase?<p>  

     Part of the Web's problem is that, as a very new entity, it is still relatively undefined.  It is yet to be determined if the Web is an advertising medium, communication channel, information retrieval system, Cybercatalog, or vast yellow pages directory.  Or, is it all of these and more?<p>  

     If novelty is what it takes to get repeat visitors, then hold tight, 3-D is coming!  Cyberspace visitors with graphical browsers and sound cards already can download pictures, text, sound, and video.  Soon, they'll be able to add 3-D (Meyer 1995).  Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML) will translate 3-D images on the Web using such 3-D viewers as WebSpace and supplemental programs for Netscape and Mosaic.  The 3-D technology will allow cybershoppers to see products, turn them around on the computer screen, and inspect all sides.  Cybershoppers purchasing tickets for a basketball game, play, or orchestra performance will get a 3-D view of their scope of vision from the seats, as if they were actually there.  This technology offers a sense of realism that the Internet currently lacks.<p>   

     There are many marketplaces on the Web, but far too many of them are dull.  They look and feel like brochures slapped onto computer screens.  Critics equate them to junk mail or drive-by billboards (Ziegler).  However, some creative sites are attracting notice and several appeal to Cybersports.  The ESPNET SportsZone, at http://espnet.sportszone.com, is an exciting resource for sports information, excelling in writing, graphics, depth, and immediacy (Mossberg 1995).  It offers news stories, scores, game highlights, statistics, graphics, player information, and real time narratives of games as they are played.  The strategy of this site is to continue offering a free public area, but later expand into a select, subscription area that will require a fee for entry.<p>

     Many Web visitors will return because of the services offered.  For example, customers shipping parcels using Federal Express Corp. and United Parcel Service of American, Inc. can check the status of their delivery on the Web (Ziegler 1995).  They access the appropriate Web site, follow simple tracking instructions, and type in the number of their shipment.  Others may want to use Web financial services, for example mutual fund owners can visit a site that will help them calculate their potential investment earnings.  Cybershoppers can track stocks on the Web and even purchase them through traditional brokers who have set up shop in cyberspace.  Others will enjoy tapping into cybernews that can help them make business decisions (Wildstrom 1995).<p>

     Some Web visitors will return because they need and want information.  If so, they may be hooked by information on the Web, and particularly by a new Web source.  The Encyclopaedia Britannica, one of the world's preeminent information sources, is beta testing a Web site.  The computer CD Britannica, at 44 million words, vastly out-informs most other computerized encyclopedias, at 8 to 9 million words (Jones, Springen and Sawhill 1995).  It is expected that the Web Britannica will also outweigh its competitors.<p>

     Americans are much more oriented toward interactive shopping on the Internet than their European cousins.  While some worry about what it will take to keep Americans on the Web, others worry about what it will take to get Europeans there.  Europeans are far less interested in video on-demand over the Internet.  While 43 percent of American consumers say they are "very interested" in this service, only 19 percent of the consumers in France and Britain feel the same way (Parker-Pope 1995).  While 75 percent of U.S. households owning a VCR rent at least one video a month, in Western Europe the number drops to under 40 percent.  Only in France, which has enjoyed interactive shopping services through telephone terminal connections for years, is there almost as much interest in home shopping as there is in the United States.<p>

<title>Mini-case: Change or Die</title>
</head>
<body background="/gifs/back/sandpapr.gif">


<h2>Mini-Case:  Change Or Die - Even Market Leaders Feel The Heat</h2>

An old saying goes, "You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make him drink!"  Can this be applied to American's eating habits, as well?  The Center for Science in the Public Interest says most fast foods are too fatty and not good for your health (Sullivan 1995).  The Center has found fault with traditional fast food burgers and fries, Chinese food, and Mexican food, reporting that deep fried burritos and cheese-laden dishes have as much fat as 10 glazed doughnuts (de Lisser 1995).<p>  

America's love of greasy fast foods is held accountable for the third of all U.S. citizens who are overweight.  Yet most people seem to lack the willpower to eat a salad in a place where they can smell the fries and watch others chomp down on a 640 calorie Whopper, or a 510 calorie Big Mac, with its 26 grams of fat.  Will they change their eating habits voluntarily?  Can the fast food chains get them to change?<p>

Many chains have tried to develop good tasting, low fat menu alternatives, only to fail.  Weight Watchers' dietetic foods were sold in Burger King stores for only a short time before being cancelled.   McDonald's McLean Deluxe never caught on after its introduction in 1991, and some franchisees have taken it off their menus (Sullivan 1995).  It is said that some industry analysis dubbed it the McFlopper (de Lisser 1995).  However, McDonald's does offer McGrilled Chicken and lite salad dressing.  Arby's allows its restaurants the option of not offering low-fat items, and 40 percent don't (Sullivan 1995).<p>

As if further proof is needed of America's love of big, beefy hamburgers and crisp fires, McDonald's is serving up  sandwiches with "double the beef", coupled with Super Sized drinks and fries (Gibson 1995).  PepsiCo's Pizza Hut is offering Stuffed Crust pizza, with extra cheese baked into the outside edge of crust (Rudnitsky 1995).  And Wendy's is known for loading on the cheese, bacon, sauce, and extra beef.<p>       

Bucking the trend, PepsiCo's Taco Bell, a low price leader in fast food, is trying to become a low fat leader, as well.  Taco Bell led the industry into a low price, value strategy when it introduced a "value menu" in 1989.  It is trying to do the same with low fat foods.  If it succeeds, it will break away from the competition and reap large profits.<p>

Taco Bell's strategy with its Border Lights menu is to offer reduced fat versions of items on the regular menu.  The low fat versions will be priced the same, but without the fat.  Taco Bell is aggressively targeting the fat conscious consumer, and where others have failed, it intends to succeed.<p> 

If we are what we eat, then Americans might want to take a lesson from the Chinese.  Traditional medicinal restaurants are enjoying a revival of popularity in Chinese communities.  Many Chinese seek out these restaurants for foods that may cure health problems.  A customer comes into a health restaurant and tells the host what ails him.  The host listens carefully, then prescribes the customer's lunch (Brauchli 1995).  For someone recuperating from a recent operation, the host may give them chicken soup with ginseng and splayed gecko lizards to improve blood circulation and stimulate the formation of new blood cells.  If you have swollen neck glands, your lunch may be chicken and seahorse stew; for dizziness, fried rice with wolfberries (Brauchli 1995).<p> 


<b><a name="questionse">Mini-Case Questions</a></b>

<ul>

<li>Is McDonald's right in pursuing a strategy of offering double hamburgers and super size fries to cater to "large" appetites?<p>

<li>Does Taco Bell have a good strategy with its low fat line?<p>

<li>Why don't older consumers pay greater attention to health warnings?<p>

<li>Why are younger consumers (teens, twentysomethings) ignoring health warnings about fatty foods?<p>

<li>How much influence do restaurant smells and the sight of others eating hamburgers and fries have on consumers trying to stick to a low fat diet?<p>

<li>Do consumers ignore low fat fast foods because they think they won't taste good?  What does perception have to do with their reluctance?  How could promotions be designed to remove this stigma?<p>

<li>What do you think are the chances that Taco Bell can establish a sustainable competitive advantage with their Border Lights strategy?  What will it take for them to do so?  What will the competition do if Taco Bell is successful?<p>

<li>A recent survey showed that 83 percent of China's teens daily consume medicinal tonics to improve and protect their health (Brauchli 1995).  Will they also like Big Macs and Whoppers when those chains establish restaurants in China? <p>

<li>Many Americans enjoy Chinese restaurants in the United States.  Do you think there might be a market for traditional Chinese health restaurants here?<p>

<title>Mini-case: World Car</title>
</head>
<body background="/gifs/back/sandpapr.gif">


<h2>Mini-Case:  Does The World Need Or Want A World Car?</h2>
   
The ambitious Ford 2000 Plan calls for the merger of Ford's operations in the United States and Europe, and later the Asian and Latin American organizations into one, giant, global corporation (Flint 1994).  The goal is to eventually integrate Ford designs and production so that Ford's world cars can be built anywhere, in any Ford plant, using one set of basic designs with only modest local variations.  The same platform, design, and manufacturing processes that Ford Europe uses to build small cars will also be used in the United States; U.S. Ford plants will focus on larger cars and trucks, which many be marketed worldwide.  The goal is to achieve cost savings through the increased efficiency that comes with engineering a car only once.  Ford is pushing its global strategy of bigger-is-better.<p>

Ford has already tried producing a world car, the Escort. However, while the Escort has been successful in Europe, it hasn't made money in the United States, even when modifications were made to make it more appealing to American consumers.  Ford has higher expectations for the Mondeo, Ford Contour, and Mercury Mystique.  These three models come from common ancestry, starting with the European version, the Mondeo, and progressing to the Contour and Mystique, which were introduced in the United States in September 1994.  The Mondeo was launched in Europe in 1993 and is very popular with Europeans, already selling over 600,000 units.  It cost Ford $6 billion over six years to develop the three cars (McElroy 1994).<p>

Some automobile marketing analysts believe that Ford may be going in the wrong direction.  Other automobile companies are taking the opposite strategy and spinning off regional units.  These smaller production centers are closer to the markets they will be courting.  Their more narrowly focused plants are positioned to deliver mass customized cars tailored to satisfy cultural differences and smaller market segments.  Decisions will be made at these regional production sites to deal with differences in work processes, consumers, and government regulations.  Lee Iacocca, former president of both Chrysler and Ford, questions Ford's decision, as he doubts that one product group can make decisions for both the North American and European continents (Flint 1994).<p>   

Ford's launch of its world cars in the United States was hampered by production problems; recalls, that left dealers without products and consumers with questions in their minds about the cars' reliability; high lease prices; and confusing product positioning.  The initial advertising campaign proudly declared that the Contour was the world's first "global car", but consumers seemed confused by what this meant.  They certainly weren't impressed with the claim.  Industry observers quickly criticized the car's positioning and its relatively high lease costs (Connelly 1995).<p>  

Because sales were weak throughout the fall, Ford decided to relaunch the cars in early 1995, with aggressive print advertisements that moved away from the "world car" theme and began promoting the Contour's value, as more car for less money (Warner and Suris 1995).  Ford's advertising agency for the Contour, J. Walter Thompson, concentrated on safety features, performance features, and competitive pricing (Halliday 1995).<p>

Ford's goal for 1995 was to sell 200,000 Contours, yet its sales were averaging below 13,000 per month.  Goals for the Mystique, were about 70,000 units annually, but its sales were averaging less than 3,000 per month.  When global production gears up, Ford plans to sell 800,000 Mondeo, Contour, and Mystique cars annually (Jost 1994).<p>

     
<b><a name="questionsf">Mini-Case Questions</a></b>

<ul>

<li>Are Ford's goals for the Contour and Mystique realistic?<p>

<li>What went wrong with Ford's initial strategy for marketing the Contour in the United States?<p>

<li>Is Lee Iacocca right, is Ford moving in the wrong direction?<p>

<li>Is Ford's strategy one of "Think global, act local?"<p>

<li>What are some problems that Ford can expect from centralizing its decision making?<p>

<li>What are some advantages that Ford's competitors can realize from decentralizing?<p>

<li>Does the world really need and want a world car?<p>

<li>Do American consumers really need and want a world car?  What do initial sales indicate?<p>

<title>Siegel IM - What To Do On The First Day</title>
</head>
<body background="/gifs/back/sandpapr.gif">
Instructor's Resource Manual to accompany<br>
MARKETING: FOUNDATIONS AND APPLICATIONS<br> 
by Carolyn F. Siegel<br>
Part I    Starting Points<br>
   
<h2>WHAT TO DO ON THE FIRST DAY</h2>
              
     Even a marketing instructor who has seen many first days can
usually remember the <b>very first</b>.  It's often a time for sweaty
palms and considerable nervousness.  Some hints for the first day
may be helpful for those facing it.  I can't promise that these
suggestions will cure all first day jitters, but this is the
routine that I follow each term, and it works for me!<p>
<ul>
<li><b><i>Be prepared</i></b>!  Make sure that copies of the syllabus are
     ready before class in sufficient numbers, usually with
     several extra copies for students who enrolled late.  Check
     the classroom in advance and count desks; if there aren't
     enough, bring in extra chairs.  If you intend to use the
     chalkboard, make sure you have chalk and an eraser.  If you
     plan to use equipment, such as an overhead projector, check
     to be sure there is one in the room and it works.  Position
     your transparency on the glass so that everyone in the room
     can see it.  If you need to use a wall screen, be sure you
     can reach the cord.  If you plan to use a lectern (podium),
     make sure it is at the correct height.<p>

<li><b><i>Check your roll before class</i></b>.  Say each name aloud before
     class.  If you are unsure of a pronunciation, check with the
     student in class as you call the roll.  Mark the phonetic
     pronunciation of unusual names on your roll so you can
     pronounce the name correctly at the next roll call.<p>

<li><b><i>Come to class on time</i></b>.  Coming late, particularly on the
     first day, sends students a very negative message.<p>  

<li><b><i>Firmly take charge</i></b>.  If students are talking when you come
     into the room, which is fairly typical, confidently walk to
     the lectern and greet them.  Welcome them to the class, tell
     them your name and the course title.  As you call the roll,
     ask for their help in correcting your pronunciation of their
     name.  At the end of the roll call, ask any student whose
     name was not called to come forward.  Write their name in an
     appropriate place on the roll.  If you intend to have
     students complete an information card on the first day of
     class, come equipped with enough cards.  Be prepared to
     write on the chalkboard or have a transparency master ready
     with the information on it that each student will be asked
     to provide.<p>

<li><b><i>Distribute your syllabus</i></b>.  Make sure that each student has a
     syllabus.  Carefully go over each point.  Ask for questions
     at anytime.  Emphasize the important points and clearly
     state the assignment for the next class meeting, referring
     to the syllabus.  Ask if anyone has a copy of the textbook
     with them.  Have them show the book to the class, so
     students who haven't purchased it will know what to look for
     in the bookstore.<p>

<li><b><i>Break the ice</i></b>. Everyone is a little on edge the first day. 
     To break the ice, you might share some observations about
     marketing, perhaps why you find it so interesting.  Briefly
     mention your academic or professional marketing experiences. 
     Students usually enjoy learning something about their
     instructors, so a brief biography of your marketing-related
     experiences should be well received.  Alternately, if your
     class is relatively small, ask each student to share some
     information about himself or herself, particularly about
     marketing work experiences and career goals.<p>

<li><b><i>Plan an orderly dismissal</i></b>.  When it is time to leave, tell
     the class that you look forward to seeing them again at the
     next class meeting.  Make it clear that <b>you</b> are dismissing
     the class.  Set the precedent from the first day that it is
     the instructor and not the clock that signals the end of a
     session.<p> 

<li><b><i>Try to relax</i></b>.  Most marketing instructors survive their very
     first day.  All of us know we can do it better next time! 
     Set that as your goal and learn from your mistakes.  Keep
     the first day in perspective.  While it is important to
     start firmly, relax and try to share a laugh or two with the
     class, particularly if you feel comfortable telling a joke
     on yourself.  Never tell a joke at the expense of a student.<p>
</ul>

<i>Enzymes</i>: The biological importance of enzymes becomes apparent as this    program vividly
reveals how enzymes work to sustain life.  This program      examines: functions of enzymes
in living cells; chemical reaction; catalyst; substrates; energy of activation; enzyme structure
including amino acid chains, active site, and relative size of an enzyme; the lock-and-key
model and the induced fit model; enzyme activity; factors affecting enzyme activity including
temperature, pH, enzyme concentration, substrate concentration, cofactors, competitive
inhibitors, and noncompetitive inhibitors.

<h2>American Goverment Videodisc</h2>

<h4>Videodisc #23028</h4>
<BR clear=left>
<hr>This interactive videodisc, from Brown & Benchmark Publishers, utilizes videoclips from
C-SPAN and other sources, allowing students to experience what happens on the floor of
Congress, in committees, and elsewhere in Washington. 

A time line traces the development of campaign finance and related legislation from the
passage of the Civil Service Act in 1883.  By selecting a particular event, the student will
bring up more information on screen.  Your students will learn about lawmaking and
policymaking processes with a graphical flow chart.  High-quality graphics and text show
various steps in the process.  A chart representing the steps is displayed on screen.  By
clicking on the rectangle representing any of the steps, more information including
video becomes available to the user.  A glossary of terms also is included.

Side one covers the legislative and policymaking process within Congress and elsewhere,
using campaign finance as a specific example.  Side two includes five topics: the budgetary
process, civil rights, lobbying, the North American Free Trade Agreement, and the Supreme
Court. <EM>American Government</EM> also includes software that enables you, via Hypercard, to
operate your videodisc in conjunction with your Macintosh computer.

With <EM>Interactive Physics II</EM>, experiments and demonstrations are as quick and simple as you
want them to be, and as sophisticated as you need them to be.  This simple interface lets
beginners jump right in.  The advanced simulation engine gives you an effective tool for
investigation.  <P>

<EM>Interactive Physics</EM> is an electronic blackboard  where drawings are animated to quickly
simulate realistic motion.  The interface is so easy to use that a beginner can start
immediately by drawing objects, then defining parameters such as mass, friction, gravity, air
resistance, electrostatics and elasticity.  Constraints such as springs, gear,       pulleys, ropes
and motors can be selected to act on the simulation objects according to their designated
parameters.  <P>
<a href="gifs/physics3.gif"><img border=2 align=left hspace=15 vspace=10 src="smgifs/s_phys3.gif"></a>
The advanced engine calculates the motion of the system and displays it in smooth animation. 
Meters can be selected to automatically display simulation information in graphical or digital
format as the   simulation runs.  Tabular Data Input lets users run experiments in the lab,
hook the collected data into <EM>Interactive Physics</EM> through standard formats such as Excel, and
simulate the experiment on a computer to compare real results with simulation-     generated
results.<P>
This is physics as it should be.  You're no longer limited by the contents of your equipment
room, or by friction, or by     gravity, or by time, or by      complexity, or by your fixed
frame of reference. <a href="gifs/physics4.gif"><img border=2 align=right hspace=15 vspace=10 
src="smgifs/s_phys4.gif"></a> You can perform virtually any experiment, model and problem,
demonstrate any principle, all in clear, smooth,      animated simulations.  With all these
tools at your fingertips, you can demonstrate principles with great clarity, and explore new
questions with unparalleled flexibility.<P>

<EM>Interactive Physics</EM> is powerful and intuitive, offering advanced collision detection and
accuracy checking technology to ensure reliable data.  You can choose from a combination of
accuracy settings to meet the need of simulations performed.

<BR>Imagine volcanoes erupting before your students' eyes, or witnessing a formation of a star! 
Now, it is possible with the help of <I>Physical Geology</I>, created by Wm. C. Brown Publishers.
This CD-ROM         contains 21 chapters with material ranging from the motion of plates,
to the growth of crystals from melt, to the weathering and erosion of Earth's surfaces. 
Whether used as a lecture supplement or as a student tutorial, this software's many color
animations help teach some of the most fundamental geological processes and capture the    imagination of today's visually oriented students.  
<a href="gifs/geo5.gif"><img border=2 align=left hspace=15 vspace=10 src="smgifs/s_geo5.gif"></a><P>
Students using this software actively participate by answering questions that vary in level of
difficulty, rather than      passively absorbing information.

<h1>ITD Computing Resources</h1>
<h2>Computers</h2>
ITD has hundreds of workstations and personal computers linked
by an extensive network.  Many of these machines are in specialized
facilities.
Most of these resources belong to the various branches and are used
primarily for work performed within those branches.
A few more widely available resources are listed here.
Follow the hyperlinks for more information.
<ul>
<li><i>itd.nrl.navy.mil</i> is a system operated by
and in support of the Division as a whole.  Users of this system
can access
<a href="../SYS/itd.html">local documentation</a>.
Persons who have a relationship with the Division can request
an account by sending e-mail to
<em>accounts@itd.nrl.navy.mil</em>.
<li>NRL's backbone fiber optic network, much of NRL's "big iron", and
a Visualization Laboratory are
operated by Code 5590, the <a href="http://www.nrl.navy.mil/ccs.html">Center
for Computational Science</a>.
These resources
are used by researchers from all parts of NRL as well as from outside NRL.
<li>A Virtual Reality Laboratory is operated by Code 5580, the
<a href="http://www.ait.nrl.navy.mil/about-ait.html">Advanced Information Technology Branch</a>.
</ul>
<h2>Internet Domains</h2>
<dl>
<dt><i>nrl.navy.mil</i>
<dd>The primary domain for computers at NRL.
Some ITD computers (mostly operated by codes
<a href="http://www.nrl.navy.mil/ccs.html">5592, 5594, and 5595</a>)
have names in this domain, but most ITD machines are instead
in one of the following subdomains.
Each subdomain below has a primary machine whose name is the same as
the name of the subdomain.  (For historical reasons, a few other machines
in the subdomains have aliases in <i>nrl.navy.mil</i>.)
<dt><i>aic.nrl.navy.mil</i>
<dd><a href="http://www.aic.nrl.navy.mil">Code 5510</a>.
<dt><i>ait.nrl.navy.mil</i>
<dd><a href="http://www.ait.nrl.navy.mil/about-ait.html">Code 5580</a>.
<dt><i>cmf.nrl.navy.mil</i>
<dd><a href="http://www.nrl.navy.mil/ccs.html">Code 5590, especially 5591 and 5593</a>.
<dt><i>itd.nrl.navy.mil</i>
<dd>All other Codes within the Division.
</dl>
<p>
A few other subdomains are managed by other parts of NRL.

<a href="#[3.0]" NAME="[2.0]"><b>[2.0]</b></a>  One of the goals of the ONR European Office (ONREUR) is to
facilitate liaison, communication, and discussions of research
issues and progress among scientists on both sides of the Atlantic.
Toward this end I organized the ONR Data Visualization Workshop
which was held last July at the Fraunhofer Institute for Computer
Graphics in Darmstadt, Germany.  The workshop's sponsors were
ONREUR and the Computer Science Division of ONR.  The 30 attendees
included 16 members from Western Europe, 10 from the U.S., and 4
from Russia and the Far East.  The intent of the workshop was to
survey recent progress in scientific visualization and especially
to examine research requirements.
<P>

Members of the Workshop's working subgroups have continued their
efforts through the fall.  The result is a set of articles that
will appear next month as a Special Section of IEEE CG&A.  Some
Realization Report readers had a preview in the October 1993
Special Issue of the Realization Report on the ONR Data
Visualization Workshop where I provided a preliminary statement of
research issues as generated from the Workshop's results.  This
Realization Report Special Issue was released only to U.S.
government scientific program managers on the Realization Report
distribution list because the workshop attendees were hard at work
completing this final version.

<h2>GSA</h2>
The General Services Administration's Online Schedule System (OSS)
is a BBS providing information
about some GSA schedules, particularly ADP. Microcomputer-related
schedules are online in their entirety and can be searched; an
especially useful capability lets you list all vendors offering
a particular item, sorted by price, with links to their respective
GSA schedules.

<h2>NASA</h2>
The NASA Scientific and Engineering Workstation Procurement (SEWP)
is a set of giant IDIQ contracts with -- at least in some cases --
very aggressive pricing.  In the past, the Navy has been able to
use this contract up to a yearly allocation, but the limit has usually
been reached very early in the fiscal year.  The online information
may still be useful in other ways, e.g., for comparative pricing.

<PRE>
                         28 October 1992
</PRE>

Hello from London!
<P>

I'm Larry Rosenblum and I've accepted a 19 month assignment as
Liaison Scientist (Computer Science) at the Office of Naval
Research European Office.  I'm on leave from the Naval Research
Laboratory in Washington DC.  My focus is data visualization,
virtual reality, and their enabling technologies.
<P>

As part of my responsibilities, I will be issuing e-mail reports on
European research in these focal areas.  These reports will
frequently be trip reports of visits to institutions in Europe,
describing the research seen.  Less often, they will be
conference/workshop reports, or reports on computer science topics
of interest obtained from other sources.  The reports are intended
to assist both computer science researchers and managers.  Please
note that while every effort is made to be accurate, emphasis will
be placed rapidly disseminating information.
<P>

My goal is to help the U.S. research community maintain a current
awareness of European activities and to encourage liaison and
discussion between research groups across the Atlantic.  I welcome
your feedback on a variety of topics:  Do you know someone in
Europe doing leading, original research who should be visited for
a report?  Do you have any other comments or recommendations?  My
time here is limited, so I might not be able to respond to every
recommendation or inquiry -- but I'll do my best and your input is
valued!
<P>

Do you know others who might like to be added to the distribution
list?  If so, let me know.  If the reports are not of interest and
you would like you your name removed (you might have a better idea
after a few reports!) let me know that also.
<P>

I will appreciate (I hope!) any feedback that you take the time to
give me, and I look forward to providing you with useful
information on important happenings in Europe.
<P>

Regards to all,
<P>

Larry

<a NAME="[1.0]"><b>[1.0]</b></a>  Abstract:  Eurographics '92 was held in Cambridge, UK in
September 1992.  Eurographics is the major all-topics computer
graphics conference for Europe.  This report describes some
highlights of Eurographics '92.
<P>

<a NAME="[2.0]"><b>[2.0]</b></a>  Eurographics '92, the annual conference of Eurographics -
the European Association for Computer Graphics - was held in
Cambridge, UK on 9-11 September 1992, with workshops and tutorials
held earlier.  I'd never been to Cambridge before; it was a
stimulating site for a conference.  Walking among the old, massive
buildings that gave rise to modern universities produced a sense of
awe.  The University consists of separate Colleges that operate
largely independently.  Attendees were housed in dormitories at
Queens and Kings College (the school year not having started); we
lived the experience all week.
<P>

Eurographics was founded in 1980 and held its first conference that
year in Geneva, Switzerland.  It performs the usual functions of a
professional society: holding an annual conference, publishing a
journal (the Computer Graphics Forum), holding focused workshops,
and publishing a book series, a technical report series and a
newsletter, holding local events, etc.
<P>

There were nearly 400 attendees from 25 countries, including about
a dozen from Japan and 30 from the U.S.  The relatively small
attendance (contrast with the SIGGRAPH Conference in the U.S.) is
attributable to the activities of country-wide European computer
graphics associations.  These apparently serve the needs of many
practitioners, so that Eurographics attracts leaders within each
country.
<P>

The conference had three plenary sessions with invited speakers.
The remaining sessions had three parallel tracks -- usually two
paper tracks and one STAR (STate of the ARt) track.  Conference
paper sessions included Multimedia, Animation, User Interfaces,
Visualization, Radiosity, Rendering, Fundamentals, Algorithms,
Modeling, Curves and Surfaces and Applications. The STAR tracks had
1 or 2 speakers talk on a focused topic of current interest.
Multiple tracks are common for computer graphics conferences today,
even for focused ones such as the IEEE Visualization Conference.
It leaves the usual set of problems for an attendee -- I saw only
a portion of the conference.  The conference papers are published
as a special issue of the Computer Graphics Forum.  This journal is
well known and widely accessible in the U.S.  The STAR reports are
published as one of the Eurographics Technical Report Series -- a
table of contents subtends this report.
<P>

<a NAME="[3.0]"><b>[3.0]</b></a>  The welcome address was given by Bob Bishop, managing
director of CADCenter Ltd in Cambridge.  He overviewed the
impressively large number of graphics companies that have arisen in
Cambridge and that maintain close ties with the University.
Particular areas of expertise are CAD/Solid Modeling, HCI
(human/computer interface technology), and GIS (geographical
information systems).
<P>

The invited speaker for the plenary session was Mik Lamming of
Xerox EuroPARC.  He described work at EuroPARC, which numbers some
30 people about equally divided between cognitive, social, and
computer science.  They look 5-10 years out on the horizon (10
seemed a better estimate than 5 after hearing the talk), seeking to
understand technology and how it will work in practice.  The focus
is on the development of "everyday" technology.  Lamming noted that
the most utilized applications software today (perhaps word
processing) is used by only a small segment of the population.  On
the other hand everyone uses microprocessor-driven appliances.
Lamming predicted that these microprocessors will collaborate and
cooperate with each other.  A sample application would be a home
that operates semi-automatically based on the owner's behavioral
patterns.  He predicted that video and other technologies will
track individual movements, not only in the home but also in the
workplace and elsewhere.  Time differences between frames will be
the basis of the storage mechanism.  The computer we will all wear
for this purpose must be compact, say wristwatch sized.  The device
must have a low cognitive load.  Lamming also noted the potential
military benefit of a technology which automatically determines
everyone's location and movements.
<P>

While Lamming spoke of the benefits of such technology, many in the
audience worried about the big brother aspect.  Certainly, the
potential for abuse is high.  In concluding, Lamming appealed to
the data visualization community to add the visualization of
personal data to its list of research topics!
<P>

<a NAME="[4.0]"><b>[4.0]</b></a>  Multimedia is a booming business and the presenters in that
session gave several approaches and application.  An unusual
multimedia system was given in "Visual Composition and Multimedia"
by Vicki de Mey et al., University of Geneva.  The system, oriented
for developers rather than end users and written in C++, uses a
technique they call visual composition to create and interact with
multimedia applications.  An internal graph representation is used
with classes Node, ConnectionPoint, and Edge.  Data flow is through
defined subclasses of these classes, and graph class hierarchies
can be created.  The authors note the similarity of this approach
to scientific visualization systems such as AVS (Advanced
Visualization System) that allow construction of powerful networks
by linking modules in defined ways.  They illustrated the
multimedia system with an example called a virtual museum.  Though
not virtual in the sense of immersing the user within the scene,
the Museum was a 3D building with both 2D and 3D artifacts, plus
sound.  The user could walk through the scene and manipulate
objects using techniques familiar to multimedia users.  One could
visualize an eventual merger between virtual worlds and multimedia.
Research issues involved in developing the system include real-time
response and user feedback, handling multiple data streams,
developing special purpose hardware, and concurrent usage.
<P>

A more standard multimedia system, from a user's viewpoint, was
given in "Pandora: An Experiment in Distributed Multimedia" by T.
King of Olivetti Research Limited.  The paper describes the Pandora
workstation, nineteen of which have been deployed at Olivetti and
at the Cambridge University Laboratory for distributed applications
that include video mail, video conferencing, and real-time media
delivery services.  The system utilizes the capabilities of a UNIX
host, but uses a specialized processing box for high-bandwidth,
time-critical, and device dependent processing.  Data communication
is over a 50 Mbit/second ATM (asynchronous transmission mode)
network.  A Transputer is used as the process controller.  The
author's note, however, that the advent of higher speed busses and
processors will likely alter their fundamental approach; they
foresee processing pixels and sound samples directly rather than
through rigid interfaces, as currently.  Still, multimedia has
arrived.  Video and sound are effectively integrated with
hypertext, creating new capabilities both in publishing and for
interacting with colleagues.
<P>

<a NAME="[5.0]"><b>[5.0]</b></a>  Data visualization papers appeared in both in the
Visualization Session and in Applications Sessions.  In "The
Visualization Input Pipeline" W. Fegler and F. Schroder (FhG-IDG,
Germany) argue that the classic visualization pipeline should be
extended into an output pipeline (that contains most of the
commonly used pipeline) and an input pipeline for the purpose of
semantical interaction.  They note that today's application builder
systems (AVS, apE, IRIS Explorer, Data Explorer, etc.) are
primarily output oriented.  They argue that a dual system, where
each output operation has a corresponding inverse input operation,
will allow for better user interaction through data probing as well
as being direct ports back into the data visualization process.
Several architectures are proposed for achieving this result.
<P>

Improving the speed of volume rendering is an important research
area because of the growing use of these methods in scientific data
visualization.  In "Template-Based Volume Rendering" Roni Yagel
(Ohio State Univ.) and Arie Kaufman (SUNY Stony Brook) observe that
a ray cast from the image plane will yield a template that can be
used to reduce processing requirements.  Attempting this approach
from the image plane leads to view-dependent sampling difficulties.
However, the template can be used effectively by casting rays from
a base plane parallel to a face of the volume.  All rays no longer
need be processed; it is enough to process one ray, store the
results, and generate subsequent rays using this stored template.
One must then transform from the base plane to the image plane.
This, however, is a 2D image transformation that is simpler to
solve than the original 3D problem.
<P>

A particularly enjoyable paper was "A CAD System for Color Design
of a Car" by T. Oshima (Toyota Motor Corp.) et al.  The paper
reports on over a half-decade of effort to produce photorealistic
renderings of an automobile for paint selection.  The system uses
physical-based modeling of light to obtain accurate reflection data
for different sky lighting and weather conditions and a variety of
paint types.  It uses analysis of the CRT colorimetric
characteristics to maintain consistency and accuracy.  Parallel
computing provides high-speed computation in support of
interaction.  Dan Whitney of this office saw this work in progress
at Toyota during a tour of duty at ONR-Tokyo about a year ago.  It
impressed him from the manufacturing viewpoint.  The system had
developed to where it was replacing paint prototyping using clay
models.  I was pleased, however, just to see an application that
truly justified the attention paid by the computer graphics
community to n-th order lighting effects!
<P>

<a NAME="[6.0]"><b>[6.0]</b></a>  The STAR reports were interesting as technology updates.  My
favorite story from the conference came, however, from Tom Hewett's
(Drexel Univ.) plenary address on perception and HCI.  He told of
a human factors person touring a nuclear power plant.  A light on
the power console was blinking red, but his hosts did not appear
concerned.  Not wanting to make a scene, he moseyed up to the
light.  Written on a note that was taped above the light was
EVERYTHING IS NORMAL WHEN THIS LIGHT IS BLINKING RED!

<a NAME="[1.0]"><b>[1.0]</b></a>  Abstract:  The University of Leeds is actively supporting
its own researchers with scientific visualization methodology, as
well as in coordination and cooperation within the British higher
education system.  Visualization research at Leeds primarily
focuses on both developing toolsets for scientists and
interdisciplinary research with scientists and engineers from
across the university.  The GRASPARC project is developing methods
for the interactive steering of numerical computations.
<P>

<a NAME="[2.0]"><b>[2.0]</b></a>  Some 90 years old, the University of Leeds serves 12,000
students, soon to rise to 16,000.  The University has several
computing facilities and a range of computers to support both
educational and research functions. There is an Amdahl 5860, but
the University is currently updating its research facilities using
Silicon Graphics and there are also a large number of Sun
workstations.  Twenty IBM-compatible clusters with servers form the
nucleus of undergraduate computing facilities.  Two Silicon
Graphics 8 processor power series serve as high-end computers for
the research staff.  A recent agreement with Silicon Graphics has
provided 70 SGI workstations for the research facility at low cost.
<P>

The University is also a heavy user of AVS (Advanced Visualization
Systems) data visualization software.  AVS is a modular system that
allows users to utilize graphical cues to link AVS-provided and/or
user generated modules.  The result is a visualization pipeline
that begins with the data set and ends with a rendered display.
The development of AVS and ApE, a similar product from the Ohio
State Supercomputer Center, were significant breakthroughs in
providing scientists with usable and powerful desktop tools.
Several other corporations now offer similar products.  The
Combined Higher Education Software TEam (CHEST), based at the Univ.
of Bath, acts as a 'broker' to make deals for British university
participants; products such as AVS are thus made available on
significantly more favorable terms than an individual institution
could obtain.  British universities and research institutions
appear to maintain closer coordination in both equipment and
research than one finds in the U.S.
<P>

The Computer Studies Dept. at Leeds consists of 45 persons, divided
roughly equally between computer science, artificial intelligence,
and information systems. British universities are being encouraged
to develop computer-based teaching materials.  This has led to a
push in multimedia research and development, and Leeds is currently
recruiting several multimedia researchers for the Computer Studies
Dept.
<P>

An active Computer Services Group, some 60 persons strong, provides
university-wide support.  An unusual asset of the Univerity, with
which the Group has close ties, is a full TV production studio that
does collaborative work with industry and government.  On the day
of my visit they were conducting a course for junior diplomats on
how to be interviewed.  A trained TV interviewer would ask tough
questions of them, and the results played back to help them better
their performance.
<P>

<a NAME="[3.0]"><b>[3.0]</b></a>  Rae Earnshaw, a pioneer in computer graphics algorithms and
prolific author/editor of books on computer graphics (including two
recent ones on scientific visualization), heads the Graphics Group
within the Computer Services Group.  A university-wide, 100-
researchers strong Visualization Group has been formed to implement
visualization within various domain fields.  This group's thrust is
to support visualization across the University and assist
scientists in integrating visualization within their work.  A
recent change to project-oriented funding has assisted the group's
ability to "sign up" scientists.  Obviously, I could see only a
small sampling of this effort.
<P>

Dr. Tim David was using Wavefront Technologies' Data Visualizer
software toolkit to analyse thermally driven fluid flow.  He was
integrating the visualization process to in-house developed flow
code.  As has been seen across many scientific disciplines, the use
of volumetric techniques, in this case examining isosurfaces as
planar cross-sections of 3D volumes, produces dramatic knowledge
benefits for scientists whose previous tools had been contour plots
and other 2D tools.  Particle flow could also be represented using
"tracers" and the two techniques mixed.  Dr. David was pleased that
he could obtain effective visualizations using the Data Visualizer
with minimal effort on his part.  It illustrated the progress made
toward good desktop visualization over the past five years.  A
half-decade ago generating these displays would have required man-
years of programming effort.  However, his current research on
blood flow through the heart also shows the limitations of current
desktop technology.  He noted that for this application the desktop
displays discussed above were not adequate.   3D, time-varying
displays are needed.  Fluid flow representation in 3D is a leading-
edge visualization research topic.  ("Visualizing Vector Field
Topology in Fluid Flows" by James Helman and Lambertus Hesselink of
Stanford University from the May 1991 visualization issue IEEE
Computer Graphics and Applications (CG&A) will receive the CG&A
best paper award for 1991 at the IEEE Visualization '92
Conference).
<P>

Several visualization research projects are underway at Leeds.
Volume rendering, which permits seeing within a displayed volume
using transparency, has become a key 3D display methodology for
much of science.  In medical imaging it is often useful to
integrate volume rendering with traditional polygon methods, so
that one might have planes or surfaces visible within the volume.
Research at Leeds is extending the algorithms developed by Marc
Levoy at UNC and Stanford in speed and power.
<P>

A new, joint project between Leeds and the University of Manchester
will examine timing issues for remote visualization, i.e. when a
simulation process is run on one host and the results monitored by
a second host in a remote location via a network connection.  Three
levels of data abstraction will be examined: (1) scientific data
where the immediate results of the simulation process are
transmitted to the monitor process which is then responsible for
the graphics representation;  (2) graphical data where the
simulation process is augmented to also construct the abstract
graphical representation to the monitor process for rendering; and
(3) image data where the rendered picture is sent over the network
for display.  Several levels of networked links between the hosts
will be examined as well.  Many methods for remote display of data
have been developed in recent years.  A well-done analysis of the
timing and issues involved in these different approaches will place
such research on a firmer footing.
<P>

<a NAME="[4.0]"><b>[4.0]</b></a>  The GRASPARC (Graphical environment for supporting parallel
computing) project is a software development effort in
visualization designed to produce an integrated environment that
can support not only numerics, graphics, and data management, but
also heterogeneous and distributed environments.  The stated aim of
the project is ".. to improve the interaction between the scientist
and the parallel computer through the development of interactive
visualization software, the exploitation of parallelism being
essential to ensure the user can work freely without the
'traditional wait' for either a computation to complete or an image
to be displayed" [1].  The project is a three year (17 man-year)
collaborative project funded jointly by the UK Department of Trade
and Industry and the Science and Engineering Research Council
(SERC).  The partners are NAG Ltd., the University of Leeds (School
of Computer Studies) and Quintek Ltd.
<P>

The primary work thus far has been to design a data base structure
that better supports the interactive steering of numerical
computations.  The system utilizes a "history tree" that includes
various branches taken when an investigator alters the computation
interactively.  A sample interaction, taken from a case study using
GRASPARC, would be to modify areas of a mesh where calculations are
seen (by examining the graphical overlay on the mesh) to be
inadequately modeled.  Using a mouse, the area is defined and the
solution recalculated.  The program's goal is also to assure that
GRASPARC takes advantage of developments in parallel hardware.
<P>

[Note:  With the current economic climate in Britain, research
grants from SERC and similar British funding agencies are
increasingly dependent upon cooperative research proposals between
universities and industry.  Several UK researchers have expressed
concern about the future of "pure" research in the UK.]

<a NAME="[1.0]"><b>[1.0]</b></a> Abstract:  The IEEE Visualization 92 Conference took place in
Boston, 19-23 October.  There was a full program of tutorials,
papers, panels, and case studies, and many items of interest for
visualization users, developers, and researchers.  This Report
summarises the principal results presented at the Conference.
<P>

<a NAME="[2.0]"><b>[2.0]</b></a>  Around 400 people attended Visualization '92 in Boston,
October 19-23.  The first 2 days consisted of Tutorials and
Workshops on a range of topics including volume visualization,
modelling, fluid flow, human perception, virtual reality, and
education.  There was a Khoros Workshop and also the ACM SIGGRAPH
2-day Volume Visualization Workshop.
<P>

On Tuesday evening there was a Special Evening Session on "How
to Lie and Confuse with Visualization" led by Nahum Gershon, Mitre
Corporation, who made some interesting and serious points about
how easily we are misled by the way we intuitively deduce things
from information presented in pictures, the way we contrast large
and small areas sometimes wrongly, and how we construe perspective,
particularly in works of art.  Carol Hunter, Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory, described how the choice of colours for
information on video can dramatically affect the information
presented.  Al Globus, NASA Ames Research Center, outlined 13 ways
in which it was possible to lie with scientific visualization!
<P>

<a NAME="[3.0]"><b>[3.0]</b></a>  The opening session of the Conference began with an IEEE
Meritorious Service Award to Dr. Larry Rosenblum for his activities
in the areas of developing the theme of data visualization within
the IEEE Technical Committee on Computer Graphics, the
Visualization Conference, the special theme issues of IEEE Computer
Graphics and Applications and Computer Magazine.
<P>

The Keynote Address was delivered by Dr. Eugene Wong, Associate
Director for Industrial Technology, Office of Science and
Technology Policy, Office of the President.  Dr. Wong was a
Professor of Computer Science at Berkeley and founder of Ingres
Corporation.
<P>

[Note:  A detailed description of Dr. Wong's talk will appear in
THE REALIZATION REPORT, Issue No. 4 -- Larry Rosenblum]
<P>

The Keynote Panel on "Interactions between Science and
Visualization" investigated the relationship between visualization
and science.  How could good visualization techniques help us to do
science better?  How could the needs of science influence
visualization research more effectively?  Dr. Larry Rosenblum
(Office of Naval Research, European Office), Dr. Stephen Benton
(MIT Media Lab), Dr. John Conway (Princeton University), Dr. Jeff
Dozier (UC Santa Barbara), and Dr. Robert Langridge (UC San
Francisco) outlined the interactions in their own fields of
interest.  Dr. Stephen Benton covered stereopsis, computational
holography, and MRI Imaging, and outlined image cues spatial
organisation, and spatial display technologies.  He cited a
reference from Jacob Bronowski from a 1978 Yale lecture on "The
Origins of Knowledge and Imagination" where imaging and
visualization were brought together.
<P>

Dr. Jeff Dozier outlined Sequoia 2000, a next generation
information system for assessing global change.  The severity of
the overall global situation was indicated by the increasing
greenhouse gases, the decreasing stratospheric ozone, the
decreasing biodiversity, deforestation, and the increasing human
population.  Just to preserve the status quo in the environment
would need an overall reduction of 70% in car exhaust gases, and
global HCF's would continue to go up for 15 years even if they were
completely stopped now. Thus in this situation of severe crisis it
was essential to have improvements in observations, models, and
information systems to enable an accurate picture of the
environment to be obtained.
The study, prediction, and understanding of changes in the Earth's
system all had a visualization component which was essential to
their success.  A $12 million DEC flagship project had been set up
in this area which involved database management systems, access and
data, and visualization.  Remote visualization was to be used for
browsing, managing, interactive analysis, and computational
steering.  Challenges included dealing with large objects and
interactive visualization.
<P>

Dr. Robert Langridge outlined the development of molecular graphics
from 1964 to 1992, and the ways in which molecular biologists used
visual tools to explore existing structures, design new molecules,
and investigate relationships between molecules, e.g. by fitting
one inside another to form a new compound.  He presented a
graph of log (typical cost of a computer for molecular modelling)
against time, beginning with 2 million in 1964 for Project Mac
to 40K for an IRIS 3030 in 1986.  If this trend continues, a
comparable system was expected to cost 300 dollars in the year 2000
(Dr. Jim Clark has similar figures in his predictions - see ACM
SIGGRAPH 92 Proceedings).
<P>

The remainder of this report provides a snapshot of various items
in the Conference Program, since it was possible to attend only a
proportion of the total due to the parallel streams of Papers,
Panels, and Case Studies.
<P>

<a NAME="[4.0]"><b>[4.0]</b></a>  One of the key problems in the future is linking large
databases to visualization tools, and a Panel on "Managing Large
Scientific Databases" set out to address these issues.  Robert
Cromp of the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center outlined the
Intelligent Data Management Project and methods for extracting
metadata, and how an intelligent information fusion system could be
designed to address the areas of metadata management and user
interface.  Ray Wall of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory discussed
animating space imagery.  Animation was very useful to observe
spatial relationships, structure, and process dynamics.  Complex
models and process simulations could be overlaid on observational
data which was essential for identifying correlations or
deviations.  The image data could be queried or browsed.  Animation
could also be related directly to virtual environments.  Rendering
of images could be done on parallel architectures.  These methods
were to be used on the Magellan data from the Venus probe; the
rendered was also being interfaced to the JPL animation tool
Surveyor.
<P>

<a NAME="[5.0]"><b>[5.0]</b></a>  Two Panels of further interest were 'Grand Challenge
Problems in Visualization Software' chaired by Dr. Lloyd Treinish
(IBM), and 'Real Virtual Environments Applications - Now' chaired
by Paul Breen, Mitre Corp.  Lloyd Treinish began by outlining the
problem and the tools required.  The issues in visualization
software included matching the software more closely to the
scientist's needs and requirements, integration of visualization
and computation, usability of visualization software, managing
large data sets, increasing the dimensions of interaction with the
data, and real-time interaction with data.  Matching the software
to the scientist's needs required greater knowledge of the
discipline characteristics of each area.  Systems were required
that could provide different levels of access, accommodate multiple
sources of data, support domain-driven problems, required a minimum
of detailed system knowledge for their use, and which could create
intelligent customised interfaces.  A tall order!
<P>

David Butler, Sandia National Laboratory, analysed the work being
done in the area of the integration of visualization and
computation where the user had direct access to computation as
it proceeded rather than outputting results of previous
postprocessing stages.  Spontaneous computing was an area where all
objects were 'visible' as opposed to interactive computing where
only a fixed number of user dialogues were possible.  The
computation agent managed the numerical objects, the visualization
agent managed the graphical objects, the storage agent managed the
persistent objects, and control managed other agents. The enabling
technologies were the object-oriented paradigm, and the
visualization reference model.  Current research challenges
included domain-specific data models, algorithm visualization,
new visual programming paradigms, and 3D interaction techniques.
<P>

Hikmet Senay, George Washington University, assessed visualization
tools from a usability perspective, and proposed that it was
important to design visualization systems which provided guidance
and support for users for domain specific visualizations, and
task-specific visualizations.  Automating the design of
visualizations was an area of current research.  Some current
systems for 2D included APT, SAGE, and BOZ, and for 3D - CCAD, NSP,
VISTA, and Autovisual.  The second challenge was to integrate
visualization with other technologies and tools:  computation -
simulation and analysis; data - storage and models; interaction -
multi-sensory and multimedia.  The overall objective was to design
intelligent information systems capable of understanding users'
goals specified in an appropriate high-level language, e.g. 'Show
me the effects of acid rain on the wildlife in Queensland'.  Such
systems should know under which circumstances a particular visual
presentation was more effective than another. The two aims
therefore were to provide support and guidance to the user, and
integrate visualization with other technologies and tools.
<P>

Georges Grinstein, University of Massachusetts at Lowell, outlined
three challenges: large data sets, human perception capabilities,
and increasing the dimensions of interaction via sound, color,
motion, surfaces, and volumes.  It was going to be important to be
able to explore massively large data sets, and integrate the
database with the visualization.
<P>

Steve Bryson, NASA Ames, argued for real-time interactive
scientific visualization, or 'reification', defined as the ability
to regard or treat an abstraction or data as if it had concrete
material existence.  This involved the use of Virtual Reality (VR)
types of environments.  It was easier to explore and understand a
'thing' than a picture of a thing, and active exploration was more
useful and dynamic than passive observation.  Real-time
visualization was easy to do for small tasks but very difficult for
real-time applications in science and engineering.  Computation,
rendering, and data management had all to be done in less than 0.1
sec. For unsteady CFD a typical data set was 5-10 GB, and a
time-step was 100MB.  For some visualizations (e.g. particle paths)
all data must be available.  Some visualizations such as
isosurfaces and streamers are computationally intensive.  Hardware
improvements will alleviate some of the problems, but currently
there are design compromises that have to be made, viz, speed
versus accuracy, speed versus limited data access, and speed versus
quality of the rendering.  Interactivity must make sense for the
particular scientific problem, so the designer must understand the
science.  The interface must be as invisible as possible.  The user
must be given control over the compromises, and high performance
must be built in from the beginning.
<P>

<a NAME="[6.0]"><b>[6.0]</b></a>  In the Panel on 'Real Virtual Environment Applications -
Now' Dr. David Zeltzer (MIT Media Laboratory) began by outlining
the need for a better term than 'Virtual Reality' to cover all the
areas encompassed by the matrix of immersive interfaces, autonomous
agents, and the complex work domain.  His work was concerned with
the visualization of human behaviour and human motor behaviour, and
the modelling and simulation of virtual actors as humans.
<P>

David Mizell, Boeing Computer Systems, outlined the use of CAD and
VR systems in the design of the 777 plane.  Full scale mock-ups of
the plane were no longer used; everything was done by CAD. VR was
now being used to provide 'augmented reality' where graphics were
superimposed on the real world, to provide 3D immersive views of
engineering work as it proceeds, and also do accessibility and
maintainability checks.  On the 747 there were 40000 form boards
for wiring circuits; these were now being done by using a graphics
display to ascertain where to put the wiring.
<P>

Richard Satava MD, Silas B. Hays Army Hospital, described the
increasing use of VR tools and techniques in surgery.  Remote
manipulation techniques were now being used with appropriate 'feel'
and 'feedback'. The primary benefit of the new techniques was the
minimal impact upon the patient since much smaller incisions were
performed compared to manual procedures.  Hospital recovery time
was less and patient recovery time was much less.  These techniques
have great potential for surgical training and for remote surgery
via telepresence. If there is no reason for the surgeon to believe
the patient is not in front of him 'on the TV screen', then he will
operate as if he were.  But the actual patient could be on the
other side of the country.  Using these methods other modalities
can be brought in and overlaid on the patient, e.g. CT scans.  SRI
are currently working on this technology to make it available to
surgeons.  Clearly the issues of accuracy, reliability, stability,
and maintainability have to be fully addressed.
<P>

Michael Stephens, Computer Sciences Corporation, outlined the uses
of VR in a number of application areas including the Waterways
Experimental Station (WES) - six major laboratories for hydraulics,
structures, geotechnical, coastal, environment, and information
technology.  VR applications included architectural walk-through,
fluid mechanics, surface exploration, and volume visualization.
<P>

Georges Grinstein, University of Massachusetts at Lowell and Mitre
Corp, summarised the use of Virtual Environment Architectures for
interaction with magnification, satellite control, electronic sand
box scenarios, virtual command post, and air traffic control. The
Electric Power Research Institute were developing a trainer system
by software which could replace a trainer system currently needing
600K dollars in annual maintenance.
<P>

<a NAME="[7.0]"><b>[7.0]</b></a>  Five papers of particular interest were 'Visualization of
Second Order Tensor Fields and Matrix Data' by T. Delmarcelle and
L. Hesselink, 'Volume Rendering on a Distributed Memory Parallel
Computer' by T. Elvins, 'Visualizing Wind Velocities by Advecting
Cloud Textures' by N. Max, R. Crawfis and D. Williams, 'Virtual

Spacetimes via Geodesic Flows' by Steve Bryson, and 'Network Video
Device Control' by D. Nadeau and M. J. Bailey.
<P>

<a NAME="[8.0]"><b>[8.0]</b></a>  John Rasure summarised current thinking with regard to
Khoros and visual languages.  Current issues included
interoperability, collaboration, objects in dataflow, distributed
computing, fine grain programming, and applications building.
<P>

A Panel on 'Object-Oriented, Dataflow Visualization Systems - A
Paradigm Shift?' began by looking at current systems and noting the
trends.  Some points about current systems include the following:
current uses, prospects, drawbacks, improvements, alternative
approaches, and interoperability.  Bob Brown, Manager of the IRIS
Explorer Project at Silicon Graphics Inc indicated how large grain
data flow systems were likely to develop.  There were currently
many users of these systems.  To date around 25000 copies of
Explorer had been shipped!  Meaningful results were being obtained
by users and visualization researchers alike, and tools like
Explorer had brought visualization to many people who had not used
it before.  However, current systems had limitations.  Large data
sets and large programs were cumbersome.  Large module suites were
unmanageable, and systems were not optimised.  Extending systems
needed experts.  Use of distributed computing needed care, and the
visual programming style was not natural for all users.  He
envisaged that in the short term there would be developments for
alternate execution modules, better data model, larger data sets,
and better coverage of application areas. There were two pressures
in the marketplace - one for simpler systems and one for more
powerful systems!  One approach to this is to make the system more
user-friendly and also add advanced features for the experts.  He
expected more highly interactive interfaces in the future and more
desk-top features such as audio and video. Terry Myerson,
International AVS Center, outlined the work of the AVS Consortium.
Lloyd Treinish, IBM T.J.Watson Research Center, examined the
effectiveness of dataflow systems, particularly in the context of
large and complex data sets.  There was high level user interface,
powerful prototyping, and extensibility, but it required knowledge
about the structure of the data, and it was difficult for the
practising scientist (and non-computer expert) to extend the
system.  Interfaces could be too unfamiliar or too simplistic, and
dataflow systems did not scale too well to problems of interesting
and complex science.
<P>

A further evening session on 'Research Problems Visualization'
chaired by Georges Grinstein, added to the list of last year's
problems.  The new list is available from Georges Grinstein.
Problems include handling large data sets, perception issues, and
higher dimension problems.  Issues in VR include creating a real
sense of presence, better resolution, and better body tracking.  A
further challenge was in the area of modelling and visualizing
unsteady phenomena where the data was changing with time.
<P>

<a NAME="[9.0]"><b>[9.0]</b></a>  The Capstone Speaker, Dr. Margaret Livingstone, Harvard
Medical School, outlined the complexities involved in 'seeing'
objects, and how the human visual system made sense of an infinite
variety of images.  This ability is made possible by the brain's
capacity to process large amounts of information simultaneously.
Recent studies suggest that form, color, and spatial information
are processed along three independent pathways in the brain.  An
understanding of the human visual system can vastly improve the
perceptual quality of the display of images.
<P>

This was an excellent conference with many points of interests in
the Papers, Panels, and Case Studies.  The Proceedings are
published by the IEEE Computer Society and there is also a video
containing extracts of the videos submitted with the papers.

<a NAME="[1.0]"><b>[1.0]</b></a> Abstract:  The keynote address at the IEEE Visualization 92
Conference [see The <a href="rosenblum.003.html">REALIZATION REPORT #3</a>] in Boston,
Oct. 1992, was given by Dr. Eugene Wong of the White House Office
of Science and Technology Policy.  He discussed the formation,
start-up, focus, and philosophy of the High-Performance Computing
Initiative.  Because of the high interest in HPCC, I am providing
a report on his talk.
<P>

<a NAME="[2.0]"><b>[2.0]</b></a> The keynote address "High Performance Computing and
Communication (HPCC)" at the IEEE Visualization 92 Conference in
Boston, Oct. 21-23, was presented by Dr. Eugene Wong.  Dr. Wong is
Associate Director for Industrial Technology in the White House
Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP).  Previously, he was
a Professor of Computer Science at U.C. Berkeley and a founder of
Ingress Corp.  He discussed funding, the principal agencies, the
major components of the program, and the significant goals and
objectives.  Dr. Wong stressed that HPCC, as with other
Presidential Initiatives, emphasizes an underlying strategy.  HPCC
seeks to achieve a unification between business and scientific
computing, technology and applications, and computing and
communications.  He noted that visualization is a key topic that
will play a major role in the success of HPCC while at the same
time being influenced and modified by other aspects of HPCC
achievements.
<P>

OSTP focuses on life sciences, physical sciences, industrial
technology, and industrial policy.  They support Cabinet Councils,
the President's Council of Advisors for Science and Technology
(PCAST), and the Federal Coord. Council for Science, Engineering
and Technology (FCCSET).  Presidential Initiatives in science and
technology (S&T) are:
<P>

<PRE>
     FY 91:    Global Change
     FY 92:    Mathematics and Science Education
               HPCC
     FY 93:    Advanced Materials
               Biotechnology
     FY 94:    Manufacturing
</PRE>

The S&T program seeks knowledge of general truths, the means to
sustain and improve human life, and an appropriate government role
in supporting science, producing technology, and maximizing
benefit.
<P>

HPCC was expected to be an FY 91 start-up program; it took an extra
year, according to Dr. Wong, to assemble the appropriate political
consensus and focus (a 1989 OSTP Report initiated the effort).  It
has been called "one of the finest science and technology programs
government ever launched."  HPCC seeks to push technology to the
limit in speed, reliability, usability, and capacity.  It divides
into:
<P>

<PRE>
	1.   Systems        --        Hardware and Software
</PRE>
	2.   Applications   --        Grand Challenges
	3.   Networking     --        National Research & Educ. Network (NREN)
	4.   Basic Research and Human Resources
<P>

Dr. Wong called data visualization the "greatest symbiotic
relationship" with HPCC of all computer science topics.  He noted
that "HPCC makes visualization possible; visualization makes HPCC
usable."  He also noted the role of visualization in other
Presidential Initiatives:
<P>

<PRE>
     Global Change       --   Data Rendering
     Math & Sci. Education -- Virtual Experiments (simulated
                              experiments for education)
     Advanced Materials  --   Molecular synthesis
     Biotechnology       --   Drug design/DNA research
     Manufacturing       --   Product and Process Design
</PRE>

Dr. Wong used a Boeing production system, in which an electronic
"man" crawls into spaces within a computer generated model of an
airplane design for validation, as an example of how visualization
technology is becoming increasingly critical to the manufacturing
process.
<P>

Dr. Wong discussed HPCC's funding to date:
<P>

<PRE>
                    proposed            actual
     FY 92           638 M              655 M
     FY 93           789 M              718 M (house); 769 M (sen.)
     FY 94           956 M
     FY 95          1087 M
     FY 96          1202 M
</PRE>

In 1992 the program was funded above the proposed level; 1993 will
see a shortfall with the burden to fall most heavily on NSF.
<P>

Dr. Wong spoke of the importance of strategy (for HPCC a strategic
element was to push networking as an enabling technology).  He
suggested the chain:
<P>

<PRE>
     vision --->  strategy  --->  reality
</PRE>

He noted conflict between cultures at several stages:
<P>

<PRE>
          science vs. commercial
          application vs. technology
          scalable vs. modular systems
</PRE>

Scalable systems, such as highly parallel computers, play a large,
underlying role.  Dr. Wong pointed out that parallelism had
produced speedup factors of the order of 1000 in fields such as
wave mechanics and structural mechanics when measured against a
normalized metric.
<P>

Dr. Wong noted that applications have, until recently, come
primarily from weapons laboratories, but that this is now changing
rapidly.  He also remarked that Grand Challenges have the largest
budget within HPCC.
<P>

<a NAME="[3.0]"><b>[3.0]</b></a> He concluded with highlights of recent events:
<P>

<PRE>
 -- HPCC Act of 1991 (credit to Sen. Gore)
      "a good example of bipartisanship producing good legislation"
</PRE>

<PRE>
 -- Progress
      - Scalable systems delivered.
      - NREN (interim) traffic doubled and growing super-
           exponentially which will result in cultural
           changes of an unpredictable nature.
      - Grand Challenge Applications started
</PRE>

<PRE>
 -- Catalytic effects on the entire industry
      CSPP: CEO's from the 12 largest computer companies form group
      to look at industry.  Results include a "peace pact" with the
      semi-conductor industry on trade issues with Japan and an
      examination of HPCC.  The examination of HPCC by CSPP was
      largely supportive, but with some criticism.
</PRE>

<PRE>
 -- CSPP suggested management changes.  In response, within the last
      month, a National Coordinator Office for HPCC has been
      established at NIH.  The Director will be:
</PRE>

<PRE>
           Donald A.B. Lindberg, M.D.
           Director, Nat. Library of Medicine
           NIH
</PRE>

<PRE>
      Dr. Lindberg will also chair the FCCSET committee.  The
      functions of this office are program coordination, policy
      formulation, establishing a single point of contact, and
      providing institutional continuity.  The National Coordinator
      Office will continue to be located at NIH.
</PRE>

<a NAME="[4.0]"><b>[4.0]</b></a> Summary:  Much of Dr. Wong's talk contained materials
available in previously published synopses of the HPCC initiative.
Nonetheless, it was quite interesting to hear the viewpoints of one
so closely associated with the initiative.  The point that an early
establishment of strategy was inherent in HPCC's generation and
early success was a recurring theme.  A second theme was the
symbiotic relationship between data visualization and HPCC sub-
areas.  Although the smallest of the presidential initiatives, it
has had a catalytic effect, according to Dr. Wong, because it has
been well focused.  The establishment of a National Coordinator
Office, in response to the CSPP criticisms, was news for many of us
in the audience.

<a NAME="[1.0]"><b>[1.0]</b></a>  Advanced Robotics Research Ltd (ARRL) is located on the
campus of the University of Salford, England.  ARRL seeks to
develop a telepresence testbed, with special emphasis on the
ability to consider the human factors elements.  Current efforts
are in two parts: the virtual reality (VR) interface for
telerobotics and scene reconstruction using a laser ranging device.

<P>

<a NAME="[2.0]"><b>[2.0]</b></a>  Advanced Robotics Research Limited (ARRL) was formed in 1988
to manage a new U.K. National Advanced Robotics Research Center, as
part of the U.K. Department of Trade and Industry's 1985 Advanced
Robotics Initiative.  ARRL is located on the campus of Salford
University, near Manchester, U.K.  The Center was granted L5
million ($7.75 million) in start-up funds to be spread over 5
years.  It is constituted as a commercial enterprise and expected
to proceed independent of government funding.
<P>

<a NAME="[3.0]"><b>[3.0]</b></a>  The computing (and indeed the research in so far as I could
tell) divided into two parts.  On the VR end, ARRL uses SuperVision
by Division Limited of Chipping Sodbury, U.K.  ARRL was the first
purchaser of a Division Limited Vision system, recently upgraded to
SuperVision.  Several devices input to SuperVision.  These include
voice input via Marconi Marcospeak and the Ascension "Bird"
electromagnetic sensor for head tracking.  ARRL has recently
obtained both a new Polhemus head tracker and the new Ascension
"Big Bird" tracker that extends range to an 8 foot operating cube
(3 feet has been standard for trackers).  This will allow
comparison between the Polhemus (an AC device) and the Ascension (a
DC device).
<P>

I was disappointed not to be able to try ARRL's tactile feedback
AirGlove data glove.  It had been damaged in a recent show and was
undergoing repairs.  The AirGlove concept was developed by Jim
Hennequin of Airmuscle Ltd. (Cranfield, U.K.) and Robert Stone
(ARRL) for use in conjunction with a VPL DataGlove.  It provided
pneumatic-based force feedback to the user.  There appears to have
been a divergence in approach between Hennequin and ARRL, and Stone
is now developing a handgrip device which incorporates an IsoTrak
or Bird sensor.  Force feedback is provided by expanding the grip
slightly, using three to five air pockets designed for that
purpose.  A VPL headset was used for my demo; a LEEP headset was
also available.  The LEEP, according to Stone, provides better
resolution (around 300 by 400 pixels) but requires use of a body
pack and is hard to calibrate.  Thus, it is not used for demos.
<P>

ARRL had developed several demos, both the usual architectural fly-
through of a building and a scientific-visualization-oriented one
to examine a synthetic surface.  Improving VR, according to Stone,
requires more computing power for better rendering, better
resolution and contrast in the LCD displays in the head mounted
unit, improving the reliability and calibration difficulties of the
data gloves, and generating a better human/computer interface (hci)
understanding of human requirements for interfacing to virtual
worlds.
<P>

<a NAME="[4.0]"><b>[4.0]</b></a>  The remaining hardware and software efforts focus on
robotics for telepresence.  The goal is to be able to recreate 3D
scenes from non-optical sensors so that virtual reality can then be
used for remote user-based manipulation.  Work on path planning and
obstacle avoidance is also performed.
<P>

The 3D image analysis system uses a scanning laser rangefinder as
an input sensor.  ARRL owns an imaging head, built by NEL of
Scotland, that operates over 1-5 a meter range and acquires an 8-
bit range image in 2 seconds.  A semiconductor laser produces a
vertical strip of infra-red light, which is reflected by a scanning
mirror.  A slightly offset CCD camera also views the scene.  When
the laser strikes the scene, the camera detects a stripe containing
distortions due to objects.  By scanning the mirror, a complete
image is obtained.  A transputer-based computer system hosted by a
Sun Sparc Workstation processes the image data and communicates
with the SuperVision system.  The processing reduces the
rangefinder output to 3D coordinates and then uses machine vision
methods to segment the results into planar parts.  This
representation is then made format compatible with the SuperVision
system.  Obstacle avoidance algorithms are also being developed.
These involve rule-based mobile path planners.
<P>

Navigation displays are similar to those I have seen for underwater
autonomous vehicles.  The ARRL algorithms use probabilistic methods
to correct constantly upgraded estimates of position.  The track is
shown at intervals and the accumulated errors are displayed as an
ellipse of uncertainty with the computer's best estimate of
position at the center.  The ellipse grows in area as the errors
accumulate.  As the autonomous vehicle moves, it is assumed to
encounter known features or beacons which it can detect.  A Kalman
filter integrates these observations with the computer's position
estimates to provide an improved estimate of positional, thus
reducing the size of the uncertainty.
<P>

Other hardware and software used by ARRL include several CAD
packages and a Virtual Reality Toolkit developed by Dimension
International (U.K.) for use with a 486-PC and SPEA Graphics Card.
ARRL has integrated Dimension files with the SuperVision system, so
that stereo imagery can be input to display devices such as the VPL
headset.
<P>

<a NAME="[5.0]"><b>[5.0]</b></a>  Telepresence is a long-term development process, as diverse
fields must be integrated.  U.S. Laboratories would look to expend
perhaps $300,000 to enter the telepresence research area (typical
is a high end Silicon Graphics Workstation with expensive interface
peripherals).  ARRL is making do with less.  With the current
economic climate in England, it is difficult to obtain the long-
term funding necessary for an ongoing telepresence effort.  ARRL
appears to be seeking work in VR areas outside the telepresence
testbed concept.  These areas include command and control,
medicine, and multi-media applications.

They have marketed several commercially successful products.  This

<a NAME="[2.0]"><b>[2.0]</b></a>  W Industries is well known as a producer of virtual-reality
games.  Dr. Jon Waldern, Managing Director and CEO, frequently
speaks at U.S. conferences.  Terry Rowley, another of the four
cofounders, gave a STAR Report on virtual reality at the
Eurographics 92 Conference (see The <a href="rosenblum.001.html">REALIZATION REPORT #1</a>).
The company is growing rapidly since its formation in 1988.  They
now employ 60 persons.  W Industries projects a turnover of L 11
million for 1992 ($17 million).
<P>

<a NAME="[3.0]"><b>[3.0]</b></a>  I positioned myself standing in the "pod", placed the
headset with the goggles over my head, tightened the pack around my
waste and held the joystick in my right hand.  After some
introductory graphics, I found myself in a 3D room.  As I turned in
the pod, the magnetic sensors above me perceived my movements and
the scene changed.  Two doors lay ahead, one wooden and the other
metallic (presumably iron).  I faced the wooden door, pressed my
joystick, and moved forward.  I reached out with my hand and opened
the door.  I moved forward with the joystick, walking down a set of
stairs.  The new room contained a chest.   After turning and
"walking" over to it, I opened the chest and reached inside by
holding out my hand.  The 3D display now contained my hand holding
a sword.  I heard a noise behind me.  Turning in the pod, I faced
two skeletons.  Holding the joystick, I swung my arm as if I was
holding a sword.  Polhemus sensors interpreted my motion and the
skeletons dissipated at my blows.  After investigating several more
rooms and encountering virtual dwarfs and other virtual objects, I
was killed in a swordfight.  I had reached the sixth room on the
first level.
<P>

The game, still in development stage, was LegendQuest (tm) by W
Industries.  It showed the weaknesses, but also the hope and
promise, of virtual reality.  The resolution of the LCD's in the
head mounted display are currently 200 by 300 pixels.  At this low
resolution, reading the large logo shown at the start of the
program was difficult and scenes lacked sharpness.  Besides
hardware resolution, rendering more polygons and adding texture
would help realism.  The 200 msec delay was too slow to give a real
sense of the virtual "me" reacting properly to my movements.  W
Industries hopes to see the delay reduced to 100 msec.  The company
also expects to add doppler effects to the sound processing.  The
magnetic sensors cannot be user calibrated when the user changes
every few minutes.  As a result the movement sensing was inexact
quite apart from delay constraints.  Force feedback data gloves
would certainly aid the perception of realism as well.  W
Industries says they are working on all these improvements.
<P>

Still, I have watched my 11- and 15-year-olds play enough computer
and Nintendo adventure games to observe the difference when VR
technology is used.  The feeling of being a "character" is quite
different from moving a "character" that is not you on a TV screen.
And the emergence of VR entertainment will help the growth of more
serious VR efforts much as computer graphics from the entertainment
industry provided a technology base for scientific visualization
efforts in the late 1980's.
<P>

<a NAME="[4.0]"><b>[4.0]</b></a>  There are unique aspects in designing virtual reality
hardware for arcade entertainment.  The frame and peripherals must
be indestructible, with the peripherals as isolated from the user
as possible.  The head mounted display must fit both children and
adults with a minimum of adjustment and distortion.  W Industries
develops their consoles and visors from glass-reinforced plastic.
The computers are also housed safely away in the underbody.  The
joysticks, according to Rowley, are a military design that was
further ruggedized.  A monitor on the front of the unit helps keep
the interest of those waiting a turn.  The system is specifically
designed to allow passage through doors with minimal disassembly.
<P>

The computer is a combination of commercial and in-house
development.  A Commodore Amiga 3000 is currently used as the
computing engine, although W Industries expects to switch to IBM PC
technology to reduce cost even further.  An in-house developed
graphics board made with T.I. graphics chips provides higher
graphics rates than available from the Amiga.  Game software is
stored on CD-ROM.  In-house developed software is used for graphics
generation.  Objects for games have been created by digitizing
models, but W Industries is now moving toward generic modeling.
<P>

The helmet is designed in house, produced externally, and assembled
(as are all components) in-house.  The LCD for each eye is placed
on the side of the helmet and viewed through a mirror.  According
to W Industries, this design keeps the weight back on the helmet
for balance.  The graphics software, of course, produces frames as
mirror image.  There are two speakers in each earphone.  Polhemus
magnetic trackers are used for both hand and head tracking.
<P>

The economics of a virtual reality arcade game dictates that the
game must recapitalize itself in 6-12 months (some have done much
better).  The life expectancy of a game is 2 to 3 years.  Games
have been successfully released at several large arcades, including
one in London.  However, the difficulty with arcade games lies in
the learning curve for players.  Players must be willing to keep
contributing tokens (at several dollars per minute), an unrewarding
undertaking until a certain skill level is obtained.  W Industries
is looking to the theme park and advertisement industries for
growth while awaiting the day home virtual reality games become
possible over "telephone" links.  A recent agreement with Paramount
will see the construction of Star Trek Virtual Reality Centres
where the player, as Captain Picard, will battle the Romulan
Empire.
<P>

Oh, yes.  I now have a wonderful time telling my "kids" that they
can shake the hand that held the virtual sword and slew ...

<a NAME="[1.0]"><b>[1.0]</b></a> The Freeform Curves and Surfaces '92 meeting was held at the
Mathematical Research Institute Oberwolfach in June 1992.  It is an
international, invitation-only event for presenting recent advances
in Computer-Aided Geometric Design (CAGD).  CAGD is, of course, a
critical topic for manufacturing design.  This report presents some
highlights of Freeform Curves and Surfaces '92.

<a NAME="[2.0]"><b>[2.0]</b></a> The Mathematisches Forschungsinstitut Oberwolfach was the
site for the "Freiformkurven und Freiformflaachen" meeting held
June 14-20, 1992.  Located in the Black Forest village of
Oberwolfach-Walke, Germany, the institute receives support from the
Volkswagen Foundation.  This allows very reasonable fees to be
charged to the attendees.  The facility is self-contained with
dormitory space and family style dining which greatly enhances
contact between the participants. The attendees for this meeting
consisted of people working in the area of Computer-Aided Geometric
Design (CAGD).  The area of CAGD emerged in the early 1970's and
since that time has grown into a vital and active area of study and
research.  Today it enjoys the support typically accorded any
scientific discipline:  workshops, seminars, textbooks, and
journals.  Much of CAGD is concerned with the development of the
science and technology for the computer-aided design, analysis, and
production of 3D objects such as cars, airplanes, and telephones.
This meeting was the fifth in a series of workshop/conferences on
CAGD held at Oberwolfach, with the first having been held in 1982.
Participation at Oberwolfach meetings is by invitation only and
these invitations are highly regarded in the scientific community.
This generally leads to very high quality talks on the latest and
best research.  The total attendance was about 60, of which 40 gave
presentations on recent research results.  The attendees were
primarily from Europe and the U.S.  Active research groups in CAGD
from the U.S. are located at Arizona State University, RPI,
University of Washington, University of Utah, Rice University,
Boeing in Seattle, and General Motors in Warren.  Representatives
from each of these groups were in attendance.  The active European
groups who were represented at this workshop are located at
University of Kaiserlautern, University of Stuttgart, Technische
Hochschule Darmstadt, Technische Universitat Braunschweig,
University of Oslo, Brunel University and University of Catalanya.
<P>

Rather than report on all the presentations, I have picked a subset
in the hope that my selection and comments will convey a sense of
what occurred at the meeting in a more compact and easily obtained
manner.  A list of abstracts is available from Institute Office,
Mathematisches Forschungsinstitut, Oberwolfach, Albertstrasse 24,
D-7800 Freiburg/Breisgau, Germany.
<P>

And now for comments on the four selected talks:
<P>

<a NAME="[3.0]"><b>[3.0]</b></a>  Modelling and visualization with implicit surfaces, Wolfgang
Dahmen, RWTH Aachen
<P>

Throughout the development of CAGD there have been two distinct
approaches to representing surfaces in 3D space: 1) Parametric
methods with a representation of the form (X(u,v), Y(u,v), Z(u,v))
which maps a two dimensional domain containing (u,v) to 3D space
and 2) Implicit methods which define a surface as a set of points
{(X, Y, Z) such that F(X,Y,Z) = 0}.  The parametric approach is
associated with spline functions and has been quite successful for
the general representation and design of free-form surfaces.  The
implicit approach is philosophically more closely related to the
concepts of Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) and Solid Modeling.
<P>

Both approaches have long lists of pros and cons.  One of the most
detracting aspects of the implicit approach is the lack of
techniques for designing free-form surfaces.  Over the years there
have been some valiant attempts, but there are no real successes to
date.  This presentation describes the most recent attempt.  The
work is encouraging and interesting.  The authors develop
techniques for matching user specified normals and positions to
points of a triangulated net in 3D space.  They use implicit
patches which have algebraic defining functions of degree 3.  Some
rather impressive images were shown.  I believe this is the first
public announcement of these results and I look forward to seeing
future reports on this research.
<P>

<a NAME="[4.0]"><b>[4.0]</b></a> Topological design of sculptured surfaces, Alyn Rockwood,
Arizona State University
<P>

The genus of an object reveals the number of holes that it has.  A
sphere has genus zero and a donut has genus one.  The genus is a
fundamentally important topological property of an object which
should be consistent with any mathematical representation.  For
example, the genus of a mathematical model of the surface of a
human skull should be the same as the skull it is attempting to
model.  Often, many topological properties are taken as by products
in the design and representation process.  This is not the case
here.  Rockwell makes the point that topology is primal geometry
and reports on a new surface design method based on a "marked"
polygon.  The marked polygon captures the topology of the mappings
from a polygon to the sculptured surface.  Three different
techniques for obtaining a parametric map of a surface with
predescribed genus are given.  One of the most interesting examples
is the mapping of the hyperdisk to a double torus.
<P>

The whole character of this work is very interesting, from the
involvement of an actual sculptor (Helaman Ferguson) with real
machined works of art to the novel and intriguing use of geometry
and topology.  I suspect we will see more on this in the future.
<P>

<a NAME="[5.0]"><b>[5.0]</b></a>  Embracing CAGD - constraints on industrial application as
seen by the German automotive industry, Werner Dankwort, BMW,
Reinhold Klass, Mercedes Benz, Burkard Woerdenweber, Hella
<P>

A rather unique session was held one evening after dinner.  Werner
Dankwort (BMW), Reinhold Klass (Mercedes Benz), and Burkard
Woerdenweber (Hella - a German company that produces automobile
head lamps) gave an informal presentation on the current usage of
CAGD techniques and methodology in their respective companies.
Both Klass and Dankwort have given presentations at all four
previous meetings.  Thus, for most of the attendees their material
was incremental and was perceived as a current update about ongoing
projects.  In addition to their own research and development
projects, for many years both Klass and Dankwort have been actively
involved in the establishment of standards for the description and
distribution of geometric data.  This seems to get more attention
in Europe than the rest of the world.  They take this whole problem
much more seriously than most.  I think that most people consider
the problem of standards as being an important topic that should be
dealt with, but it is not a heavy weight research problem.  As a
result, most are not really very interested.
<P>

One interesting feature of this presentation was a one page sheet
of problems that the presenters felt needed attention by this
scientific community   One person jokingly asked if they would be
willing to issue a research contract based on these problems.  The
audience laughed and the presenters were silent.
<P>

<PRE>
     Here are the problems that were presented:
</PRE>

<PRE>
 problem 1: (application - digitizing, returning FEM data) edge
            detection from scattered point data
 problem 2: (application - digitizing, returning FEM data) surface
            approximation from scattered point/normal data
 problem 3: (application - "shape preserving" surface generation)
            specific - trimmed surface for corner blend (underlying
            surface exceeds corner blend for milling purposes)
            general - filling n-sided patch with trimmed surface
            maintaining edge conditions (epsilon-GCn condition)
 problem 4: (application - "shape preserving" surface generation)
            smooth cross-edge connection between trimmed surfaces
            (epsilon-GCn condition)
 problem 5: (application - "shape preserving surface modification)
            modelling techniques for b-rep. shells
 problem 6: (application - thick plates, milling) offsets of b-rep.
            shells
 problem 7: (application - thick plates, milling) rational offset
            surfaces
</PRE>

<a NAME="[6.0]"><b>[6.0]</b></a>   Barycentric coordinates for convex polytopes, Joe Warren,
Rice University and Tony DeRose, University of Washington.
<P>

Bernstein polynomials have been important from the very beginning
of CAGD.  The parametric versions of these polynomials are called
Bezier curves in CAGD and can be represented as Sum(i = 0, n) Bi
C(n,i) t^i(1-t)^n-i, where the point in 3D space, Bi, is called a
control point and is used to shape the curve.  The notation C(n,i)
is used for the combination of n taken i at a time.  The concept of
a Bezier curve is of theoretical interest and practical value.
Generalizing from one variable to a bivariate domain leads to
methods for surface representation and design.  Generalizing to
volume domains gives rise to techniques for animation and
deformation (morphing) of 3D objects.  In this presentation, the
authors are interested in generalizing to a general convex polytope
domain.  The basis functions Bi(t) = C(n,i)t^i(1-t)^(n-i) can be
obtained from the binomial expansion [ t + (1-t)]^n = t^n + ... +
C(n,i)t^i(1-t)^(n-i) + ...  + (1-t)^n.  The quantities t and (1-t)
can be viewed as the barycentric coordinates of an arbitrary point
in the domain.  This observation is the key idea to their approach
and so all that is needed is a representation of barycentric
coordinates for convex polytopes.  The authors develop a nice
representation based upon some very reasonable definitions and
assumptions.  Within certain restrictions, they show that this
representation is unique.  Several examples are discussed.  We
should also point out that these barycentric coordinate
representations are closely related to nodal functions used in the
finite element method (FEM).  The results of this work could lead
to ideas for improved techniques for solving PDE's over convex
polytopes.  It is a starting point.

<a NAME="[2.0]"><b>[2.0]</b></a>  Unlike the U.S., The Netherlands does not have research
organizations directly under their Defense Department.  Instead,
research is performed at contact laboratories similar to the U.S.
Department of Energy research system (Los Alamos, Livermore, etc.).
This research, along with civilian sponsored research, is performed
in the 5,000 person TNO, spread over some 25 different
laboratories.  TNO receives about half of its funding from the
government and the remainder from contracts with industry and other
funding organizations.  Three of the larger laboratories within TNO
are FEL, PML (chemical research) and IZF (human aspects of
perception research).  The mission of TNO defense research is to
support the three armed forces with applied R&D and to transfer TNO
R&D technology to industry.
<P>

FEL's divisions and their functions are:
<P>

<PRE>
     Observation Systems ---> pure physics and sensor design
     IT & Telecom        ---> data processing for sensor systems
     T&S                 ---> computer science R&D
     Policy Support      ---> policy studies including war games
</PRE>

FEL has an annual turnover of 70.5M fl. ($ 42M) of which more than
half represents personnel costs.  Within T&S is the 25 member High
Performance Computing (HPC) Group.  This group focuses on visual
simulation, machine vision, autonomous systems, and a recently
started effort in virtual reality.
<P>

<a NAME="[3.0]"><b>[3.0]</b></a>  The visual simulation effort is 5 years old.  The first
simulator is a trainer for firing a stinger missile at an incoming
aircraft.  Picture generation is performed by projecting the
scenery onto a large dome.  The system used an in-house developed,
20 processor transputer system and was delivered to the sponsor in
1991. The group's second system is an anti-aircraft, anti-armor
tank simulator.  The simulator allows looking in all directions but
the tank does not move.  Background images are precomputed and
integrated with target information.  The computer hardware is an
in-house developed 120 transputer system.
<P>

A new prototype simulator processes both objects and background
with unrestricted movements and enhanced realism.  This system uses
10 to 100 Intel I860 processors.  The graphics pipeline is
parallelized by assigning processors to computing vertical scan
lines.  Horizontal scan lines are avoided because typical
simulation images have known horizontal coherence (sky, trees,
etc.).  Thus, the processing load would likely be unbalanced.  A
more typical parallelization approach has been to assign processors
to a 2D area of the screen.  Comparisons will be run to validate
the parallel scanline method.
<P>

Each processor board of this new system contains one T805
transputer for control and two Intel I860 processors for
calculation.  Each processor has its own memory bank for storage of
data and programming.  There is no shared memory.  The processors
communicate via FIFO channels.  It has been tested with 4, 8, and
12 processors.  Data is exchanged using two 32-bit wide busses for
each board with claimed data throughput rates of up to 100 Mb/sec.
A host computer is required to start the system and control it at
run time.
<P>

<a NAME="[4.0]"><b>[4.0]</b></a>  The machine vision effort I saw focused on vision for
autonomous and semi-autonomous systems.  The Teleman UKIS
(Universal Knowledge-based Imaging System) research program of the
European Atomic Energy Community is funding this effort.  The
program's goal is to develop methods for remote handling in
hazardous or disordered nuclear environments.  The system seeks to
utilize and fuse data from a laser rangefinder, a stereo vision
camera, and an ultrasonic imaging systems.  Equipment includes a
Dornier laser range camera and a Tecnomare stereo vision camera.
The Ultrasonic imaging and 2D modeling are being performed at a
different TNO laboratory.  FEL's research to date has been to
develop methods for scene and shape recognition using laser
rangefinder data.  The Dornier laser range finding device has a 32
deg by 64 deg field of view, an accuracy of 3 cm, and a 4 to 8 m
range.  The number of elements is 64 by 128 and the update rate is
1 scan/sec.
<P>

The range images were polygonalized by generating normals, growing
regions, and extracting planar regions.  The normal generation
includes modifying normals that are incorrect due to measurement
error or discontinuities (i.e. measurements from the edges of an
object).  An algorithm examines the surrounding normals and uses
them to assess the accuracy of (and correct if necessary) the given
normal.  Planar regions are then generated by using thresholds that
limit the angular variations of the normals and the distance from
the measured point to the proposed plane.  Algorithms that compare
the behavior of normals on planar segments for a conjectured larger
object have been used to successfully identify primitive objects
such as spheres, cylinders, and cubes.
<P>

<a NAME="[5.0]"><b>[5.0]</b></a>  Virtual reality (VR) research centers on two problems driven
by other FEL research.  Telepresence is a potentially valuable tool
for (semi-) autonomous vehicle applications while VR's role in
simulations is more proven.  The stinger missile simulator (see
3.0) was developed and fabricated at a cost of 12M fl. ($6.7M); FEL
estimates a VR version could be constructed for one tenth the cost.
For VR development FEL is using Division Ltd.'s (U.K.) PROVision
transputer-based hardware and dVS software.  They use a Virtual
Research head mounted display and Polheumus magnetic sensors for
movement tracking, both in the head mounted display and in the
Division Ltd. mouse (which they use instead of a data glove).  The
LED display is 320 by 200.
<P>

Two applications are implemented, although improvements are
ongoing.  The first is a simulation of an astronaut trying to
maneuver around a space station.  The head-mounted display shows
the space station and a pair of thrusters, one for moving forward
and one for reverse.  The goal is to maneuver into the bay of the
space station and pick up an object.  It is based on a real
training exercise.  As usual, the first thing one does after
entering the virtual space is to try to fly through walls and
otherwise test the systems limits.  FEL has a collision detection
algorithm but has not yet implemented actions when collisions
occur.  So I was able to fly right through the spaceship.  Even
using a novice mode that did not provide a rotation component to my
movement when I fired the thrusters, virtually entering the cargo
bay of the space station was actually quite difficult.
<P>

The second application was simulation training for firing a stinger
missile.  An object the size and shape of a stinger missile is
placed on ones shoulder (mercifully they didn't use their other one
that is the correct weight!).  Since a portion of the stinger
appears in the virtual environment, it contained both computer-
generated and real components.  The virtual space had simple
scenery, as higher resolution scene generation requires more
computer power.  Also shown are the two guides which must align
properly for firing the missile.  Sound ("beeps") is used to help
fix on the target and the mouse controls fire the missile.  This
was the first time I had a significant problem with parallax in a
VR system.  The movable guide, which had to align with one of four
lines on a lower guide depending on the direction of the incoming
aircraft, was constantly below the second guide.  It needed to be
above.  The problem turned out to be the closeness of the two
guides which are on the missile barrel to my eyes and the dual
magnetic sensors on the top and front of the helmet.  Generally,
calibration for the spatial difference of these two magnetic
sensors is not necessary.  Here, because of the closeness of the
objects of interest, it is.  FEL is currently developing
calibration for this problem.
<P>

FEL is experiencing the usual set of VR hardware issues.  These
include the need for greater computer power for scene rendering,
for higher resolution and contrast in the LCD's of the head mounted
display, and for higher accuracy and longer range from the magnetic
sensors.  Nonetheless, they have the benefit of applying VR to
interesting problems that are appropriate for the technology.  They
expect that transitioning to in-house developed parallel computers
will help improve the scene rendering.
<P>

<a NAME="[6.0]"><b>[6.0]</b></a>  Primarily because of its mission, FEL has initiated a VR
research program quite similar to a longer running one at Advanced
Robotics Research Limited in the U.K. (see <a href="rosenblum.005.html">REALIZATION REPORT #5</a>).
Both seek to develop a telepresence testbed for robotic
manipulation and much of the equipment is identical or similar.
FEL has the advantage of also having in-house simulation
applications which can be brought to fruition more quickly than
telepresence.  Simulation (VR) research will provide equipment and
expertise that can then be applied to telepresence.  As part of a
large research laboratory that places heavy emphasis in areas where
VR technology can be expected to produce advances, the FEL VR
effort may benefit from the long term funding telepresence
applications will require.
<P>

FEL has close ties with the Delft Technological University, having
hired both MS and PhD Students.  They have good ties with other
universities and research institutions in The Netherlands as well.
Perhaps because the country's small size, these liaisons appear to
be quite strong across all institutions I visited in The
Netherlands and the research seems to benefit.

<a NAME="[1.0]"><b>[1.0]</b></a>  Abstract:  Daniel Thalmann at the Swiss Federal Institute of
Technology in Lausanne and Nadia Thalmann at the University of
Geneva are a married couple whose joint work in computer-generated
animation has long been leading edge.  Their current research is
primarily in physical-based and behavioral modeling as it applies
to the human figure.  Examples include animating human facial
movements, human hair, movement by human figures, and clothing.
They are beginning to integrate virtual reality (VR) technology
into this research.
<P>

<PRE>

</PRE>
<P>

<a NAME="[2.0]"><b>[2.0]</b></a>  The Thalmanns are well known in U.S. research circles,
having spent over a decade in Canada before returning to their
native Switzerland three years ago.  Daniel heads a laboratory at
the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL), one
of two federally funded universities in Switzerland.  EPFL is
French speaking, while the Federal Institute in Zurich is German
speaking.  Nadia holds an equivalent position as head of the
MIRALAB at the University of Geneva.  Both are professors.  As
noted in earlier Realization Reports, the title Professor is
different in most of Europe than in the U.S.  By comparison, it is
more select than a full professorship in the U.S.
<P>

EPFL is a new university and its recently built and under
construction buildings are modern in style.  There are 3,000
engineering students, both graduate and undergraduate.  The EPFL
computer science department is very structured.  There are 13
"Laboratories" within the CS Department.  Each Lab gets one floor
of the CS building, has one full professor, 1/2 of a secretary, and
three to four full time researchers paid by the school.
<P>

In sharp contrast the Academy of Geneva was created in 1559 through
the efforts of John Calvin.  Theology was predominant until the end
of the 17th century.  The Academy then opened it's doors to the
physical and natural sciences and, even later, to law and
philosophy.  In 1873 it was raised to the status of University.
Today there are some 11,500 students and 650 professors.  Unlike
most U.S. campuses, Geneva has buildings throughout the city and no
central campus.
<P>

The Thalmann's research is largely joint and will be reported that
way here (however, each heads their own research team at their
respective universities).  For over a decade the main thrust has
been animation of the human figure.  Current efforts include facial
movements (e.g. mouth, eyebrows), human hair, human walking, and
fitting the human figure with clothing.  Human "synthetic"
animation is well known in computer graphics as a difficult
problem.  The Thalmann's research traces a thread in computer
graphics research.  At first they used geometric methods for
modeling.  To define a "character's" (or "actor's") path, a curve,
generally a spline, would be defined by a set of control points
which the path must contain.  This spline would then define a path
for the character to follow.  The mid 1980's saw a shift from this
approach to physical-based modeling.  Now a character would have
his motion determined by predefined forces such as gravity.  So a
character is pulled toward an object by a set of physical-based
forces acting on the scene (rather than moving along a precomputed
curve).  Obstacle avoidance is performed by instituting a repellant
force when the character gets "too close".
<P>

<a NAME="[3.0]"><b>[3.0]</b></a>  Much of the Thalmann's research still involves physical-
based modeling.  However, behavioral modeling is a growing area of
interest.  Here the actor's motions are defined in terms of
behavior and personality now becomes part of a character.  Movement
is performed using vision-based obstacle avoidance.  In the
research I saw, an octree was used to represent the division of 3D
space.  The scene is generated by using standard computer graphics
methodology and then accessing the Z-buffer data.  Since the Z-
buffer is used for hidden surface removal, a range estimate to all
visible objects is thus obtained.  This processing seems analogous
to assuming very high-resolution data from an error-free laser
rangefinder.  The goal is to introduce personality traits to a
character and then to automate the character's movements using
behavior-based modeling.
<P>

Another research effort involves the synthetic generation of human
emotions.  Muscles in the mouth are modeled by a set of polygons.
Using techniques derived from Sederberg's work, a set of free form
deformations is applied to create movements.  The free form
deformations apply to a lattice surrounding the mouth.  The lattice
can be thought of as comprising a surrounding parallelipiped.  The
object (the mouth) is considered flexible within the
parallelipiped.  Thus, a deformation applied to the lattice will
also deform the polygon vertices and thus produce mouth movements.
Because the lattice is regular and contains relatively few points,
it appears to be easier to simulate mouth movements by deforming
the lattice and mapping the deformation onto the mouth than to
deform the more complex set of polygons that represent the mouth
directly.
<P>

<a NAME="[4.0]"><b>[4.0]</b></a>  Another project is producing a kinematic model of human
walking.  Physical-based modeling of foot motion in the walking
process is performed, but a second model of the foot is maintained
for fine-scale correction.  When physical-based modeling equations
are applied to the foot, portions of the foot tend to go below the
plane of the ground at certain stages of the motion process.  This
occurs even when complex equations involving many variables are
used.  Corrections are made to the second model by identifying
certain key points on the foot.  Constraints on the second model
evaluate these control points and prevent the foot from going below
the surface of the floor.  The result is a quite realistic
rendering of the walking process.
<P>

A final example of physically-based modeling is the "Fashion Show".
Here the object is to dress a character using physical-based
modeling.  The character can select from a wardrobe.  Clothes are
represented as planar polygons with seams and attaching
information.  Physical modeling creates forces on the seams so that
the panels deform in 3D about the body.  Collision detection
assures that an outward force is applied when the clothes and the
body are about to make contact.  Eventually, the system reaches
stability and the figure is dressed.
<P>

<a NAME="[5.0]"><b>[5.0]</b></a>  The Thalmann's are currently investigating the integration
of VR to their applications.  To date they have done an
architectural walk through without collision detection.  Some
ability to "pick up" a virtual object has been developed.
Interface hardware includes VPL data gloves and headsets.  Two SGI
computers are used for rendering, one for each eye.  The Thalmann's
are also investigating the data glove as an interface device for
interacting with animation frames for key-framing as well as to
control physical-based modeling.
<P>

Proposed VR research directions are interesting and unusual.
Research has begun with the goal of developing a virtual wardrobe,
an extension of the fashion show described above.  VR will become
the interface to allow the user to dress him/herself in virtual
clothing.  This is a potentially worthwhile exploration of human
interaction in virtual space.  And the ramifications for the
fashion industry are self-evident!

<a NAME="[1.0]"><b>[1.0]</b></a>  Abstract:  The (French) National Office for the Study of
Aerospace Research (ONERA) is a large scientific institute whose
departments span physics, optics, and other disciplines in addition
to the obvious topic of fluid dynamics in support of aerospace
design.  This report describes the activities in the Visualization
Branch of the Computing Center.  Visualization activities include
both visualization support and RACE-sponsored research into
distributed visualization.

<a NAME="[2.0]"><b>[2.0]</b></a>  ONERA is a 2,500 person scientific institute that performs
government and industry studies in support of aerospace technology.
ONERA includes seven centers and has some of Europe's largest wind
tunnels.  Sixty percent of ONERA's staff are situated at its main
research site in Chantillon, a few kilometers outside Paris.  Among
those located here are the members of the Computing Department.
This Department is divided into two parts:  a research branch whose
focus is parallel computing AI and a computing center which serves
as a central computing resource similar to that found at most large
laboratories.  The research group uses Intel i860 based processors
and a newly installed Paragon for investigation of parallel
algorithms for AI.  The Computer Group maintains ONERA's Cray Y-
MP4/128 computer with CDC front ends and provides user services,
networking support, etc.  Within this Group is a seven person
visualization section, headed by Michel Grave.  The Group has SGI
computers, a Pixar, a frame buffer from UltraNet, and an assortment
of X- and Tektronix terminals.
<P>

<a NAME="[3.0]"><b>[3.0]</b></a>  Any visualization center in a large laboratory must support
software packages and products that assist users in a variety of
chores.  The visualization section provides support for both the
AVS and the IRIS Explorer modular visualization software packages
[<a href="rosenblum.002.html">REALIZATION REPORT #2</a> discusses AVS activities in England].
Other supported software packages include GKS, the NCSA XImage and
XDataSlice programs for 2D and 3D data analysis in an X-Windows
environment (Note: NCSA-HDF format is supported on the CRAY), the
UTAH RLE program for processing run length encoded data (including
operations such as color manipulation, histograms, and
transformations) on the Cray and UNIX workstations, and support for
the CGM (Computer Graphics Metafile) format.  A variety of in-house
packages are also supported.  The most interesting of these are
PART_3D and VIF.  These are fluid dynamics packages that are now
several years old; they appear roughly comparable to the NASA/Ames
packages of the same time period.
<P>

<a NAME="[4.0]"><b>[4.0]</b></a>  The major research project of the group is a RACE II
(Research and development in Advanced Communications technology in
Europe) sponsored effort to examine distributed visualization.
There are some 10 partners, but the two major ones are ONERA and
the computing facility at the University of Stuttgart.  The goal is
to allow joint viewing of computation at remote sites.  The first
year's effort has been to start an evaluation that will quantify
distributed results, i.e. to determine what portion of the
visualization chain is best done on the Cray and what portion on
the workstation.  For this purpose the visualization pipeline is
taken to be:
<P>

<PRE>
  Simulation ---> Mapping ---> Rendering ---> Display ---> User
</PRE>

where the rendering stage has three steps:
<P>

<PRE>
     Transformation ---> Rendering ---> Rasterization
</PRE>

The first problem faced was how to make timing measurements in the
same units for different platforms.  Timing modules were developed
and successfully tested.  The Parallel Virtual Machine (PVM)
software from Oak Ridge National Lab. (U.S.) was used to emulate a
parallel mode on a workstation.  One result is that when the
software for distributed mode execution executes, there is a 20%
overhead even if the second machine is not used.
<P>

Test cases include both sequential and non-sequential applications.
The non-sequential case involved looped-data generation displayed
by isosurfaces.  Thus, there is competition for CPU time between
the modules and large data sets must be passed.  It was found that
the ratio Cray/Workstation (SGI) was application dependent.  The
ratio was high for simulations but low for isosurface generation
and rendering.  Results to date indicate that the visualization
computation should be performed on the Cray, although Grave
includes the caveat that this conclusion is application dependent.
For this computation the time for the graphics (isosurface
generation) was small compared to the application itself.  There is
a lot of CPU overhead in data duplication, and another conclusion
is that shared data space is needed in a distributed environment.
Future work will examine data communication issues required to help
solve this problem.  (A new U.K. effort to quantify distributed
data visualization was reported in <a href="rosenblum.002.html">REALIZATION REPORT #2</a>).

<a NAME="[1.0]"><b>[1.0]</b></a>  While visiting Nadia and Daniel Thalmann (see <a href="rosenblum.009.html">REALIZATION REPORT #9</a>) 
at the University of Geneva and the Swiss Federal Institute of

<a NAME="[2.0]"><b>[2.0]</b></a>  The Peripheral Systems Laboratory develops new software and
hardware technology for advanced displays, printing devices,
photocomposers, and information servers.  The Laboratory's focus is
improved printing capabilities including the use of outline
character generation and automatic hinting for improving the
readability of bilevel and grey-scale characters on displays and
printing devices.  This work has been extended to color printing,
including new dithering algorithms for avoiding Moire effects and
producing higher quality output images.  Research also involves
fabricating hardware for fast input/output using processor and disc
array technology with parallel access.
<P>

One hardware system was being developed to provide fast access to
images on disc arrays.  The goal is rapid browsing through these
images.  The system uses parallelism to provide high-speed access
to pixmapped data.  There are 8 discs with 1 Transputer assigned to
each disc for processing.  The 2D images being retrieved are about
1 mbtye in size.  The data retrieval rate is 3 mbytes/second.  The
bottleneck is data throughput.  The new Transputer chip, when
released, is expected to significantly improve the data rate.  This
is one of several projects I have visited in Europe that were "on
hold" awaiting the new Transputer.
<P>

Improving typographic fonts is the subject of ongoing algorithmic
research.  To produce the best looking characters at a given size
on a specific printer, non-linear operations must be applied to
parts of the character shape.  To obtain improvements, grid
fitting-rules called hints are added to the character description.
A character is represented topologically in order to identify key
characteristic points.  Hinting methods are developed that produce
a subpixel displacement that is applied to certain parts of the
outline.  These algorithms have been extended from bilevel to gray-
shaded characters.  The results offer noticeable improvements over
standard filtering methods and are valuable for situations where
reading small text is important.  Human factors testing is
currently being conducted to quantify the gains from perceptual
hinting.
<P>

<a NAME="[3.0]"><b>[3.0]</b></a>  The Multimedia Laboratory had presented an interesting and
unusual multimedia project called the Virtual Museum at
Eurographics 92 (see <a href="rosenblum.001.html">REALIZATION REPORT #1</a>) and I stopped by to see
recent progress.  This project is the work of a five member
subgroup of the laboratory called the Object-Oriented Group.  The
Virtual Museum is part of a ten year ongoing effort to develop a
test framework for multimedia.  Research includes investigation of
timing issues for multimedia and methods for hiding hardware
dependencies from the user.  The application is distributed over
several machines.  A Next is used as the sound server, an SGI as
the render server, and a Sun as the application server.  An Amiga
2000/Video Toaster combination provides video recording.  Using a
spaceball, a user "walks through" the Virtual Museum.  The group
strives to develop tools for the flexible design of hardware and
software components with all equipment under computer control.
<P>

Current research includes techniques for media synchronization and
further development of models for inclusion in the Museum.
However, much of the current research is devoted to investigations
of data modeling (with a realization that eventually data bases
must be specifically designed for multimedia applications).  Time
based-media, including digital video and audio, require notions of
data flow, timing, temporal composition and synchronization.  These
concepts are not contained in conventional data models.  This work
extends previous efforts that have dealt primarily with text and
images.
<P>

The basic abstraction for time-based media modelling is "temporal
sequences" of media elements, where this term includes video
frames, musical notes, etc.  These sequences are proposed to occur
as concatenated groups called "streams".  A formal set of
mathematical mappings are proposed to develop a procedure for
processing these primitives.  The mappings then become the basis
for higher level operands that provide a formal foundation for data
modelling.  Existing data bases do not support these multimedia
data models and new data base architectures are required to provide
the building blocks for better multimedia.

<a NAME="[1.0]"><b>[1.0]</b></a>  The Netherlands Energy Research Foundation (ECN) carries out
research to develop "sustainable" energy supplies, where
sustainable means that the energy is produced without limiting the
options of future generations.  Within ECN a software engineering
and research group investigates how computer science can best be
applied to ECN problems.  This report focuses on the visualization
research of Dr. Jarke van Wijk within this group.

<a NAME="[2.0]"><b>[2.0]</b></a>  The Netherlands Energy Research Foundation (ECN) is a 900
person research organization investigating current and future
energy requirements and solutions.  They hold that fossil fuels,
nuclear energy, and renewable energy sources (solar, wind, hydro,
and biomass) are the three constituents of the energy supply
system, but their ratio of use will change.  ECN believes future
developments will be driven by environmental issues.  They focus on
long term solutions.  Their energy research program is divided into
five categories:  fossil fuels (including environmental research),
renewable energy, radiation technology, nuclear energy, and energy
studies.  ECN was originally oriented to nuclear energy and they
have a nuclear reactor.
<P>

In addition to the five units described above, there is a 200
person technology service unit.  The technology unit includes
mechanical engineering and finite element modeling, networking,
computational engineering, and computational physics.  Also
included in this unit are a 15 member software engineering and
computer science research group.  This group performs research into
software engineering, knowledge-based engineering (including ESPRIT
funded projects), and a two person visualization effort that is led
by Dr. Jarke van Wijk.
<P>

Van Wijk has become, in effect, a one man visualization center for
the organization.  About half of his time is spent performing
visualization for clients (mostly non-ECN) and the remainder on
performing research into new computer graphics algorithms (and
interfaces) for visualization.  His work is done on a Silicon
Graphics computer.
<P>

ECN's 1991 budget was 149.5 million guilders ($ 83M) of which
about 40% comes from a government grant.  Over 60% of the budget
goes for personnel expenses.
<P>

<a NAME="[3.0]"><b>[3.0]</b></a>  One visualization effort helped Heineken understand a
problem in factory automation.  The scuffing of the beer bottles
against each other as they proceed down the conveyer belt in the
factory limits the number of times a bottle can be used.  To gain
understanding, a physically-based model of the bottles traveling on
the conveyer belt was developed at Delft Technical University and
visualized by van Wijk.  The beer bottles on the conveyor are
modelled as discrete elements and are shown as circles.  Contacts
between the bottles are shown as lines, with a width proportional
to the contact force.  Input data at each step includes the
coordinates, velocity, and other quantities describing both the
bottle and the properties of the contact.  The model has been
successfully verified using real data.  Output displays have helped
gain an understanding of the places on the conveyor belt where the
damage is really occurring and potential solutions are being
investigated using the model.
<P>

A second visualization application, performed using ship-design
software from the Maritime Research Institute Netherlands (MARIN),
shows the dynamics of a ship in sea waves.  The calculation of the
dynamics is done in the frequency domain, using a ship-
characteristics-dependent spectral transfer function for the six
degrees of freedom.  The sea surface is described by a wave model
and the user can specify a wave spectrum interactively with
parameters such as wind force.  Interactive analysis and animation
tools illustrate the ship's motion through the waves.  Another
application developed novel visualization techniques to assist ECN
scientists in understanding the behavior of molten mixture of
potassium and lithium carbonate.  By creating a tube frame to
visualize the local structure, the convex hull of a selected ion is
isolated.  Examining the motion of the convex hull over time using
animation, one notices that the convex hull of different ions have
differing spatial characteristics (especially average size).  These
spatial differences help explain the bonding and rotational
behavior of the molecules.
<P>

The use of animation in these applications has led to an analysis
of the requirements for interactive animation ("steering") of such
applications.  User interface techniques include manipulation via
a control panel, direct manipulation of a time graph, and keyboard
accelerators.  The combined use of spatial and temporal views on
the data helps the location and analysis of areas and time
intervals of interest.
<P>

<a NAME="[4.0]"><b>[4.0]</b></a>  Two-dimensional fluid flow was an important topic in the
1980's and those algorithms have now been incorporated in
commercial software.  Many users of fluid dynamics have recently
taken to using such tools (cf. the report on the work of Dr. Tim
David, University of Leeds in <a href="rosenblum.002.html">REALIZATION REPORT #2</a>; also Dr.
Arthur Mynett of Delft Hydraulics).  A recent addition to this 2D
work has been the development of an interesting technique called
"spot noise."  Spot noise is based on the repeated addition of
randomly positioned spots on a surface.  A stochastic texture is
thus produced.  The properties of the texture can be varied by
changing the properties of the spot, such as shape, size, and
direction.  If these properties are changed as a function of the
data, then structure appears in the texture which contains useful
information about the flow.
<P>

The seminal paper by James Hellman and Lambertus Hesselink of
Stanford in my special issue on data visualization of IEEE Computer
Graphics and Applications was awarded best paper of 1991 by that
journal for its extension of two-dimensional fluid visualization to
3D.  Representing 3D vector fields and 3D flow surfaces is now an
important research area.  The Netherlands' visualization research
community, esp. Dr. van Wijk and Dr. Frits Post of Delft Technical
University, are among a small group at the forefront.
<P>

A common technique in fluid flow visualization is the insertion of
particles into the flow.  A variety of techniques follow:  the
particle's time-dependent position can be animated, stream lines or
stream surfaces can be generated, etc.  Each technique helps
illuminate different characteristics of the flow field and the
selection of technique(s) is problem specific.  Older particle
rendering methods have generally treated the particle as a point.
Van Wijk has shown that advantages accrue if the particle is
treated as consisting of very small facet, with an associated
normal.  Due to the facet's small size, the shape is irrelevant but
the knowledge of the normal assists in the visualization process.
These "surface-particles" are generated by user-defined particle
sources that have geometric and time-related attributes.
<P>

The user interface allows for both continuous and discrete release
of the surface-particles into the flow.  The rendering pipeline is
taken to be: shading, transformation, filtering, and scan
conversion.  The aim is to achieve good quality at a reasonable
cost.  The latest additions to this work are modified Gaussian
filters for the prevention of spatial and temporal artifacts and a
new method for computing and compensating for the surface-
particle's opacity.  A paper presenting this research will appear
in the July '93 special issue of IEEE Computer Graphics and
Applications.
<P>

A second area of current research is producing a new method for the
generation of "stream surfaces".  A stream surface is the trace of
a curve (think of a continuous stream of particles forming a curve)
in the flow as time varies.  When a large number of streamlines is
required to gain understanding, stream surfaces offer better
insight into the structure of the flow field.  Hidden surface
elimination and shading can then be used to provide depth and
orientation cues.
<P>

One approach to stream surface generation is to use a polygonal
mesh that approximates the stream function.  However, deformations
by convergent flow, divergent flow, and shear flow cause
difficulties.  In this research, the stream surface is represented
as an implicit surface f(x)=C.  After the initial calculation of f,
a family of stream surfaces is generated by varying C.  The shapes
of the originating curves are defined by the value f at the
boundary.
<P>

<a NAME="[5.0]"><b>[5.0]</b></a> This is one in a series of reports that cover visualization
research activities at several organizations in The Netherlands.
Fluid flow and its visualization is an important research component
in The Netherlands and these researchers appear to benefit from the
close ties they maintain.

<a NAME="[1.0]"><b>[1.0]</b></a>  For reasons that are obvious to anyone who has heard the
story of the little boy with his finger in the dike, fluid
(specifically water) flow is an emphasized research topic in The
Netherlands.  Working closely with industrial partners, the
computer graphics group at Delft University of Technology focuses
on research into the visualization of fluid flow from computational
fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations.  Applications are primarily on
water flow, which has some distinct problems when compared with
aerospace-oriented CFD visualization.

<P>

<a NAME="[2.0]"><b>[2.0]</b></a>  One hundred fifty years old in 1992, Delft University of
Technology (TU Delft) is Holland's oldest and largest school of
engineering.  TU Delft has 12 faculties (departments) serving over
13,000 students.  One of these is the Faculty of Technical
Mathematics and Informatics where Informatics is defined as
Computer Science and Information Systems.  The computer science
research concentrates on software engineering, theoretical
informatics and operating systems, with a focus on the quality of
the ultimate information system and the speed with which it can be
constructed.  A second research area is "technical applications,"
including CAD/CAM, computer graphics, and knowledge-based systems.
The computer graphics research is headed by Prof. F. W. Jansen.
Dr. Frits Post leads the research effort in data visualization.
This effort focuses on the visualization of 3D vector fields with
an emphasis on visualizing 3D fluid flows using data from
computational fluid dynamics (CFD) numerical simulations.
<P>

The computer graphics group contains some 9 people, 4 in
visualization.  Several of these are PhD students (who in Holland
are typically salaried university employees).  A PhD takes four
years after achieving an engineering degree.  This is the first
university degree obtained in Holland but is roughly the equivalent
to a U.S. masters degree.  Only in the last decade has the
university developed a regular graduate student program.  Because
of the newness of these programs and the lack of "post-doc"
positions, there is some uncertainty as to the transition path from
a completed doctorate to an employed research position in
universities or industry.
<P>

<a NAME="[3.0]"><b>[3.0]</b></a>  One ongoing research project at TU Delft is the development
of a testbed for fluid flow visualization.  This project is
partially funded by Delft Hydraulics.  The goal is to provide the
characteristics that one would like in a testbed: easy program
development and integration of new techniques as they arise,
programmer access at the source code level for the addition,
replacement, extension, or division of modules, minimum software
overhead for prototyping, good debugging facilities, and
artificially generated data with known characteristics for
evaluating new methodologies.
<P>

The testbed is currently used for development of visualization
techniques for turbulent flow. Methods are developed to represent
turbulent flow as a mean velocity field and a turbulence intensity
field. The turbulence intensity is used to generate perturbations
of the velocity field, resulting in fluctuations of particle
motion. This is visualized by animation of particle motion.  In
addition, the lifetime of particles can be dynamically adjusted,
and extra particles can be launched, depending on the local
characteristics of the field.  Very dynamic areas in the flow field
result in more particles being launched and these die quickly when
leaving the turbulent area.  Techniques that include the use of
color and particle traces provide an overview of the process.
Another useful recent testbed addition has been the development of
a new user interface.  This has provided point and click, sliding
knobs for parameter control, and other interfaces, including some
for data probing, that assist both the novice and sophisticated
user in better interaction with the testbed.
<P>

<a NAME="[4.0]"><b>[4.0]</b></a>  The Power Probe, under development by a graduate student who
divides his time between TU Delft and The Netherlands Energy
Research Foundation ECN, is a data probing device designed
specifically for 3D fluid flow analysis.  The probing portion of
the program is straightforward.  A point is picked out in 3D space
by manipulating a mouse while the display contains a cursor
location that moves with planes parallel to the axes planes shown
as a visual aid.  Alternately, a user can type in specific
coordinates if known.  The innovative aspect of this work is the
association of a glyph (a geometrical object with information
encoded in the geometry or associated attributes such as color)
with the data point and a small surrounding region.  Components of
the local flow field are derived and encoded onto the glyph.  The
components are derived by a decomposition of the velocity gradient
tensor, calculated in a local coordinate frame, where one axis is
aligned with velocity direction.  This results in quantities such
as the curvature of the stream line through the probe point,
convergence, shear, and helicity (rotation component).  Each of
these quantities is associated with a specific part of the glyph.
<P>

The glyph is arrow shaped with disks and rings at the base, and the
components of the local flow are mapped onto the shapes of parts of
the glyph, and patterns on the surface of the glyph.  So the glyph
direction and length symbolizes velocity and magnitude of the
velocity field at the point selected by the Power Probe.  To
develop the Power Probe, TU Delft researchers designed a set of
graphical primitives that visualize the quantities in an
intuitively understandable form.  The probe is currently being
integrated with a 3D CFD data set for evaluating the potential of
these methods to assist the fluid dynamicist in obtaining improved
understanding.  Certain extensions of this concept to regions of
interest, instead of single points, appear promising and will be
the subject of future research.
<P>

<a NAME="[5.0]"><b>[5.0]</b></a>  Another research topic is hybrid rendering algorithms.
Volume rendering has been a leading topic in scientific
visualization over the last 5 years.  Classical rendering methods
portray surfaces while volume rendering allows viewing into the
interior of objects or viewing nebulous objects such as clouds.  As
volume rendering algorithms have improved, interest has grown in
hybrid rendering which allow volume rendered scenes that contain
geometrical objects such as slice planes.
<P>

Hybrid rendering can be achieved by converting volume data into
geometrical format for rendering, by converting geometrical data
into voxelized format for rendering, or by rendering each type of
data separately.  In the latter case, algorithms are required that
effectively merge pixel buffers containing volumetric and geometric
components. TU Delft is investigating new methods for this last
type of hybrid rendering.  Environmental studies serves as an
example application area, such as the dispersion of pollutants in
sea water.
<P>

The H-buffer rendering system consists of a buffer for storing
results (the H-buffer), algorithms for writing data into the
buffer, and a means of taking objects in the H-buffer and
calculating the color of a pixel from the elements stored in the
buffer.  The H-buffer works as a multi-layered Z-buffer, so that
for polygons and lines, volume and opacity information is
maintained.  Polygons are rendered into the H-buffer by storing an
object for each pixel covered by the polygon.  The boundary of the
volume is also stored into the H- buffer.  This boundary can be any
bounding object, but typically is just the extent of the volume.
Finally, rays are cast into the volume to render the volumetric
data.  The H-buffer then contains an ordered list of lines,
polygons, and volumetric data with entry and exit positions into
the volume known.  Before an object is merged, a ray is cast from
the entry point up to the object.  The resulting opacity and color
along the sub-ray are merged with the current pixel color until the
process terminates.
<P>

<a NAME="[6.0]"><b>[6.0]</b></a>  We have noted in other reports that the visualization
community in The Netherlands maintains close ties.  Combining this
issue with the reports on ECN (<a href="rosenblum.001.html">REALIZATION REPORT #1</a>), FEL-TNO
(<a href="rosenblum.008.html">REALIZATION REPORT #8</a>), and Delft Hydraulics (to appear) yields

<a NAME="[1.0]"><b>[1.0]</b></a>  A large funder of information technology (IT) research and
development in the U.K. is the Joint Framework for Information

<P>

<a NAME="[2.0]"><b>[2.0]</b></a>  NEURAL NETWORK TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER PROGRAM
<P>

The L. 5.75 million ($9 M), three-year Neural Computing Technology
Transfer program will have two main parts: (i) an awareness
campaign concerned with raising general business awareness of
neural computing, and (ii) a program of clubs concerned with
building application demonstrators.
<P>

Good progress has been made on implementing both parts of the
program.  Touche Ross Management Consultants have been appointed to
assist the DTI to plan and manage the awareness campaign.  Touche
Ross will lead a consortium of organizations that will provide the
necessary marketing, technical, organizational, and
representational skills needed for the campaign.  Planning of the
awareness campaign is well advanced toward the launch of an initial
program of activities in January 1993.
<P>

Following the competitive call issued in August, over 70 outline
proposals for application demonstrator clubs were received.  A
short list has been selected and it is expected that the final
selection of the clubs to be supported will be completed early in
the new year.
<P>

<a NAME="[3.0]"><b>[3.0]</b></a>  DISTRIBUTED SYSTEM ENGINEERING PUBLICATION TO BE LAUNCHED
<P>

New ground is broken with the announcement of a collaborative
journal to be published by three major learned bodies:  The British
Computer Society, The Institution of Electrical Engineers and The
Institute of Physics.
<P>

The journal, entitled Distributed Systems Engineering, will
concentrate on the problems of integration of processing, storage,
and communications networks to form an overall distributed
processing system.  Dr. Morris Sloman of Imperial College
summarizes: 'Any distributed system needs to be managed, secure,
and while working in the face of inevitable faults, must be able to
incorporate new user requirements and technological developments.'
<P>

The journal will publish practical engineering-oriented papers with
the emphasis on implementation experience rather than the
theoretical approach.  It will provide a forum for the developments
in distributing architecture and networking technology, allied with
the emergence of multimedia processing and storage, all reflecting
the rapid increase in both research and commercial activity in
distributing systems engineering.
<P>

The new journal will draw its readership from both the academic
research community and commercial and industrial implementors.  The
journal will be served by an international editorial board covering
all sectors of the science community.  The board will be controlled
by three Honorary Editors:  Prof. David Hutchison, Lancaster,
University; Dr. Morris Sloman, Imperial College; and Dr. Rafael
Alonso, Matsushita Information Technology Laboratory.
<P>

To be published quarterly, the first issue of Distributed Systems
Engineering will be available in July, 1993.

<a NAME="[4.0]"><b>[4.0]</b></a>  1993 JFIT TECHNICAL CONFERENCE - SHOWPIECE FOR UK IT
<P>

Plans for the 1993 conference are progressing well.  The conference
is designed to be a showpiece for UK IT supported by JFIT.  It will
be of interest to IT research workers and managers involved in JFIT
programs as well as potential users and appliers of the technology.
The first technical conference in Sussex was widely hailed as a
successful and stimulating event.
<P>

We have planned a three-stream conference with three leading
figures giving overview talks in plenary sessions.  Two streams of
papers will be devoted to the Devices and Systems areas, and the
third stream will feature cross-boundary sessions on novel uses of
IT and neural computing.
<P>

There has been a remarkable response to our Call for Papers, and we
anticipate high-quality presentations over an range of topics.
Papers have been refereed and selected on the basis of significant
achievements, exploitation potential, and technical excellence.
<P>

To accompany the Conference there will be an exhibition with
approximately 100 posters and demonstrations by JFIT project teams.
<P>

The Conference will be opened by Mr. Robert Jackson, MP, of the
Office of Science and Technology.  Dr. Geoffrey Robinson, until
recently head of IBM Hursley Laboratories, and now Chief Advisor on
Science and Technology in DTI, will be the after-dinner speaker at
the Conference dinner on Tuesday evening.

<a NAME="[5.0]"><b>[5.0]</b></a> SECOND CSATP PROJECT MOVES AHEAD
<P>

The second project in DTI's Compound Semiconductor Advanced
Technology Program (CSATP), High Efficiency Microwave Power
Amplifiers (HEMPA), is now well underway.
<P>

The project was developed under the auspices of JFIT as a
comprehensive package of activities concerned with research into
the improvement of DC to RF conversion efficiency of GaAs-based
solid-state devices especially for power applications.
<P>

High-frequency solid-state power amplifiers are key components in
a variety of communications and radar applications.  The
requirements of high output power and high device efficiency is a
critical system requirement but places ever more stringent demands
on component performance and the underpinning technologies.
<P>

HEMPA, therefore, targets key areas of technology such as GaAs MMIC
based amplifiers for driver applications, low-loss power combining
techniques and investigation of automated multi-carrier and
wideband measurement techniques.  Emerging solid-state devices
based on novel materials and device structures, as well as novel
circuit topologies and configurations, will also be examined.
<P>

Work on this three-year project, costing L. 1.3 million ($1.9 M)
started on the 1st April 1992 and involves the close collaboration
of British Aerospace Space Systems (lead partner), Brunel
University, Elettronica UK, ERA, and Phillips Research
Laboratories.  The project promises to make a major contribution
toward strengthening the UK microwave industry.

<a NAME="[2.0]"><b>[2.0]</b></a>  The 200 person Center for Mathematics and Computer Science
(CWI) in Amsterdam is an independent research institute.  CWI is
part of the Mathematical Centre Foundation, a non-profit
organization founded in 1946, that fosters mathematics and computer
science research in The Netherlands.  CWI seeks to initiate
research that is subsequently transferred to universities, applied
research laboratories, or commercial organizations for further R&D.
CWI receives 70% of its funding from the Dutch NWO (National
Organization for Scientific Research).  The remaining 30% is
obtained through national research programs, European programs
(ESPRIT, RACE, BRITE, etc.) and contract research commissioned by
the industry.
<P>

CWI is located at the Watergraafsmeer Scientific Center (WCW) in
Amsterdam.  It benefits from the presence next door of the academic
computer center SARA which contains a CRAY Y-MP and a 512 processor
transputer system.  Several other Dutch research institutes are
also located at WCW, as is the mathematics and computer science
faculty of the University of Amsterdam.  CWI is the Dutch member of
ERCIM, the European Research Consortium for informatics and
mathematics.  This organization is a loose consortium of major
research laboratories throughout the EEC.  Other members are
CNR/IEI (Italy), FORTH (Greece), GMD (Germany), INESC (Portugal),
INRIA (France), RAL (U.K.), and SINTEF (Norway).
<P>

CWI's Interactive Systems Department consists of 20+ researchers.
Areas of investigation include multimedia, languages for parallel
processing, visualization, and graphics architectures.
<P>

<a NAME="[3.0]"><b>[3.0]</b></a>  CWI believes that the management among a set of concurrent
processes arises in many applications and is a central concern in
parallel computing.  A language called MANIFOLD is being developed
to describe and manage the complex interconnections among
independent, concurrent processes.  The language is concerned not
with the capability of individual processes, but rather with how
their processes are interconnected and how these interconnections
change.
<P>

The basic components in the MANIFOLD model are processes, events,
ports, and streams.  CWI defines a process as a black box with well
defined ports of connection through which it exchanges "units" of
information with other processes in its environment.  A process has
its own private processor and memory.  A stream is a sequence of
bits that represent a reliable, directed flow of information in
time.  Streams and processes are connected through "ports", i.e.
regulated openings at the process boundaries.  Information placed
into one of its output ports by a process flows out only when it is
connected to a stream.  Finally, events are asynchronous, non-
decomposable messages broadcast by a process to its environment.
<P>

MANIFOLD is an ongoing effort with experimentation taking place on
a 512 processor transputer system.  CWI hopes to put the system on
a Connection Machine for further development and evaluation.
<P>

<a NAME="[4.0]"><b>[4.0]</b></a>  CWI is investigating the image processing of facial
movements with the goal of providing automated methodologies for
lip movements for applications like low-bandwidth image telephones
and animations.  In a typical setup, an actor would speak before a
camera.  Lip movements are then analyzed and fed into keyframes.
The goal is to automate the processing between keyframes.  The
difficulties lie in real-time computation, the analysis and
classification of mouth shapes, and compensating for significant
person-dependent differences.
<P>

The approach is to select and measure the lip area, perimeter,
mouth opening size, etc.  Keeping the lip corners connected during
speech is a problem that has been solved using mathematical
morphology.  For the whole face, registration is performed using
key points that are selected because they remain nearly invariant
(e.g. the bottom of the nose).  The techniques are not human
dependent - they can be used to create, for example, a talking
telephone with a mouth that moves.
<P>

CWI is beginning a new effort in scientific visualization.  They
expect to focus on computational steering, with an emphasis on
chemical reactions.

<a NAME="[1.0]"><b>[1.0]</b></a>  Because of its ability to cross national boarders in Europe,
the European Strategic Programme for Research and Development (R&D)
in Information Technology (ESPRIT) has become a premier source of
funding for European research.  ESPRIT Information Day was held in
February to discuss the next round of ESPRIT funding (ESPRIT-III).
This report provides a brief overview of ESPRIT and the objectives
and R&D tasks for two domains:  High Performance Computing and its
Applications and Basic Research.  A second report will follow to
describe the objectives and R&D for selected additional domains.
The R&D tasks for Basic Research specifically includes a new task
(R&D task 6.4) covering data visualization and virtual reality.
<P>

<a NAME="[2.0]"><b>[2.0]</b></a>  Launched in 1984, ESPRIT was designed to become a European
information technology (IT) program that would overcome such
problems as a lack of university/industrial cooperation and funding
limitations on trans-national programs.  ESPRIT proposals are
required to have participants from two member states and typically
comprise a consortium of 4 to 10 members that range from university
research to industrial partners and end users.  At the Information
Day High Performance Computing (HPC) session it was indicated that
ESPRIT-III would closely examine consortiums with large numbers of
partners, with the implication of past problems.  Awards are highly
sought after, both by academics and leading industrial R&D
organizations, and highly competitive.  European colleagues
indicated to me that the acceptance was about 1 in 10.  ESPRIT is
administered by Project Officers under the Commission of European
Communities and awards are based on a review process.  From what I
could gather, the review process appears similar to that used by
the U.S. National Science Foundation.  ESPRIT does not fully fund
awards; rather the percent of funding is negotiable in the final
contract stage and tends toward 50% ESPRIT funding and 50% matching
funds, typically by the industrial partners.  Projects can be
proposed for up to 5 years duration.  A look at the yearly synopses
for the Computer-Integrated Manufacturing and Engineering portion
of ESPRIT revealed projects ranging from 4 to 60 months with most
concentrated between 2 and 4 years.
<P>

Members of the European Free Trade Association who are not EEC
members are permitted to participate with certain constraints.
Just before my visit to Switzerland in December, the Swiss had very
narrowly rejected a new European free trade pact.  Swiss
researchers were concerned as to whether this "no" vote would
prevent their participation in future ESPRIT projects.
<P>

<a NAME="[3.0]"><b>[3.0]</b></a>  The ESPRIT-III 1993-94 program is 400 million ECU (European
Currency Units) or about $ 500 M in size.  The funding is divided
into 7 programs, although interdisciplinary proposals across
subdivision boundaries are accepted.  These program areas are:
<P>

<PRE>
   Microelectronics
   Design and Engineering Technology for Software Intensive Systems
   High Performance Computing and its Applications (HPC)
   Advanced Business and Home Systems - Peripherals
   Computer Integrated Manufacturing and Engineering (CIM&E)
   Basic Research
   Open Microprocessor Systems Initiative
</PRE>

The ESPRIT Information Day was held in Brussels in February for
potential proposal submitters.  It was not, however, a general
introduction to the ESPRIT program.  Rather, it was an opportunity
to hold discussions and ask questions of Project Officers and, in
afternoon sessions, to present short briefs on ones own expertise
in the search for partners to form a consortium.  The Program
Officers for each of the seven topic areas ran the all day meetings
in parallel and they were not uniformly structured.  I attended the
HPC session in the morning and the CIM&E afternoon session.  The
specific funding breakdown for each of the 7 domains was not known,
but it appeared from discussions that all would be approximately
equal except for Basic Research which would be one-half to two-
thirds of the others.
<P>

After an introductory session attended by all, the attendees
separated by domains.  The morning HPC session included a brief
overview of recent HPC projects, including the use of acronyms that
required much pre-knowledge.  This was followed by a question and
answer session between the Project Officers and the audience.  The
CIM&E afternoon session was organized to permit short briefings of
special capabilities or interests by potential submitters and allow
groups who might wish to combine efforts to talk.  It left me with
the impression that it was an unlikely method of finding
collaborators, yet the number of Information Day attendees has
risen dramatically since its conception a couple of years back and
the hallways were crowded.  I should also mention that bulletin
boards were available for soliciting partners and stating areas of
expertise.  Some of these ads were from leading institutions and
the area was full of people making notes.
<P>

The remainder of this report describes the High Performance
Computing and Its Applications and the Basic Research portions of
ESPRIT-III.  The detailed objectives and R&D tasks identify the key
priorities on which the bulk of the resources and efforts are
expected to be concentrated in 1993/94.
<P>

The following information is extracted from Specific Research and
Technology Development Programme in the Field of Information
Technology, ESPRIT Work Programme for 1993-94, DRAFT COPY.  Those
R&D tasks where major R&D work is already in hand in ongoing
projects are marked with an (*).
<P>

<a NAME="[4.0]"><b>[4.0]</b></a>                       DOMAIN 3
         High Performance Computing And its Applications
<P>

The work in this domain aims to expand the application potential of
High Performance Computing and Networking (HPCN); to demonstrate
the cost-effective transfer of applications currently running on
conventional systems to HPCN environments; to act on new
applications which will foster the mastery of new functionalities
and levels of performance; to develop next generation HPCN
technologies and systems, especially those which improve the
processes of application transfer or development, and are easy to
use.  The application focus is on improving industrial and
commercial productivity.  The high performance systems addressed
concern parallel processing systems both shared memory and
distributed memory multiprocessors, clusters of workstations for
high performance applications and the integration of high
performance sub-systems into distributed client/server
relationships.
<P>

HPCN Applications
<P>

Objectives
<P>

To demonstrate within a two-year timescale the successful migration
of the 10 or 15 most relevant existing codes onto advanced parallel
computing environments in a way which is as far as possible
portable and scalable.  This should build confidence in the
effectiveness of HPC both technically and economically.
<P>

To develop and demonstrate within two to five years new
applications that could not be solved cost-effectively without HPCN
and which have an impact on industrial and commercial productivity.
<P>

R&D tasks
<P>

<PRE>
     Existing Applications
</PRE>

3.1  Migration of existing codes from, for example, the fields of
structural analysis, fluid dynamics, computational chemistry or
microbiology, the simulation of industrial processes, data

through simulation and modelling of complex phenomenon for example
in the fields of mechanical impact and chemical research.
<P>

3.3  New applications which improve through HPCN information
management by planning, scheduling or quality enhancement, better
access and management of databases and complex data analysis.
<P>

3.4  New embedded systems applications of HPCN which are of
particular economic relevance, addressing complex signal
processing, pattern recognition, image processing, real time
systems involving data fusion and advanced surveillance systems.
Emphasis will be placed on the use of commodity components and
subsystems.

<P>

<a NAME="[5.0]"><b>[5.0]</b></a>                       DOMAIN 6
                         Basic Research
<P>

Objective
<P>

The dual objective is to replenish the reservoir of new knowledge
and expertise on which industrial research must draw to generate
future technological breakthroughs, and to ensure the environment
for training tomorrow's researchers in the most effective way
possible, through research itself.
<P>

Basic Research achieves this objective by contributing to the
programme's main aims from an upstream position and reinforcing
interdisciplinary links.  To ensure focus and effective application
of resources, the priority R&D tasks for 1993/94 fall into seven
clusters taking sharp aim at major themes of industrial R&D,
notably software best practice, high performance computing and
networking, image processing, multimedia and basic, microelectronic
technologies.  Projects would mostly be of a horizontal and highly
interdisciplinary nature addressing problems with potential impact
in several industrial areas.

<P>


<a NAME="[1.0]"><b>[1.0]</b></a>  <a href="rosenblum.001.html">REALIZATION REPORT #1</a> presented an overview of ESPRIT, a
premier European R&D program for information technology and gave
the objectives and R&D tasks for the domains of High Performance
Computing and its Applications and Basic Research.  This combined
issue of the ONR Newsletters on Electronics and Computer Science
presents the ESPRIT-III program for Microelectronics.
<P>

<a NAME="[2.0]"><b>[2.0]</b></a>  The ESPRIT program and ESPRIT Information Day were discussed
in <a href="rosenblum.001.html">REALIZATION REPORT #1</a>.  This report provides additional
information on the ESPRIT-III program by providing the objectives
and R&D tasks for the Microelectronics Domain.  The information
presented below is extracted from "Specific Research and Technology
Development Programme in the Field of Information Technology,
ESPRIT Work Programme for 1993-94, DRAFT COPY" that was provided to
Information Day participants.  It outlines the strategy in
microelectronics for the next round of ESPRIT funding and beyond.
It outlines the objectives and the R&D tasks both for Group V and
Group III-V based electronics and optoelectronics. It also outlines
the objectives and R&D tasks for micro-systems which integrate
various functions on the same chip, e.g. micro-electronics, optics,
mechanics.  Those R&D tasks where major R&D work is already in hand
in ongoing projects are marked with an (*).
<P>

<a NAME="[3.0]"><b>[3.0]</b></a>                       DOMAIN 1
                        MICROELECTRONICS
<P>

The goal of the work in Microelectronics is to strengthen the
European ICs users' capabilities to develop advanced and innovative
electronic systems for a broad range of applications, by providing
them with a competitive European source of the necessary
technologies and tools.  The work on the development of CMOS
technologies and relevant design, manufacturing and packaging
techniques will be carried out in conjunction with JESSI (Joint
European Submicron Silicon) and making best use of the expertise
available in the Community at large.  Specific actions will be
taken in favour of the SMEs to establish favourable conditions to
their use of microelectronics, covering training aspects,
demonstration of IC capabilities and service.
<P>

The continuous trend towards higher levels of integration driven by
system manufacturers is reflected in the new approach of the work
programme, which is focussing its objectives on the following three
primary axes of R&D action:
<P>

<PRE>
     design, fabrication and test of complex ICs (ASICs and
     standard logic circuitry) based on the next generations of
     core semiconductor technologies;
</PRE>

<PRE>
     increased integration at system level, to be exploited in
     multifunctional Application Specific (Sub)-Systems (ASIS), by
     incorporating different electronic functions on the same chip
     (through the combination of different core technologies or
     variants) or at multichip level;
</PRE>

<PRE>
     development of microsystems, aimed at achieving the
     compatibility of different types of functions/processes on the
     same chip or at multi-chip level, and bringing together
     different semiconductor technologies with micro-optics and
     micromechanics.
</PRE>

To make best use of the resources, synergy will be promoted, both
vertically within one main strategic area (e.g. between users,
suppliers and researchers, from materials and technology
development to final assembly and testing) and across the three
different axes of action, as driven by the requirements of a
specific application field (such as automotive, telecom or
consumer).
<P>

The creation and evolution of international standards will also be
promoted and industry will be assisted in the early implementation
as well as in the evaluation of emerging standards, notably in the
design and equipment areas.
<P>

Complex ICs based on a single core technology
<P>

Objectives
<P>

To develop complex ICs (standard logic circuitry and ASICs) based
on a single core technology and aimed at major specific
applications as proposed by internal and external users, to provide
early access to the technology under development.
<P>

To cover coherently several CMOS technology generations,
encompassing development and qualification of today's technologies,
applied research to establish the next technology generation, and
explorative work towards the longer term generations.
<P>

To identify, from advanced applications (e.g. consumer, telecom),
specific requirements for technology development and design
support.
<P>

R&D tasks
<P>

*1.1  Development of CMOS processes and relevant design,
manufacturing, qualification and packaging techniques comprising:
<P>

<PRE>
     adaptation of 0.5 um CMOS technologies to the industrial
     requirements of specific applications.  Establishment of the
     next generation at 0.35 um and execution of the applied
     research work aimed at the following generation at 0.25 um,
     with a major focus on process integration and transferability
     for further industrial engineering.  Explorative work on the
     major issues which is necessary to address in order to fulfill
     the future requirements of 0.18 CMOS;
</PRE>

<PRE>
     development of equipment and materials including collaborative
     characterisation and qualification in support of the above
     process needs of European IC manufacturers, as well as low
     entry cost flexible equipment and components needed for lower
     volume quick turnaround manufacturing of ASICS, or as
     clustered platforms for the development of prototype
     processes;
</PRE>

<PRE>
     development of new semiconductor manufacturing concepts
     breaking the increasing investment spiral for ICs production
     or aimed at the optimization of the process cycle, yield, etc,
     or broadening the access of SMEs to the use of ASICs.  As part
     of the manufacturing improvements, work may address "mini
     environments", development of clean room concepts, materials
     and supply systems suitable for processing at the above target
     geometries, as well as safety and environmental issues.
</PRE>

*1.2  Application driven work notably for the area of
communications and transport, aimed at the development of
competitive III-V based microwave and millimetre wave ICs, with
particular Attention to materials (e.g. substrates) and design and
manufacturing methods.
<P>

1.3  Development of advanced packaging and assembly techniques for
single ICs, able to meet the electrical and functional requirements
of the above technologies, while maintaining a satisfactory
reliability/cost ratio.  Packaging requirements should already be
taken into account in the circuit design phase.
<P>

Multifunctional Application Specific Sub-Systems
<P>

Objectives
<P>

To integrate a larger part of a system on a single chip
(Application Specific (Sub)-System), through the flexible
combination of electronic (and possibly optoelectronic) functions
on the same chip or at multichip level, in order to match the
application requirements in terms of functionality, performance,
reliability and costs.
<P>

To demonstrate the industrial capabilities of the processes through
the fabrication of complex circuits, designed by qualified users,
including SMES, and preferably oriented towards prototypes and
applications.
<P>

To develop suitable design methodologies and techniques, specific
to the particular combination of functions.
<P>

To identify, from applications,, specific requirements for
technology development and design support.
<P>

R&D tasks
<P>

<a NAME="[1.0]"><b>[1.0]</b></a>  The German Center for Mathematics and Computer Science (GMD)
has recently established a Scientific Visualization Department in
conjunction with a supercomputer center that serves several large
German research laboratories as well as universities.  The
Visualization Department performs both basic research and
applications support.  Their work is primarily Connection Machine
based.  This report describes some of their activities.
<P>

<PRE>
<b>Contact:</b>
   Dr. Wolfgang Krueger, Director
   GMD-HLRZ. VIS
   P.O. Box 1316
   D-5205 Sankt Augustin 1, Germany
   krueger@viswiz.gmd.de
</PRE>
<P>

<a NAME="[2.0]"><b>[2.0]</b></a>  To support scientists from research centers and universities
with supercomputer capabilities, a supercomputer center (HLRZ) was
founded in 1986 by the large German research centers DESY Hamburg,
KfA Juelich, and the Center for Mathematics and Computer Science
(GMD).  Juelich is a large (4,000 person) center for computational
physics and mathematics, similar in some ways to Los Alamos
National Laboratory in the U.S.  GMD employs 1,400 people and
conducts research and development in computer science and
information technologies and in those fields of mathematics on
which these technologies depend.
<P>

GMD was founded in 1968 and has an annual budget of around DM 150
million ($ 100M) of which DM 40 million ($ 13.5M) is earned from
cooperative agreements.  The German Federal Minister for Research
and Technology supplies 90% of the remainder.  GMD is headquarter
in Sankt Augustin just outside Bonn where over 60% of their
personnel are located.  Other facilities are located in Bonn and
Darmstadt.  In addition to these three research facilities, GMD
operates research centers at the Technical University of Berlin and
at the Universities of Karlsruhe and Cologne.
<P>

In 1991 GMD established a Scientific Visualization Department to
work in conjunction with HLRZ.  The commitment to visualization by
GMD was significant; this group consists of 12 scientist plus a
support staff and has been well funded equipment-wise.  They have
available many types of computers, but much of their research uses
a Thinking Machines CM-2.  They are currently purchasing a CM-5
Connection Machine and a Kendall Square parallel computer.  The
Visualization Department performs basic research in graphics and
visualization algorithms as well as applications across several
scientific domains.  Major research topics include interactive data
visualization and real-time walkthrough models, interactive
"steering" of supercomputer computations, virtual reality using
parallel machines, and the development of visualization and data
handling algorithms for parallel machines.
<P>

<a NAME="[3.0]"><b>[3.0]</b></a>  One research topic under investigation is volume rendering
methods for massively parallel machines.  As did Yagel and Kaufman
(see <a href="rosenblum.001.html">REALIZATION REPORT #1</a>), the GMD researchers observe that a ray
cast from the image plane yields a template that can be used to
reduce processing requirements.  To avoid view-dependent sampling
difficulties, the rays are cast from a base plane parallel to a
face of the volume.  All rays now no longer need be processed; it
is enough to process one ray, store the results, and generate
subsequent rays using this stored template.  The transformation
back from this base plane to the image plane is a 2D image
transformation that is simpler to solve than the original 3D
problem.  The rendering is performed using Krueger's previous work
where he showed that volume rendering modes can be understood as
specializations of an underlying transport theory model of light
propagation in a participating medium.  These methods are being
used to enhance understanding of several types of scientific data
sets including CT data, MRI data, and protein models.  Stereoscopic
displays have been developed and integrated with the volume
rendering.
<P>

<a NAME="[4.0]"><b>[4.0]</b></a>  Cellular autonoma (one popular example is John Conway's
"Game of Life") is a topic of growing scientific importance.  Using
a known rule, the value of a given cell and its neighboring cells
at a given time determine the value of the cell at the next time
step.  In the Game of Life two states are possible for a cell, but
the concept extends easily to multiple states.  Cellular autonoma
is an attractive approach to modeling certain scientific problems
because of its suitability to extremely fast execution using
massively parallel machines, the complex physical behaviors which
can be visually seen, and the ability of cellular autonoma to
simulate mathematical models that have widespread applications to
computational physics.  Sample applications include simulating the
Navier-Stokes equations, representing equilibrium systems in
statistical mechanics and high energy physics, and portraying the
motion of complex dynamical systems and large particle systems.
The Naval Research Laboratory in Washington DC (where I return in
1994) has, under the direction of Dr. Susan Numrich, a Connection-
Machine-based research program that is successfully using cellular
autonoma to simulate underwater acoustic propagation.
<P>

Most cellular autonoma simulations are two dimensional.  Research
at the GMD Visualization Dept. has been into visualization methods
for 3D cellular autonoma.  In 2D it is enough to portray those
cells that are alive at a given time.  In 3D this technique is
insufficient unless space is only sparsely filled by "living"
cells.  Also, smoothing multi-state fields does not generally
produce good visualizations.  The GMD research team has noted that
effective visualization requires encoding information about the
nearest neighbors as well as global information on clusters.  Based
on these concepts, they are experimenting with a variety of rules
and emphasize interactivity in developing the best portrayals of
processes.  The representations portray dense groupings of "living"
cells as spheres and make use of color and transparency to portray
other parameters such as specific state and information about
neighboring regions.
<P>

Two types of volume rendering algorithms are offered to portray 3D
cellular autonoma.  The first is a ray casting method that uses
tri-cubic interpolation.  This produces realism but not
interactivity, for the calculations (on a 16K processor CM2) take
at least 10 seconds for a 512x512 image.  For interactivity, a
simple splatting method is used.  Since all displayed objects are
spheres, the splatting is straightforward and produces pictures at
rates greater than 6 frames per second.  Thus splatting is used for
interactive analysis and the ray-tracing technique for detailed
examination or for the production of final products.
<P>

These algorithms have been evaluated on a variety of rules
including an interesting one that produces a convergence to an
oscillation between three states.  The visualization techniques
developed for cellular autonoma are, of course, extensible to other
3D application models based on integer fields.
<P>

<a NAME="[5.0]"><b>[5.0]</b></a>  A significant portion of the Visualization Group's efforts
will be directed toward virtual reality.  As noted above, this
group was formed in 1991 and their efforts in virtual reality are
just beginning to gear up.  Monika Fleishmann, whose prior work
included using virtual reality to design the HP building in Berlin
as well as visualizations of East and West Berlin as the wall came
down, has joined GMD to lead this effort.  Included in the
flythrough of East Berlin mentioned above is a unique view of the
Hitler Bunker in the Berlin underground that was briefly opened
after a period of 40 years.
<P>

GMD's current equipment is from VPL.  A FakeBoom display is on
order.  Intended applications include medicine, fluid flow,
molecular modeling, and robotics.  Specific research topics include
rendering for virtual reality, collision detection, moving objects
using bounding boxes, fast transformations, and motion guidance.
They also expect to investigate the role of sound and other
ergonomic issues.  The collision detection will be done on their
Connection Machine as an exploration of the role of parallelism.
Future research will include cooperative efforts with the AI
Division of GMD, with FhG-IAO, and with the Academy of Media Arts
in Cologne.

ESPRIT Information Day #3 - the ESPRIT programs in Business & Home
Systems and Computer Integrated Manufacturing & Engineering.

<P>


<a NAME="[1.0]"><b>[1.0]</b></a>    This report concludes a three part discussion of the
European Strategic Programme for Research and Development (R&D) in
Information Technology (ESPRIT) and ESPRIT Information Day with
some additional remarks about Information Day and by listing the
programs for the ESPRIT-III Domains of Advanced Business & Home
Peripherals and Computer Integrated Manufacturing & Engineering
(CIM&E).
<P>

<a NAME="[2.0]"><b>[2.0]</b></a>  <a href="rosenblum.001.html">REALIZATION REPORT #1</a> presented an overview of (ESPRIT) and
discussed ESPRIT Information Day.  That report also provided the
objectives and R&D tasks for High Performance Computing and for
Basic Research.  <a href="rosenblum.001.html">REALIZATION REPORT #1</a> discussed the ESPRIT
microelectronics program.  This report concludes my discussion of
ESPRIT-III/Information Day with further discussion and a
presentation of the ESPRIT-III programs in Advanced Business and
Home Peripherals (mainly multimedia) and CIM&E.
<P>

I had attended the High Performance Computing Session at ESPRIT
Information Day in the morning.  In the afternoon I switched over
to CIM&E, although this was a continuation of the morning session
and not a restart.  After some confusion about rooms was solved,
the group split into two parts.  I stayed with the Robots and
Sensing Technologies.  There followed a brief overview of the CIM&E
programmatic interest in this area divided into three parts:
manufacturing systems, novel application domains - robotics, and
mobile systems.  Examples of each were given by acronym and topic,
but not explained in detail.  For example, the novel application
domain - robotics mentioned three programs dealing with autowelding
of very large structures, ship repair, and low cost robotics
control.  The information on the associated programs is presumably
available in the ESPRIT program synopses books for the previous
year.  These were provided at a table in the lobby, although
collectively (for all 7 Domains) it would be more than one could
reasonably carry home.
<P>

Next followed a half-dozen short (less than 5 minute) presentations
from groups seeking partners for joint proposals.  They included a
group looking at new fruit sorting and packing (with quality
control) methods, presentations of robotics research from two major
universities, and a company looking at walking and climbing
vehicles in flexible configurations.  Perhaps the most interesting
was a 300 person British company with previous collaborative
success.  They had demonstrated by feasibility study an idea for
using acoustic waves and measured frequency shift to develop a
torque transducer for non-contact measurements and were seeking
partners for a demonstration project.  They stated the idea was
particularly applicable to electric cars.
<P>

The interdisciplinary nature of virtual reality (vr) and data
visualization led to their appearance in tasks across the 7 Domains
of ESPRIT.  VR appears explicitly in research tasks 4.10 (see
multimedia below) and 6.3 (see Realization Report (RR) #16 on basic
research).  It was also implicit in several CIM&E tasks and there
were several proposal ideas advertised in the main hallway (see RR
#16) that focused on VR for CIM&E.  One sample advertisement
involved using vr as part of 3D laser or water jet cutting systems.
Data visualization appears in High Performance Computing (task
3.8), Advanced Business and Home Systems (task 4.6) and Basic
Research (task 6.3).
<P>

The information presented below is extracted from "Specific
Research and Technology Development Programme in the Field of
Information Technology, ESPRIT Work Programme for 1993-94, DRAFT
COPY" that was provided to Information Day participants.  Those R&D
tasks where major R&D work is already in hand in ongoing projects
are marked with an (*).

<a NAME="[1.0]"><b>[1.0]</b></a>  The Computer Science Dept. at the University of Marseille -
Luminy has recently expanded its focus to include computer
graphics.  This report describes the work of Prof. Sequeira, who is
setting up the graphics group.

</PRE>
<P>

<a NAME="[2.0]"><b>[2.0]</b></a>  The University of Marseille - Luminy is located in the
southwest suburbs of Marseille in the Luminy Science and Technology
Park on the road leading from Marseille to the pretty coastal town
of Cassis.  The science faculty of Luminy was founded in 1968 and
includes 2,300 students and 200 teachers/research workers.  The
science faculty is actually a teaching and research section of the
University of Aix-Marseille II.  The faculty includes 7
departments: computer science, mathematics, molecular and cellular
biology, chemistry, physics, social sciences, and sciences of the
land, sea, and environment.
<P>

The research emphasis in the computer science faculty at Marseille
- Luminy includes logical programming, automatic demonstration and
knowledge representation, natural languages, and speech
recognition.  The department is best known for its role in the
creation and development of the PROLOG logical programming language
that played such a prominent role in the Japanese 5th generation
computer systems project.  Prof. Sequeira has recently joined the
faculty to expand the department into computer graphics.  Prof.
Sequeira previously spent over a decade at the IBM Paris Scientific
Center where he participated in projects on geometric modeling,
workstation design, and medical imaging.
<P>

<a NAME="[3.0]"><b>[3.0]</b></a>  Prof. Sequeira's most recent research, which he is
continuing in Marseille, involves surface based methods for 3D
medical image reconstruction (see also the work of Dr. Ayache at
INRIA - Sophia Antipolis in an upcoming Realization Report).  The
goal of such research is to develop methods that will take data
measured as cross sections and associate a geometric 3D model with
this set of points.  The approach is performed in two parts.
First, interactive methods are used to identify sets of points to
be associated with tubular cavities.  Next, free-form surfaces made
of uniform B-spline patches are computed automatically to represent
these cavities.  The junctions between the surfaces are computed
automatically as sets of Bezier-Gregory patches.  The methods is
also applicable when only a few data points are present or when the
points are not homogeneously distributed in space.
<P>

<a NAME="[4.0]"><b>[4.0]</b></a>  The School of Architecture of Marseille - Luminy is located
in a separate part of the industrial park.  Several members of this
School are integrating computer graphics and archaeology.  In
particular they produced a 13 minute animation, shown on French
television, that uses animation to follow the time evolution of
Marseille.  Geometric models of buildings and other architectures
are constructed in a manner that permits overlaying the
architectural qualities native to a given era.  Programming was
performed using object-oriented programming languages.  Prof.
Sequeira and the group performing the architecture modeling will be
working together to continue and expand this effort.

JFIT: Information Technology in the U.K. (April 93)
--------------------------- 27 April 1993

<P>


<a NAME="[1.0]"><b>[1.0]</b></a>  A large funding agency for information technology (IT)
research and development in the U.K. is the Joint Framework for
Information Technology (JFIT).  JFIT is a combination of the U.K.
Science and Engineering Council (SERC) and the Department of Trade
and Industry (DTI).  The following are copied or abstracted from
selected IT items in JFIT publications.  See also <a href="rosenblum.001.html">REALIZATION REPORT #1</a>.
<P>

<a NAME="[2.0]"><b>[2.0]</b></a> FIRST 35mm VIDEO CAMERA
<P>

A 35mm diameter video camera called Peach, believed by VLSI vision
to be the world's first, has been developed (i.e. the first camera
which measures 35mm in diameter across its housing -- about the
size of a postage stamp).  The camera is based on a single-chip
sensor.  The chip is a CMOS silicon chip which includes a 312 x 287
pixel sensor array and associated digital and analog support
circuits including automatic exposure and gain control.
<P>

The original camera on a chip is based on world-class vision
research carried out at Edinburgh University and funded under JFIT.
<P>

As a consequence of the success of the work, a start up company,
VLSI Vision Ltd. (VVL), was set up to exploit the chip.  VVL's
camera product represents a strong example of how JFIT R&D programs
can lead to innovative, competitive IT systems.  The work also
highlights the vital impact silicon ICs can have in providing the
basis for new systems concepts and products.
<P>

In a new collaborative project, VLSIVision, Renishaw Metrology, and
the University of Edinburgh are now researching into the problems
of a CAD system to implement the camera for specific applications.
Clearly the ability to program vision chips quickly and efficiently
will provide an important advances in the development of future
products.
<P>

Finally, for those interested in further technical details, the
video camera provides a CCIR-standard monochrome output signal
using 5V levels generated by the sensor chip.  It draws 40mA under
a 75 ohm load from a regulated 7 to 12V dc supply.  VVL claims this
allows the device to run for 15 hours powered by an alkaline PP3
battery.
<P>

<a NAME="[3.0]"><b>[3.0]</b></a> SERC/IMechE MEETING ON IT AND PRODUCT DESIGN
<P>

SERC and the Institute of Mechanical Engineers (IMechE) hold a
jointly organized and funded annual meeting on a topic of current
interest.  This year the subject was 'IT and Product Design', with
the aim of identifying the research and development issues that the
community should be tackling over the next 5-10 years, and thus
produce an 'innovation' agenda for direction of effort.
<P>

This year's meeting, held in St. Albans from 8-10 December, was
attended by about 50 people from a variety of backgrounds,
including a mixture of overseas visitors, industrialists, and UK
academics.
<P>

The conclusions from the meeting have now been brought together
into a report.  The main finding was that there should be a
coordinated program of work addressing how designers carry out the
design process when assisted by computer-based tools, demonstrator
projects to support the scientific understanding required in the
construction of the next generation of design tools, and forward
looking projects to prototype the design tools of the future.
<P>

<a NAME="[4.0]"><b>[4.0]</b></a> NEW GaAs THREE INCH LINE OPENS
<P>

On 27 January 1993, the new GaAs Integrated Circuit manufacturing
line was officially opened by GEC-Marconi Materials Technology
Ltd., Caswell.  This new Class 10 'state-of-the-art' facility is
now Europe's finest Monolithic Microwave IC manufacturing facility
and is a key part of the company's aim to maintain its position as
Europe's leading GaAs commercial foundry.  GEC's commitment to the
exploitation of its GaAs technology base has been underlined by its
capital investment of over L.10 million ($16 million) in the new
line.
<P>

Whilst GEC has clearly invested heavily in R&D programs to support
its technology base, JFIT projects have also played an important
part in establishing its GaAs capability.  The recently completed
collaborative projects on 'Low Damage Plasma Processing', 'Improved
Substrate Materials', and the 'Advanced Lithography Research
Initiative'  have all supplied new process techniques which are
being introduced to the new manufacturing line.
<P>

<a NAME="[5.0]"><b>[5.0]</b></a> INTELLIGENT AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES WORKSHOP
<P>

The first IFAC International Workshop on Intelligent Autonomous
Vehicles (IAV's) is to be held at the University of Southampton,
UK, on 18-21 April 1993.
<P>

The aim of the workshop is to provide a forum in which new and
emerging system methodologies and technologies for the design and
development of IAVs can be discussed openly.  Many of the
approaches under discussion will be generic by nature and therefore
applicable to land, sea, and space vehicles.  Thus the workshop is
well suited for engineer and technologists from a range of
professional backgrounds, disciplines, and industries with a common
interest in intelligent autonomous systems.
<P>

An opening keynote address will be given by Prof. J.M. Brady,
University of Oxford, entitled 'Future Aspects of IAV Research'.
Over 70 papers will be presented and there will be several poster
sessions.  Each registered participant will receive a bound copy of
the pre-prints which will include both the paper and poster
presentations.
<P>

Sessions will be devoted to sensors, machine perception,
intelligent control, intelligent guidance, navigation, mission
planning and management, design and architectures, integrated
vehicle systems and other specialized topics.
<P>

It should be noted that it is the intention to restrict the number
of attendees to the workshop to approximately 100; this is in order
to encourage all the delegates to acquaint themselves with each
other and for them to make an active contribution to the workshop
proceedings.  In order to engender such friendly comradery, the
main workshop social function is a medieval banquet with
entertainment at the Abbey, Beaulieu.
<P>

<a NAME="[6.0]"><b>[6.0]</b></a> FORMATION OF THE UK MICROENGINEERING COMMON INTEREST GROUP
(MCIG)
<P>

In response to the high level of interest expressed at the recent
Microengineering meeting held at the Lucas Advanced Engineering
Center, it has been decided to go ahead with the formation of the
Common Interest Group.
<P>

The  initial idea for the group was suggested by the UKSG (UK
Sensors Group), and the DTI has agreed financial support to aid its
formation.  The aim of the group is to promote and catalyse all
aspects of microengineering research and development in the UK and
to act as a source of information on Europe.  The group will seek
to represent the UK microengineering community to Government, the
EC and other agencies.
<P>

Benefits of membership to MCIG include access to a series of major
meetings covering a wide range of subjects.  These meetings will
cover technology markets and information topics.  In addition, a
number of smaller specialist seminars will be arranged to cover, in
detail, specific areas of common interest.  Members will be
informed of recent developments and related activities within their
countries through a regular newsletter.  Opportunities will exist
within the group for members to share in collaborative work and so
bring mutual benefit to those concerned.  The group has been
coordinated initially by a steering committee with representatives
from Imperial College, Lucas, Druck, and Central Research
Laboratories.  An executive committee meeting will be elected at
the first members meeting, which will be held in early June.

<a NAME="[1.0]"><b>[1.0]</b></a>  This report describes activities at the 4th Eurographics
Workshop on Visualization in Scientific Computing, held in
Abington, U.K. on April 21-23.
<P>

<PRE>
<b>Contact:</b>
   Julian Gallop, jrg@inf.rl.ac.uk (workshop co-chair)
</PRE>
<P>

<a NAME="[2.0]"><b>[2.0]</b></a>  The 4th Eurographics Workshop on Scientific Visualization
was held at Coseners House, Abington, U.K. (Abington is near
Oxford).  Coseners House (the Cook's House) is the standing remains
of an old abbey that has been turned by Rutherford Appleton
Laboratory into a facility for meetings and workshops for a maximum
of about 50 people.  The actual workshop had an attendance of 30,
selected from submitted papers.  The papers were approximately
equally divided between theory, visualization architectures
(primarily dataflow software), and case studies from a variety of
disciplines.
<P>

The workshop began with a change in leadership, as Mr. Michel Grave
of ONERA (see <a href="rosenblum.001.html">REALIZATION REPORT #1</a>) stepped down after four years
as head of the Eurographics Visualization Group.  Michel was given
thanks as the person most responsible for organizing the workshop
series.  He introduced Dr. Jarke van Wijk of the Netherlands Energy
Research Foundation ECN  (see <a href="rosenblum.001.html">REALIZATION REPORT #1</a>), the new
Visualization Group chairman.  The two Workshop co-chairs, Mr.
Julian Gallop of Rutherford Appleton and Dr. Jeremy Walton of NAG
Ltd., then outlined the workshop format and procedure.  I gave an
opening presentation that discussed the ONR computer science
research program, the structure and visualization activities of the
IEEE Computer Society, and some recent developments in synthetic
environments.  The remainder of the workshop consisted of paper
presentations, one panel discussion, and a few hours devoted to
working group discussions.
<P>

Since this is a closed workshop and paper titles are not generally
available, the conference program is given in the appendix.  A
selection of the papers will be published in book form by Springer-
Verlag (some were presented as "work in progress").  The
participants received looseleaf-bound workshop proceedings.
<P>

<a NAME="[3.0]"><b>[3.0]</b></a>  The workshop presentations were divided roughly equally into
three parts: algorithms and techniques, architectures and systems,
and applications.  One interesting paper was by van Wijk and
Tissen.  This presented the molecular modeling work discussed in
<a href="rosenblum.001.html">REALIZATION REPORT #1</a>, where a combination of simple glyph
representation and the time-dependent convex hull of a molecule was
used to study the molten carbonate fuel cell.  The motion of the
convex hull, with molecule parts glyph represented, gave new
information about possible docking sites.  The applications papers
were of uniformly high quality although they ranged from
inexperience-in-visualization physicists and others deriving
knowledge through first use of data visualization methods through
the applied visualization work of experienced users.
<P>

Brian Collins of the IBM U.K. Center in Winchester presented an
archaeological reconstruction of the Dresden Frauenkirche in "From
Ruins to Reality - The Dresden Frauenkirche".  This church,
according to Collins the most important example of German
Protestantism architecture, collapsed from heat damage from the
resulting fire storm two days after the bombing of Dresden in 1945.
<P>

Communist rule prevented its reconstruction, but it is now hoped to
rebuild the church at an estimated cost of DM 160 million ($107
million) and 10 year's time.  Collins discussed how all available
documentation on the architecture was used in the computer graphics
reconstruction to establish realism.  Detailed architectural
drawings and old photographs were input into the geometric CATIA 3D
model.  The project was split into several parts, resulting in
separate models for the outside and inside (and portions of the
inside).  The building is very complex and detailed, and Collins
credited CATIA with enabling results to be achieved within 5 weeks.
<P>

The geometric model was supplemented with scanned images and
information available from other churches.  Additional methods
included using a color palate editor, warping 2D images onto a 3D
surface, and texture mapping.  The geometric model was then
transferred from CATIA to TDImage for photorealistic rendering and
generating camera positions.  Finally animation was produced by
incorporating the camera trajectory and geometric model into IBM
Data Explorer.  Much of the project used 9000 machine hours on IBM
RISC System/6000 workstations over 12 weeks.  The latter stages
were performed on the IBM Power Visualization System.  With its 32
processors, 21 Gbyte disk subsystem, and 1 Gbyte shared memory,
there was a dramatic time reduction from weeks to days.  A final
point made by Collins was that, if the Church reconstruction does
not happen, this will become the best historical record of the
church.  What will happen to this record, asks Collins, as digital
formats change over the coming years?
<P>

Another interesting application paper, "Visualization of
Telecommunications Network Data", was presented by Walker et al. of
BT (British Telecom) Laboratories.  The authors presented
conclusions from two studies of interest to BT management: results
of a Sunday discounting price experiment and correlation between
outages and lightening strikes.  The methodology used was not new,
but interest lay in the application to commercial data.  The
visualizations were effective and the authors stated that, after a
few minutes of initial skepticism, members of the BT Board were
very receptive to this type of presentation.  If this experience
can be generalized, it will open broad new marketplaces to what has
been known to date as "scientific visualization" (although many of
us have already opted for the term "data visualization").
<P>

<a NAME="[4.0]"><b>[4.0]</b></a> Pagendarm and Choudary of DLR (the German aerospace research
laboratory) are experienced in fluid flow theory and visualization.
<P>

Their paper "Visualization of Hypersonic Flows -- Exploring the
Opportunities to Extend AVS" evaluated the potential of the
commercial visualization system AVS (Advanced Visualization System
- one of the most widely used module-based visualization systems).
Their interest was to see to what degree AVS could serve as a post-
processing system for numerical flow analysis and, in particular,
to explore the extensibility and flexibility of AVS to incorporate
new algorithms and requirements.  They presented an animation that
used advanced flow algorithms.  Their conclusion was that AVS was
a stable and flexible platform for visualization, but restrictions
such as the definition of an unstructured cell data type required
(or at least was made easier by) performing certain functions
outside AVS.
<P>

Several papers and the panel dealt explicitly with AVS, or with
comparisons between AVS and other modular-based commercial systems.
<P>

I wonder if, on the whole, these differences are not of greater
concern to the vendors, who must differentiate to sell products,
than to the scientific end user!  However, one area where the
differences are important is for use within distributed
visualization systems.  The Computing Center at the University of
Stuttgart has been involved with ONERA and others (see <a href="rosenblum.001.html">REALIZATION REPORT #1</a>)
in developing distributed visualization.  In
"Architectures of Distributed Visualization Systems and their
Enhancements" by Wierse et al., an evaluation is made of AVS, IRIS-
Explorer, IBM Data Explorer, and the newer Visage (see the IEEE
Visualization 92 conference proceedings) specifically for
distributed visualization.  Several strengths and weaknesses are
noted for each system; in particular, weaknesses on systems lacking
shared memory (e.g. Cray) are noted.  The authors conclude by
presenting their own design.  The architecture is AVS-like on the
"top" end, but uses a data system that permits both local and
remote shared data spaces.  They avoid connectivity between modules
and place an "administrator" on each machine.
<P>

<a NAME="[5.0]"><b>[5.0]</b></a>  Two papers were presented on virtual reality (VR).  The
first, "Integrating Virtual Environments into the Dataflow
Paradigm," presented work in progress at the National Center for
Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) Urbana, USA that is beginning to
look at the role of VR in the scientific visualization process.
Projects include cosmology, molecular dynamics, and heavy equipment
simulation.  I believe that NCSA initially implemented the
NASA/Ames Virtual Windtunnel VR system; they now have a variety of
VR devices for input and display.  This was one of two U.S. papers
presented at the workshop.
<P>

"Realtime Sonification to enhance the Human-Computer Interaction in
Virtual Worlds," discussed a toolkit for using sound in a VR
environment developed at FhG-IGD (Frauhofer Institute for Computer
Graphics) in Darmstadt, Germany. The work was quite interesting and
several examples were given, such as playing a virtual drum.  The
experiments to date, however, did not explore the use of sound in
a virtual environment for obtaining knowledge from a data set.
<P>

Four working group sessions were held, pairwise in parallel.  Each
lasted about 1 1/2 hours with a report given back to the entire
workshop by the session leader.  I attended "Virtual Reality and
Multimedia" and "Visualization Methods and Techniques."  The VR was
largely a presentation and discussion by the two or three people in
the group familiar with VR/visualization applications to the
others.  The audience questioned the role of multisensory
immersion; indeed, even VR proponents do not yet claim demonstrable
scientific results.  Multimedia received a more animated
discussion.  It was agreed that multimedia would be important in
the presentation process, rather than the discovery process.
Current multimedia scientific publication efforts were discussed,
such as the multimedia cdrom from last year's Supercomputing 92
Conference.  The participants felt that publication methods would
change over the next decade and two working group members
volunteered to investigate a possible Eurographics multimedia
publication.
<P>

The "techniques" working group focused on high-dimensional data
spaces.  The participants felt that this critical topic has seen
only limited research, perhaps because it is so difficult.
Techniques mentioned by participants were the use of iconic
representation (e.g. the Chernoff "faces"), the embedded-axes
method (Beshers and Feiner, IEEE Visualization 92), ordered
parameters (Mihalisin et al., CG&A 1991 and Ward et al., IEEE
Visualization 90), and the work at IBM by Inselberg.  Chernoff's
and Feiner's research was ONR sponsored, incidently.  A second
research topic discussed was extending vector field visualization
methods to tensor fields.  The work of Hesselink (IEEE
Visualization 92) was mentioned as seminal.  Two members of the
audience, Dr. van Wijk and Prof. Hans Hagen, gave brief mention of
their respective work in progress in tensor field representation.
I had recently spoken with an ONR scientific manager who felt the
need for such results in his mechanics program, so it was good to
see this topic beginning to be addressed.
<P>

In concluding this report, I extend my thanks to Michel Grave,
Julian Gallop, and Jeremy Walton for inviting me to speak at the
workshop.  The workshop was both enjoyable and valuable, a pleasing
combination.

<P>


<a NAME="[1.0]"><b>[1.0]</b></a>  At a lecture in Cambridge (U.K.), Prof. Andrew Wiles
announced a solution to Fermat's Last Theorem, mathematics most
famous (previously) unsolved problem.
<P>

<a NAME="[2.0]"><b>[2.0]</b></a>  One of the beauties of number theory is the existence of
problems that are extremely simple to state and comprehend, but
which have defied solution by leading mathematicians for centuries.
<P>

The most famous of these is Fermat's Last Theorem which states that
the equation
<P>

<PRE>
                     N         N         N
                    X    +    Y    =    Z
</PRE>

has no positive integer solutions (X,Y,Z) for any integer N, where
N>2.  N=2 is, of course, the Pythagorean theorem for right
triangles and has many solutions in integers (e.g. (3,4,5) or
(5,12,13)).  In the 17th century the French mathematician Pierre de
Fermat wrote in the margin of a letter to a friend that he had
found an admirable proof of the theorem, but the margin was too
narrow to contain it.  Mathematicians have been perplexed ever
since!
<P>

In a June 23 lecture at the Newton Institute for Mathematics in
Cambridge (U.K.), Prof. Andrew Wiles, a British-born mathematician
now at Princeton Univ., announced a solution.  The proposed
solution, incidently, is reported to owe little to computer
technology and to be based on previous work by Prof. Matthias Flach
of Heidelberg Univ.  Both Wiles and Flach did their doctoral
studies at Cambridge, a traditional seat of excellence for number
theoretic research.
<P>

In what now seems a previous lifetime, my PhD was from this area of
number theory (Diophantine equations) that deals with the solution
of polynomial equations by integers or rational numbers.  I'll
venture a few comments that rely on the accuracy of ancient
memories.
<P>

An intriguing question for mathematical historians is "did Fermat
have a proof, or even really think he did"?  There is no other
known instance of Fermat's having claimed proofs of theorems that
he did not demonstrate, so we conjecture that he did indeed believe
he had a proof.  By trivial factorization when N is not a prime, it
is sufficient to demonstrate the conjecture for all odd primes.
This leads to the study of quadratic number fields that take the
form for a given prime P of
<P>

<PRE>
               (A + B*sqrt(P))/2
</PRE>

where A and B are integers with certain constraints on A and B that
depend on whether P is congruent to 1 or 3 modulo 4.  These
quadratic number fields satisfy the usual axioms for a number
field, but some have a remarkable property:  An important property
of the integers is that they are uniquely factorizable into a
product of primes.  However, certain quadratic number fields
contain numbers that have more than one representation as products
of prime factors.  If memory serves, it was about 1970 when the
issue of exactly which quadratic number fields did not have the
unique factorization property was finally put to rest.
<P>

The above relates to Fermat's Last Theorem because if all quadratic
number fields had unique factorization, there would be a moderately
short, elegant (and "admirable" ) proof.  And, in the days before
the algebraic representation of quadratic fields was developed,
there were subtle ways of implicitly making this erroneous
assumption.  This is at the heart of a long history of incorrect
solutions for Fermat's Last Theorem and is a likely source of
Fermat's error.
<P>

Why the fascination with this problem?  Certainly its accessibility
is a factor.  But problems such as Fermat's Last Theorem really
become important not for the problem itself, but rather for the new
branches of mathematics that arise in the quest for a solution.
Portions of modern algebra have roots here.
<P>

Logicians have demonstrated that, given the axioms of number
theory, one can write down theorems that are true but cannot be
proven true.  There were those who thought Fermat's Last Theorem
might be an example of a true but unprovable theorem.  Prof. Wiles
solution will surely be scrutinized in the coming months.

<a NAME="[1.0]"><b>[1.0]</b></a>  This report briefly summarizes the Spring 1993 National
Academy of Sciences International Science Lecture Series (sponsored
by the Office of Naval Research (ONR) and the Air Force Office of
Scientific Research (AFOSR)).  This year's topic was information
science and the area visited was Eastern Europe.  Prof. John
Hopcroft of Cornell gave a series of lectures and discussions were
held with computer scientists in the five countries visited.
<P>

<a NAME="[2.0]"><b>[2.0]</b></a>  The National Academy of Sciences holds an ongoing lecture
series under the sponsorship of ONR and AFOSR.  This year's
selection for scientific topic was information science and the
selected lecturer was Prof. John E. Hopcroft of Cornell University.
<P>

The ONR European Office played a major role in establishing the
contacts, meeting sites, and agenda for the lectures, discussions,
and visits.  Between May 23rd and June 8th the lecture series was
conducted in Eastern Europe (with a brief stop in "West" Germany).
We conducted lectures and held meetings with computer scientists in
the Federal Republic of Germany, Poland, Hungary, Russia, and the
Ukraine.
<P>

This is the lecture series' third year.  Previous years' topics
were oceanography and material science.  The goals are to conduct
discussions with colleagues, especially in places where contact
with U.S. scientists may be limited, about the current and future
directions of the field and for all participants to gain a better
understanding about the nature of current research directions in
both the host country and the U.S.
<P>

For anyone not familiar with him, Prof. John Hopcroft is the Joseph
C. Ford Professor of Computer Science and Associate Dean for
College Affairs in the College of Engineering, Cornell University.
Prof. Hopcroft is widely recognized for his pioneering work in the
theoretical aspects of computing, especially in the areas of
analysis of algorithms, formal languages, automata theory and graph
algorithms.  The four books on formal languages and on algorithms
that he has co-authored with Professor J. D. Ullman and Dr. A. V.
Aho are classics of the field.  His most recent work is in the
study of solid modeling, robotics, and information capture and
access.  For his pioneering efforts, Prof. Hopcroft was awarded the
1986 A. M. Turing Award.  He is a fellow of the American Academy of
Arts and Sciences, the American Association for the Advancement of
Science, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, and
the National Academy of Engineering and a member of the National
Science Foundation's National Science Board.
<P>

John and I participated throughout.  Others attending all or part
of the lecture series were Dr. Arthur Diness (Technical Director,
ONR European Office), Dr. Andre van Tilborg (Director of Computer
Science, ONR),  Dr. Charles Holland (Director of Mathematics and
Computer Science, AFOSR), Dr. Norman Metzger (Executive Director of
the Commission on Physical Sciences, Mathematics, and Applications,
National Research Council, National Academy of Sciences), Dr.
Nicholas Bottka (Liaison Scientist for Electronics, ONR European
Office), and Prof. Miroslaw Malek (University of Texas - Austin)
who many of you know from his days at ONREUR.
<P>

<a NAME="[3.0]"><b>[3.0]</b></a>  This report briefly summarizes the events in order to
provide the flavor of the lecture series.  I will not go into
details or provide conclusions here; a future publication is
anticipated and I will point Realization Report readers to it at
that time.  I omit discussions of dinners or receptions, although
these proved useful methods of making contacts and holding
individual discussions.
<P>

Except in the Federal Republic of Germany, where the arrangements
were made directly with the Center for Mathematics and Computer
Science (GMD), the Academy of Science of the host country was
involved in hosting the lecture and other aspects of the visit.
Prof. Hopcroft's lecture was entitled "Computing, Communication and
the Information Age."  It was a two part talk: the first dealt with
research issues in computational geometry while the second
projected computer science topics that will arise in the 1990's.
The latter's central thesis was that the use of and interface to
the computer will become the key issues in computer science (rather
than the design of the hardware and system).
<P>

Federal Republic of Germany:  John's lecture was at GMD in Schloss
Birlinghoven, just outside of Bonn (see <a href="rosenblum.001.html">REALIZATION REPORT #1</a>).
Prof. Dennis Tsichritzis, who heads GMD, was John's student some
years ago and the lecture provided an opportunity for them to have
an enjoyable reunion.  The lecture was held in a small castle that
has been refurbished as a lecture hall; there was much artwork,
etc. -- a unique site for a presentation.  It was followed by a
choice of one of four simultaneous demonstrations for both us and
the lecture attendees.  The afternoon featured a round table
discussion on both technical and sociological issues in the future
of computer science.
<P>

Poland:  The visit was designed to overlap with the ONR-sponsored
International Workshop on Models for High-Performance Computing.
This workshop was arranged by Prof. Miroslaw Malek of the Univ. of
Texas (Austin), who also made the arrangements for both John's
lecture and a round table discussion.  We arrived on the second day
of the workshop; Dr. Nico Habermann of NSF had given an invited
talk on the opening day.  The workshop had a strong selection of
U.S. and Western European attendees as well as a good
representation of Polish computer scientists within the specialty.
The workshop closed at noon on the day after we arrived so that
John could give an afternoon lecture at the Staszica Palace to
workshop attendees and others.  The next day John gave a more
specialized lecture on electronic prototyping, followed by
discussions with colleagues from the University of Warsaw and the
Polish Academy of Sciences.  (Note:  After lecturing in a castle
and a palace, John's revised site criteria for his future invited
lectures may provide difficulties for organizers!).
<P>

Hungary:  The one-day visit began with John's morning lecture.
After lunch, John gave a lecture on electronic prototyping that
provided an in-depth discussion of research issues in computational
geometry.  Hungary has an active research community in related
areas and an animated discussion followed.  The day concluded with
a round table discussion with leading Hungarian researchers.
<P>

Russia:  This visit was the longest stopover of the lecture series.
<P>

In addition to John's lecture, several visits and round table
discussions were held.  Institutions visited included Moscow State
University and its Research Computing Center, the Keldysh Inst. of
Applied Mathematics of the RAS, the Computing Center of the RAS,
the Institute of Precision Mechanics and Computer Technology
(IPMCT) of the RAS, and the Dept. of Informatics, Computing
Technology, and Automation of the RAS.  In the course of these
visits we saw the Russian ELBRUS supercomputer and held discussions
with Prof. Babaian, its designer.  The ELBRUS series of
supercomputers uses modular pipelined processors (MKP).  Each MKP
processes a vector and a scalar instruction stream with peak
performance of 500 mflops achievable in each stream.  An unusual
visit was to a special High School for Information Sciences.
Several student demonstrations made it clear that the students are
programming (mostly in C, with some smalltalk, modula2, and lisp)
at a high level of proficiency.  We were impressed that the
projects involved using software packages at an advanced level as
well as programming.  Indeed, all of us judged the entire
scholastic program at this school impressive.
<P>

Ukraine:  Our final stop was a one day event in the Ukraine.  John
gave a morning lecture that was very well attended.  The question
and answer period lasted an hour and a half!  After lunch, the day
concluded with group discussions between us and our Ukrainian
colleagues.
<P>

<a NAME="[4.0]"><b>[4.0]</b></a>  This report is a brief summary of the lecture series.  I
anticipate subsequent publication of an in-depth article.  One
point that was mentioned in all Eastern European stopovers: lack of
hard currency is preventing East European scientists from certain
involvements that are required to be active at the frontiers of
science.  Especially mentioned were the lack of availability of
Western journals and the inability to attend conferences in the
West.  Those of you who receive extra copies of journals as guest
editors or authors may wish to consider forwarding some of these to
colleagues in Eastern European countries for distribution.
<P>

<a NAME="[5.0]"><b>[5.0]</b></a>  Acknowledgements:  The trip was highly successful with well-
attended lectures and much interchange between the U.S. delegation
and senior members of the host country.  Credit for this must be
given to those scientists in the host country who put forth so much
time and effort toward the planning:  Prof. Dennis Tsichritzis, Dr.
Gilbert Kalb, and Dr. Wolfgang Krueger in Germany; Prof. Piotr
Chrzastowski in Poland; Prof. Gabor Renner in Hungary; Prof.
Stanislav Klimenko, Prof. Victor Ivannikov, and Prof. Dmitrii
Koryagin in Russia; and Dr. Slava Knyazhnitsky in the Ukraine.
Special thanks go to Prof. Koryagin and Dr. Knyazhnitsky for the
assistance provided while in Russia and the Ukraine, respectively.

<a NAME="[1.0]"><b>[1.0]</b></a>  The Parallel CFD '93 Conference (CFD stands for
computational fluid dynamics) focuses on the entire range of CFD
parallel computation, from pre-processing and methods of solving
partial differential equations (PDE) though post-processing and
interdisciplinary applications.

<a NAME="[2.0]"><b>[2.0]</b></a>  The parallel CFD annual conference provides a platform that
enables applied mathematicians, computer scientists, engineers and
physicists to exchange their experience on parallel algorithms and
numerical methods for efficient flow simulation.  Topics of
interest include pre-processing techniques, cost-effective
solutions of linear and non-linear PDE modeling complex flows,
post-processing techniques, and multidisciplinary applications.
This year's conference was held in Paris on May 10-12 and was
organized by A. Ecer (Purdue Univ.), J. Periaux (Dassault-
Aviation), and P. Leca (ONERA) with the support of the GAMNI
association (Groupement pour l'Advancement des Methodes Numeriques
de l'Ingenieur) and the sponsorship of several organizations and
computer manufacturers.  The Parallel CFD '93 Conference had around
170 attendees with a strong participation from France, Germany, the
United Kingdom, and the United States.
<P>

<a NAME="[3.0]"><b>[3.0]</b></a>  A diversity of topics was covered by the conference and it
was interesting to notice the importance of PVM software (Parallel
Virtual Machine, a public domain software) as a means to start
experimenting with the message-passing programming model.  Also
noteworthy is the need for the development of domain decomposition
methods to guarantee an efficient implementation of implicit
schemes with unstructured meshes on massively parallel computers.
Further, the use of adaptive meshes on this kind of computer poses
challenging problems of data structure management and load
balancing.  The availability of shared memory would be of great
help.  Some of these problems are being studied within the
framework of APPARC (a consortium of universities and research
organizations that includes ONERA).
<P>

T. Iwamiya (NAL Chofu, Japan) gave a very interesting invited
presentation about the Numerical Wind Tunnel (NWT) Program.  The
talk described the large effort made by NAL to install a very
powerful (more than 200 Gflops peak) 140 processor parallel machine
which has just been designed in conjunction with Fujitsu.  The talk
"Heterogeneous Computational Aeroelasticity" given by Ch. Farhat
(Univ. of Colorado, Boulder) was also noteworthy.  Farhat indicates
that multidisciplinary applications -- the coupling of numerical
models -- is emerging as a new research theme.  The presentation of
P. Schiano (CIRA, Italy) about CIRA activity in parallel CFD also
contained many interesting insights.
<P>

A special session was devoted to the computer manufacturers (with
a panel session moderated by W. Jalby from Versailles Univ).
ARCHIPEL, CRAY Research, IBM, INTEL-SSD, KSR, and TELMAT were
represented.  One must remark that the fuzziness of what was said
about the HPF language seems to indicate that the future of this
language as an emerging standard is not so clear.  A final remark
is about the important participation of the delegates of the
industry:  ALV-List, Aerospatiale, Boeing, CEA, Dassault-Aviation,
DORNIER, EDF, GDF, MATRA, Simulog, and SNECMA all sent some of
their engineers indicating that the use of numerical simulations on
such advanced computers has become of great interest to these
companies.
<P>

Next year the Parallel CFD '94 conference will be organized in
Japan by Dr. Satofuka (Univ. of Kyoto).  This move to Japan instead
of the U.S. shows that advanced techniques for simulating complex
fluid flows attracts a growing community of researchers and
engineers around the world.

<P>

<a NAME="[2.0]"><b>[2.0]</b></a>  Founded by four persons who were key engineers in the U.K.
parallel processing industry, Division Ltd. of Bristol, U.K., has
become a leader in software and integrated solutions for vr
applications.  The chairman of the company, Dr. Iann Barron, was a
founder of INMOS Ltd. (producers of the Transputer parallel
processing chip); several members of the senior management also
come from INMOS.  Division believes that their May 1993 placing on
the London stock exchange is a first for a virtual reality company
world-wide.  The offering raised L. 5 million ($7.5 million).  The
infusion of funds is being used for both new R&D and to expand
their sales and marketing staff world-wide.
<P>

Division currently employs 24 people at their Bristol office with
an additional 7-person support office in Redwood City, CA for sales
and marketing in the U.S.  Distribution in Japan is being handled
by Matsushita Electric Industrial in Tokyo.  Division expects to
add an office in the Chapel Hill or Research Triangle area of North
Carolina and to expand to 40-50 persons by the end of 1993.  They
have recently sold their first U.S. system to Aberdeen Proving
Grounds.
<P>

<a NAME="[3.0]"><b>[3.0]</b></a>  Division offers both board products (for pc's) and
integrated system products.  At the board level, add-on accelerator
boards are offered to support vr on pc's.  These boards include a
stereo image generator and a real-time collision detection board.
We did not examine this product during our visit.
<P>

Division also offers several levels of workstations (called
ProVision and SuperVision) that are based on Intel 486
microprocessor architecture running UNIX.  These provide stereo
image generation with optional texturing, binaural audio synthesis,
and user tracking.  At the high end, video images from video
cameras and computer-generated images can be combined.  Division
states that ProVision can render up to 35K Phong or Gouraud shaded
polygons per second per eye (sustained performance) while
SuperVision can achieve rates of up to 280K polygons.
<P>

The primary thrust of Division, however, appears to be in software
development.  They are integrating their software packages to run
on high-end UNIX workstations (currently SGI and IBM RS/6000 with
SUN expected shortly).  Given the number of potential vr users who
already own workstations, this approach makes sense.  When we
visited, DIVISION was in the process of shipping an SGI system to
SIGGRAPH '93 for trade show demonstrations.
<P>

<a NAME="[4.0]"><b>[4.0]</b></a>  dVS is an operating environment that runs on top of certain
standard operating systems.  The approach of dVS is to create
specialized modules for different functions (which they denote as
"Actors").  For logical reasons only, they divide vr into 3
categories:  sensing of the real environment, control of the
virtual environment, and display of the virtual environment.  Each
category then has Actor modules.  For example, Real Environment
Sensing might include Actors for gesture recognition, 3D tracking,
and speech recognition; Virtual Environment Control might include
Actors for object behavior and collision detection; and Display
might contain Actors for visual, audio, and haptics.
<P>

To allow for multi-user systems with multiple servers, a shared
data space is created into which Actors may place shared objects
called "Elements".  Different Actors then model these Elements and
respond to global changes.  The fundamental objects in dVS is an
"Environment" or shared data space which can be accessed by a
number of Actors.  The Environment contains the Elements.
<P>

This structure offers users the advantage of being able to put
together a vr environment quite quickly -- a higher level
environment authoring language that sits on top of dVS is also
offered by Division.  Parallelization comes primarily from having
the Actors operate in parallel.  Thus, the software offers
advantages on "lightly" parallel systems (e.g., an 8 processor
SGI).  Peripherals currently supported include, among others, a
subset of those offered by Polhemus, Ascention, Logitec, VPL, Fake
Space Labs, Virtual Technologies, Spatial Systems, Crystal River
Engineering, and Division.
<P>

Division hopes to release improved versions of the dVS software and
ports to other workstations about every 6 months.  Anticipated
near-term software improvements are in networking, collision
detection, and the generation of high-level authoring tools for 3D
authoring of worlds while immersed.
<P>

<a NAME="[5.0]"><b>[5.0]</b></a>  I was accompanied on this visit by Ms. Bets Wald of ONR and
several others from a U.S. delegation to Great Britain that she was
chairing.  The first application discussed below was of particular
interest as some delegation members are contemplating a similar
application.
<P>

The following are sample applications developed by Division or by
other using Division software.  Several of these were demonstrated
to us.  The standard limitations in vr technology (low resolution,
high response time from sensors, etc.; see previous Realization
Reports on vr) were noted in these demonstrations.  However,
several applications are at a functional, rather than research,
stage.  Division does not deal with most of these largely sensor-
related problems; they will simply incorporate improved sensor
technology in their software suite.
<P>

Architecture:   VR is being used to design the operations room of
the frigate HMS Marlborough for the Defence Research Agency -
Maritime Division, Portsdown UK.  A computer-based model using
scaled measurements of the operations room was constructed using
AutoCAD.  Realistic lighting was included by passing the AutoCAD
models through a radiosity program.
<P>

Environmental Simulation:  Based on Division's PROVISION system,
the Living Environmental Systems Laboratory at Matsushita
Electronic Industrial Co. has developed a system for simulating
living environments in vr.  The goal is to provide building
designers with an accurate simulation of the air conditioning,
lighting, and acoustical characteristics of a room or building
under design.  The Thorn EMI Central Research Laboratories (U.K.)
and the London Parallel Applications Center have studied lighting
models to develop software for Thorn Lighting that will serve as an
interface to the design process.
<P>

Manufacturing Design:  A project has begun with the Computer-Aided
Industrial and Information Design researcher group at the Coventry
School of Art and Design.  The goal is to replace the building of
full scale models with a virtual representation.  This is the start
of an anticipated long term project to evaluate how vr can be used
to help the user interact with objects in their natural environment
and thus perform design evaluation, identifying features and flaws
that might otherwise be overlooked until much later in the design
process.
<P>

Molecular Modeling:  Work at the Glaxo Group Research of the
University of York is developing vr tools for molecular modeling.
The goal of the project is to allow the scientist to hold and
manipulate the molecular shape while receiving real-time feedback
about steric hinderance and other molecular interactions.
<P>

Training and Simulation:  TNO-FEL has used Division software to
develop vr simulations of stinger missile firings and of spacewalks
for training astronauts (see <a href="rosenblum.008.html">REALIZATION REPORT #8</a>).

New European Workshop on Virtual Environments
.............................. August 27, 1993

<strong>Contents:</strong><br>
<b>1.0  </b><a href="#[1.0]">  Background</a><br>
<b>2.0  </b><a href="#[2.0]">  Program for 1st Eurographics Workshop on Virtual Environments</a><br>
<P>


<a NAME="[1.0]"><b>[1.0]</b></a>  One of the goals of the ONR European Office is to initiate
new activities such as workshops on emerging scientific topics in
order that scientists world-wide can have the opportunity to meet,
discuss, evaluate, and simply get to know each other's work.  To
this end I initiated discussions with some colleagues who are on
the Eurographics Board about generating an activity in virtual
reality.  The result is the 1st Eurographics Workshop on Virtual
Environments, to be held the day prior to the Eurographics '93
annual conference in Barcelona.  The event is supported in part by
the ONR European Office and the U.S. Army Research Institute
European Coordination Office.
<P>

The Workshop Program is given below.  I will be attending the
workshop and will report on the results.  I have remaining, for a
DOD person, one free admission to the Workshop and/or the
Eurographics '93 Conference.

                        Barcelona, Spain
</PRE>

VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENTS are regarded as a significant step in Man
Machine Communication.  Following non-interactive, command driven,
and graphical-interaction systems, virtual environments now allow
easy-to-understand presentations and more intuitive interaction
with computer internal worlds.  Simulation, presentation and
interaction is required in realtime.  The integration of visual,
auditory and further stimuli are evidently needed in future man
machine interaction.
<P>

The first generation of peripherals and systems software for
building virtual environments like gloves, helmets and commercial
packages are widely available now.  The use of these tools in many
applications is now under evaluation.
<P>

Current research in this area is established at various levels of
immersion and interaction - from desktop virtual reality to fully
immersive systems.  Research activities aim to overcome the
limitations and to improve the acceptance of the techniques.  New
paradigms in future computer supported communication are already
under development.
<P>

Applications, now, are undertaking the first steps by adapting
system prototypes to virtual environments.  The accuracy,
usability, and effectiveness of this new technology is
investigated.
<P>

The particular goal of this event is to identify the key research
work and to stimulate application areas to use Virtual Environment
techniques.

<P>


<a NAME="[1.0]"><b>[1.0]</b></a> This Symposium covers recent work in the area of parallel
numerical analysis.  Speakers, drawn from industry and academia,
covered both algorithmic advances and applications of parallel
methods.  Algorithmic topics included matrix computations and
nonlinear optimization while applications included auto crash,
microelectronics, and oil reservoir simulation.

<a NAME="[2.0]"><b>[2.0]</b></a> The Symposium on Parallel Numerical Mathematics, sponsored by
The Centre for Novel Computing, University of Manchester was held
on Sept. 9-10, 1993.  Located at the Manchester Centre for
Computational Mathematics (U.K.), the Symposium brought together
people interested in parallel computing with a nice balance across
different areas of scientific computing and perspectives from both
theory and practical experience.
<P>

The Department of Pure and Applied Mathematics has an active group
of staff with specialist interests in numerical analysis, who are
responsible for teaching the subject at the undergraduate and
postgraduate level and undertaking and directing research in this
area.  In the recent U.F.C. review of research in British
Universities the Department's record in this area was given a high
rating.  The present head of the numerical analysis group is
Professor C.T.H.Baker.
<P>

<a NAME="[3.0]"><b>[3.0]</b></a> A spectrum of parallel architectures were represented in
talks at the symposium:  virtual shared memory (e.g. KSR),
networked workstations, and massively parallel SIMD.  In a pleasing
push toward portability, some of the speakers were even able to
demonstrate good performance on all these architectures.
<P>

Higham made the point that on the KSR machine, only the GEMM matrix
multiply primitive has been highly optimized and he showed how to
get a fast polar decomposition from this.  Kagstrom, building on
the same observation, has built a full collection of matrix-vector
primitives based on GEMM and showed instances in which the package
outperforms even the vendors' tuned libraries on the Cray and the
IBM RS/6000. The GEMM-based BLAS will appear in
<netlib@research.att.com>.  Kagstrom also brought a laptop to
demonstrate CONLAB, implementing the popular MATLAB operations and
augmented by a simulator, compiler, and visualization tools for
parallel computing primitives.  Contact <bokg@cs.umu.se>.
<P>

Sorensen described the implicitly restarted Arnoldi method for
getting a few eigenvalues of huge matrices.  He showed important
applications in computational fluid dynamics, structural analysis,
chemistry, and biology.  To get a copy of the ARPACK code, contact
<sorensen@rice.edu>.
<P>

Bjorstad and Grosse showed good speedups on model problems from oil
reservoir simulation and VLSI device simulation, using the additive
(for MPP) or multiplicative (for networked workstations) form of
the overlapping Schwarz method of domain decomposition.
<P>

Other speakers were:  Filippone (distributed memory architectures),
Gladwell (ordinary differential equation boundary value problems),
Lonsdale (crash-simulation), McKinnon (dynamic programming),
Torczon (pattern search).
<P>

Parsys introduces 25 gigaflop parallel computer
.......................... Sept. 22, 1993
<P>

Parsys, a small British firm, is a spin-off from Thorn EMI which
holds a 16% share of the company.  Parsys began within Thorn EMI,
but spun off as an independent company with L 600,000 ($ 930,000)
of venture capital after Thorn exited the parallel processing
business by selling off INMOS, maker of the Transputer chip.  The
Parsys computers are Transputer-based.
<P>

The Parsys SN9400, the first of a planned range of 9000-series
parallel computers, is being introduced this week at the World
Transputer Congress in Aachen, Germany.  Capable of 25 gigaflops,
the machine will sell for L 4 million ($ 6.2 million).  The machine
is based on the 3.3 million transistor INMOS T9000 Transputer chip,
released this March after a prolonged delay.  The current T9000 is
slower than the INTEL Pentium chip, but claims advantages in the
communications link between processor and memory segments so that
data can be moved more rapidly.

The report given below is reprinted with permission of the U.K.'s
Dept. of Trade and Industry.  It presents an excellent overview
of the structure of ITC programs within the European Community
(EC) and how these programs are viewed by a member nation.  The
report will be of value to those wanting an overview or even
needing a reference to the occasional acronym appearing elsewhere
for a European ITC program.
<P>

Portions of the current program for ESPRIT III, the major
Community IT program, have been described in detail in
<a href="rosenblum.001.html">REALIZATION REPORT #1</a>, <a href="rosenblum.001.html">REALIZATION REPORT #1</a>, and <a href="rosenblum.001.html">REALIZATION REPORT #1</a> 
and observations about ESPRIT
and its structure can be found in those reports.
<P>

A few comments and conclusions (from the report and from my
discussions with European program managers):
<P>

<PRE>
 -- ITC is expected to become the largest single economic
      sector within the EC, totaling 10% by the year 2000.
</PRE>

<PRE>
 -- Future programs will be more focused and more  downstream
      (i.e. toward end-user products).
</PRE>

<PRE>
 -- Some tensions remain between the roles of EC programs
      and those of individual countries.
</PRE>

<PRE>
 -- EC project funding will continue at up to the 50% level,
      with the industrial partners expected to contribute the
      remainder.
</PRE>

<PRE>
 -- The previous item may be a contributing factor to
      concerns about how well the programs are serving
      smaller potential industrial partners.
</PRE>

<PRE>
 -- Funding requires consortiums with members from at least
      two countries; competitive benefits are given to those
      with member(s) from the poorer EC countries.
</PRE>

<PRE>
 -- Projects with a large number of potential partners will
      experience increased scrutiny in the review process.
</PRE>

<PRE>
 -- The lack of mobility for researchers between countries
      (language, pensions, benefits, etc.) remains a concern.
</PRE>

<PRE>
 -- Virtual reality is expected to be a component in the
      Fourth EC Framework (starting in 1995) within ESPRIT,
      RACE, and the telematics programs.

                R&D IN EUROPE: THE GENERAL SCENE
</PRE>

Information and communications technologies are only one part,
albeit the largest part, of Europe's collaborative research and
development effort.  This effort is focused through a variety of
complementary programmes and mechanisms to achieve various common
objectives.  Most programmes are conducted under the auspices of
the European Community, though some schemes have a wider
participation.  This introductory article aims to sketch the main
strands of collaborative European R&D in general, with later
articles focusing on aspects of the information and
communications technologies.
<P>

The European Community took the first step towards the
coordination of research in a broad structure in 1984, with the
first Framework Programme covering the years 1984 to 1987.  The
second Framework Programme (1987-91) marked the adoption of a
comprehensive political strategy on technology, as part of the
Single European Act.  The aim of this policy is to strengthen the
international competitiveness of European industry in
high-technology sectors in the face of competition - above all
from the U.S. and Japan - in global markets.  The third Framework
Programme (1990-94) is under way and plans for the fourth are
being discussed.
<P>

Europe cannot afford, nor is it necessary, to tackle every area
which offers future potential.  The aim is to concentrate on
projects that can be conducted more rationally, more
cost-effectively and more efficiently at European level, and
which promise real added value as a result of cross-border
cooperation.  The success of the European projects depends to a
large extent on their innovative value, and the success of the
single internal market will depend to a large extent on the
application of this innovation.
<P>

The current Framework Programme covers research in six areas,
grouped into three categories:
<P>

<PRE>
     (1) Enabling technologies:
          Information and communications technologies
          Industrial and materials technologies
     (2) Management of natural resources:
          Environment
          Life sciences and technologies
          Energy
     (3) Management of intellectual resources:
         Human capital and mobility.
</PRE>

The focus of the collaborative industrial projects in the
Framework programme is precompetitive research, and their funding
is on a shared-cost basis, with the Community providing up to 50%
of the cost.  Shared-cost actions involve contracts with industry
and universities; other funding mechanisms for Community R&D
include "direct action", as for the EC Joint Research Centre;
"concerted action", involving the coordination of national
efforts; and "cooperative research action", where the Community
contributes to the cost of collaborative projects for small
firms.
<P>

Other European initiatives include several whose memberships
extend beyond the member-nations of the EC.  Examples include
EUREKA, a series of industry-led collaborative development
projects for new products or services (with public funding at the
discretion of national governments); COST (Cooperation on Science
and Technology), a concerted-action programme of collaborative
projects across a broad range of technologies; the European Space
Agency; and the European Science Foundation, a non-governmental
agency whose members are national scientific societies and
research councils.
<P>

It is the intention of the Commission and the EUREKA Secretariat
to seek enhanced synergy between these two complementary
mechanisms.  However, the management and funding structures are
quite different and should not be confused.
<P>

IT AND COMMUNICATIONS:  ESPRIT AND ELSEWHERE
<P>

Within the "enabling technologies" part of the, EC's
Framework-III Programme, the Information and Communications
Technologies (ICT) effort is focused on three specific
initiatives.  These are the European Strategic Programme for
Research and development in Information Technology (ESPRIT);
Research and development in Advanced Communications technologies
in Europe (RACE); and the Telematics Programme.  This article
outlines their history and current status, beginning with points
from a recent report commissioned by the European Commission from
an independent review board chaired by Dr. Wisse Dekker, chairman
of Phillips Electronics.  The "Dekker Report" undertook rigorous
evaluation of some significant elements of the second Framework
Programme.
<P>

A competitive arena:
<P>

The Dekker review board declared in its report that extensive use
of information and communication technologies coming from an
indigenous industrial base will be highly significant in assuring
future prosperity within the EC.  European ICT output now
represents about 5% of EC gross domestic product, and on only
modest growth estimates it will reach 10% ~ and will represent
the largest single economic sector by the year 2000.  Virtually
all the working population is affected by the products of these
industries, and a similar proportion of other services and
industrial sectors depend on ICT for their efficiency and
competitiveness.
<P>

The Community's ICT industries are facing unprecedented
pressures.  Margins are being eroded as markets are opened to
full competition, high levels of investment are needed to develop
and manufacture the next generation of products, faster response
times are essential to remain competitive in the marketplace,
with related pressures on quality, delivery and price.
<P>

Despite all this, the review board believed that Europe's
industry was capable not only of surviving, but also of thriving
in this highly competitive arena.  Industrial horizons must be
set on international markets, and companies must be strong enough
to play a major part in global alliances as they develop.
<P>

<PRE>
 From its assessment of the ICT industrial scene and the
</PRE>
positioning of industrial scene and the positioning of European
industry, Dekker concluded that industry rooted in Europe must be
supported and encouraged through Community actions in order to
sustain high-quality employment and raise the level of ICT
services to enhance European competition.  Dekker considered in
turn ESPRIT, RACE and DRIVE activities in Framework 11.
<P>

ESPRIT
<P>

For the IT community, ESPRIT is the best-known of all the
European R&D initiatives.  Launched in 1984, virtually in
parallel with Britain's Alvey Programme of advanced IT research,
ESPRIT I was the result of action by the Commission in response
to a call by the so-called "Round Table" of 12 leading European
IT companies.  The aims of the programme were to underpin the
technology base of the IT industry, foster collaboration, and
assist in the standards arena.  ESPRIT I (1984-88) was followed
by ESPRIT II (1988-92) and the current programme, ESPRIT III,
launched in 1991.
<P>

As with all the EC ICT programmes, the essence of ESPRIT is
collaboration across national boundaries.  The programme is open
to companies, academic institutions and research bodies; projects
must as a rule involve organisations from at least two
member-states; and the basic level of Community support is 50% of
project costs.  The current ESPRIT III covers six technical
areas:
<P>

1.  Microelectronics.  Here the aim is to strengthen the
Community's capability in the design and manufacture of
leading-edge integrated circuits and to ensure their ready
availability in Europe.  This is seen as complementary to the
Joint European Submicron Silicon Initiative (JESSI), a EUREKA
project.  The emphasis is on application-specific integrated
circuits (ASICS) because of their wide applicability.
<P>

2.  Information processing systems and software.  Objectives are
to apply software-intensive systems design and engineering to
user needs; develop information servers and their interfaces
appropriate to user tasks and level of expertise; and develop
advanced architectures and their applications.  High-performance
computing and networking now constitutes a separate area in its
own right.
<P>

3.  Advanced home and business systems and peripherals.  Work in
this area aims to develop user-friendly support or cooperative
working; promote the development and use of multimedia systems;
develop loosely coupled distributed systems; and promote the
introduction of the "intelligent home".
<P>

4. Computer integrated manufacturing and engineering.  This area
covers the whole range of CIM activities including architectures
and communications, the design of manufacturing systems and
products, management and control, and robotics and shop-floor
systems.
<P>

5.  Basic research actions.  Intended for academic and other
research organisations rather than for industry, these research
actions aim to improve the potential for future advances in
information technologies, reinforce interdisciplinary links and
ensure the environment for training tomorrow's researchers
through research itself.
<P>

6.  Open microprocessor initiative.  This horizontal initiative
will interact with and build on the results of all the
technological areas, and on standards and other developments
worldwide.  The goal is to extend the concept of open systems and
standards to the microprocessor systems environment.
<P>

According to the Dekker review board, ESPRIT II's achievements
are impressive.  The programme has had a major impact on European
cooperation between companies, between industry and academia, and
between organisations in different countries.  ESPRIT has been
responsible for a cultural change in the ITC community in Europe,
whereby a whole generation of scientists and engineers are now
thinking on a European, rather than national, level.
<P>

Since the beginning, ESPRIT has involved over 1,500 participants
in over 600 projects, and good techno-logical results have been
achieved.  But in the view of the review board - while accepting
that projects were precompetitive and not directed towards
product development - the industrial "yield" has been
disappointing and there had been little focus on standards,
particularly in the microelectronics area.  Also, many of the
positive results are not in core business areas or in
significantly large market sectors.
<P>

After a comprehensive assessment of the various elements of the
organisation and performance of ESPRIT, Dekker concluded by
arguing as follows: The programme should not continue in its
present form.  ESPRIT's industry-led, technology-push approach is
capable of producing good results but is not achieving the lift
in European competitiveness that is now called for.
<P>

The scope of ESPRIT has been so broad, and the objectives built
into the programme so numerous, that its sense of strategic
direction has been dissipated.  To clarify the focus and reduce
administrative overheads, a set of smaller, interrelated
programmes, each with just a few key objectives is now needed.
User needs should receive greater emphasis.
<P>

RACE
<P>

The aim of RACE is to establish a strong European manufacturing
industry in broadband communications, and to accelerate the
emergence of a competitive Community market for
telecommunications equipment and services, while working towards
uniform standards throughout Europe.
<P>

In its first phase, the programme developed Integrated Broadband
Communications (IBC) demonstration equipment and standards, and
created a technological base for advanced IBC equipment and
services.  The second phase, part of Framework III, is focusing
on eight priority areas:
<P>

<PRE>
      IBC research and development;
      Intelligence in networks; flexible communications
        resource management;
      Mobile and personal communications;
      Image and data communications;
      Integrated services technologies;
      Information security technologies;
      Advanced communications experiments;
      Test infrastructures and interworking (a horizontal
        R&D area supporting the other seven areas).
</PRE>

RACE projects involve collaboration between industry, academic
institutions and telecommunications operators.  Up to 50% of
project costs may come from Community funds.
<P>

In the report, Dekker noted that RACE had a positive impact in
encouraging European public network operators to work together to
map out the way in which advanced telecommunications networks
should develop; and had succeeded in accelerating the
standardisation process.  Also, a number of exploitable results
had emerged as spin-offs along the way.
<P>

Dekker noted an important difference in the impact of RACE
between the two main market areas with intelecommunications-
switching and transmission equipment for the public network
operators; and customer equipment.  RACE had concentrated on the
former sector where, after a period of consolidation European
companies were strong both in markets and technology.  Europe was
much weaker in customer equipment, though new opportunities would
open up in areas such as new mobile communications products and
video telephones.
<P>

Since RACE had successfully completed its consensus - building
and network specification tasks, Dekker suggested that the
programme should not be continued in its present form.  This was
not to say that telecommunications research should not continue
to be supported; opportunities to capitalise on the strong
technological position of the European telecommunications
industry should emerge within the demand-side focused themes,
which the board proposed should be identified for a successor
programme.
<P>

DRIVE
<P>

The DRIVE programme differed from ESPRIT and RACE in having a
very low budget, but its objectives were clear, demand-side and
pan-European.
<P>

A number of DRIVE projects pursued long-term and highly ambitious
goals, such as vehicle and curbside communications systems to
ensure a safe convoy driving with minimal driver attention.
Other projects would have an impact in the shorter term, based
more on systems integration than on additional research effort.
A continuation of this dual approach, preferably in two separate
future programmes, would help to raise Europe's competitiveness,
Dekker suggested.
<P>

Another beneficial feature of DRIVE projects, noted by Dekker, in
comparison with ESPRIT and RACE (which were dominated by
industrial and academic participation) was the involvement of
service providers and city and regional authorities.  National
purchasing authorities had begun to work with potential suppliers
from other countries, so making a positive contribution towards a
single market in procurement.
<P>

The Telematics Programme
<P>

Projects in this Framework Ill programme are designed to
stimulate the development of a trans-European electronic
information exchange infrastructure.  Though sharing basic
characteristics with other Community programmes - international,
precompetitive, industry-led, eligible for 50% from Community
funds - the Telematics programme differs from them in two
important respects: the projects are based on existing
technologies, wherever possible, and in Framework II are
concentrating on the needs of users in seven specific sectors
throughout the Community.  The sectors are:
<P>

1.  Trans-European networks between public administrations: To
facilitate inter-operability of networks and systems between
member states, in order to help implement the "four freedoms of
movement" - goods, persons, services and capital - arising from
the completion of the Single Market.
<P>

2.  Transport services: Building on the former DRIVE - Dedicated
Road Infrastructure for VEhicle safety - Framework II programme
discussed above and relevant EUREKA projects, to improve the
safety and efficiency of passenger and goods transport services,
to reduce the impact of transport on the environment.
<P>

3.  Health care: Building on the former AIM - Advanced
Informatics in Medicine - programme, to develop tools, techniques
and practices supporting a common European approach to
health-care, informatics, and telecommunications.
<P>

4.  Flexible and distance learning: Building on the former DELTA
- Developing European Learning through Technological Advance -
programme, to pursue implementation strategies, technology and
system development, and pilot testing and validation.
<P>

5.  The libraries programme: Among other goals, to promote the
availability and accessibility of modern library services
throughout the Community; introduce new information technologies
into libraries cost-effectively; and encourage standardisation.
<P>

6.  Linguistic research and engineering: To develop a basic
linguistic technology for computer applications, where natural
language is an essential ingredient, in order to help overcome
language problems within the Community.
<P>

7.  Telematic systems for rural areas: Among other goals, to
create the conditions for geographically dispersed small
businesses to provide more diverse employment opportunities and a
more balanced economic activity in rural areas; and establish a
basis for improved services to dispersed and isolated
populations.
<P>

<PRE>
     NATIONAL VERSUS EUROPEAN: THE QUESTION OF SUBSIDIARITY
</PRE>

The vexed question of subsidiarity within the European Community,
debated at length in Britain's consideration of the Maastricht
Treaty, is highly relevant in the context of collaborative
research and development.  Which activities are better conducted
nationally, and which ones demand a European dimension?  And,
looking ahead, what are the implications of cooperation on a
global scale, as research and development patterns increasingly
reflect global industrial trends?
<P>

Community actions in research, technological development and
demonstration must respect the principle of subsidiarity, the
European Commission declares in its working papers for Framework
IV, "whereby the Community takes action in accordance with the
thematic content of this framework programme only if and insofar
as the objectives of the action cannot be sufficiently achieved
by member-states and can, therefore, by reason of scale or
effects be better achieved by the Community".
<P>

Large projects, for example, may be too expensive to be mounted
nationally and, if they can strengthen the technology base of
Community industry, then it may be desirable to mount them on a
European basis, despite the higher total costs inherent in
collaboration.  But size is not the only criterion.
<P>

In essence, the main benefits of joint European programmes and
projects are that: costs are pooled; risks are shared;
potentially profitable cross-frontier collaborative links are
forged; access is provided to new ideas; and influence can be
exerted over emerging standards and specifications.  However, the
total mass of European S&T can only be mobilised effectively if
the European programmes remain transparent and open.
<P>

There are also drawbacks: international joint projects usually
take longer and cost more than national ones, and make great
demands on management time, they restrict flexibility; they raise
questions of intellectual property rights; and they can suffer
from participants objectives.  On the other hand, success in
jointly overcoming the problems of today's projects will ease the
solution of tomorrow's.
<P>

All collaborative projects make sense only if each of the
participants has some special expertise or other resource to
contribute to the venture.  This sometimes results when an
organisation obtains specific expertise in a national programme.
<P>

National collaborative projects and programmes can share many of
the benefits listed above for international collaboration.  They
are appropriate in the many cases where the nature, scale and
scope of the project do not require action at the international
level.  Planning and execution of U.K. National IT programmes
takes full account of European programmes.  Britain aims to avoid
duplication of effort, but complementarily and synergy go further
than this.
<P>

National programmes are important in teaching companies how to
collaborate, in building national technological strengths and in
overcoming particular market failures.  U.K. programmes also aim
to plug gaps, so that specifically U.K. priorities are covered.
National technology-transfer activities also have a role in
promoting the uptake of European-developed technology within the
U.K.  National academic research projects provide credibility for
groups to launch into European ventures, while enhancing the U.K.
training environment in key areas of science.
<P>

The perceived interactions between European and U.K. national
research objectives and actions will help shape the British
Government's forthcoming White Paper on U.K. science and
technology.  Thus, there are changes afoot both nationally and in
Europe this year, as Britain's science policy is redefined and
Europe's next Framework programme moves towards final definition
and approval.
<P>

Historically, there are clear parallels in broad aims between the
U.K. Alvey Programme and the Community's ESPRIT in the early
1980's.  Together, the two programmes built up a collaborative
research culture which is now the norm.  Both programmes featured
joint projects between industry and academia but, initially, only
the British programme included academic - only basic research
projects - adopted by the European programme in ESPRIT II.  In
the academic projects as in the industrial ones, there must be
real complementarity between the partners; projects must be
conceived as European proposals for sound reasons.
<P>

In both European and national collaborative projects, industrial
representation has been strong from the larger companies, who
have been quick to recognise the benefits.  For small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), however, the overheads of
collaboration have proved a formidable deterrent especially where
those overheads extend to European collaboration - though these
companies can be well-placed to carry research through to
exploitation.
<P>

Both the Commission and national governments are making a
determined effort at present to improve the extent and quality of
coordination between national and European programmes, not only
in research, but in technology transfer also.  In recent years,
ESPRIT activities have been a key input in the selection of areas
to be addressed in national programme!  In other words, to try to
adjust the national activities, to achieve complementarity with
the European programmes.  Now the expectation is that national
activities will themselves influence the European programmes.
<P>

Participation in national R&D programmes can prepare companies
for collaborating in European programmes and projects, one result
of which is to gain access to new technology arising from the
larger-scale activity.  The same principle is now beginning to be
applied between Europe and the rest of the world, with Europe
similarly gaining access to new technology arising from global
cooperation in research.
<P>

TOWARDS FRAMEWORK IV.
THE IMPACT OF MAASTRICHT
<P>

As a result of the Treaty on European Union (the Maastricht
Treaty), the fourth Framework Programme will be much broader in
scope than its predecessors.  As well as continuing the R&D
patterns established in the earlier programmes, the new framework
will extend to encompass also all R&D carried out in support of
the Community's major common policies-such as agriculture,
fisheries, energy and transport.  Limits for the total annual
expenditures on Community research and development for the years
1993-1999 have been agreed, but the pattern of this spending
within the fourth Framework Programme has yet to be decided.
<P>

The European Commission has initially identified three
fundamental objectives for Framework IV. to support industrial
competitiveness; contribute to satisfying society's needs; and
support the various common policies of the Community.  "An
appropriate combination of continuity and novelty" in addressing
these aims is suggested.
<P>

The Framework Programme is likely to embrace four types of
activity - (1) cooperative research, technological development
and demonstration programmes within the Community; (2) a
broadening of cooperation on such programmes with outside nations
and international organisations; (3) dissemination of results and
technology transfer from the Community programmes; and (4)
stimulation of the training and mobility of researchers in the
Community.
<P>

The Commission's initial proposal is that the first of the above
four main activities should address 35 core themes, grouped in
five broad areas: (1) information and communication technologies;
(2) industrial technologies; (3) environment; (4) life sciences
and technologies; and (5) energy.
<P>

In the area of information and communication technologies, the
core themes are likely to include key elements for IT systems,
software engineering and best practice, high-performance
computing and networking image technologies, electronic networks
and linguistics, ICT support for function integration in
manufacturing, advanced communications, information exchange
between administrations, and technologies for integrated and
optimised transport systems.
<P>

Actions in these research areas would be complemented by
initiatives in the other three proposed activities:
<P>

<PRE>
       R&D cooperation would be strengthened with industrialised
     nations outside the Community; with central and eastern
     European countries; with developing countries and with other
     European bodies and schemes; and thought the existing COST
     (European Cooperation in Science and Technology) mechanism.
</PRE>

<PRE>
       Beneficial application of R&D results would be encouraged
     by improving the flow of information between research and
     industry; between research and the scientific community;
     between research and society; by technology transfer leading
     to the integration of technologies by industry; and by
     special incentives for small and medium-size enterprises.
</PRE>

<PRE>
       Training and mobility of researchers in the Community
     would be stimulated by easing post-doctorate mobility
     between countries; developing Community networks for
     cooperation; increasing cooperation between industry and
     academia; and providing incentives for developing new
     skills.
</PRE>

In new guidelines for Framework IV, put forward recently by
Antonio Ruberti, the Commissioner responsible for research policy
and education, a key element is the shift in emphasis away from a
set of programmes and activities, and towards the framing of a
Community research policy.  Since the Community's own research
effort represents less than 4% of total government research
funding in the 12 member-states.  Professor Ruberti foresees
greater integration between national and European activity,
including closer coordination between laboratories and some
networking mechanism for technology assessment.  Limited
financial and human resources imply also a greater selectivity in
research, according to Professor Ruberti, including a greater
concentration on generic technologies which have a wide
industrial impact.
<P>

These are the general principles within which the future
programmes and projects in the information and communication
technologies are expected to be mounted.  The Framework IV
Programme is seen as one of the first implementations to follow
the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty, and processing of the
Commission's proposals by the European Parliament and Research
Council is expected to take about six months.  It had been hoped
that ratification in June 1993 would lead to the implementation
of Framework IV by the end of the year, but delays in the
ratification process could affect this timescale.

<a href="#[2.0]" NAME="[1.0]"><b>[1.0]</b></a>  The First Eurographics Workshop on Virtual Environments was
held on Sept. 7th in Barcelona, Spain as part of the Eurographics
annual conference.  The workshop resulted from discussions between
Eurographics and the ONR European Office and was designed to
provide a venue for European and U.S. researchers to discuss
current activity.

<a href="#[3.0]" NAME="[2.0]"><b>[2.0]</b></a>  One goal of the ONR European Office is to initiate new
activities such as workshops on emerging scientific topics in order
that scientists world-wide can have the opportunity to meet,
discuss, evaluate, and simply get to know each other's work.
Discussions between myself and European and U.S. colleagues
indicated that virtual reality was a good topic for a new European
activity.  Accordingly, I engaged in discussions with colleagues on
the Eurographics Board of Directors about generating a Workshop.
The result was the 1st Eurographics Workshop on Virtual
Environments, held on Sept. 7, 1993 as one of four Eurographics
workshops that preceded the Eurographics '93 annual conference in
Barcelona.  The Workshop was supported in part by the ONR European
Office and the U.S. Army Research Institute European Coordination
Office.  The fine organizational job performed by the Workshop
Chairman, Dr. Martin Goebel of FhG-IGD, and the Local Arrangements
Chairwoman, Prof. Danielle Tost of the Polytechnical University of
Catalonia, contributed greatly to the Workshop's success.
<P>

<a href="#[4.0]" NAME="[3.0]"><b>[3.0]</b></a>  VR software toolkits are now being designed to assist in
developing a VR environment.  One European commercial system, dVS
by Division Ltd., was described in <a href="rosenblum.002.html">REALIZATION REPORT #2</a>.  The
paper "Virtual Design - A Generic Virtual Reality System" by P.
Astheimer, W. Felger, and S. Mueller of the Fraunhofer Institute
for Computer Graphics (IGD) in Darmstadt, Germany describes another
approach.  The toolkit has been designed and applied primarily for
applications such as architecture, interior design, and historical
reconstruction that creates photorealistic scenes.  A radiosity
system precalculates the color value of polygon patches and an
integrated ray tracer is also used.  The IGD toolkit is based on a
central data storage scheme with both runtime modules (such as a
collision detector) and configuration-time modules (such as the
radiosity calculator) using the central data storage.  Objects are
grouped into sets for modeling.  For rendering they are transformed
into a flat and referenceless but fast, interpretable cache
structure.  Libraries are provided for graphics, acoustics,
simulation, display, navigation, and interaction.
<P>

"Design Issues for Virtual Reality Systems" by Roger Hubbold, Alan
Murta, Adrian West, and Toby Howard of the University of
Manchester, England, presented a discussion of central issues to
the design of a software VR architecture.  Key issues are the
support of diverse and complex applications, the demand for high-
quality interaction with its associated time management problems,
and the need for maintaining a continuity of the experience.  The
paper discussed some of the numerous and complex trade-offs which
must be made in a VR software system design.  The Univ. of
Manchester's system, AVIARY, provides a hierarchical and extensible
model where processes are linked by a communications system.
AVIARY interprets and controls the virtual world using processes
that fall into the categories of human input, output to the user,
virtual environment managers, and virtual environment servers.  A
main goal is to provide platform independent parallel and
distributed processing.
<P>

<a href="#[5.0]" NAME="[4.0]"><b>[4.0]</b></a>  "The Virtual Treadmill: A Naturalistic Metaphor for
Navigation in Immersive Virtual Environments" by M. Slater, A.
Steed, and M. Usoh of the University of London, England, gave
results from an experiment to judge people's reactions to traveling
in an immersive environment by "walking on the spot".  A tracking
sensor on a head-mounted display provides positional data of head
motions while the participant performs a variety of actions,
including walking in place.  A pattern recognizer learns to
recognize the participants walking motions.  Movement in the
virtual environment is then achieved by simulating the kinds of
kinesthetic actions and sensory perceptions involved in walking.
This method was compared to the alternative of using a hand-held
pointing device.  Preliminary results, based on a small sample
size, suggest that the walking on the spot method may enhance the
participants sense of presence, but there is not yet sufficient
evidence to suggest that it is advantageous with respect to the
efficiency of navigation.  Some subjects did become tired; this is
an obvious limitation of requiring human motion.  Further
experiments are planned.
<P>

<a href="#[6.0]" NAME="[5.0]"><b>[5.0]</b></a>  There were several U.S. papers, including an invited talk by
Steve Bryson of NASA/Ames on "Why Application Development is So
Hard - Virtual Reality as a Research Field," and a panel discussion
was held that included both U.S. and European experts.  Both Bryson
and the panel noted how few actual applications yet exist, although
good prototypes are certainly becoming more commonplace.
<P>

There are tentative plans to expand the Workshop into a two day
event at Eurographics 94 in Oslo and then make VR a significant
part of the Eurographics 95 conference in The Netherlands.  The
European Commission may also provide funding for the 94 event.  In
any event, Workshop participants expressed the view that the event
was valuable and merited continuation in an expanded format.
<P>

The Workshop proceedings were published as EG93 VR - Eurographics
Technical Report Series ISSN 1017-4656.  Expansion of the papers
into a book was anticipated by the Workshop chairman.

<a href="#[2.0]" NAME="[1.0]"><b>[1.0]</b></a>  Abstract:  This report, taken primarily from selected
publications of the U.K.'s Department of Trade and Industry (DTI),
examines several IT projects of interest.
<P>

<a href="#[3.0]" NAME="[2.0]"><b>[2.0]</b></a> NEURAL NETWORKS ASSIST IN UNDERSTANDING SLEEP DISORDERS
<P>

The Department of Engineering Science of the University of Oxford
is collaborating with the Oxford Medical Division of Oxford
Instruments in a project to develop an automated system for the
analysis of sleep disorders.  The evaluation of sleep disorders is
one of the fastest growing sectors of US and European healthcare.
It relies principally on the continuous analysis of the
electroencephalogram (EEG) during sleep.  At present, a set of
rules proposed more than 20 years ago is still being used by human
experts to classify successive 30 second segments of the EEG sleep
record into one of six categories (wake, dreaming sleep, and four
stages of progressively deeper sleep), but the rules are
notoriously difficult to apply and inter-observer correlation is
often very low.  The lack of agreement among trained human experts
on all but very typical data segments has made the automation of
the 'sleep scoring' process an almost impossible task.
Consequently, there is no expert system available for the analysis
of the sleep EEG.
<P>

It as been suggested that neural networks might offer a promising
alternative for problems such as these, where the extraction and
application of rules are tasks that cannot be performed very
reliably.  Over the last 4 years a sleep-analysis system was
developed.  It is based on a radial-basis function (RBF) neural
network architecture that combines both unsupervised and supervised
learning.  Starting with no a priori assumptions about the number
of states which may exist within the EEG during sleep, a clustering
analysis using a Kohonen feature map was performed on a database
consisting of EEG signals parameterized on a 1 second time scale
using a 10-coefficient Kalman filter.  The topology preservation
properties of the Kohonen algorithm made it possible for the
trajectories generated by successive frames of coefficients to be
tracked over time.  Three distinctive types of trajectories in the
sleep EEG were identified and a description of the sleep process
was obtained at the output of the RBF network, which claims to be
more precise than the arbitrary six-state classification of the
rule-based system.
<P>

The neural network analysis system has now been used to analyze not
only whole-night recordings from normal subjects but also the EEG
of patients with severe sleep disorders whose records had
previously been deemed to be unscorable.  The University of Oxford
has been working with Oxford Medical to transfer the neural network
technology and first prototypes should be available in early 1994
for evaluation in a number of clinical centers.

<a href="#[4.0]" NAME="[3.0]"><b>[3.0]</b></a> SYSTEM FOR RAPID PROTOTYPING AND MONITORING OF RACING CARS
WINS BRITISH COMPUTER SOCIETY (BCS) IT AWARD
<P>

A computerized system for monitoring the performance of the McLaren
Formula One racing car is one of the winners of this year's BCS
Information Technology Awards.  The success of the McLaren racing
team is dependent upon its back-up team, and in McLaren's case the
back-up team's success is dependent on its wholly integrated
approach to engineering, using computers at the design and
manufacturing stages.  The system also monitors the car during the
race and allows the data to feed back into the design process.
<P>

Other winners this year were ICL for DAIS, which provides
technology that allows the development and integration of business
applications across a variety of hardware and software platforms.
It provides tools that allow users both to protect their existing
investment in database technology and to utilize modern, client-
server technology.
<P>

Thames Water Utilities were the third winner, for the trunk
scheduling system for the London Water Ring Main.  PC-based
scheduling for optimization of pump usage led to an ability to
incorporate a high degree of automation within the repetitive
scheduling task.
<P>

<a href="#[5.0]" NAME="[4.0]"><b>[4.0]</b></a>  CUTTING PILOT ERROR IN COMMERCIAL AVIATION
<P>

Since the 1960s, commercial aviation has witnessed a substantial
reduction in the number of accidents per passenger mile.
Unfortunately, over the same period, the percentage of accidents
ascribed to pilot error has remained constant.  Many instances of
pilot error can be traced back to a lack of situational awareness;
either the crew misinterpreted the information with which they were
presented, or the speed and complexity of events allowed too little
time for correct decision making.
<P>

The MBRAWSAC (Model-Based Reasoning Applied to Warning Systems for
Aircraft Cockpits) project has brought together a multi-
disciplinary team in a three-year investigation of solutions to
this problem of situational awareness.  The partners in this
collaboration are Smiths Industries Aerospace and Defence Systems,
British Airways, and the University of Bristol Department of
Psychology.  Funding has been provided by DTI and the UK Science
and Engineering Research Council (SERC) through the Joint Framework
for Information Technology (JFIT).
<P>

The project has two main strands:  system design and human factors.
The starting point for the research has been an examination of
existing warning system design.  In the modern cockpit, aircraft
system information is provided by a central warning system.  Should
a malfunction occur, primary system parameters can be displayed on
a central panel together with associated warning messages.
Interpretation becomes difficult for the pilot when malfunctions in
one system lead to abnormalities in related systems.  When this
results in multiple warning, aircrew must identify the most
important symptom, or the root cause of the problem, in order to
take appropriate action.
<P>

The human factors team have used structured interviews and a large-
scale questionnaire survey to identify pilots' requirements for
advanced warning systems, and to assess difficulties associated
with current designs.  Meanwhile, the aim of the system effort has
been to use model-based reasoning techniques to achieve early
detection of malfunctions, together with isolation of primary
causes.  An additional feature of this work has been the
combination of goal hierarchies and constrain-satisfaction methods
to generate sequences of recommended crew actions in the event of
complex or multiple failure situations.  Work is also being
undertaken to determine how the information generated by the new
system can best be displayed.

<a href="#[6.0]" NAME="[5.0]"><b>[5.0]</b></a>  FLAME DETECTION BY IMAGING
<P>

Conventional fire detectors are essentially single-element infrared
and/or ultraviolet devices.  While these can be extremely sensitive
to the characteristic electromagnetic radiation emitted by flames,
they are also liable to be put into alarm by everyday sources such
as arc-welding, lightning, torches, hot machinery, etc.
<P>

Reducing the incidence of false alarms is particularly important
for high-risk installations where an alarm may mean activation of
a suppression system or an automatic call to the emergency
services.  Another disadvantage of a single element detector is
that the signal is integrated over the field of view, so that
signals from small distant fires will be lost in the background
radiation.  In response to the need for a detector that does not
suffer from the above problems, the Signal Processing Group at
Cambridge University Engineering Department and a team from Kidde-
Graviner Ltd. (a division of Fire and Safety International) have
joined forces to work on developing and building one of a new
generation of fire detectors.  This incorporates an imaging system
in the form of a monochrome CCD video camera (made to work in the
near-infrared by means of a colored glass filter) which constantly
surveys the risk area, coupled to dedicated processors which take
the incoming data and execute algorithms to decide whether or not
a flame is present.  It is intended that the imaging detector
should be capable of recognizing flames in a way similar to that
used by the human brain.
<P>

The real-time system, which uses a field-programmable gate array
for the initial grabbing and preprocessing of the incoming image
data, and RISC processors for the algorithm implementation, will
shortly be ready for field testing.  Real-time tests will enable us
to decide on the ultimate form of the detection algorithm.  Current
working algorithms include the use of spatial and temporal
statistics of flames, neural networks classifiers, and
morphological filters.  Depending upon the results of the real-time
testing, one, or some combination, of these techniques will
ultimately be used.  It is envisaged that a working prototype
system will be available by December 1993.

<a href="#[7.0]" NAME="[6.0]"><b>[6.0]</b></a>  NEW SERC FUNDING INITIATIVE FOR COMMUNICATIONS SIGNAL
PROCESSING AND CODING
<P>

The Communications and Distributed Systems Committee is launching
a new research initiative in communications signal processing and
coding (SPC).  SPC represents a core element of information
technology, and forms an important growth area in electronics.
Over the last 5-10 years there has been a vast increase in the
application of signal processing and coding techniques in civil and
military electronic systems.  In Europe today, digital signal
processing and coding products and systems form a billion dollar
market.  The long-term goal of the new Program is to ensure that
algorithm development in the universities proceeds in parallel with
VLSI processor development and industrial system applications.  The
SPC approach to this goal is to bring about substantial
improvements in the processing algorithms on which future smart
communication systems will be built.
<P>

Projects supported under the Program will be of two types:
academic-only, and collaborative with industry (although funding
will not be available to industrial partners).  The call for
proposals has been circulated, and the closing date for the first
round of applications will be 1 March 1994.

<a href="#[1.0]" NAME="[7.0]"><b>[7.0]</b></a> TELEMATICS REVIEWED
<P>

The Mid-Term Review Board, under the chairmanship of Brian Oakley,
has recently completed its report on the Telematic Program.
<P>

The Board was asked to review the Program as a single entity with
reference to the objectives of the Framework Program as a whole,
and to the Framework Telematics Program in particular.  The latter
included the contribution of the JFIT Telematics Program to the
furtherance of Community policies in the various application areas,
strengthening of the scientific and technological basis of European
industry and achievement and success of the internal market.
<P>

The report recognizes that the seven areas of the Program are
largely concerned with applications and with applications systems
engineering.  This means that user involvement is not just
desirable, it is essential if successful exploitation is to be
achieved.  When the user involvement is strong, and the users
themselves know what they want and are prepared to cooperate to
achieve it, the Program is at its best.
<P>

The Board found a very general welcome for the Telematics Program
and enthusiasm from the project participants.  Principal
recommendations and conclusions included:
<P>

<PRE>
  *  the Program needs a stronger strategic vision for the future;
  *  the Program should be kept together and run by a single team;
  *  continued user involvement is essential to meet objectives;
  *  the Program should be organized to maximize development and
       use of generic solutions;
  *  the development of relevant standards remains a high priority;
  *  the Board recommends a substantial increase in the budget for
       telematics, an activity where systems development work is
       likely to lead to exploitation.
</PRE>

<a href="#[3.0]" NAME="[2.0]"><b>[2.0]</b></a>  The Sant'Anna School of University Studies and Doctoral
Research of Pisa was set up in 1987 by merging the School of
University Studies and Doctoral Research with the Sant'Anna
Conservatoire.  Both institutions have long traditions.  The School
of University Studies and Doctoral Research can be traced back to
the Ferdinand I College and the Puteano College.  The Ferdinand
College was founded in 1593 at the behest of the Grand Duke to
admit students of the Faculties of medicine and law.  The Puteano
College was founded in 1605 by Archbishop Carlo Antonio Dal Pozzo
to admit students of the Faculties of medicine, law, and philosophy
who came from the town of Biella.
<P>

The 1987 merger created a single institution that was modeled on
the Scuola Normale Superiore (of Pisa) which has a long history as
a distinguished Italian university for arts and science.  With the
University of Pisa also present, the small city of Pisa -- about a
50 minute train ride west of Florence -- is a major scientific
research center for Italy.
<P>

The School is composed of two branches:  The Faculty of Social
Sciences which includes economics, management, law, and political
science, and the Faculty of Experimental and Applied Sciences which
includes Agrarian Studies, Engineering, and Medicine.  The School
of Engineering focuses on Bioengineering, Innovation Management,
Information Technology, Microelectronics, and Robotics.
Specialties are sensors and measurement of biomedical parameters,
architectures for real-time information systems, software
engineering, solid state electronic devices, component development
techniques, and robotic systems for applications in non-structured
environments.  The school is small and admission is highly
competitive based primarily on national testing.
<P>

The Advanced Robotics Technical Systems (ARTS) laboratory was
established in 1986 by Bergamasco and another professor, both from
the University of Pisa.  It focuses on virtual environment issues,
the control of industrial robots including the development of
tactile sensors for robots, and the use of robots for biomedical
applications.
<P>

The school, incidently, is a short walk from the Leaning Tower of
Pisa.  The Tower leans because of unstable soil exacerbated by a
particularly heavy bell tower at the top.  The Tower has been
closed for some time while engineering efforts are being made to
prevent further "leaning", so I was not able to climb up for the
"panoramic" view of Pisa.
<P>

<a href="#[4.0]" NAME="[3.0]"><b>[3.0]</b></a>  GLAD-IN-ART (Glove-Like Advanced Interface for the Control
of Manipulation and Exploratory Procedures in Artificial Realities)
is an ESPRIT funded project.  As noted in earlier discussions of
ESPRIT (see <a href="rosenblum.001.html">REALIZATION REPORT #1</a>, <a href="rosenblum.001.html">REALIZATION REPORT #1</a>, 
<a href="rosenblum.001.html">REALIZATION REPORT #1</a>, <a href="rosenblum.002.html">REALIZATION REPORT #2</a>), these projects
are multi-partner collaborations which must span at least two EC
countries.  For this project the participants are AITEK SRL (IT),
Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna (IT), Trinity College Dublin (IRL),
Video Display Systems (IT), and Technology Applications Group (UK).
<P>

One goal of the project, now successfully completing after 3 years,
is to develop an instrumented glove to be worn by the human
operator and capable of recording the hand geometrical
configuration in the control space.  This information is used to
control a virtual hand in artificial space and allow more natural
and accurate interactions than could be achieved with other 3D,
interactive devices.  The project developed kinesthetic and force
feedback sensations for the users wrist and hand.  Proposed
applications are remote operations (telepresence) in space and
hostile environments, physiotherapy, and biomedical robotics.
<P>

The dataglove structure wraps around the hand and supports
kinesthetic sensors for the fingers.  Flexion-extension and
abduction-adduction movements are recorded by the sensors.  The
glove has 12 motors, one for each phalanx of each finger (i.e. 3
per finger) with the little finger excluded.  The glove contains 23
sensors.  Each finger has 3 strain gage sensors and one magnetic
sensor.  Two mechanical sensors and one made of conductive plastic
monitor the wrist joint.  The final force feedback glove will use
only strain gages for force and conductive plastic for all fingers
and other points of measurement.
<P>

A computer model with graphics has been developed for the
dataglove.  The model contains 28 contact points for the phalanges
and 3 for the palm.  Understanding the geometric areas of contact
with an object for different user motions is generating both
tactile feedback requirements and also a physical-based model that
can determine if an object has been picked up.  The latter will
improve on current models that just measure geometrical proximity
for this purpose.
<P>

<a href="#[5.0]" NAME="[4.0]"><b>[4.0]</b></a>  I must be unlucky with prototype datagloves, for the glove
was being repaired and I was unable to test it (see also
<a href="rosenblum.005.html">REALIZATION REPORT #5</a>).  However, I was able to test the other
component: a shoulder-to-hand force feedback exoskeleton system to
which the glove will attach.
<P>

The system is a 7 degree-of-freedom (DOF) exoskeleton wrapping up
the whole arm and supported by the shoulder and trunk of the
operator.  It is gravity compensated, so that the operator does not
bear the weight of the system.  The DOF's match the corresponding
human joints:  flexion-extension and abduction-adduction at the
shoulder, rotation of the arm, flexion-extension of the elbow,
prono-supination movement of the forearm, and flexion-extension and
abduction-adduction of the wrist.  Each joint on the exoskeleton is
actuated by means of DC servomotors located on the structure.  The
motion of each joint is obtained through a tension, tendon-based
transmission system that includes complex cable routings for the
elbow and forearm joints.  Torque sensors measure the differential
tension of the cables actuating each joint.
<P>

I tested the system by moving around and against a simply modeled
geometric object containing planar sides in virtual space.  The
results were impressive as the system was responsive and the force
feedback strong and accurate.  The response delay to my movements
was noticeable, but this was attributable to the need to process
using several workstations: two low-end SGI's for graphics and a PC
with a Transputer card for control with an ethernet connection (a
high-end SGI is being obtained).  The claimed innate system delay
is 2 msec.  Bergamasco has studied the operation of the tendons of
the human forearm and hand.  He notes that the actual interaction
is more complex than the current modeling by one cable to push and
one to pull.  In actuality there is a redundancy of tendons
generating a motion.  Implementation of these ideas is a future
direction.
<P>

<a href="#[1.0]" NAME="[5.0]"><b>[5.0]</b></a>  Tactile feedback is a potentially valuable companion to
force feedback.  A new 5 year EC funded project, SCATIS, is
attempting to develop a tactile sensor that would be sensitive to
both temperature and textures.  Started in 1992, the project's
first year saw a definition and specification of possible systems.
Another EC-funded (TIDE - Technology for Disabled and Elderly
people) project will redesign the GLAD-IN_ART structures of
rehabilitative purposes.  A third project uses a PUMA robot with a
force and tactile sensor attached.  By passing over the surface of
the object, the tactile sensor determines the roughness.  An expert
system performs a classification by hardness and roughness, where
the object has predetermined characteristics from a small class of
objects.  Bergamasco felt that these ideas might be extensible to
a larger class of partially known or unknown objects.  A final
project uses PVDF (a piezoelectric polymer) as part of an
ultrasound sensor to permit the control of wheelchairs by the
disabled.

<title>TTCP STP-11</title>

<img src="../gifs/banner-logo.GIF">

<H1>TTCP STP-11 - Secure Information Systems</H1>

<H2>What is TTCP STP-11?</H2>


There is a treaty among the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada,
Australia, and New Zealand called The Technical Cooperation Program
(TTCP), under which collaborative research is organized and relevant
research information is exchanged.  Subgroups are organized under the
treaty, each identified by a letter of the alphabet and covering a
particular technology area.  Under each subgroup there are Technical
Panels (TPs), each identified by a number and covering a particular
aspect of the technology or particular problem.  Subgroup S covers
Communications Technology and Command and Control Information Systems.
Technical Panel 11 (STP-11) is concerned with technology for secure
life cycle management, security architectures and technical strategies
for securing information systems, and security of specific applications
of high military interest.  TTCP works through cooperation and
coordination of research activities;  it has no budget.
<P>
Or, more briefly and bureaucratically:
<blockquote>
STP-11 meets under the auspices of The Technical Cooperation Program (TTCP),
Combined Policy Committee Subcommittee on Non-Atomic Military Research 
and Development (NAMRAD) and is governed by the Policies, Organizations, 
and Procedures in NAMRAD issued under the authority of the Subcommittee 
on NAMRAD of the Combined Policy Committee.  
</blockquote>

<H1>History</H1>

STP-11 began life as XTP-1, under Subgroup X, whose scope was
Computing Technology.  Subgroup X, Technical Panel 1
(or XTP-1, for short) covered Trustworthy Computing Technologies.

XTP-1 first met officially in the fall of 1986.  Since then, a variety
of activities, workshops, and exchanges of software tools for research
and development purposes have been carried out under its auspices.  These
include the development of the RS-232 repeater problem as a test case
for the application of formal methods, numerous exchanges of software
for automated theorem proving, and organization of a workshop on the
effective use of automated reasoning technology.  Current collaborations
include efforts to document research progress in multilevel secure
relational databases, to organize an international ATM INFOSEC
testbed, and to develop generalised threat models. 
<p>
In 1995-96, the TTCP structure was reorganized, and activities
previously carried out under Subgroup X were realigned.  In this
process, XTP-1 was re-formed under Subgroup S as Technical Panel
11 (STP-11) on Secure Information Systems.  The scope of Subgroup
S is Communications Technology and Command and Control Information
Systems.

McLean, J and Heitmeyer, C. "High Assurance Computer Systems: A Research Agenda," America in the Age of Information, National Science and Technology Council Committee on Information and Communications Forum, Bethesda, 1995.
<blockquote>
       Many scientific approaches for specifying, constructing, and certifying high assurance systems have been developed, including formal verification and validation techniques. Much still needs to be done with respect to individual critical properties (e.g., safety, security, and timeliness). Even more needs to be done with respect to (1) the lack of technology support for applying these techniques to practical, real-word systems, and (2) the lack of a unified framework for building systems that satisfy several critical properties. These problems are of such a difficult nature that they will not be solved by industry or academia without the support of both government funding agencies and government research laboratories. This paper summarizes the results of a workshop in which a group of 50 experts from academia, government, and industry participated to address these challenges.

<h1>High Assurance Workshop Reports</h1>

<p>
McLean, J and Heitmeyer, C. "High Assurance Computer Systems: A Research Agenda," America in the Age of Information, National Science and Technology Council Committee on Information and Communications Forum, Bethesda, 1995.
<blockquote>
       Many scientific approaches for specifying, constructing, and certifying high assurance systems have been developed, including formal verification and validation techniques. Much still needs to be done with respect to individual critical properties (e.g., safety, security, and timeliness). Even more needs to be done with respect to (1) the lack of technology support for applying these techniques to practical, real-word systems, and (2) the lack of a unified framework for building systems that satisfy several critical properties. These problems are of such a difficult nature that they will not be solved by industry or academia without the support of both government funding agencies and government research laboratories. This paper summarizes the results of a workshop in which a group of 50 experts from academia, government, and industry participated to address these challenges.

<blockquote>
Verifying properties of hybrid systems can be highly complex.  To reduce 
the effort required to produce a correct proof, the use of mechanical 
verification techniques is promising.  Recently, we extended a mechanical 
verification system, originally developed to reason about deterministic 
real-time automata, to verify properties of hybrid systems.  To evaluate 
our approach, we applied our extended proof system to a solution, based 
on the Lynch-Vaandrager timed automata model, of the Steam Boiler 
Controller problem, a hybrid systems benchmark.  This paper reviews our 
mechanical verification system, which builds on SRI's Prototype Verification 
System (PVS), and describes the features we added to handle hybrid systems.  
 It also discusses some errors we detected in applying our system to the 
benchmark problem. We conclude with a summary of insights we acquired in 
using our system to specify and verify hybrid systems.

Assuring the correctness of specifications of real-time systems
can involve significant human effort.  The use of  a mechanical theorem 
prover to encode such specifications and to verify their properties
could significantly reduce this effort.  A barrier to routinely encoding 
and mechanically verifying specifications has been the need first to 
master the specification language and logic of a general theorem proving 
system.  Our approach to overcoming this barrier is to provide mechanical
support for producing specifications and verifying proofs, specialized for 
particular mathematical models and proof techniques.  We are currently 
developing a mechanical verification system called TAME (Timed Automata 
Modeling Environment) that provides this specialized support using SRI's
Prototype Verification System (PVS).  Our system is intended to permit 
steps in reasoning similar to those in hand proofs that use model-specific 
techniques.  TAME has recently been used to detect errors in a realistic 
example.

<blockquote>
This paper reports the results of a case study on the feasibility of 
developing and applying mechanical methods, based on the proof system 
PVS, to prove propositions about real-time systems specified in the 
Lynch-Vaandrager timed automata model. In using automated provers 
to prove propositions about systems described by a specific mathematical 
model, both the proofs and the proof process can be simplified by exploiting 
the special properties of the mathematical model. This paper presents the 
PVS specification of three theories that underlie the timed automata model, 
a template for specifying timed automata models in PVS and an example of 
its instantiation, and both hand proofs and the corresponding PVS proofs of 
two propositions. It concludes with a discussion of our experience in 
applying PVS to specify and reason about real-time systems modeled as 
timed automata.

"Automated Consistency Checking of Requirements Specifications,"
ACM Trans. on Software Eng. and Methodology 5, 3, July 1996, 
231-261.  
<a href="../publications/CHACS/1996/1996heitmeyer-ACM.ps">PostScript</a>
<blockquote>
This paper describes a formal analysis technique, called
consistency checking, for automatic detection of errors, such as  type
errors, nondeterminism, missing cases, and circular definitions, in
requirements specifications.  The technique is designed to analyze
requirements specifications  expressed in the SCR (Software Cost
Reduction) tabular notation.  As background,  the SCR approach to
specifying requirements is reviewed.  To provide a formal semantics for
the SCR notation and a foundation for consistency checking, a formal
requirements model is introduced; the  model represents a software
system as a finite state automaton, which produces externally visible
outputs in response to changes in monitored environmental quantities.
Results are presented of two experiments which evaluated the utility
and scalability of our technique for consistency checking in a
real-world avionics application.  The role of consistency checking
during the requirements phase of software development is discussed.

<blockquote>
This chapter defines real-time systems and illustrates them with a
number of small examples.  It also discusses issues central to applying
formal methods in the development of real-time systems:  the trade-offs
between operational and descriptive specifications, different levels of
formality that can be applied, and the requirements of formal methods
for building industrial-strength systems.  To put the newer formal
methods into perspective, two methods widely used in practice to design
and analyze real-time systems, namely, structured analysis and
Statecharts, are reviewed.  Several promising new techniques for
specifying and analyzing real-time systems are then summarized and
illustrated with examples.  These include  graphical notations, state
machine and logic-based models,  process algebras,  and analysis
techniques,  such as model checking and deductive reasoning.

<blockquote>
The use of the Lynch-Vaandrager timed automaton model is illustrated
with a solution to  the Generalized Railroad Crossing problem. The
solution shows formally the correspondence between four system
descriptions:  an axiomatic (i.e., descriptive) specification, an
operational specification represented in terms of timed automata, a
discrete system implementation, and a system implementation that works
with a continuous gate model.  Several sample proofs are given.  In the
development of the solution, a number of guidelines were applied.
These guidelines, which should prove useful in applying formal methods
to practical systems, are described and illustrated with examples.

<blockquote>
This paper presents a formal framework for representing and reasoning
about the requirements of hybrid computer systems.  By a hybrid
computer system, we mean a computer system whose environment includes
both continuous and discrete entities.  As background, the paper
briefly reviews an abstract model for specifying system and software
requirements,  called the Four Variable Model, and a related
requirements method, called   SCR (Software Cost Reduction).  The paper
then introduces  a special discrete version of the Four Variable Model,
called the SCR requirements model,  and  suggests how the  SCR model
can be extended to specify and to reason about hybrid systems. Examples
of how the SCR model can be used to specify  a system's timing and
accuracy requirements are given.

The Computer Security Section conducts research leading to improved 
methods for specifying, designing, implementing, verifying, and
certifying computer systems that must enforce security requirements. 
A fundamental question that motivates many of our projects is, "How can 
we write computer programs or build computer systems and know what they do?"

<A NAME="summary"><H2>Summary:</H2>

The use of a switched communications network should not require
revealing who is talking to whom.  Onion Routing is a flexible
communications infrastructure that is resistant to both eavesdropping
and traffic analysis.  Onion routing accomplishes this goal by
separating identification from routing.  Connections are always
anonymous, although communication need not be.  Communication may be
made anonymous by removing identifying information from the data
stream.  Onion routing can be used by a variety of unmodified Internet
applications by means of proxies.

<P>

Traffic analysis can be used to infer who is talking to whom over a
public network.  For example, in a packet switched network, packets
have a header used for routing, and a payload that carries the data.
The header, which much be visible to the network (and to observers of
the network), reveals the source and destination of the packet.  Even
if the header were obscured in some way, the packet could still be
tracked as it moves through the network.  Encrypting the payload is
similarly ineffective, because the goal of traffic analysis is to
identify who is talking to whom and not (to identify directly) the
content of that conversation.

<P>

The efficiencies of the public Internet are strong motivation for
companies to use it instead of private intranets.  However, these
companies may want to protect their interests.  For example, a
researcher using the World Wide Web (Web) may expect his particular
focus to remain private, and the existence of inter-company
collaboration may be confidential.  Individuals may wish to protect
their privacy too.  The identities of the participants in an e-mail
conversation should be known only to the communicating parties.  A
person shopping on the Web may not want his visits tracked.
Certainly, someone spending anonymous e-cash expects that the source
of the e-cash be untraceable.

<P>

Onion routing has been prototyped on Sun Solaris 2.4.  The prototype
includes proxies for private Web browsing, remote login, e-mail, and
file transfer protocols, and also anonymizing versions of those
proxies that remove identifying information from the data stream.
This page describes the Onion Routing system at several levels of
abstraction, including a detailed specification for reimplementors.

<P>

Our motivation here is not specifically to provide anonymous
communication, but, to seperate identification from routing.
Applications and users may identify themselves to each other.  But the
use of a public network should not automatically reveal to others the
identities of communicating parties.

<A NAME="introduction"><H2>Introduction:</H2>
Letters sent through the Post Office are usually in an envelope marked
with the sender's and recipient's addresses.  We trust that the Post
Office does not peek inside the envelope, because we consider its
contents private.  We also trust that the Post Office does not monitor
who sends mail to whom, because that information is also considered
private.
<P>
These two types of sensitive information, the contents of an envelope
and its address, apply equally well to electronic communication over
the Internet.  Just like mail, electronic messages travel in
electronic envelopes, and protecting the privacy of these messages
requires both safeguarding the contents of those envelopes and hiding
the addresses on the envelopes. Although communicating parties usually
identify themselves to one another, there is no reason that the use of
a public network like the Internet ought to reveal to others who is
talking to whom and what they are talking about.  The first concern is
traffic analysis, the latter is eavesdropping.
<P>
By making both eavesdropping and traffic analysis hard, the privacy of
communication is protected.  But what about anonymity?  Can two
parties communicate, if one or both do not want to be identified to
the other?  If the electronic envelope keeps its contents private, and
the address on the envelope is also hidden, then any identifying
information can only be inside the envelope!  So for anonymous
communication, we remove identifying information from the contents of
an envelope.  This may be called anonymizing a private envelope.
<P>
These goals may appear to be insolvable: Can the contents of an
envelope really be kept private?  How can a letter reach its
destination if its address is hidden?  Can two parties communicate
without revealing their identities to one another?  Can all this be
done without trusting third parties (the Post Office, for example) not
to remember addresses or to open envelopes?
<P>
Onion Routing uses well known networking and cryptographic techniques
to protect both the privacy and anonymity of Internet communication
against both eavesdropping and traffic analysis.  Onion Routing is
easily used in a wide variety of Internet applications (WWW browsing
and electronic mail, for example) to communicate both privately and
and anonymously.

<A NAME="solution"><H2>Solution:</H2>
If we protect a communications channel against both eavesdropping and
traffic analysis, and remove identifying information from the data
stream, then we have anonymous and private communication.
<P>
Onion Routing provides socket connections that are strongly resistant
to both eavesdropping and traffic analysis.  The privacy of these
socket connections is moved beneath the application layer and made
application independent.  Unmodified Internet applications may use
these anonymous socket connections by means of proxies.  If the proxies
anonymize the data stream, anonymity may be layered on top of anonymous
socket connections.  Onion Routing has been implemented on Sun Solaris
2.4 along with proxies for HTTP (WWW) and RLOGIN.  Proxies for e-mail
(SMTP) and FTP are forthcoming.
<P>
Onion Routing works in the following way: An application, instead of
making a (socket) connection directly to a destination machine, makes
a socket connection to an Onion Routing Proxy.  That Onion Routing
Proxy builds an anonymous connection through several other Onion Routers
to the destination.  Each Onion Router can only identify adjacent
Onion Routers along the route.  Before sending data over an anonymous
connection, the first onion router adds a layer of encryption for each
onion router in the route.  As data moves through the anonymous
connection, each onion router removes one layer of encryption, so it
finally arrives as plaintext.  This layering occurs in the reverse
order for data moving back to the initiator.  Data passed along the
anonymous connection appears different at each Onion Router, so data
cannot be tracked en route and compromised Onion Routers cannot
cooperate.  When the connection is broken, all information about the
connection is cleared at each Onion Router.
<P>
Onion Routing differs from other anonymity services in two ways:
Communication is real-time and bidirectional; and the anonymous
connections are application independent.  Applications may choose
whether to identify their users over an anonymous connection.  However,
the use of a switched public network should not automatically
reveal who is talking to whom.  This is the traffic analysis that
Onion Routing complicates.

<H2>Recent Accomplishments</H2>
<p>
<font color="#000000">
We have developed techniques for computing the capacity of
timing channels [1] and our application of these techniques to the
SINTRA database architecture [2].   We developed capacity bounds [1]
that are useful, for example, in bounding the capacity of
covert channels  arising from the need for atomicity in certain
database schedulers.  <P>

We have developed the theoretical basis of the  Pump [2] which is a dynamic,
quasi-secure, buffer
that accommodates the need for acknowledgements in communicating
computer systems.  A major benefit of the Pump is that it has minimal
negative impact upon communication throughput.  We have also extended the Pump 
to deal with a network environment [3].  We have also developed a new model 
for bursty computer communication [4] that further shows the advantages of the
Pump.
<p>
We have developed  a general theory of composition for Noninterference-like
security properties [5].  Unlike previous work, which addresses only the
question of whether a property is preserved when composed via general
hook-up with itself, we address the more general question of what
properties will be satisfied by a system in which components satisfying
different properties are composed via various types of composition
constructs.
<P>
We will study current techniques developed in steganography 
for visual information hiding and detection. 
Primarily, we are interested in the mathematical analysis of continuous
capacity calculation. We will also investigate further refinements 
 of the formal foundations of steganography.

<H2>Objective</H2>

To develop and evaluate formal methods for the verification of
cryptographic protocols. One of our accomplishments is the NRL
Protocol Analyzer, a tool for the verification of security properties
of cryptographic protocols.
We also develop and use modal logics to analyze cryptographic protocols.

Abbott, Russell J. Resourceful Systems for Fault Tolerance, Reliability 
and Safety. ACM Computing Surveys. 1990 Mar; 22(1): 35-68.
Above all, it is vital to realise that completely guaranteed behaviour 
is impossible and that there are inherent risks in relying on computer 
systems in critical environments.  The unforeseen consequences are 
often the most disastrous. [Neumann 68]
Section 1 of this survey reviews the current state of the art of 
system reliability, safety and fault tolerance.  The emphasis is on the 
contribution of software to these areas.  Section 2 reviews current 
approaches to software fault tolerance.  It discusses why some of the 
assumptions underlying hardware fault tolerance do not hold for 
software.  It argues that the current software fault tolerance 
techniques are more accurately thought of as delayed debugging than as 
fault tolerance.  It goes on to show that in providing both backtracking 
and executable speciifcaitons, logic programing offers most of the 
tools currently used in softwar fault tolerance.  Section 3 presents a 
generalisation of the recovery block approach to software fault 
tolerance, called resourceful systems.  Systems are resourceful if they 
are able to determine whetheer they have achieved their goals or, if 
notk to develop and carry out alternate plans.  Section 3 develops an 
approach to designing resourceful systems based on a functionally rich 
architecture and an explicit goal orientation.

communications. 1970. 
AFIPS Conf. Proc. 37 (FJCC) pp.281-285
This is the standard reference used for the ALOHA packet radio wide 
area network from which much of today's technology has sprung. It is 
essentially a UHF packet broadcast system created by a team at the 
University of Hawaii. This paper describes the initial implementation 
of 'pure ALOHA' and  the system's configuration,and provides an 
analysis of predicted channel utilization.
The simplest transmission technique is called pure ALOHA. When a node 
has a packet to transmit it does so immediately; having transmitted 
the packet, the node waits for an acknowledgement, and if no 
acknowledgement is received within a time out period, the packet is 
assumed lost.
It is collisions which cause problems, so a collision avoidance 
mechanism should improve efficiency. In packet radio networks a 
scheme known as carrier sense multiple access (CSMA) is used. When a 
node is transmitting all other nodes can receive the transmission, so 
they can avoid a collision by not transmitting themselves until the 
channel is free.

Cambridge University Computer Laboratory Technical Report No 114
This dissertation concerns the provision of Integrated Services in a 
local area context, eg on business premises. The term Integrated 
Services can be understood at several levels. At the lowest, one 
network may be used to carry traffic of several media - voice, data, 
images etc. Above that, the telephone exchange may be replaced by a 
more versatile switching system, incorporating facilities such as 
stored voice messages. Its facilities may be accessible to the user 
through the interface of a workstation rather than a telephone. At a 
higher level still, new services such as multi-media document 
manipulation may be added to the capabilities of a workstation.

An automated formal verification study of a commercial network 
security device, the SmartCrypto, is described. A high level view of 
relevant formal verification techniques using the m-EVES environment 
is given. A description of the SmartCrypto is provided, as well as a 
brief overview of the m-EVES system. The uses and roles of 
Verification plans, environmental and device-specific models, and 
other planning techniques are discussed in the context of this case. 
Observations are made concerning the proof process and the problem of 
tractability which may apply to similar projects.

This survey paper describes the alternatives to verification. It 
primarily concentrates on the tools and techniques that can be used for 
testing that programs are correct. A brief discussion of proof based 
systems and of the use of simulations is given.
Exhaustive testing of all but the simplest systems is impossible. The 
paper presents two alternatives to exhaustive testing: functional 
testing, which ensures that each category of use has been tested, and 
structural testing, which ensures that each segment of code is tested

Aggarwal, S.; Courcoubetis, C.; Wolper, P. Adding Liveness Properties to 
Coupled Finite-State Machines. ACM Trans on Programming Languages 
and Systems. 1990 Apr; 12(2): 303-339.
Informal specifications of protocols are often imprecise and 
incomplete and are usually not sufficient to ensure the correctness of 
even very simple protocols.  Consequently, formal specificaiton 
methods, such as finite-state models, are increasingly being used.  The 
selection/resolution (S/R) model is a finite-state model with a 
powerful communcation mechanism that makes it easy to describe 
complex protocols as a collection of simple finite state machines.  A 
software environment, called SPANNER, has been developed to specify 
and analyse protocols specified with the S/R model.  SPANNER provides 
the facility to compute the joint behaviour of a number of finite-state 
machines and to check if the 'product' machine has inaccessible states, 
states corresponding to deadlocks, and loops corresponding to 
livelocks.  So far, however, SPANNER has had no facility to 
systematically deal with liveness conditions.  For example, one might 
wish to specify that, although a communication channel is unreliable, a 
message will get through if it is sent infinitely often, and to check 
that the infinite behaviour of the protocol viewed as an infinite 
sequence will always be in some w-regular set (possibly specified in 
terms of a formula in temporal logic or as an w-automata).  In this 
paper we show that with very minor modifications to the implemented 
system, it is possible to substantially extend the type of properties 
that can be specified and checked by SPANNER.  This is done by 
extending the S/R model to include acceptance conditions found in 
automatons on infinite words, which permits the incorporation of 
arbitrary liveness conditions into the model.  We show how these 
extensions can be easily incorported into SPANNER (and into essentially 
any finite-state verification system) and how the resulting system is 
used to automatically verify the correctness of protocols.

Akl, Selim G.; Denning, Dorothy E. Checking Classification Constraints 
for Consistency and Completeness. 1987. 
Classification constraints are rules for assigning access classes to 
data when they are entered into a database. In order that a given set of 
constraints specify meaningful classes, they should be consistent, that 
is, not define conflicting classes for the same data. This paper gives 
algorithms for checking the consistency and completeness of a set of 
classification constraints defined on a database schema. The 
techniques use computational geometry to compute intersecting 
regions in a multidimensional space, where each region is defined by a 
classification constraint or integrity constraint.
IEEE Comp. Soc. Proc 1987 Symp. Security and Privacy, pp. 196 - 201
This paper follows on from the previous year's paper where 
classification constraints are applied to database views. It argues that:
 classification constraints must be considered with integrity 
constraints, and
 classification constraints must be simple otherwise nobody will 
understand them or their interactions with the other constraints.
However, the need for consistency checks arises from the resultant 
classification by each rule being given as a single value. Since not all 
rules would be expected to be equally important in every case there 
seems to be no reason why all rules applying to an object should result 
in the same classification. Therefore there is no use for the 
consistency checks if the least upper bound of all the classifications 
from the rules is taken. Completeness could be covered by a default 
rule, for example that all objects should be classified according to 
their source.

In this paper we present a generalization of McCullough's 
restrictiveness model as the basis for proving security properties 
about distributed system designs. We mechanize this generalization for 
an event-based model of computer systems in the HOL (Higher Order 
Logic) system to prove the composability of the model and several 
other properties about the model. We then develop a set of generalized 
classes of system components and show for which families of user 
views they satisfy the model. Using these classes we develop a 
collection of general system components that are specializations of 
one of these classes and show that the specializations also satisfy the 
security property. We then conclude with a sample distributed secure 
system, based on the Rushby and Randell distributed system design and 
designed using our collection of components, and show how our 
mechanized verification system can be used to verify such designs.

This paper is a good summary of a range of issues and experience in 
security kernels up to 1980. It outlines the parts of a formal security 
kernel development methodology, and reviews some of the practical 
work which has been done in this area. It also presents some of the 
ways in which the kernel concept is applied to particular problem 
areas. It finally considers limitations of the kernel methodology.
It concludes that the mathematical axioms on which kernel systems are 
based were very good, but too simple to form a complete practical 
system. Even practical kernels require too much reliance to be placed in 
application programs in order to be workable, thus compromising 
security.

Protection models provide a formalism for specifying control over 
access to information and other resources in a multi-user computer 
system. Useful protection models must balance expressive power with 
the complexity of safety analysis, ie. the determination of whether of 
not a given subject can ever acquire access to a given resource. We 
argue that, in terms of expressive power, a joint creation operation is 
a natural candidate for inclusion in an access control model, 
particularly in the context of integrity considerations. We extend the 
Schematic Protection Model (SPM) to allow for groups of subjects to 
jointly create other subjects and objects. We show that the extended 
model, which we call ESPM, is equivalent in expressive power to the 
monotonic access matrix model of Harrison, Ruzzo, and Ullman. 
Additionally, we conjecture that SPM is in fact less expressive than 
the monotonic access matrix. Thus the joint creation operation appears 
to have fundamental expressive power lacking in the SPM model. We 
discuss the safety properties of ESPM. Despite the increase in 
expressive power, ESPM retains tractable safety analysis for many 
cases of practical interest.

Access control models provide a formalism and framework for 
specifying control over access to information and other resources in 
multi-user computer systems. Useful access control models must 
balance expressive power with the decidability and complexity of 
safety analysis, ie. the determination of whether or not a given subject 
can ever acquire access to a given object. The access matrix model of 
Harrison, Ruzzo, and Ullman (HRU) has very broad expressive power. 
Unfortunately, HRU also has extremely weak safety properties; safety 
analysis is undecidable for most policies of practical interest. In this 
paper we show the remarkable result that an alternate formulation of 
HRU gives us strong safety properties. This alternate formulation is 
called the Extended Schematic Protection Model (ESPM). ESPM is derived 
from the Schematic Protection Model (SPM) by extending the creation 
operation to allow multiple parents for a child, as opposed to the 
conventional create operation of SPM which has a single parent for a 
child. It has earlier been shown that ESPM is equivalent in expressive 
power to HRU. Here we analyze the safety properties of ESPM. We show 
that, despite its equivalence to HRU, ESPM retains tractable safety 
analysis for a large class of protection schemes that are of practical 
interest.

Symposium on Research into Security and Privacy; 1992 May 4; Oakland, 
California. USA: IEEE Computer Society Press; 1992: pp. 204. 
We offer a concurrency control algorithm for replicated, secure, multi-
level databases. In secure databases, single copy techniques cannot 
avoid indirect channels without subjecting high level transactions to 
starvation due to malicious low level processes. However, multi-
version and replicated databases can avoid starvation problems without 
introducing indirect channels by maintaining stable copies of old low 
level data values for use by high level transactions. The algorithm 
presented here improves on two comparable techniques, a direct multi-
version approach of Keefe and Tsai [10] and full replication scheme of 
Jajodia and Kogan [9]. In the latter, each security level has a container 
that holds a copy of all lower level data. This paper shows that only a 
constant number of old copies - two, as it turns out - need be 
maintained. We argue correctness of our algorithm and demonstrate 
that the algorithm is free of indirect channels and starvation.

Protection models provide a formalism for specifying control over 
access to information and other resources in a multi-user computer 
system. One such model, the Extended Schematic Protection Model 
(ESPM), has expressive power equivalent to the monotonic access 
matrix model of Harrison, Ruzzo, and Ullman. Yet ESPM retains 
tractable safety analysis for many cases of practical interest. Thus 
ESPM is a very general model, and it is of interest whether ESPM can be 
implemented in a reasonable manner. In this paper, we outline a 
distributed implementation for ESPM. Our implementation is 
capability-based, with an architecture where servers act as mediators 
to all subject and object access. Capabilities are made non-
transferable by burying the identity of subjects in them, and 
unforgeable by using a public key encryption algorithm. Timestamps and 
public keys are used as mechanisms for revocation.

Implementing Transaction Control Expressions by Checking for Absence

Conference; 1930 Nov 4; San Antonio, Texas. USA: IEEE Computer 
Society Press; 1992: pp. 131 - 140. ISBN: 0-8186-3115-5.
Separation of duties is an important, real-world requirement that 
access control models should support. In      
[13], Sandh introduced the transaction control expression (TCE) for 
specifying dynamic separation of duties. In this paper we consider the 
implementation of TCEs in the typed access matrix model (TAM) 
recently proposed by Sandhu [16]. We show that TAM requires 
extensions for satisfactory handling of dynamic separation of duties. In 
particular, dynamic separation requires the capability to explicitly 
test for the absence of rights in cells of the access matrix. We 
illustrate how TAM, extended to incorporate such tests, can implement 
TCEs. We also discuss the impact of checks for absence of rights on 
safety analysis (i.e., the determination of whether or not a given 
subject can aquire a given right to a given object).

An approach to the measurement of software trust is shown to be based 
on a collection of security and software engineering trust principles. A 
set of criteria classes consisting of various trust principle 
combinations is shown to provide a scale for measuring and comparing 
trust. The system V/MLS secure operating system development 
approach is used to demonstrate the effect of trust principles in a

Anderson, David P.; Rangan, P. Venkat. A Basis for Secure 
Communication in Large Distributed Systems. 1987. 
We propose a secure communication architecture for distributed 
systems that puts security below the transport level, and uses host-
to-host rather than process-to-process secure channels. We argue that 
this provides the same level of end-to-end security as putting security 
at higher levels, and that it can simplify and improve the performance 
of transport protocols. The architecture is designed for very large 
distributed systems, which in general have security requirements 
beyond those of LAN-based systems.
IEEE Comp. Soc. Proc 1987 Symp. Security and Privacy, pp. 167 - 172
This paper presents an Authenticated Datagram Protocol (ADP) 
operating below the transport level for use in high-speed distributed 
systems where:
 there is no single administrative authority able to provide a 
universally-trusted name or key service and able to punish offenders; 
and,
 not all system-level components are equally trusted. 
A system is considered as a series of hosts, each with an operating 
system kernel, and a set of security principals, or owners, each with a 
private/public key pair. The paper specifies what it means by 'kernel 
secure'. It then identifies the conditions under which it can guarantee 
that a message a kernel is delivering to one of its processes came from 
a process for a given owner, and that the message was aimed at the 
'port' set up by the receiving process. The conditions surrounding the 
guarantees it offers to the sender are also established. The paper 
concludes with a comparison with other architectures such as the 
Birrell RPC Protocol.

TRW
IEEE Comp. Soc. Proc. 1985 Symp. Security and Privacy pp.184-189
Because of the size and complication of ADA, doubts have been raised 
as to its suitablility for writing secure systems. A system can be 
considered as 4 levels - applications, applications Runtime Support 
Library (RSL), security kernel and kernel RSL. As the security kernel is 
responsible for maintaining separate domains, there is no need (in 
general) for the Application or its RSL to be trusted. The kernel and its 
RSL both have to be trusted, but if we restrict the kernel to use the 
'PASCAL subset' of ADA, the features provided by the kernel RSL are 
minimal to non-existent and automatic TLS-to-code correlation 
becomes feasable. ADA also provides the sort of hardware-oriented 
features needed for efficiency of the security kernels, and the huge 
effort invested in the validation suite offers some assurance of 
compiler correctness.

This paper looks at the problems of network security from a 'new' 
viewpoint: it shows that the normal concepts used for computer 
security on single computer systems are applicable to secure network 
systems. One new concept is introduced, that of a Network Reference 
Monitor (NRM), and by investigating various configurations of trusted 
and untrusted computers on a network shows that there are a number of 
ways of implementing NRMs.
It considers the implications of the DoDCSC Criteria if a computer 
system is to be trusted to handle multilevel data. It is shown that 
untrusted computers can be attached to a multilevel network via a 
trusted Network Front End (NFE) which adds appropriate labels to all 
output and rejects input with unsuitable labels.
An unresolved problem is that of connecting to different networks 
where the granularity of access control and authorisation is not the 
same; special protocols and/or guard devices may be needed, but such 
solutions may conflict with other general networking objectives.

Note: Abstract in TechGnosis, June 1989 (PO689-26).
Tempest is the military term for electromagnetic eavesdropping on 
emissions from computer equipment.  The cost of Tempest 
eavesdropping equipment can vary from 3000 to 150,000, and the 
costs of protection against these devices varies according to the 
sophistication of the eavesdropper.  Typical security measures include 
screens attached to individual machines or screened rooms in which all 
sensitive equipment is placed.  Many companies have spent considerable 
sums on traditional data security methods but electronic eavesdropping 
can circumvent thes and holders of sensitive information should 
consder protecting against it.

Use of rapid prototyping to develop Multilevel Secure (MLS) systems 
requires that security be included in the rapid prototyping process. The 
literature shows some examples of rapid prototyping applied to secure 
components. However, little guidance is available for using a rapid 
prototype to develop an MLS system, consisting of multiple 
components, that can be accredited in the DOD environment. A 
methodology is proposed for including security in the rapid prototyping 
process. In this methodology, assurance that security has been 
correctly incorporated is provided by four foundation documents: the 
security concept of operations, the security policy, the security 
architecture, and the certification and accreditation plan. This 
methodology increases the probability of producing a rapid prototype 
without serious security shortfalls.

This paper develops a general mathematical framework in which to 
study the different flavours of dataflow and considers the operational 
implications of the different flavors.  The main advantage of separating 
mathematical and operational considerations in this way is that the 
mathematical underpinnings of operational distinctions are clearly 
expressed.  Another advantage of the framework is that it is the 
natural middle ground between functional languages and machine 
architecture.  Looked at one way, it yields particular functional 
languages, and looked at another way, it yields different evaluation 
strategies for different multiprocessor architectures.

Although high assurance multilevel secure (MLS)
database management systems (DBMSs) are slowly
becoming commercially available, these systems are
yet to offer a concurrency control protocol that is
free of signaling channels and guarantees serializabil-
ty (one-copy serializability if multiple versions are
kept in the database). Some database vendors have
started using in their products concurrency control
protocols that are easy to implement and give good
performance, even though they do not satisfy the usual
serializability requirements. For example, the con-
currency control protocol that has been implemented
m the commercially available Trusted Oracle MLS
DBS generates histories that are level-wise serializable.
While level-wise serializability has many desirable
properties, it suffers from the inconsistent retrieval 
problems which may seriously harm database integrity.
	In this paper, we show that it is possible to meet
stricter correctness criteria (such as pair-wise serializ-
ability and one-copy serializability) using Trusted Or-
acle, provided we have the knowledge of the update
transactions that will be executed in the system. We
perform a static analysis of the read and write sets of
these transactions and, based on this analysis, we con-
trol the order of submission of the transactions to the
scheduler in such a way that the resultant history en-
sures higher correctness level. It is important to note
that rather than taking the usual approach of modify-
ing the underlying concurrency control protocol such
that it meets the stricter correctness requirements, we
achieve our goal without modifying the Trusted Oracle
concurrency control algorithm in any way. This
is because the code that implements the concurrency
control is large and complicated and, moreover, the
source code for the DBMS is not available since it is
provided by the vendors in compiled form to the users.
Therefore, it is neither advisable nor possible to ma}e
modifications to the concurrency control protocol.

Over the past few years it has become obvious that the Orange Book is 
incomplete; integrity and availability are only touched upon. The Orange 
Book focuses much of its emphasis on disclosure (confidentiality) of 
data and little to unauthorized modification (integrity) of data. The 
Canadian Systems Security Centre has begun efforts to create a "Made 
in Canada" Orange Book. The Canadian Trusted Computer Product 
Evaluation Criteria, is an attempt to address those areas which were 
not (or were insufficiently) addressed in the US TCSEC. Two workshops 
at which Canadian and US industry and government were asked to 
contribute to a strengthening of the existing US Criteria, have already 
been held with more planned in the future. The Canadian Criteria is not 
a definitive answer but an evolutionary step towards incorporation of 
the requirements of a computer using community.

A mechanism is presented for ensuring the changes that occur to a 
system and its data occur in a consistent manner. The mechanism, 
Process Execution Controls, impose restrictions on the method of 
access to the data, unlike access controls which impose restrictions 
upon which users can access the data. This mechanism imposes another 
layer to the currently existing access control restrictions, but one that 
is, on the most part, transparent to the user. Although transparent, the 
system offers the capability to contain viruses to within a given 
domain. The paper shows two methods of implementation: extending 
current access control lists, and implementing complementary 
execution control lists.

was presented on a new form of consistency (or integrity) controls. In 
late 1989 the Government of Canada contracted with Thompson-Foss, 
Inc. to implement these controls into Trusted Tunis. This paper 
discusses the Thompson-Foss implementation, how well Process 
Execution Controls worked, and recommendations for improvement.

The Cambridge Distributed Computing System (CDCS) was designed 
some ten years ago and was in everyday use at the Computer Laboratory 
until December 1988.  An overview of the basic design of CDCS is given, 
an outline of its evolution and a description of the distributed systems 
research projects that were based on it.  Experience has shown that a 
design based on a processor bank leads to a flexible and extensible 
distributed system.

Bacon, Jean. Evolution of Operating System Structures. Cambridge: 
Computer Laboratory; 1989 Mar; Technical Report No 166. 
The development of structuring within operating systems is reviewed 
and related to the simultaneous evolution of concurrent programming 
languages.  First, traditional, multi-user systems are considered and 
their evolution from monolithic closed systems to general domain 
structured systems is traced.  Hardware support for protected sharing 
is emphasised for this type of system.  
The technology directed trend towards single user workstations 
requires a different emphasis in system design.  The requirement for 
protection in such systems is less strong than in multi-user systems, 
and, in a single language system, may to some extent be provided by 
software at compile time rather than hardware at run time.  
Distributed systems comprising single user workstations and dedicated 
server machines are considered and the special requirements for 
efficient implementation of servers are discussed.
The concepts of closed but structured and open system designs are 
helpful.  It is argued that the open approach is most suited to the 
requirements of single user and distributed systems.  Experiences of 
attempting to implement systems over a closed operating system base 
are presented.
Progress towards support for heterogeneity in distributed systems, so 
that interacting components written in a range of languages may 
interwork and may run on a variety of hardware, is presented.
The benefits of taking an object orientated view for system-level as 
well as language-level objects and for specification, generation and 
design of systems are discussed and work in this area is described.
An outline of formal approaches aimed at specification, verification 
and automatic generation of software is given.
Finally, design issues are summarised and conclusions drawn.

pp.120-136. 
Covert channel analysis is a challenging task, particularly when 
performed during the development of a large system. Some elements of 
covert channel analysis, such as timing channel identification and 
reduction, require techniques currently beyond the state of the art. 
Performing a useful covert channel analysis during development 
requires a careful balancing of costs and assurance, and a careful 
selection of currently available techniques. While it is possible for new 
research to assist in the covert channel analysis of large systems, 
developers cannot plan on breakthroughs. This paper discusses available 
techniques, their limitations and tradeoffs, and makes 
recommendations for performing covert channel analysis.

Note: The starting point of the paper seems to be the observation that 
it is often convenient to be able to describe transactions at different 
levels of granularity, so why not graft nested transaction theory onto 
Clarke-Wilson? The rest is detail.
The concept of nested transactions is definitely a useful one and may 
well prove fruitful. However, I found neither the content nor the style 
of presentation of this talk particularly good. Nonetheless it was of of 
the two joint winners of the prize for best paper.I cant help thinking 
that the Badger formulation could probably be greatly streamlined. It 
has been pointed out by Dale Johnson of Mitre that the model underlying 
the ISO language ESTELLE resembles the nested transaction model used 
here. This might provide a means of improving the presentation and may 
render it more formal.

Baldwin Robert W. (Tandem Computers, Cupertino). Naming and Grouping 
Privileges to Simplify Security Management in Large Databases. in: 
1990 IEEE Computer Society Symposium on Research in Security and 
Privacy; 1990 May 7; Oakland. USA: IEEE; 1990: 116-132. 
Note: ANSI SQL is a definition of a standard interface language for 
relational databases. Its security features are mainly based on access 
control lists (ACLs) for named database objects. Examples of database 
objects are tables and views.
Since they are attached to objects there can be large numbers of ACLs 
to maintain for an active database. For example, when a new user is 
added the database security administrator has a lot of work to do in 
modifying the ACLs. This makes it difficult to maintain both 
satisfactory security and administrative efficiency.
The paper proposes the use of named protection domains (NPDs) to 
simplify the problem. An NPD is a set of privileges which are 
permissions that may be held by a subject to use given operations on 
given objects.
A user may only have one NPD active at any given time. However, this is 
no disadvantage because there is a hierarchical relationship between 
NPDs, based on the relation that one NPD may contain another. These 
NPDs may then be used so that users are grouped according to roles. A 
new user need only be assigned an NPD (or NPDs).
NPDs can be used to form a link between the high level specification of 
security policy and the low level implementation of ACLs.
The concepts have been adopted for a future issue of the ANSI SQL 
standard.
This paper describes an extenstion to ANSI SQL that simplifies security 
management by reducing the complexity of the access controls on 
database objects, and by providing users with the flexibility to define 
administrative roles (like Auditor or Security Administrator) that 
match their requirements for the separation of duties.  The benefit of 
simplified security management is improved security.  The main 
features of this extension have been implemented in the Oracle RDBMS 
and have been adopted for a future version of the ANSI SQL standard.  
This paper focuses on major concepts and issues, not syntax and 
implementation.  The key idea is to allow users to group and name 
privileges to form named protection domains (NPDs).  The Clark-Wilson 
and Bell-La Padula models are used to illustrate the benfits and 
limitations of NPDs.  The main conclusion is that the naming and 
abstraction mechanisms provided by NPDs can simplify security 
management in much the same way that procedures can simplify 
programming.

The protocol described by this paper started out as a 'dating' scheme: 
users can register their wishes, but no-one but the intended dates can 
read the wishes, and then only if they have registered a matching wish; 
its requirements for anonymity and authentication are similar to those 
of electronic voting and oblivious transfer.

Security auditing systems are used to detect and assess unauthorised 
or abusive system usage. Until recently, security audits have been 
confined to a single computer system. Current work examines ways of 
extending auditing to include heterogeneous groups of computers 
(distributed systems). This paper examines the issues involved in 
auditing distributed systems, presents the framework for a distributed 
auditing system (DAS), and proposes a design for the audit reporting 
elements of the DAS.

The VAX/VMS environment provides unique built-in security control 
features for implementation by a system administrator. However, if the 
necessary controls are not in place, any or all the VAX/VMS security 
mechanisms can be easily bypassed. The DEC "Guide to VAX/VMS System 
Security" manual provides security-related information to increase 
security on VMS systems, but this manual is over 250 pages long and is 
difficult for the novice system administrator to follow. Therefore, to 
assist both novices and experienced system administrators in providing 
at least the minimal security for their VMS systems, SPARTA 
developed the "VMS System Security Guideline". This paper summarises 
the contents of the guideline that is currently being used throughout 
the Department of Energy (DOE).

1964; a summary of which is available in the this reference. This 
described a study conducted for the US Air Force on providing a 
survivable communication system for both voice and data transmission. 
The system proposed had no critical components within it and used a 
digital microwave system with integral encryption as its transmission 
medium. Unfortunately the Air Force did not follow this work up and it 
disappeared into obscurity until packet switching systems were 
reinvented a few years later.

There is currently only limited assurance that software electronically 
downloaded from a central source is a faithful copy of the original 
source software. Current Internet standards for privacy enhancement of 
electronic mail can also be employed to protect electronic distribution 
of software. The standards offer disclosure protection, source (sender) 
authentication, and message integrity services. However, electronic 
mail is a relatively inefficient means for distributing software. 
Proposed modifications to the mail privacy-enhancement standards 
will permit files to be afforded integrity and source authentication 
protection in a manner compatible with current file transfer 
conventions.

This Policy supportability is applied to selected policies from the

Note: This came over as a rather clever but at times seemingly rather 
desperate defence of the Bell/LaPadula model. Nonetheless a number of 
important (if not necessarily original) points were made.
Bell points out that the term model can be used in science and 
mathematics in several ways:
 a. An abstraction upon which analysis can be performed.
 b. As a 'proof' of consistency of a set of axioms.
 c. As a definition.
It was claimed that the Bell/LaPadula model was intended only to fulfil 
the first of these and hence criticisms of it on the basis of the other 
two definitions are misguided. He stresses that there is no reality 
against which to test a model but only intuitions. In order for any 
analysis performed on the model to be useful the model must be 
'faithful', that is to say it must represent (under a suitable 
interpretation) all relevant features without distortion.
'Modelling' in the context of computer security has the same 
connotation as in the fields of science and engineering, that of an 
abstraction used for the consideration of a problem of interest.  One 
recent criticism of the Bell-LaPadula model confused this notion of 
'modeling' with a foundational notion of 'model' or 'interpretation' and, 
in addition, included intrinsic errors of reasoning.

Note: Bell describes work carried out on behalf of the Defence 
Communications Agency. The work is based on the premise that the next 
generation of military packet switches will need to be treated as 
trusted systems in the sense of the TCSEC.
The paper takes Bell's previous work and applies it to packet switched 
networks (of the DDN type). The paper is based on an interpretation of 
the simple security property, the *-property and of a discretionary 
security property.
A number of rules relating to the security properties of actions carried 
out by the network (eg call connection) on behalf of subjects are 
described. Theorems which show the rules preserve the security 
properties are also presented.
The contents of the paper refer primarily to the network as a whole and 
the facilities it supports. An individual packet switch is treated to be 
just another instance of a general purpose trusted system. The work did 
not address denial of service nor precedence and priority issues.
During his presentation Bell spent a considerable amount of time having 
to correct errors in the formal portions of the paper!
To some extent the work presented has been overtaken by the Trusted 
Network Interpretation of the TCSEC.
A general network interpretation of a standard computer security 
model is applied to the next generation packet switch levels of 
discourse, using different interpretations.

This volume takes the model developed in vols 1&2 and the rules from 
vol 2 as well as the security condition and star-property and refines 
them to produce a set of rules which is likely to be more useable. The 
concept of current security level is introduced and the star-property is 
revised so that it is expressed in a form which is easier to check in a 
practical application. The revised form of the star-property is stronger 
than that given in vol2 and there is an explanation of the states that 
are now excluded. The model is adapted to fit with a hierarchical view 
of the objects in the system. The control attribute is adapted so that it 
becomes decentralised and implicit in the hierarchy. The concept of 
compatibility is introduced and justified and a new rule is given which 
preserves compatibility as well as security and star-property. There is 
a set of useful appendices which give the rules, proofs of the new rules 
and a notational glossary.

This is the definitive paper describing the Bell-LaPadula model, which 
has been very influential on the design of subsequent secure system 
models.
In the model subjects attempt to perform certain operations (read, 
write, execute or read-write) upon objects. Whether this is allowed is 
defined by a set of rules based on the operation and the security 
classes of the subject and object. The fundamental rules are known as 
the Simple Security Property and the Star Property; these are 
expressed formally and informally in a variety of forms, which has led 
to confusion.
The model is described in formal mathematical terms as a finite state 
machine, with the state being an access control matrix. State 
transitions occur as a result of objects being created, subjects 
acquiring and releasing privileges, and subjects transfering privileges 
between themselves. The model presents rules for these operations 
that ensure that all transitions from a secure state result in a secure 
state.
A formal specification of a system based upon Multics is presented 
together with proofs that the specified functions conform to the 
security model.

Classical cryptographic protocols based on user-chosen keys allow an 
attacker to mount password guessing attacks. We introduce a novel 
combination of asymmetric (public-key) and symmetric (secret-key) 
cryptography that allow two parties sharing a common password to 
exchange confidential and authenticated information over an insecure 
network. These protocols are secure against active attacks, and have 
the property that the password is protected against off-line 
"dictionary" attacks. There are a number of other useful applications as 
well, including secure public telephones.

Computer security is emerging as the business risk of the 1990's for 
many organisations operating in the commercial sector. Unlike 
military, government, defense and financial organisations, the mid to 
low risk commercial sector does not have well-developed security 
procedures. However, owing to the very different security needs of the 
commercial sector, it is inappropriate to apply the procedures used by 
high risk organisations.
	This paper will identify the characteristic system security 
concerns of the commercial sector, suggest some solutions and in 
particular investigate a structured and systematic approach to security 
assessment in the form of a qualitative based security risk analysis.

Distributed System Security. in: 1989 IEEE Symposium on Security and 
Privacy; May 1; Oakland, California. USA: IEEE Computer Society; 1989: 
194-203. 
Note: The Hierarchical Model presented in this paper is an extension of 
the Harrison-Ruzzo-Ullman access matrix model. The system is viewed 
as a deterministic finite state machine, accepting commands which are 
sequences of enter and delete operations. These operations add/remove 
tokens from locations in a global state matrix. Tokens may 
represent access rights, locks or indices into the matrix itself (e.g. 
object references).
The scheduler of the system takes a set of commands as input, and 
issues the constituent operations of those commands. Commands may 
proceed concurrently (the operations of those commands are 
interleaved), subject to the constraints imposed by locks. A command 
blocks if it attempts to enter a lock where one exists, or delete a lock 
where one does not exist. This model does not include any security 
constraints itself; it claims to be a framework in which to express 
security predicates, including those which require explicit modelling of 
synchronisation. The paper includes a discussion of critical regions of 
commands, serialisability and the nesting of critical regions.
There is an example of Bell  La Padula properties expressed in this 
model, but this seems fairly contrived, and doesnt increase 
confidence that the Hierarchical Model is applicable generally. It is 
admitted that major covert channel problems exist with this approach, 
and that non-interference properties cannot be expressed in this model.
The paper is confusingly written, and the presentation provided little 
clarification, being based on an over-complex example. The content of 
the paper seems to bear little relation to any of the keywords in its 
title, and it is unlikely that the approach will be of much use.

This paper presents a synchronization mechanism that communicates 
information from a writer to a reader without permitting information 
flow in the reverse direction. The synchronization mechanism takes 
advantage of a priori knowledge of the semantics of communicated 
information and is optimal because it does not require blocking, busy 
wait states, an unbounded number of re-reads of data or inefficient use 
of system resources. The synchronization mechanism has been 
implemented in the Trusted Mach Operating System's file system. This 
paper describes Trusted Mach's file system and shows how performance 
is enhanced through the use of the synchronization mechanism.

SCOMP was the first system to be certified in catagory A1. This 
required formal specification and verification of not just the security 
kernel, but also of the trusted software that is allowed to bypass the 
security kernel. This paper describes the methods used for the SCOMP 
trusted software.
Trusted software is not kernel software, nor access control. It is 
security relevant, and provides specific functionality and user 
services. It is trusted to control use of privileges (invoke function; 
modify attributes), to isolate high integrity users (added integrity; 
restricts user to class; ensure HI software), and to be functionally 
correct. Examples of trusted software include secure servers, file 
access managers (privilege), audit tools (integrity) and database 
editors and file labellers (correctness).
The automated tools for kernel verification are not suitable as the 
trusted software is designed to violate or extend the normal rules for 
multilevel security. There can be no global policy; the approach taken 
was to use Gypsy, and a procedure was developed to ensure a thorough 
review of the verification evidence for each of the trusted software 
functions. The major problems were the lack of covert channel analysis 
tools for Gypsy, and the abstract nature of the Gypsy top level 
specification which made spec-to-code ('C') correlation difficult and 
subjective.
An appendix lists all the trusted component within the SCOMP system.

Compartmented Mode Workstations: Prototype Highlights. IEEE Trans on

Note: Revised version of IEEE Symposium paper.
The primary goal of MITRE's compartmented mode workstation (CMW) 
project was to articulate the security requirements workstations must 
meet to process highly classified intelligence data.  As a basis for the 
validity of the requirementsdeveloped, a prototype was implemented 
which demonstrated that workstations could meet the requirements in 
an operationally useful manner while still remainng binary compatible 
with the off-the-shelf software.
	The security requirements developed addressed traditional 
security concerns (e.g. as found in Department of Defence Trusted 
Computer Systems Evaluation Criteria) whil also introducing new 
concepts in areas such as labeling and the use of a trusted window 
management system.  The CMW labeling paradigm is based on 
associating two types of security labels with objects: sensitivity 
levels and information labels.  Sensitivity levels describe the levels at 
which objects must be protected.  Information labels are used to 
prevent data overclassification and also provide a mechanism for 
associating with data those marking that are required for accurate data 
labeling, but which play no role in access control decisions.  The use of 
a trusted window manager allows users to easily operate at multiple 
sensitivity levels and provides a convenient mechanism for 
communicating security informaiton users in a relatively unobtrusive 
manner.

Bevier, William R.; Hunt, Warren A. , Jnr.; Young, William D. Toward 
Verified Execution Environments. 1987. 
Current verification technology provides tools for the verification of 
programs written in a high-level language. Even verified high-level 
programs may not satisfy their specifications when executed, due to 
errors in lower-level software and hardware. We discuss an attempt at 
eliminating this problem with the design of an execution environment 
consisting of a compiler, operating system and processor, each of 
which has been mechanically verified.
IEEE Comp. Soc. Proc 1987 Symp. Security and Privacy, pp. 106 - 115
Computational Logic are currently employed on a research programme 
to design a verified execution environment. This paper summarises the 
objectives of the programme and the current work status.
The environment will have three principal components: a compiler for a 
formally-specified subset of Gypsy 2.05 called Micro-Gypsy, an 
operating system and a processor (the FM8501). The intention is to 
specify each component in the Boyer-Moore logic and to mechanically 
check correctness using the Boyer-Moore theorem prover.
The choice of language is motivated by the desire to use the existing 
GVE toolset to develop verified application software - in Micro-Gypsy - 
which can then be compiled and run on the verified environment. The 
authors claim that this strategy allows a much higher degree of 
confidence in correct program execution than is possible with 
conventional designed systems, but that 'our belief in correct program 
execution....depends only on the soundness of our verification tools (the 
Boyer-Moore theorem prover and the correct fabrication of the 
processor'.
The paper discusses the verification of a simple multi-tasking 
operating system. The verification results include isolation of tasks, 
protection of the operating system from tasks, correctness of 
operating system services, and correct termination of the operating 
system.
The operating system runs on the lowest level component, the FM8501 
microprocessor, for which implementation of the instruction set of the 
processor (using combinational and sequential circuits) has been 
mechanically verified.
The verification of the compiler, operating system and processor have 
proceeded independently and, as the authors admit, the task of 
integrating this work is not trivial. Future work will address the 
design of a new verified processor which adds some necessary 
facilities missing from the FM8501.

Bilsby, E. R. Trial Implementation of a Secure Application Using Tenl5. 
1991 Mar 15. 
This report describes how a subset of SERCUS has been implemented 
using Tenl5. SERCUS is a research implementation of a multi-level 
secure workstation based on the SMITE approach and running a 
classified document handling application. SMITE is an approach to the 
construction of secure systems which uses strong typing. Ten15 is an 
algebraically defined, strongly typed abstract machine running on a VAX 
station.
	This work was performed while the author was a Vacation 
Student at RSRE and used the Ten15 Cross Compilation System as it 
existed in Summer 1990.

in: 1990 IEEE Computer Society Symposium on Research in Security and 
Privacy; May 7; Oakland. USA: IEEE; 1990: 41-48. 
Note: This paper discusses peer entity identification in the SP3 
network layer protocol, and suggests a method for peer entity 
identification. The solution suggested solves the problem of mapping 
SP3 users on SP3 provides in a networking environment containing 
intermediate networks and systems.
The paper starts by describing some of the problems involved in peer 
entity identification. It goes on to describe how these problems are 
compounded by the connectionless nature of network layer protocols, 
and the characteristics cryptographic protection. The paper then 
suggests a solution which offers a dynamic method of performing the 
mappings from SP3 User to provider.
The solution involves new network layer protocol procedures which 
work with existing routing procedures. The solution identifies a least 
cost path between the two entities using probe packets. This provides 
advantages such as the dynamic nature of the solutions, however it also 
has disadvantages, for example the probe packets can be used as a 
covert channel.
SP3 is a network layer protocol that has been designed to provide 
security services for network service users.  SP3 services can be 
provided by the system in which the network user resides or by 
Intermediate systems on the path between the network service users.  
This paper assumes that the network service users reside in different 
private internetworks and must traverse a public internetwork to 
communicate.  It is further assumed that SP3 services are being 
provided by Intermediate systems that reside at the internetwork 
boundaries.  The problem is, in this environment, the mapping from SP3 
users to SP3 providers is not simple: multiple SP3 systems can serve 
the same user.  This mapping problem is further compounded by 
characteristics of cryptographic protection and connectionless network 
layer protocols.  This paper discusses the characteristics of the 
mapping of SP3 service users to the set of SP3 service providers.  This 
paper also offers a dynamic method of performing this mapping by 
proposing a new network layer protocol and procedures to work in 
conjunction with inter-routing domain routing procedures.

Birrell, Andrew D. Secure Communication Using Remote Procedure Calls. 
1984 Sep. 
Xerox PARC report CSL-84-2
This paper describes a new protocol for remote procedure call aiming 
to overcome the practical efficiency problems often encountered. The 
protocol is designed to use datagrams, and relies on each client and 
service having a private encryption key known only to the client (or 
service) and the access controller. A client can requests a conversation 
with a service by asking (a local agent of) the access controller using 
this private key.
The protocol proposed is shown to be secure, and has the property that 
only one datagram and reply is required to set up the conversation and 
only one extra datagram and reply (in the RFA and its response) is 
required to fully establish a service connection. Once running there is 
no further message overhead.

D. A Global Authentication Service without Global Trust. 1986 Apr. 
IEEE Comp. Soc. Proc. 1986 Symp. Security and Privacy pp.224-230
The work reported here is the result of an investigation into a global 
naming service for people, machines, organisations and resources. The 
authentication scheme is expected to have a long lifetime, and to cope 
with 10,000 million names, using no centralised resource and no 
universally distributed information.
The usual technique is to have a key distribution centre (KDC) which 
shares a key or password with each principal, and offers evidence of 
authenticity about other principals. The scheme presented in the paper 
extends this standard technique by having a collection of KDCs, pairs of 
which may possess a pairwise shared key. A relative naming structure 
can be used so that any principal can (eventually, if a path exists) be 
authenticated to any other. In practice, what is authenticated is a path 
of KDCs, and what is being trusted is in each node in that path. Access 
control lists contain paths or path patterns, and the system can be 
extended to include symbolic links (aliases).

Grapevine: An Exercise in Distributed Computing. 1982 Apr. 
Xerox PARC report CSL-82-4
Grapevine is a multi-computer system on the Xerox Research Internet. 
It provides facilities for the delivery of digital messages such as 
computer mail; for naming people, machines and services; for 
authenticating people and machines; and for locating services on the 
internet. This paper both to describes the system of distributed and 
replicated 'registration' and 'message' servers itself, and serves as a 
case study of a real application of distributed computing.
An important distinction is drawn between 'distributed services', 
involving multiple computers throughout an internet, and 'replicated 
services' which can be provided equally well by any of several distinct 
computers.
The paper describes the set of services provided by Grapevine, how its 
data and function are divided among computers on the internet, and the 
mechanisms used for functions such as resource location and 
authentication. It considers in detail selected aspects of Grapevine 
that illustrate novel facilities or implementation techniques, or that 
provide insight into the structure of the distributed system. In 
particular it details the algorithms used to manage update of the 
distributed registration data bases, for finding a mailbox site and for 
altering the system's configuration. Finally a summary is given of the 
current state of the system and the lessons learned from it.

two different methods of recording information (logging) and two 
different methods of analyzing information (auditing). From this model 
we draw implications for the design and use of security monitoring 
mechanisms. We then apply the model to security mechanisms for 
statistical databases, monitoring mechanisms for computer systems,

Suppose we have a database of n records each with k fields; we can use 
multivariate galois polynomials so that when doing statistics we can 
work on encrypted data and then decrypt the result in order to find 
mean, variance, etc. The problem is to stop someone who knows how to 
get certain values from using the method to get ways of getting data 
that should be inaccessible. In other words, the galois polynomials have 
to be hidden, but in such a way that getting the information is cheap.
In the question period D. Denning pointed out that a paper by Rivest et 
al. showed how to compromise a system that performed statistics on 
encrypted data where selection by comparison was possible ('av ages of 
those with salary>3K'). Such selection is not possible with this system.

Data management applications that use multilevel
DBMS capabilities have the requirement to read and write
objects at multiple levels within the bounds of a multilevel
transaction. Unfortunately, execution of multilevel
transactions cannot generally meet both secrecy
requirements and the transaction atomicity requirement
used in conventional DBMSs. Aborting or delaying
operations occurring at lower security levels based on the
results of write attempts at higher security levels creates
information flows that violate multilevel security
restrictions. In this paper, we offer a model of multilevel
atomicity that defines varying degrees of atomicity and
recognizes that lower security level operations within a
transaction must be able to commit or abort independently
of higher security level operations. We provide execution
graphs as a tool for analyzing atomicity requirements in
conjunction with internal semantic interdependencies
among the operations of a transaction. and prove rules for
determining the greatest degree of atomicity that can be
attained for a given multilevel transaction. Finally, we
present several alternative transaction management
algorithms that can be used to preserve multilevel
atomicity.

Risk analysis is required by a number of organisations to provide a 
basis for deciding which safeguards to implement to protect 
information systems. A variety of risk analysis techniques and tools 
have been developed. Each technique or tool is based, implictly or 
explicitly, on a conceptual model of risk. In this paper, the high-level 
conceptual model of disclosure  risk for information systems used in 
the Analysis of Networked Systems Security Risks (ANSSR) prototype 
is presented.

If you want real proofs of security - machine checked (not machine 
generated), freely refereeable, comprehensible, integrated crypto-
functionality and proof, preventing corruption as well as compromise, 
supporting sophisticated policies - then the machines must be secured 
at register level. The Secure ADA Target machine is designed to move 
the security-related mechanisms into the actual hardware rather than 
relying on a large amount of trusted software.
To a subject the system appears to be capability-based, with a 
personal Name Space Table (NST) that defines both the objects that can 
currently be accessed and the permitted access. A special coprocessor 
called the Tagged Object Processor (TOP) handles a Global Object Table 
and the subjects' NSTs; when asked to update the NST, it calculates the 
access rights based on the information in the GOT and the current 
security state.
All access by the CPU to the system bus is via a memory map unit and 
the current NST, so the MMU, TOP and GOT form a hardware security 
kernel. The paper describes the TOP in detail, together with the user-
visible TOP operations and the TOP-processor interface.
The whole design is flexible, so though the initial configuration will be 
a secure ADA computer, it should be possible to reconfigure and 
revalidate it for other purposes

In tomorrow's "brilliant" weapons, next-generation avionic computers 
will need to orchestrate the actions of many sub-systems while 
further maintaining the security of sensitive data, the integrity of key 
data and of system behaviour, and often other key properties. 
Maintainance of these properties will help ensure that system 
execution is trustable, conforming to both prescribed policies and 
expected behaviour.
	For traditional security (confidentiality) as required by DoD, the 
policy to be maintained is well understood and essentially application 
independant. Although the weapon environment will surely render 
inadequate much of current security engineering practice and likely 
stress the security technology base, the now familiar, fundamental 
mechanisims of MAC and DAC will still form the foundation of suitable 
multi-level security (MLS) maintenance. For integrity maintenance, 
however, realistic policies are quite application dependant. In general, 
a specific integrity policy needs to comprehend not only certain 
behavioral aspects of the overall application, but also of potentially 
many distinct states within the application. Thus, integrity 
maintenance requires control derived from a state machine specifying

An architecture especially adept at security support is outlined. The 
architecture's fundamental information unit is a 2-tuple, or ordered 
pair, consisting of a datum word and an associated security tag. As an 
atomic information unit, datum and tag move around through the 
architecture in unison as processing proceeds. A security subprocessor 
always operates on a security tag in synchrony with a fairly ordinary 
data subprocessor's operation on the associated datum word. The 
coupled subprocessors provide the overall architecture with efficient, 
multi-level-secure access control and flow control. The proposed 
architecture represents advancement of security technology along a 
unique combination of three fronts; 1) direct hardware support, 2) fine-
grained-to-the-word mediation and 3) optimal (minimal) result 
classification.

An interesting paper that categorises the reasons for auditing, written

possible solutions. That project showed that it is expensive to retrofit 
auditing into an existing operating system (as in KVM-370), and useless 
to put auditing into the back-end (too little information available). The 
proposed solution is to record every keystroke by the user, and also a 
sample of the output; the author admits there are problems with this, 
due to the volume of data and the trust imposed on the system

The specification language Z has been applied by the Distributed 
Computing Software Project to the formal specification of network 
resource managers or 'services'. The use of a formal language gives a 
more precise understanding of the behaviour of a service and is a 
prerequisite for verification of programs which use or implement the 
service. Additionally, the use of Z combined with informal text is 
sufficiently readable for the specification to be used for 
documentation purposes.
An introduction is provided to the style of specification devised for the 
project. A framework for the specification of a variety of network 
services has been developed. The framework is presented, and then 
incorporated into an example illustrating the specification of both the 
user's view and the implementor's view of a simple service. A 
discussion of the experience gained from the specification and use of 
example service is also included.

into a UNIX System. in: 14th National Computer Security Conference; 
1991 Oct; Washington. USA: NIST/NCSC; 1991; 1: pp.338-346. 
Within the last few years the integrity of many computer systems has 
been violated in a variety of ways, the most prevalent of which has 
been via "virus" attacks. These attacks feature software which, either 
intentionally or accidentally, result in a compromise of system 
security and subsequently result in hundreds of thousands of dollars of 
damage in the form of compromised/lost data or computer downtime. 
Currently, most attacks are detected long after the fact. Unfortunately, 
by the time the intrusion is detected, significant damage is done. In the 
case of a virus, it is likely to have spread throughout an entire network 
of computers. With the advent of systems containing additional 
security features such as access control lists, least privilege, and 
mandatory access control, the question arises, do these systems meet 
the challenge of preventing system security violations and containing 
virus programs while still retaining the "look and feel" of a traditional 
UNIX system? This paper focuses on the features added to UNIX System 
V Release 4.1 Enhanced Security (SVR4.1ES) intended to raise the 
overall level of system security to the B2/F-B2 level.

The DoDCSC (now the NCSC) have published a set of evaluation criteria 
for categorising secure systems (the TCSEC); using these criteria, it is 
possible to assign an evaluation class to a computer system.
This paper gives guidelines for deciding whether a system of a given 
class can be used in a particular environment; the factors taken into 
account include the spread classification markings on the system, the 
clearances of the individuals, and whether the system is restricted to 
running trusted application software. This paper formed the basis of 
the NCSC publication known as the 'yellow book'.

Note: This paper presented a design for an email system designed for 
privacy, to be implemented using cryptography and trusted computer 
systems for protection. The paper then discussed the trust residing in 
each part of the design.
	A series of protocols have recently been published to implement a 
protected mail service over networks such as Internet; these protocols 
include key management based on public key cryptography. TIS has 
developed a prototype system, Tmail, to implement these protocols. 
Part of Tmail runs on each users local host, providing local 
crtographic services and local key management. There is also a single 
remote Certification Authority, responsible for generating and signing 
certificates and also generating revoked certificate lists.
Tmail is implemented using the TMach operating system to provide 
separation between its processes and between Tmail and the users 
processes. TMach (Trusted Mach) is a prototype, multilevel, UNIX-
like system, designed to meet B3, and implemented on a Sun by TIS. 
It is based on a kernelised version of the Mach operating system 
originally developed by Carnegie-Mellon University.
The paper describes and analyses each component of Tmail in turn, to 
determine what security functionality it has to provide for the system 
as a whole to provide the requisite confidentiality (mail only to be read 
by the intended recipient), integrity (the ability to detect 
modifications) and source authentication. While based on the TMach 
implementation, the analysis would be equally applicable to similarly-
structured implementations on different systems. A port to UNIX is 
underway.
TMail is a privacy-enhanced electronic mail system on a trusted 
operating system base.  The use of a trusted computing base affords 
protection to cryptographic control processes and nullifies 
vulnerabilities that would exist if the mail system were installed on 
an untrusted base.  This paper describes the TMail cryptographic 
processes that protect the mail in transit from disclosure, detect 
modification and assure source authentication. The trusted operating 
system is used to protect the mail and the cryptographic modules on 
the host system.  The trust requirements for the system are discussed.  
Both aspects of the system, cryptography and trust, are needed to 
assure protection for the mail within the broader system in which it 
exists.

Oct; Washington. USA: NIST/NCSC; 1991; 1: pp.45-58. 
The US Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria, called the TCSEC 
[TCS85] which was first published in 1983 and revised in 1985 has 
become an accepted standard for the evaluation of trusted systems. Not 
only is it used in the US for evaluations by the National Computer 
Security Center (NCSC), it has also been adopted by NATO for the 
evaluation of systems for use in NATO installations. More recently, in 
May 1990, a group of four nations, France, Germany, the Netherlands and 
the United Kingdom produced a first draft of its Information Technology 
Security Evaluation Criteria, called the ITSEC [ITS90]. The ITSEC shows 
clearly that the thinking of the computer security community has been 
heavily influenced by the TCSEC, but the ITSEC also addresses some 
issues in ways that are very different from the TCSEC. A meeting was 
held under the sponsorship of the European Commission in Brussels on 
September 25-26, 1990 at which members of the four nations 
discussed their reactions to comments received since the publication 
of the ITSEC and presented their opinions of changes that should be 
made to the ITSEC. As a method of understanding the ITSEC more 
completely, it was analysed to determine the impact that compliance 
with an F5/E5 rating would have upon a B3 targeted system that is 
under development. This analysis led to a discussion with ITSEC 
authors from both Germany and the United Kingdom that helped to 
clarify many questions concerning specific wording and concepts of the 
ITSEC and its relationship with the TCSEC. It should be noted that the 
views presented here are the authors' and not official statements from 
the various organisations with which they are affiliated.

(Trusted Information Systems Inc.). Access Mediation in a Message 
Passing Kernel. in: 1989 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy; May

Note: This paper discusses the access control performed by the TMach 
kernel. The presentation followed the paper closely.
The TMach prototype is based on a version of the Unix-based Mach 
operating system (from Carnegie-Mellon University) which currently 
implements Mach functionality but not the Mach structures which are 
essential for security. Therefore the prototype only provides a proof 
of concept  a full TMach implementation depends on CMU completing 
Kernelized Mach (expected early 1990).
The Mach kernel is the object manager for the basic abstractions of: 
task (passive execution environment, unit of resource allocation); 
thread (active unit of execution); message (collection of typed data 
items); port (message queue); and paging object (secondary storage). 
Threads within tasks can communicate by message passing, by issuing 
Kernel Interface Commands, or via memory shared with an offspring. 
This paper concentrates on the mediation of message passing. Tasks 
queue and dequeue messages from specific ports, subject to the tasks 
possessing the relevant send or receive access rights to the 
ports. It is claimed that since ports represent the objects, in the 
TCSEC sense, control over the transfer of port access rights implies 
control over information flow.
For MAC, the strategy is to label each port with a single security level, 
and each task with two levels; maximum-write and minimum-read. This 
enables a uniform treatment of trusted and untrusted tasks (the two 
levels of an untrusted task are identical). Messages are tagged with the 
security levels of the sending task; although they are not explicitly 
labelled with a single security level, they could be implicitly 
associated with the security level of the ports via which they are 
transferred. Port access rights are transferred as part of a message, 
and the kernel mediates such transfers at message receive time. The 
security policy is expressed as a set of security invariants, which the 
kernel must ensure are upheld. Mechanisms exist to close the potential 
covert channels arising from ports filling up or being deallocated.
DAC was claimed to be a harder problem for the TMach designers, since 
the underlying Mach kernel does not support user identities. By itself, 
the TMach kernel does not provide full TCSEC DAC, but does provide 
mechanisms which could support a full DAC implementation. The TMach 
kernel associates a user-id with each task. Messages are tagged by the 
sending task with the user-id of the intended recipient, and the kernel 
ensures that the actual recipient has the matching user-id. The DAC 
scheme also includes a system of privileges relating to the transfer of 
access rights.
TMach is not a distributed system; however it is claimed that the 
design does not preclude distribution. There was some confusion in the 
presentation over where MAC and DAC are performed, other than in the 
kernel, and so it is not clear whether this paper completely covered 
access control in TMach. However, within the scope of message-
passing, this seems a sensible approach to access control.

Note: Trusted Mach (TMach) is a B3-targeted distributed Unix-like 
system, being developed by TIS under ARPA sponsorship. It is based on a 
TMach kernel, which supports a number of trusted servers (including a 
name server), above which lies the Unix kernel.
One feature of the system is that all subjects communicate via object-
like ports which are monitored by the kernel, and subjects may be 
granted transmit or receive rights to a port. A formal model of the 
system is being retrospectively produced.

The Chinese Wall Security Policy. in: 1989 IEEE Symposium on Security 
and Privacy; May 1; Oakland, California. USA: IEEE Computer Society; 
1989: 206-207. 
Note: This paper was inspired by the work of Clark and Wilson, and the 
WIPCIS initiative. It describes a commercial confidential policy as 
opposed to a national security policy. The Chinese Wall Security Policy 
is a real commercial policy which can be formally modelled.
All corporate information is stored hierarchically in three levels. At 
the lowest level are individual items of information (cf objects in 
BLP). All objects concerning the same corporation are grouped together 
in a company dataset. At the highest level, all company datasets whose 
corporations are in competition are grouped together in conflict of 
interest classes.
Initially, a user (cf subjects in BLP) has complete freedom of access. 
Once his initial choice has been made a Chinese Wall is created for him 
around the chosen dataset, and any other dataset within the same 
conflict of interest class is deemed to be on the wrong side of the 
wall. The user is still free to access any dataset in a different 
conflict of interest class. Subsequent accesses change the shape of the 
wall to include the new dataset. Thus, the Chinese Wall policy is a 
combination of free choice and MAC. Since not all information is price 
sensitive, and the sensitivity of information can be reduced over time, 
there exists sanitised data which anyone can access.
In the paper, analogies with the Bell-LaPadula (BLP) model are 
considered. In the formal model (see Annex A), two of the axioms are 
analogous to the simple security and *-properties. However, the 
Chinese Wall cannot be correctly represented by BLP. It differs from 
BLP in that it is time dependent and considers past accesses.
This work appears to be a useful paper in commercial computer 
security.

Cartesiana. in: 1990 IEEE Computer Society Symposium on Research in 
Security and Privacy; 1990 May 7; Oakland. USA: IEEE; 1990: 319-332. 
Note: What makes this paper significant is that the program 
verification system described, Cartesiana, is said to be currently in 
use for the development of a provably secure system in a pilot project 
in W. Germany. It is also described as a prototype. The level of 
assurance sought in the pilot project calls for code verification i.e. 
beyond A1, or Q6/Q7 in the FRG quality scale.
The paper is in three parts. The first of these is advocacy for the 
correctness-by-construction approach to program verification, as 
opposed to an after-the-fact verification of a given program. 
Correctness-by-construction is concerned with top-down refinement, 
with at each step a formal justification accompanying the refinement 
step. With program development, the steps may be quite small. 
Textbooks such as Gries, cited by the authors, cover this topic.
The second part of the paper, which is most of it, is a very long and 
detailed treatment of an example of development according to 
correctness by construction. A proof is sketched that pre- and post-
conditions preserve invariants of state (taken as the security-property 
of interest). An algorithmic refinement is undertaken, starting from 
pre- and post-conditions, and at each step transforming the Hoare 
triples to derive proof-obligations from the proof rules of the 
programming language.
The refinement example is presented entirely as a pencil-and-paper 
exercise, with nothing to relate it specifically to Cartesiana. As far as 
I can tell, there seems to be nothing fundamentally new here: these are 
basically the techniques described in, for example, Gries. There is no 
presentation of a rationale as such, for choice of the refinement steps. 
While this may be an example of a development method I am unable to 
tell what the method actually is, other than the need to do after-the-
fact justifications at a fine grain. Moreover, the amount of detail in the 
examples is excessive.
The final part of the paper is a rather short and vague description of 
the Cartesiana tool. The interesting question is whether the tool offers 
any support specifically for the program-construction process (other 
than containing in its rule-base a theory of Hoare triples for the 
programming language). I cannot find any explicit statement in the 
paper to this effect. There is machinery for programmed tactics 
(macros) but this is described as under evolution. The Cartesiana 
tool is generic with regard to programming language, syntax, logic.
No indications are given as to any successful or experimental 
applications of the method or the tool. No references are given to any 
other description of the tool.
Cartesiana is a system to support the construction of software on the 
basis of formal methods.  It is currently being used for the development 
of a provably secure system in a pilot project in the Fed. Republic of 
Germany.  The quality criteria applied go beyond A1 and include program 
level verification.  The Cartesiana approach to meet these criteria 
emphasises constructive techniques: proof rules are used to derive a 
solution in such a way that development and verification are closely 
combined.  Rules and specified formal requirements guide the 
development process.  Some of the methodological aspects are 
illustrated by way of example.  A concise overview over the main 
functionalities of the system is given.

definition tool, which looks like a programming language (but with 
formal back-up), and a text/diagram system design language not 
dissimilar to MASCOT. There is in addition a proof system including 
'tactics' (incomplete proofs), which enable more complex proofs to be 
built up from the six simple rules originally provided; a 'tactic library' 
is now under development.
	The security policy for this project is based on noninterference-
style conditions, and it is expected that by use of McCullough's 
'restrictiveness' (or 'hook-up') property, the target system may be 
designed in small pieces and 'hooked up' without loss of verifiability.

This paper will address the logistics of distributing a smart token on a 
computer system. A smart token is an identification and authentication 
device for a host computer system. This paper will address the 
logistics from four perspectives. The first perspective will discuss 
why the smart token, WATCHWORD Generator was implemented on 
DOCKMASTER. A cost analysis, including procurement of the smart 
token, batteries, man hours, and maintenance is the second perspective. 
The third perspective discusses how the smart token will enhance the 
security of the host computer system. How DOCKMASTER will respond 
when a use is trying to access the system with the WATCHWORD 
Generator implemented is the fourth perspective. With a successful 
method of identifying and authenticating users of the computer system, 
the system is less susceptible to penetration.

This paper describes a software subsystem that can be added to each of 
a set of physically interconnected UNIX or UNIX look-alike systems, so 
as to construct a distributed system which is functionally 
indistinguishable at both the user and the program level from a 
conventional single-processor UNIX system. The techniques used are 
proposed to be applicable to a variety of both local and wide area 
networks, and to enable all issues of inter-processor communication, 
network protocols, etc., to be hidden. It gives a brief account of 
experience with such a distributed system, which was operational on a 
set of PDP11s connected to a Cambridge Ring. The final sections 
compare this scheme to various precursor schemes and discuss its 
potential relevance to other operating systems.

In 1950, on a subject seemingly unrelated to information security, Alan 
Turing proposed a definition of machine intelligence. Turing's idea is 
his well known "Turing Test". In this paper, I will show how the Turing 
Test provides a very simple yet very general characterization of non-
information flow in multilevel information systems. Despite its 
conceptual simplicity, the Turing Test provides the study of 
information flow with an extremely useful notion which seems to be a 
significant departure from other current information flow theories. 
Turing's powerful idea is that information entropy is represented as 
uncertainty about the mathematical definition of a system, rather than 
as some function of the direct behavior of the system.

Computer Security - Awareness, Education, and Performance. in: 14th

NIST/NCSC; 1991; 1: pp.110-119. 
This paper addresses the dual problems of monitoring a contractors's 
performance and providing adequate computer security within the 
Federal government environment. Contractors perform many of the 
government's computer functions, therefore security must be a part of 
their services and products. How does the government know that the 
contractors' are performing the computer security function in an 
acceptable manner, and that they have the proper level of awareness, 
commitment, and skills to provide this security? Guidance for 
determining the contractor's experience, and assuring performance, as 
they relate to computer security, are contained in this paper. The paper 
is intended for use by computer security officers, computer resources 
management and technical staffs, and contracting officers, as well as 
by educators who are responsible for training the government 
personnel. Although the paper is directed toward those individuals 
within the Federal government, most of what is stated would also be of 
value to individuals who are working for a commercial organisation. 
The contents of the paper is based on the author's thirty years of 
experience working as a computer manager, technician, and educator 
within both the Federal government and commercial environments.

security review). The audit determines the adequacy of physical 
security, access to programs and data, and controls to ensure continued 
integrity of the system.
Points to look for during a review are outlined. A description is given 
of the way in which the computer itself can assist the auditor, with 
programs to check data integrity and review or analyse audit trails 
created during normal running. This analysis can be performed while 
the computer is running.

Burns, Rae K. (Kanne Associates, Ashburnham, Ma). Referential Secrecy. 
in: 1990 IEEE Computer Society Symposium on  Research in Security and 
Privacy; 1990 May 7; Oakland. USA: IEEE; 1990: 133-142. 
Note: This paper presents a model of security for an aspect of 
relational databases. It tackles the issue of referential secrecy: the 
analogue of the usual referential integrity. It considers the 
requirements for constraints on relationships between the security 
characteristics of related data.
Attempts to remove covert channels arising from the normal integrity 
constraints of the relational data model (i.e. entity integrity and 
referential integrity) and which retain an operational DBMS result in 
the problems of polyinstantiation, referential ambiguity and 
uncontrolled dangling references. The view is taken that such an 
approach, as in the SeaView model, results in unwarranted 
complication of the semantics of the data model. Automatic 
polyinstantiation is not permitted in this model. However, there is a 
rudimentary mechanism for providing cover values.
The objects in this model are tuples. Referential secrecy requires that 
the security class of a tuple which contains a reference must dominate 
that of the tuple referred to.
Operations are possible which would cause violations of referential 
integrity:
 insertion of a tuple with a foreign key
 deletion of a tuple which is referred to by a foreign key.
Additionally action might be useful on deletion of a tuple with a 
foreign key. In the draft update to SQL choices of resulting action may 
be defined for each foreign key in each relation. These are SET NULL, 
SET DEFAULT and CASCADE.
The operations above which are relevant to referential integrity can 
cause violations of referential secrecy. The paper defines analogous 
actions to be taken as a result of referential secrecy:
 DEFAULT, which rejects an operation if it results in a violation of 
referential secrecy;
 REJECT HIGH, which rejects insertions with references that strictly 
dominate the tuple referred to;
 ACCEPT LOW, which permits dangling references for views at some 
security classes by permitting one tuple to contain a reference to a 
tuple which it does not dominate;
 UPGRADE, where an attempted insertion is upgraded until it satisfies 
the referential secrecy requirements.
REJECT HIGH is not security critical. All the others result in covert 
channels which, in any implementation of this model must be 
monitored. Appropriate actions must be taken as a result, such as 
slowing down the channel or shutting down the DBMS.
The constraints proposed in this paper are readily enforceable by a 
DBMS, but there are some limitations in the protection which may be 
provided, in particular those relating to the values of data.
This is a very practical solution to a difficult problem and forms a 
reasonable compromise between the requirements for freedom from 
covert channels and the semantic problems associated with the 
removal of these covert channels.
This paper presents a referential secrecy model that simplifies 
automatic data classification within a relational database.  The model 
captures the secrecy semantics that reflect the dependencies among 
foreign key references.  These dependencies form the basis for 
specifying classification constraints, without the complexity of rule-
based or view-based mechanisms.  The secrecy semantics are 
expressed within the database schema as parameters to the foreign key 
definitions.  Data classification is a function of the access class labels 
of the foreign key reference tuples, as well as the access class of the 
subject.

IEEE Comp. Soc. Proc. 1986 Symp. Security and Privacy pp.182-186
The paper describes a machine being developed by Sytek for guard 
applications, being a small special-purpose device that can be added to 
an existing system to provide a physically isolated security 
mechanism.
Separate buses ensure that a slave domain (protected environment in 
which a process executes) cannot communicate directly with other 
domains; an interdomain communication board (ICB) connects slave 
busses to a master bus, through which interdomain traffic is possible 
subject to the control of the master domain. The core software running 
in privileged mode in the master domain controls the ICB; this software 
(in ROM), the master domain hardware and the ICBs together form a 
reference monitor, with the security policy controlled by application 
software in the master domain.
The paper ends with a brief discussion of the verification 
considerations relevant to such a stand-alone device.

Note: This paper discusses various issues raised in the design phase for 
a distributed secure operating system that is intended to run on a 
variety of hosts and over a variety of network types.
The operating system, SDOS, is based on the object-oriented Cronus 
system, where an object is an instance of an abstract data type, and 
the operations on it are supported by the object manager for that type. 
In theory, the security policy of the system is the security policy of 
the various abstract data types, but the authors see difficulties where 
the users can add their own type definitions. Consequently, they have 
split the policy into two parts, one covering message passing and the 
other concerning information flow within each system component.
The inter-component message passing rules are simple: each system 
component has a clearance, and is constrained to send and receive 
messages within its clearance. For the information flow within a 
component with a multiclass clearance, the McCullough hookup-secure 
information flow policy is used, and a component is called restrictive 
if it has this property. It is not stated as such, but the message-
passing rules would appear to be intended to provide the environment 
within which the restrictive property is composable.
As part of the SDOS project, it was proven that the restrictive property 
was implied by a combination of the (non-composable) weak-
noninterference property and 'various other simple properties'. A 
technique was developed to prove, using Gypsy, that a design had these 
properties and so was restrictive.
The problem of covert channels is briefly discussed, and they are 
categorised into two types - those that are inherent in the design of 
the operating system, and those that arise through the use of an 
untrusted medium; in the latter case, reference is made to 'someone 
called Girling' who was misquoted as showing it was impossible to 
decrease the bandwidth of such channels without similarly degrading 
the useful bandwidth.
Discusses some issues in distributed system security, in the context of 
the design of a secure distributed operating system.  The design is 
targeted for an A1 rating.  Some new developments in formal 
verification methods are reported.  Distributed system security is 
contrasted with single-host and network security, and described in the 
context of the TNI.  Problems unique to distributed system security are 
discussed.  An argument is made for implementing security features in 
higher layers, corresponding rougly to the session through application 
layers of the OSI model.  A new security policy, based on message-
passing rather than reads and writes, is described.  The SDOS design is 
summarized.

A document retrieval system is a specific type of distributed 
processing which has its own particular security requirements. This 
paper proposes a model for secure delivery of documents and describes 
a prototype system, based on earlier work on secure electronic mail 
and automated document delivery systems, being developed at 
University College London. In the proposed architecture, security 
protection is provided for document requests and the actual documents 
delivered. E-mail protocols are used for document requests and 
delivery, although file transfer protocols could be used in some 
circumstances. The paper begins with a discussion of the document 
delivery system background and then sets out the client-server model 
for the secure system. The security philosophy, requirements, policy, 
and techniques are dealt with next. The criterion for validation is 
analyzed; the relationship to OSI is shown; implementation issues are 
discussed and the direction of future efforts is pointed out.

Chalmers, Leslie S. An Analysis of the Differences Between the 
computer Security Practices in the Military and Private Sectors. 1986 
Apr. 
IEEE Comp. Soc. Proc. 1986 Symp. Security and Privacy pp.71-77
This paper describes the differences in philosophy between the 
treatment of information in industry and by the military, and the ways 
these differences affect the requirements and practices of the two 
sectors.
The private sector philosophy is that information is an asset, to be 
protected against disclosure, modification or destruction to a level 
commensurate with its value. It can be assumed that any attacker will 
also be working to economic rules, and will not want to get information 
at any cost. Assets can usually be given a cash value, which will 
determine the degree of protection required, and the 'bottom line' 
philosophy rules - if it doesn't further the goal of making money, don't 
do it. Also unauthorised reading of information is often not considered 
as significant as unauthorised modification.
In both sectors, the major security risk is insiders working within 
their authorisation, where the presence or absence of a provably secure 
computing base is irrelevant. The major common interests are fourfold: 
the need for authentication of people, the need for audit trails, the need 
to monitor the behaviour of those in employment, and the need for 
security to be cost effective. It is concluded that research and 
developments in these fields would be of significant benefit to both 
sectors.

The purpose of the study is to identify and model internal controls of 
Automated Teller Machine (ATM) systems used by the banking industry. 
A reliability model of internal controls of ATM systems using series, 
parallel, and simple structures is presented. Control items and 
relationships are justified based on the engineering, computer, and 
auditing literatures. Use and limitations of this model are also 
discussed. An ATM case with fixed controls and a related questionnaire 
has been developed. A computerized decision aid programmed in the PC 
BASIC language for assisting design and evaluation of the ATM internal 
control system has been developed and evaluated. To evaluate the 
modeling  effectiveness, a small group of graduate students in the EDP 
Auditing master program uses the decision aid to evaluate the ATM 
case by filling out the questionnaire. Computed values are compared 
with the user-assigned values to examine differences between model 
results and human judgments.

This paper reviews some of the available methodologies for producing 
code that can be verified to obey certain properties. It concentrates on 
four systems: HDM from SRI (SPECIAL, MLS), FDM from SDC (Ina Jo, ITP), 
Gypsy from the University of Texas, and AFFIRM from ISI (XIVUS, DTV). 
Each of these is described in detail by someone who has actually tried 
to use it, and at the end is a comparison and some general conclusions 
(such as the fact that all of them require an expert user).

Note: This paper proposes a modelling scheme suitable for dealing with 
heterogeneous distributed systems in which the differing operating 
systems implement the same policies. This is done using a system of 
'subject domains' in which each subject has the same clearance. These 
subject domains may consist of subjects running on more than one 
machine.
The paper appears well-considered and may be worthy of more detailed 
investigation.

On the Formal Specification and Verification of a Multiparty Session 
Protocol. in: 1990 IEEE Computer Society Symposium on Research in 
Security and Privacy; 1990 May 7; Oakland. USA: IEEE; 1990: 216-233. 
Note: This paper describes a student project undertaken at the 
University of Maryland. In order to be undertaken in a limited 
timescale, a small but realistic security problem was selected, and 
then a high-assurance solution was attempted. 
The chosen problem area was the formal specification of a multiparty 
session protocol, the production of a security model, and the 
demonstration that the protocol satisfies the model even in the 
presence of intruders. A multiparty session is characterised by the fact 
that a number of processes come together and perform some action on a 
shared system state before resuming independent existence; intruders 
can be modelled by extra processes listening in to messages and 
perhaps supressing some and/or inserting their own. 
The paper starts by defining multipary sessions and introducing a 
security policy. A model of this policy is then given, taking just over 1 
page in the Proceedings, and explained. The paper then goes on to 
present the FTLS of the multiparty session protocol and its associated 
key-distribution protocol, and to demonstrate how the FTLS can be 
machine-proven to be conformant with the security model. The paper is 
hard-going, but is likely to be worthwhile reading - even if just as an 
existence proof -for anyone who is going to have to produce a formally-
specified and verified system.
In this paper we present the formal specification and verification of 
the multiparty session protocol discussed in (CG88).  The notion of 
intruder processes is introduced to model intruder actions and counter-
measures of the trusted computing bases.  We argue that multilevel 
network security can be achieved and verified formally independent of 
the specific transport-layer protocols even in the presence of intruders 
through the use of (1) a multilevel secure session protocol and (2) a 
key-distribution protocol which helps establish message 
confidentiality and integrity across an untrusted network.  Both the 
formal security-policy model and the formal top-level specification 
(FTLS) of the multiparty session protocol are written in Ina Jo [SH89].  
The inference rules of the logic of authentication [BAN89] are 
incorporated in Ina Jo transforms to demonstrate the correctness of 
the key-distribution protocol.  Two detailed examples of formal proofs 
are included.

Clark, David D.; Wilson, David R. A Comparison of Commercial and 
Military Computer Security Policies. 1987 Apr 28. 
Most discussions on computer security focus on disclosure. In 
particular, the U.S. Department of Defence has developed a set of 
criteria for computer mechanisms to provide control of classified 
information. However, for that core of data processing concerned with 
business operation and the control of assets, the primary security 
concern is data integrity. This paper presents a policy for data 
integrity based on commercial data processing practices, and compares 
the mechanisms needed for this policy with the mechanisms needed to 
enforce the lattice model of information security. We argue that a 
lattice model is not sufficient to characterise integrity policies, and 
that distinct mechanisms are needed to control disclosure and to 
provide integrity.
Proc. 1987 IEEE Symp. on Security and Privacy, pp. 184-193
This paper compares the well-known concerns of military computer 
security, protection against disclosure of sensitive information, with 
the concerns of commercial security. The commercial world is 
concerned with security against fraud and error, and thus with data 
integrity.
The mechanisms used to provide security in the commercial world are 
quite different from those of military security. The two principal 
mechanisms are:
 the well-formed transaction (for example, in double-entry book-
keeping every entry in one account must be balanced by an entry in 
another); and,
 separation of duty (that the person who authorises a transaction and 
the person who executes it must be distinct - collusion is then needed 
to breach security).
A model for integrity is developed, with nine rules, which is shown to 
be superior to the Biba model (inverse Bell & LaPadula) or the lattice 
model of Lipner at expressing these particular requirements. The 
central doctrine is the need to control three things together: which 
user uses which program on which data.
Recommendations are made that for better security for industry, 
systems must provide:
 better user authentication,
 segregation of duties within the security-officer function, and
 better capabilities to govern execution of programs and transactions.
In the long term, this could be the most influential single paper of the 
conference.

Prevention of infection by computer virus can only be guaranteed by 
limiting information sharing or functionality.  This paper examines 
complexity-based virus detection mechanisms which detect 
modifications and prevent secondary infections.  The philosophical 
issues involved in providing protection against viruses are discussed 
and the structure of dependencies within an information system is 
considered.  A mathematical model of change control within a trusted 
computer system is described and features of the mechanisms used 
identified.  An alternative to dependency relations is proposed.  
Implementations for untrusted systems are outlined and the optimality 
of the mechanisms employed considered.  The role of the environment in 
viral protection, practical limits of the techniques proposed and 
practical implementations of the systems are discussed.

In a multilevel secure database management system (MLS/DBMS), users 
cleared at different security levels access and share a database 
consisting of data at different sensitivity levels. A powerful and 
dynamic approach to assigning sensitivity levels (also called security 
levels) to data is one which utilizes security constraints or 
classification rules. Security constraints provide an effective and 
versatile classification policy. They can be used to assign security 
levels to the data depending on the content, context, and time. In this 
paper, we argue that security constraints are a special form of 
integrity constraints enforced in a MLS/DBMS. As such, they can be 
handled during query processing, during database updates, or during 
database design. We then describe in detail the design and 
implementation of a secure update processor which handles security 
constraints in a multilevel secure database management system.

to provide a capability for the formal verification of Ada programs by 
stages; the initial aim (now complete) is to provide verification of 
Core Ada, which consists of basic statements and types, and simple 
I/O). More complicated features of the Ada language are expected to be 
added in later stages of the project.
	The 'state deltas' forming the semantic basis of SDVS are 
generated by a translator consisting of a translator consisting of a 
parser and two semantic phases, all implemented in Common Lisp (with 
lazy evaluation). Strong types are chosen and implemented, and scoping 
is implemented by prefixes.

Software Engineering Approach to Designing Trustworthy Software. in: 
1989 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy; May 1; Oakland, 
California. USA: IEEE Computer Society; 1989: 148-156. 
Note: This paper presents, with the aid of a scaled-down example, the 
specification strategy employed in the Secure Military Message System 
project. The emphasis is on using attempted proofs of security to guide 
the writing of module specifications, and providing exemplary 
documentation to assist the designers and programmers.
The security model  the most abstract view of the system  is 
claimed to be application-based, in that the designers found out 
what the problem was first, and then constructed the model. Intuitive 
understanding of what security meant was formalised by 
considering the application domain. The example model is a non-
deterministic state machine, with classified entities which may 
contain each other. The definition of security in this model is a 
predicate on the histories of the system.
The next stage in the methodology is the decomposition of the system 
into modules. Each module specification consists of several documents, 
including an Access Program Table, which gives details of the 
modules interface as a reference for programmers. The semantics of 
the calls (and their exceptions) are in English for most modules, but 
have been formalised for the Entity Module.
Module specifications must be interpreted in the language of the 
security model. Only the Entity Module has a formal interpretation of 
this sort, in which the module is interpreted as a complete system, 
although the formal interpretation used could be applied to other 
modules. There is no discussion of why each individual module needs 
the security properties of the whole system, of how modules are 
composed, or of why composition should preserve security.
The security of a module specification is defined to be the security of 
the interpretation of the module specification in terms of the abstract 
security model. This proof of security is reduced to showing that a 
security invariant is preserved by each call to the module; the security 
invariant must be shown to imply the weakest precondition of the call, 
with respect to the invariant as postcondition. This is a weak link in 
the methodology  the weakest preconditions used are informally 
derived (and sometimes not even equivalent to the call semantics), 
which could be dangerous in more complex specifications. Inspection of 
why preliminary proofs fail guides the improvement of the module 
specifications  the process iterates until the proof of security 
succeeds. Proofs were performed by hand.
Overall, this methodology aims to obtain benefits quickly by using a 
semi-formal approach, rather than use a high-cost, fully rigorous 
methodology. (In practice, subtle design flaws were uncovered by the 
failure of semi-formal proofs). Unfortunately, there are many crucial 
steps whose soundness is not built in to the methodology, but must be 
checked by hand for every application. Also, only two levels of 
abstraction are catered for (model and specification), which would 
limit the applicability of the approach. However, this paper details 
some very useful experience, gained the hard way over a long period of 
time, and could in principle form the basis of a rigorous, machine-
supported development methodology.

Note: This paper takes a paper microprocessor - the FM8501 - and 
verifies the correspondence between the machine code and the 
microcode. The machine was originally designed by Hunt to demonstrate 
the use of Boyer-Moore in microprocessor verification. This work uses 
an alternative proof system, the State Delta Verification System, to 
repeat Hunt's work and show equivalence between the two methods.
The main conclusion is that verification of paper machines is possible 
today, but that further work is required to address real systems. This 
unsurprising result is in line with that for verification systems 
outside the specialised field of microprocessor verification.
It is worth noting that some work on specifying real microprocessor 
instructions sets in Z has been done in the UK and the precondition / 
environment / postcondition style used here has its similarities to Z.
The FM8501 microprocessor was defined and verified by Hunt in 1985 
using the Boyer-Moore theorem prover.   A reverification of the same 
machine using the State Delta Verification System has been carried 
out.  This work correlates strongly with work done by Hunt, 
demonstrating that the verification community is capable of supporting 
its own results, drawing on the diversification of proof tools to 
provide independent validation of previous work.  The proof strategies 
and the complexities that are encountered in proving correctness of 
microcoded processors are discussed.

Virus Filter. in: 1989 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy; May 1; 
Oakland, California. USA: IEEE Computer Society Department; 1989: 
319-324. 
Note: This paper is a proposal for experimental work to determine the 
feasibility of a virus (and Trojan Horse) filter program. A virus filter 
is defined as an analysis program that is capable of sorting clearly 
OK programs from not clearly OK.
The approach being considered is the formulation of a limited 
specification (restriction) for programs which details the 
modifications that it can potentially make both to external objects and 
to itself by dynamic code generation. Furthermore, the policy of the 
system with respect to such modifications is to be formulated and 
applied to each program in conjunction with the program-dependent 
restrictions.
The intention is to be safe with respect to virus detection, the 
almost inevitable price being paid is that some programs which are 
actually OK would be rejected by the filter. The filter is also intended 
to be used in a normal system environment such as MS/DOS or UNIX.
The method proposed rests on three stated hypotheses:
 that the majority of useful programs are amenable to the formulation 
of syntactically simple hypotheses;
 on average, benign programs are simply analysable;
 modifications are classifiable into ordinary and suspicious 
categories.
It is hoped that the experimentation with the above-named operating 
systems will determine the viability of the first and last of these 
hypotheses. On the face of it, the second hypothesis appears reasonable 
as it stands.
The approach shows some promise and the results of the investigation 
may well be worth following.

The vast range of security levels/compartments, complex ownership, 
continuous evolution, adaptive policy requirements, and large size of 
battle management systems (BMS) make it evident that the trust issues 
are substantial and will require extensive attention throughout the 
development cycle. This paper outlines the software development 
process and identifies where trusted system development requirements 
fit into the process. The main contribution of the paper is the 
identification and discussion of eight leverage points that cut across 
the entire development process and provide the greatest opportunity to 
affect the security of the software that is developed.

The SRI Verification System is an interactive system for the 
composition and analysis of formal specifications and abstract 
programs.  Until something better is agreed on the system is known as 
'Enhanced HDM' and its specification language as 'Revised Special'.  This 
document concentrates on the verification system - it tells you what 
facilities are available and how to invoke them.  It also explains some 
of the theory behind the theorem prover provided in the system since 
this information is not readily available elsewhere.  The companion 
document describing the Revised SPECIAL specification language in 
detail is an essential adjunct to this one.

Note: EHDM is a specification and verification environment which is 
hierarchical both in terms of modules and in terms of abstraction. It 
consists of a specification language (largely based on typed first-order 
predicate calculus, but also including elements of richer logics such as 
higher-order logic, lambda calculus and Hoare logic), and an 
environmental tool-kit including a theorem prover supporting both 
automated and interactive proof techniques, and a 'multilevel security 
tool', which analyses specifications for compliance with a (non-
interference-style) multilevel security model. It does not provide or 
support a programming language, but instead offers procedural 
constructs at a level of detail similar to that found in Ada or Pascal; 
within the environment there is a tool to translate imperative code-
level specifications from EHDM into executable Ada code. It is expected 
that the formal semantics of the EHDM specification language, and a 
rigorous description of the operations implemented in the EHDM 
environment, will be completed in 1989.

The VIPER 32-bit microprocessor has been invented at the UK Royal 
Signals and Radar Establishment (RSRE) for use in highly safety-
critical military and civil systems. Throughout, formal mathematical 
methods have been used to prove that the gate-level realisations 
conform to a top-level specification. The paper explains the various 
layers of documentation produced, starting with the use of LCF-LSM 
(based on Meta-Language, ML) at the higher levels, proceeding via the 
use of ELLA hardware description language at lower levels, to multiple 
VLSI implementations . It is intended to show that this route for 
designing synchronous VLSI circuits promises a practical means for 
industry to produce validated designs.  Referenced in: Leonard, Timothy

Results through Prototyping. 1987. 
It has been recognised that available workstations could significantly 
enhance the capabilities of today's Intelligence Data Handling Systems 
(IDHS) if they could be integrated with the IDHS systems in a secure 
manner. The Compartmented Mode Workstation (CMW) project was 
started to further the state-of-the-art of computer security in general 
and workstation security in particular. The prototype effort had two 
major purposes: to demonstrate that operationally useful 
implementations of each requirement could be designed and developed, 
and to gain insight into what measures could be taken to augment 
commercially available workstations with meaningful security.
This paper describes compartmented mode operation, how the prototype 
satisfied each requirement, and the level of effort involved in the 
prototype implementation.
IEEE Comp. Soc. Proc 1987 Symp. Security and Privacy, pp. 2 - 12
This is an account of modifications required to a workstation software 
and firmware, to provide a form of mandatory access control which 
supports 'compartmented mode' working while allowing off-the-shelf 
application software to be used.
Unfortunately, a full description of compartmented mode security is 
not given in the paper, despite the authors' insistence that the reader 
must understand exactly what is meant by CM operation. Doubtless a 
complete description is available through the referenced official 
sources.
From the presentation (not the paper) it was gathered that CM operation 
implies:
 one or more multilevel secure hosts storing a wide variety of 
classified information
 workstations each dedicated to a particular security compartment, 
and within that offering multilevel security/mandatory access control. 
Users permitted to log on only at specific workstations
 a CM net which permits one-way flow of information from host to 
workstation, filtered according to compartment of workstation.
Data is prepared on the workstation and released from the workstation.
The bulk of the paper describes changes to Unix for security and the 
privilege system.

In reasoning about policy based on information flow
control, we can adopt two different points of view de-
pending on whether we deal with explicit permissions
or explicit prohibitions. In both cases, we use an epistemic
and deontic logic to formally define information
a subject is permitted to know. Then, we show
how the causality property [2] can be derived from the
explicit permissions point of view and how the non-
interference [5] and non-deducibility [11] properties
can be derived from the explicit prohibition point of
view. However, we argue that the prohibitions enforced
by non-interference or non-deducibility are generally
too rigid and leads to too strong security properties.
On the other hand, the causality property only han-
dles internal information flow controls and it must be
completed to ensure that the security policy is consis-
tently defined. Hence, the consistency problem is dis-
cussed; we propose a general definition and practical
conditions to verify that a security policy is consistent.
We think that the policy consistency problem is closely
related to the so-called inference problem in multilevel
databases.

Cuppens, F.; Yazdanian, K. (ONERA-CERT). A "Natural" Decomposition of 
Multi-Level Relations. in: 1992 IEEE Symposium on Research in Security 
and Privacy; 1992 May 4; Oakland, California. USA: IEEE Computer 
Society Press; 1992: pp. 273. 
In this paper, we show that the analysis of functional dependencies is 
very useful when we want to decompose a multi-level relation in a 
collection of single-level relations. We study the decomposition of a 
multi-level relation into a collection of 4NF relations according to 
various functional dependencies. These decompositions are compared to 
the decomposition algorithms in single-level relations proposed by 
SeaView) and by Jajodia-Sandhu. It appears that the first step of these 
decomposition algorithms is simply the normalization of the multi-
level relation in 3NF (or in 4NF). Then, we propose an analysis of 
functional dependencies which seems natural from a semantical point 
of view. We decompose a multi-level relation into 4NF relations 
according to these functional dependencies and we should then how to 
decompose these relations into single-level relations. We think that 
this analysis provides a good solution to the polyinstantiation problem 
and that it would lead to correct definitions of update operations.

Currie, I. F. NewSpeak: an Unexceptional Language. 1986 Jul. 
Software Engineering Journal
NewSpeak is a language designed for use in safety-critical programs. It 
tries to limit the freedom of the programmer to the kind of ideas in 
programming that are reasonably easy to formalise without making 
these restrictions unduly onerous. Its principal characteristic is that it 
has no exceptional values or states. Incorrect constructions which 
would lead to exceptional behaviour such as range violations or 
numerical overflow, are all dealt with at compile time. Initially 
intended for use on the VIPER processor but it is not limited to the 
VIPER.

Correctness Using the State Delta Verification System (SDVS). 11th 
NCSC; 1988 Oct 17; Baltimore. USA: NBS/NCSC`: pp.156-161. 
Note: This paper describes the mappings between the various stages of 
product development (from requirements to hardware via software) in 
terms of translations of both into state deltas, using the State Delta 
Verification System (SDVS). The necessary conditions are that the 
mappings between the various stages are sets of ordered pairs of 
models; in each pair, the time-line of the upper-level model is a subset 
of the time-line of the lower-level model; and for a given mapping, two 
predicates correspond at their respective levels if and only if for all 
implementations, the lower-level predicate in the lower-level model 
implies the upper-level predicate in the upper-level model. It is also 
necessary for the time-lines to correspond and (in the SDVS system as 
it stands) for the upper-level predicate to be expressible in the lower-
level logic.

This paper presents an overview of the initial application of a risk-
driven reasoning-based development paradigm to a trusted X Window 
system prototype on Trusted Mach. The goal of the prototype is to 
evolve to a system that, after refinements, will be certifiable at a B3 
level of trust. The paper provides a snapshot of current research work 
in progress. It focuses on tailoring of the development paradigm based 
on the risk identification and mitigation performed early on the 
project. Actual project results in terms of the major risk mitigation 
activities of the first two spirals are presented. The difficult issues 
involved in stretching trusted system technology on several fronts 
(complex system application, new development approach, and lack of 
TCSEC interpretation for windowing systems) are stressed. The paper 
concludes with some general observations and initial lessons learned 
about our application of the development paradigm.

IS31-484-101/207. 
Infosafe Corporation, Formerly A-O Electronics, manufactures a family 
of microcomputer encryption and access control products called X-Lock.  
All products in the X-Lock family protect information stored on IBM and 
compatible microcomputers by limiting access to the computer's hard 
disk and encryption of sensitive information.
The X-Lock 10 is Infosafe's entry-level product, offering the buyer of 
security of hardware-based start protection without requiring the 
purchase of features that may not be required.  The X-Lock 10's modular 
design permits the buyer to purchase directory control, Data Encryption 
Standard (DES) encryption, program authentication, and audit trail 
capabilities.  X-Lock 10's strengths lie in its hardware-based 
protection, familiar user interface, and virus protection capabilities; 
however, its other capabilities are those of a more basic security 
product.
In addition to competing with the X-Lock 50 and 100 products produced 
by InfoSafe, X-Lock10 competes with established products such as 
Watchdog from Fischer International, OnGuard from United Software 
Security, and Protec from Sophco, Inc.
InfoSafe was originally established as A-O Electronics in 1985 to 
manufacture custom voice communications encryption devices.  A shift 
in the company's emphasis to personal computer data security products 
resulted in a name change to InfoSafe Corporation in 1988.

vendors' awareness of the importance of design documentation to the 
security of their system throughout the system life cycle.  Second, the 
report forms an initial basis of understanding between the vendor and 
evaluator communities concerning what is expected by the evaluation 
team in the review process and deliverables for design documentation.

rating (September 1985). Multics runs on a special version of a 
Honeywell 36-bit mainframe, scheduled to be phased out in 1988. 
Multics has three independent mechanisms: a seven-layer hardware 
'ring' to protect the operating system and user subsystems from user 
modification; an ACL system to provide discretionary security; and an 
Access Isolation Mechanism (AIM) for non-discretionary security. The 
latter two are software managed but hardware checked, via 
capabilities, thus providing assurance and efficiency.

1; Oakland, California. USA: IEEE Computer Society; 1989: 312-318. 
Note: Throughout this paper a strong analogy was drawn between the 
problems facing software vendors and their clients and the problems 
facing the pharmaceuticals industry and consumers in the current 
climate of increasing consumer terrorism. The latter attempts to 
counter the possibility of unauthorised modification of the product via 
the use of tamper-resistant packaging.
The basic assumption is that the software is produced in a clean 
environment, and the problem tackled is that of unauthorised 
modification post-release. The method used is essentially that of 
appending a signature to the product the authenticity of which is 
enforced by cryptographic sealing using a public key cryptosystem. 
Furthermore the software is to be protected while in the users 
environments against modification and backtrack attacks.
It is recommended that although the vendors authentication device 
can be in software, the security-conscious user should employ a stand-
alone hardware authenticator to avoid the problems associated with 
the necessary protocols involved with using a software authenticator. 
It seems that special architectural support in the users system may 
be necessary. It is also recommended that authentication be possible 
while a program is executing since swapped-out processes are 
vulnerable to virus infection while they are in memory. This involves 
signatures being placed in the software at the block or even instruction 
level. This may require changes to the user systems memory manager, 
for example.
It is also possible that a stand-alone authenticator could check the 
operating system itself at random times.

This is a comprehensive, easy to read practical guide to many aspects 
of computer networks from the concept of packet switching to the

It covers the common protocol issues, such as routing, flow control and 
congestion avoidance, and packet broadcast systems in separate 
chapters, leaving high level protocols (the OSI transport layer and

ARPANET and other established sources of experience with little 
reference to the, more abstract, work that ISO has done.
The chapter on communication protocols gives an insight into their 
implementation and design. It deals with X.25 and its supporting layers 
(HDLC in particular) which it considers in detail. Indeed, in general, 
everything mentioned in the book is given a comprehensive exposition.
There is a brief but informative chapter on message authentication and 
the book concludes with one about network optimization. The lists of

This book looks at data security using cryptology; it does not go into 
topics such as access control. The book starts by giving a quick look at 
various historic encipherment methods such as the Vigenere cipher and 
the Enigma machine. The DES algorithm is described in detail, not just 
the mechanics but the history, its security, and various 
implementations. Various one-way and 'authenticator' ciphers are 
discussed. A interesting chapter on key distribution describes key 
generation, a session key distribution protocol, and the IBM key 
management scheme for file security. The chapter on user 
identification describes in detail and assesses many of the currently 
employed techniques. Other chapters cover Public Key systems 
(including RSA), digital signatures and EFT (including SWIFT and the use 
of smart cards).

Computer Viruses. in: 4th Aerospace Computer Security Applications 
Conference; Dec 12; Orlando, Florida. USA: IEEE: pp.7-11. 
Note: This paper characterises two different forms of virus:
 The 'patch' approach, in which a jump instruction is patched into the 
code, and additional code is appended to the original, to perform the 
viral action. These viruses may preserve the original functionality of 
the code, and so may escape immediate detection, but they can be 
detected by changes in the length of the executable file.
 The 'overwrite' approach, in which a section, or all of an executable 
is overwritten by some viral code which may or may not destroy the 
original functionality. These may be combatted by keeping tables of 
checksums.
The speaker proposes that, to maintain the integrity of a networked 
filestore, it may be necessary to dedicate a workstation on the network 
to repeatedly checking the network filestore for viral infection, using 
known good checksums. The paper gives a number of examples of 
program code suitable for performing this form of check
The presentation appeared to be not inspired, but competent.

Network users may be authenticated by different means and from a 
variety of locations. Once authenticated, the user's access should be 
consistent with the strength of the authentication. This paper examines 
one possible method for determining the authentication strength and 
conveying this information within a distributed network. The approach 
discussed uses a token composed of a unique user ID and an 
authentication level. The token is sent along with the request for 
establishing a remote session. Once the token is received, the remote 
location determines user access based solely on the authentication 
token.

This paper boils down much of the existing virus research into a 
succinct set of inference rules. These rules are then expanded to 
include the newer self encrypting stealth viruses along with the 
necessary conditions for their detection. This foundation is then

This paper describes a software program used for identifying the

application, "Auditor's Aid", allows an auditor to automatically identify 
what programs (and versions) reside on a given system. The approach 
discussed generates a checksum and uses this value as a primary key

As computer science advances at a prodigious rate, its application in 
many fields is introducing sweeping change at a similar rate. A 
significant issue generated by this phenomenon is the security of 
information in digital form. This issue is concerned not only with 
military security but also with the protection of sensitive, 
unclassified industrial information. This paper focuses on the latter 
type of data protection. It suggests common descriptors of data 
protection and information security applicable to security of digital 
information which is entitled Electronic Information Security 
(ELINFOSEC).

in Multilevel Database Systems. 1985. 
SRI International, Menlo Park CA
IEEE Comp. Soc. Proc. 1985 Symp. Security and Privacy pp.134-146
The security of Multilevel database systems is threatened in a number 
of ways. In previous work Denning showed how trusted filters and 
cryptographic sealing can be used to prevent some of these threats. In 
this paper she shows how a commutative filter can be used to stop 
leakage via inference and Trojan horse. The filter can be applied to the 
database so that the DBMS only acts on an authorised view, or it can be 
applied with the same effect to the results returned by the DBMS in 
response to queries. This means that the DBMS can perform the query 
selections, query optimisation and (some) projections, reducing the 
work required by the trusted filter

encryption schemes (including DES and RSA), and then giving ways in 
which encryption can be used in computer systems such as signatures, 
logon protocols and key distribution. The second half of the book is 
concerned with access controls, information flow and inference, and 
describes many of the problems in this area. A detailed treatment of a

Denning, Dorothy E. An Intrusion-Detection Model. 1986 Apr. 
IEEE Comp. Soc. Proc. 1986 Symp. Security and Privacy pp.118-133
The paper presents a draft model for IDES, an Intrusion Detection 
Expert System, which is based on the premise that to expolit 
weaknesses the system has to be used in an 'abnormal' way, and, if all 
actions were monitored , an expert system could detect this 
abnormality.
The expert system consists of an audit analyser which is driven from a 
database of rules;  audit event records are processed using pattern-
matching techniques, and then compared against activity profiles 
stored for each user. Anomalous events which cannot be handled by the 
rules are passed up to a human authority. This gives a useful 
combination of automatic and manual control.
It appears that the code can be implemented in a system independent 
way, dependencies being confined to the rule database. Also, if the 
rules are expressed in a system independent way, there is a possibility 
of exchange of rule information between different systems, thus 
placing less reliance on the skill of site security officers to formulate 
rules.
The major question is whether the rules can be set so as to avoid major 
loopholes while keeping a reasonably low rate of events passed up to 
the human controller. At present (1986), the work is purely theoretical.

Denning, Dorothy E. A lattice model of secure information flow. 1976 
May. 
CACM 19(5) pp.236-243
This paper presents a formal security model based on information flow. 
Information flow models are concerned with the flow of data between 
objects, either directly, or indirectly by derivation. Both the objects 
and the subject, the active agent responsible for data flow, have a 
security class associated with them.
Denning shows that valid information flow can be used as the ordering 
relation on the set of security classes and that under this relation the 
security classes form a lattice. Hence maintaining secure information 
flow in the system corresponds to ensuring that actual information 
flows conform to the lattice.
Denning states that the main problem with guaranteeing security is in 
detecting the information flows, especially implicit flow, when the 
information in one object is used to derive the information to be 
transferred to a second object. The paper presents a set of conditions 
under which a sequence of statements causing both implicit and 
explicit flows are secure.

1981 Apr. 
IEEE Comp. Soc. Proc. 1981 Symp. Security and Privacy
Denning looks at the problem of allowing statistical queries of a 
database while avoiding compromise of data on individuals. A basic 
technique is to reject queries revealing information about small 
groups; Denning extends Freidman and Hoffman's idea of implied 
queries, but shows that the work required increases exponentially with 
query order (number of attributes concerned), and so we have to fall 
back on Beck's data perturbation scheme or Denning's Random Sample 
queries

This paper summarises the papers that show how to compromise 
databases that tell the truth, even if they refuse to give information 
about small samples. It points out that any stochastic perturbation of 
the results can be filtered out using communication theory techniques, 
so pseudo-random rounding is better than truly random rounding.

This paper proposes a method for using encryption for protection on a 
network used for personal computing. the scheme uses a public-key 
encryption device in the network interface, with the secret keys built 
in to a key card or similar. As well as protecting personal data in 
transit and while stored in a central facility, it also protects against 
thefts by trojan horses in 'public' software except by use of covert 
channels. Data sharing is done by duplicating under the other parties' 
public key, and the scheme can be adapted for digital signatures.

The aim of the work underlying the paper is to design a MLS/DBMS 
based on protected views using relational model. The paper describes 
views and summarises the motivation for using them. Classification 
can be attached to views and then these act as rules for adding 
classification information when updating the database. There is a 
significant problem in ensuring this labelling technique is complete and 
consistent. The paper also discusses how views can be used to control 
aggregation, and ends with a sketch of a tentative design for a system 
that is hoped to be A1 secure.

A multilevel relational data model that meets the basic operational 
requirements for a multilevel database system is described. The model 
is an extension of the standard relational model, and consists of 
multilevel relations, which contain classification attributes as well as 
data attributes; multilevel relational integrity rules, which extend the 
integrity constraints of the relational model in order to provide 
consistency for data at different access classes, including data that 
becomes 'polyinstantiated'; a decomposition method for mapping all 
multilevel real relations into standard (single-level) base relations; 
and multilevel relational operators, which perform the functions of 
their couterparts in the standard relational model, while also labeling 
derived tuples with access classes. The model is defined in terms of 
the standard relational model, but lends itself to a design and 
implementation that offers a high level of assurance for mandatory 
security.
IEEE Comp. Soc. Proc 1987 Symp. Security and Privacy, pp. 220 - 234
This is the paper that won the best paper prize at the conference. It is 
work that has been needed for many years: the addition of 
classification to the relational data model. It should be required 
reading for anyone working in the field of secure databases.
It starts from the overall principle that views of the database must 
satisfy Codd's integrity principles for all possible clearances. 
Multilevel equivalents are then derived. These are used to classify of 
dependent attributes and eliminate inference from polyinstantiation. 
The decomposition of these polyinstantiated tuples is performed 
elegantly to fourth normal form with respect to sets of attributes 
whose values can be considered as a single object.
An aside: it is not clear why the decomposition of relations given in the 
paper should result in R(i,x,y) instead of the simpler R(i,y) given by:  
R(i,y) = x(Ri,x,y).

Note: This was one of two papers at the symposium from SRI and 
Gemini, on the Seaview multilevel secure relational database project. 
This paper presents a security policy model. The information is 
presented at a point in the project where specification and design are 
substantially complete, although implementation has not started.
A most interesting feature is the separation into two models in 
adjacent layers. The innermost layer, called the MAC model, deals with 
mandatory security. It is an extension of Bell/LaPadula with an 
integrity component.
Since the interpretation of Bell/LaPadula objects is as single-level 
database relations, a general-purpose commercially available A1 
security-kernel can be used to implement the MAC model.
The second layer of the model is called the TCB, and describes security 
in terms of relational database concepts. This accounts for the bulk of 
the paper. nineteen(!) properties are defined. Property 1, for example, 
is that the class of tuple dominates the class of every element in it. 
Although the requirements for mandatory security are handled entirely 
by the MAC model, the TCB model which sits on top of it is greatly 
influenced by the requirements for the MAC model.
A formal security policy model that uses basic view concepts for a 
secure multilevel relational database system is described.  The model 
is formulated in two layers, one corresponding to a security kernel or 
reference monitor that enforces mandatory security, and the second 
defining multilevel relations and formalizing policies for labeling new 
and derived data, data consistency, discretionary security, and 
transaction consistency.  This includes the policies for sanitization, 
aggregation, and downgrading.  The model also defines application-
independent properties for entity integrity, referential integrity, and 
polyinstantiation integrity.

The report describes a proposed system which is potentially very good. 
The report is quite readable, especially Chapters 5 on, which give a 
good summary. Unfortunately, as far as can be gathered, the work is 
entirely theoretical at present. The 'expert' in the expert system of the 
title refers to a system driven by a database of rules. The rules are 
partly suggested in the report and will be partly contributed in a 
working system by the security officer (or committee). Events which 
cannot be coped with by the rules are passed up to a human authority. 
This gives a useful combination of automatic and manual control. It 
appears that the code can be implemented in a system independent way, 
dependencies being confined to the rule database. Also, if the rules are 
expressed in a system independent way, there is a possibility of 
exchange of rule information between different systems. The major 
question is whether the rules can be set so as to avoid major loopholes 
while keeping a reasonably low rate of events passed up to the human 
controller. A reduced version of this report appeared as a paper: D.E.

This paper describes practical models used to conduct threat and risk 
analyses for large information systems or networks. The process of 
analyzing and relating threat agents, assets, and safeguards within a 
static threat model is described. In addition, a dynamic risk model is 
described that consists of threat events, security failures, and 
damaging outcomes. This approach permits the incorporation of known 
baseline security requirements such as policies and standards, as well 
as hardware and software security features that could be distributed 
throughout the information system.

An intrusion-tolerant distributed system is a system which is designed 
so that any intrusion into a part of the system will not endanger 
confidentiality, integrity and availability. This approach is suitable for 
distributed systems, because distribution enables isolation of 
elements so that an intrusion gives physical access to only a part of 
the system. By intrusion, we mean not only computer break-ins by non-
registered people, but also attempts by registered users to exceed or to 
abuse their privileges. In particular, possible malice of security 
administrators is taken into account. This paper describes how some 
functions of distributed systems can be designed to tolerate 
intrusions, in particular security functions such as user authentication 
and authorization, and application functions such as file management.

Encryption algorithms are vulnerable to exhaustive searching for the 
key: if an enemy has the plain text and corresponding cipher text it is 
possible to try all of the possible keys in turn until the correct one is 
found. This paper describes the application of this technique to the NBS 
(now usually known as DES) algorithm.
It is shown that the algorithm is vulnerable to this sort of attack, but 
in practice only if the key searching is done by many DES devices 
working in parallel, with each device searching a different part of the 
key domain. The design of a hypothetical machine constructed for this 
purpose containing one million DES devices is considered in detail. With 
such a machine the average time to discover a key would be ten hours.
This article subsequently led to much speculation about the adequacy, 
or otherwise, of the DES algorithm.

KSOS extends Bell-Lapadula to have integrity levels as well as security 
levels; this paper extends the KSOS model to an object/object model 
called CPM. Each object has 3 pairs of security and integrity levels: 
migration, absolute and corruption. Migration levels specify the highest 
security level (MSL) and lowest integrity level (MIL) to which data migh 
flow; absolute levels (ASL, AIL) classify the data in the object, and 
corruption levels (CSL, CIL) specify the levels from which data can 
flow into the object. For each object, MSL>=ASL>=CSL and 
MIL<=AIL<=CIL. In a similar way, users (subjects) have associated read, 
absolute and write levels for security and integrity. The paper 
describes how the levels of a subject and two objects can be used to 
check whether a connection can be established by the subject between 
the objects, and then mentions some examples of the use of CPM.

Distributed Services Framework. 1985 Oct. 
ECMA Ad Hoc Group on Distributed Services
Although this report is currently in flux it does represent an attempt to 
provide a framework for the standardisation of distributed services, 
such as message handling services (as already represented by X.400), 
directory services (e.g. ECMA TR/32), filing and retrieval, printing and 
the general field of security. This version of the document is due to be 
replaced by an enhanced one.
The document introduces a number of basic concepts including the 
client/service model, categorises different kinds of service, and lists 
a number of requirements. It defines four primary 'productive services' 
(mail, mailbox, filing and printing) and four 'supportive services' (time, 
authentication, directory, bulk data transfer), and outlines the way in 
which the productive services are supported and the way all the 
services interact with each other and with a user.
There is a chapter outlining many security concepts for distributed 
services, and for an authentication service and access control in 
particular, and there is a discussion of naming. Finally a number of 
guidelines for the design of access protocols for distributed services 
are presented.

Manager: A Knowledge-Based System for Formal Verification. in: 
Oakland; 1990 May 7; Oakland. USA: IEEE; 1990: 306-318. 
Note: The paper describes a front end to the Gypsy Verification 
Environment (GVE) which is intended to increase the proportion of 
proofs which can be carried out automatically. The front end is a 
knowledge-based tool to aid in organising knowledge and strategies 
for performing proofs using the GVE.
The front end is called the Deductive Theory Manager. Contrary to my 
expectations, the word theory occurs nowhere in the text of the 
paper except in repetitions of the title.
The knowledge base consists of a tree, or strict hierarchy, of 
objects. These objects contain proof expertise and correspond 
more or less to what we would call tactics; programs in the form of 
scripts and rules for deciding what GVE command to issue next in 
the light of the given proof-goal.
The organising principle for the tree is: the more general the expertise 
the closer to the root, and the more specific to the application, the 
further away from the root. This means, I think, that the organisation 
of the tree is not a reflection of the structure of any particular proof. 
Nor is it exactly the structure induced by the relation of parenthood 
between one theory and another, because any object in the tree has at 
most one more general immediate parent object. We are more used to a 
system whereby a given theory may be descended from several 
independent theories (although all ultimately have a common ancestor).
Thus it appears that the knowledge base is a tree of tactics, which 
corresponds only informally to a structure of theories. Thus, to work on 
a particular proof goal, the user selects a script, which is some point 
in the tree. If all the rules fail at that point, the system tries the (one 
and only) immediate parent script in the hope that more general rules 
will be applicable.
This effort is motivated by the large amount of work necessary in the 
verification tasks undertaken by the authors organisation. For one 
effort, FTLS-to-model verification for the kernel of a secure operating 
system called ASOS, there are 461 independently proved lemmas which 
would amount to 7600 pages of formatted Gypsy proof-logs. The large 
number of lemmas arises from effort to decompose and modularise the 
proof effort. The goal of the DTM is to capitalise on the similarity 
within groups of proofs induced by a uniform writing style for 
specifications and the decomposition into many lemmas.
The work is not complete, and no assessment of the effectiveness of 
the DTM is given.
Formal verification tools and techniques are difficult and expensive to 
apply.  To make verification of large, complex systems more practically 
feasible, TRW is developing the Deductive Theory Manager (DTM).  A 
knowledge based tools that integrates with the Gypsy Verification 
Environment (GVE), the DTM supports the construction of deductive 
theories and applies them to proofs.  Knowledge bases applicable to a 
variety of projects, and one specific to the Army Secure Operating 
System (ASOS) proofs, are simultaneously under development.  This 
work derives from a previous effort headed by Ben diVito.  This paper 
describes the underlying philosphy of verification strategy on which 
the DTM is based, presents the DTM architecture, and illustrates DTM 
knowledge engineering and proof processing with a case study.  It is 
assumed the reader is familiar with the basic concepts of formal 
verification and the Gypsy Verification Environment.

Computer Society Symposium on Research in Security and Privacy; 
1990 May 7; Oakland. USA: IEEE Computer Society; 1990: 61-74. 
Note: This paper looked at a specific aspect of the immediately-
preceding paper on the Army Secure Operating System, concentrating on 
the approach taken to verifying the multilevel secure kernel.
The design used two different notions of state, at the model layer and 
at the FTLS layer. At the model layer, there is the protection state, an 
abstract Bell-LaPadula-based representation of the protection-critical 
aspects of the reference monitor. The FTLS kernel state includes nearly 
all aspects of the kernel, in a level of detail very close to a full 
implementation. An interpretation function, formalised using Gypsy, 
maps from the more detailed to the more abstract representation and 
provides a way of determining the effects of ASOS kernel services on 
the security model properties. 
To demonstrate that the system is secure, it was first demonstrated 
that the initial state of the kernel satisfied the security properties, 
and that each kernel call, represented by a procedure declaration, was 
security preserving. By modelling the idealised machine as a Gypsy 
program which calls procedures representing kernel calls, the Gypsy 
Verification Environment could be used to generate the verification 
conditions to be satisfied. There were about 90 different transitions of 
the kernel state to consider, of which 20% caused no change in the 
kernel state (and so could not caused a change in the interpreted state); 
50% caused a state change in the kernel state, but caused no change in 
the corresponding (via interpretation) protection state; and 30% which 
caused a change in both kernel and protection states. It was only the 
last category that need substantial effort to prove they are security-
preserving. By adopting a systematic approach for each of the 
categories, it becomes easier to generate and review proofs. On 
average, the proofs consisted of 34 steps; lemmas were used to reduce 
the complexity of the longest proofs to about 100 steps. In all, proof 
documentation totalled about 18 MByte of data.
The authors noted that whereas Gypsy was good for formal 
specification, GVE is difficult to use to prove security, and is weak in 
configuration control facilities. However, it proved worthwhile to 
produce some general-purpose lemmas early-on in the verification 
process, and also to do a few trial proofs before the FTLS is complete 
(as this may reveal ways in which the specification can be changed to 
aid the analysis). The style of specification adopted was chosen to 
enable both formal proofs of correctness and also machine analysis for 
covert channels; an unfortunate side-effect of the latter aim was that 
the FTLS was more detailed than it need otherwise be.
One weakness with the approach described in the paper is that there is 
no formalised way of determining the correctness of the Interpretation 
Function.
The Army Secure Operating System (ASOS) program, under the 
management of the U.S. Army CECOM organisation, is providing a family 
of operating systems of tatical data system applications in Ada.  Two 
members of the ASOS family have been developed: a Dedicated Secure 
Operating System intended for the TCSEC [1] C2 level and a Multilevel 
Secure Operating system intended for the TCSEC A1 level.  In this paper 
we present an overview of the A1 system concept and TRW's solution to 
the ASOS kernel verification problem.  We describe the model, FTLS, 
and proff approaches as well as some practical techniques for coping 
with proof complexity.  Summary statistics on the actual proofs have 
been compiled and included in our discussion of the verification 
results.

Note: The talk was very well presented, which is also true of the paper. 
However, the content does not bear much relevance to the things the 
rest of the community are trying to achieve. Moreover, the authors 
appear to be trying to achieve too much because it looks as though they 
are developing a model which includes everything except the kitchen 
sink.
One example of this is the section dealing with the concept of 
interpretation. The authors quite rightly point out that we should not be 
as concerned about information flowing as about meaning flowing. But 
to model the flow of meaning we need to model the knowledge of the 
recipient, an unrealistic task!
Their work developed out of attempting to produce a security model for 
an IPSE. The authors noted that traditional security models, such as the 
Bell and LaPadula model, address secure systems as a product, but do 
not deal with the process of developing secure systems. Issues that 
need to be covered by such a development process are, for example, (i) 
the levels of trust assigned to tools, and (ii) information flows from 
development to target environments. Quite often there will be several 
different interests in a development, each having their own aims. These 
aims are set out as a policy. For example, one policy may be that the 
development is kept within costs, and another that it meets its 
functional specification. These policies sometimes conflict.
The authors intend to model all these issues, and more. The key 
component of their model is the notion of a role. These reflect 
positions in an organisation and are things like technical authority and 
quality assurance. The roles fall into two categories, structural roles 
and functional roles. The structural role reflects the responsibilities 
and obligations placed on the role holder. The functional role reflects 
the actions of the role holder. Other components of the model are 
agents, actions and data. Agents cause things to happen and actions are 
the means by which this is done. Data is the means by which actions 
interact. The model sets out the complex relationship between these 
components.
The paper finishes with a list of areas where the model would be, or is, 
useful. However, it remains to be seen if this is the case.

Dobson, John E.; Randell, Brian. Building Reliable Secure Computing 
Systems out of Unreliable Insecure Components. 1986 Apr. 
IEEE Comp. Soc. Proc. 1986 Symp. Security and Privacy pp.187-193
The paper examines the links between security and reliability, and 
argues that they can usefully be regarded as different aspects of a 
common problem and so amenable (at least in part) to common 
solutions. The paper suggests that an approach to system design that 
has fault tolerance as its aim can achieve both a high degree of 
security and of reliability.
The requirements for a secure system and a reliable system can be 
stated in similar terms. The authors acknowledge that this sounds like 
playing with words, but state that this leads to an initial, but 
interesting, exploration of some of the parallels between security and 
reliability.
The paper points out that work on security has concentrated on fault 
prevention rather than fault tolerance; it then investigates the 
advantages of using fault tolerance techniques to provide secure 
components from insecure components. As an example they discuss 
some of the drawbacks with the TCB approach to security, and 
illustrate how fault tolerance ideas could be used to circumvent some 
of these drawbacks.

This book defines the criteria for evaluating the security of computer 
systems set out by the US DoD Computer Security Center. It is essential 
reading for everyone in the field of computer security.
It defines a series of categories each of which has a set of 
requirements. A computer system must fulfil all the requirements of a 
category to be approved in that category, and the requirements increase 
progressively in stringency. The criteria can be used to give a rating to 
the security properties of a computer system. These ratings are used in 
some US procurement requirements where there is a need to be able to 
handle classified material. The book is referred to as the TCSEC (and is 
also known as the 'orange book' due to the colour of the cover of the 
original document).

Today, the Department of Defense (DoD) relies upon software which 
would cost many billions of dollars to replace, yet many commands 
require the operational benefits of applied Multilevel Secure (MLS) 
technologies. Traditional secure engineering practices have started 
over again at ground zero and re-designed and re-engineered secure 
systems, creating whole new systems at substantial cost. We explore 
the idea of configuring a Trusted Computing Base (TCB) from 
commercially available components and porting existing software to 
the new environment with as few changes as is possible. When 
successfully applied, this approach can yield the DoD the benefits of 
applied MLS technology without incurring the costs and development 
time penalties associated with traditional secure systems 
development.

The requirements for multilevel security have been shown to conflict 
with some database integrity and consistency properties. In this paper, 
we examine the data consistency requirements for a distributed 
database system, consider the effects of multilevel security on 
meeting those requirements, and consider architectures for achieving 
them. We discuss the problem of providing serializability in a single-
site database system and propose a solution based on optimistic 
concurrency control. We then extend this solution to a distributed 
database system. We also describe an approach for weak consistency 
concurrency control in a distributed database system based on the 
Optimistic Protocol.

in Discretionary Access Control. 1985.

The first part of the paper, presented by Debbie Downs, describes the 
purpose of Discretionary Access Controls (DAC), the lack of protection 
against Trojan Horses, some mechanisms that can be used to implement 
DAC - capabilities, user profiles, passwords, owner/group/world 
access bits and access control lists - together with their benefits and 
deficiencies, the access modes that are often found, and the 
relationship between DAC and file structure. As there is no formal 
model of DAC that fits myriad implementations, verifying DACs means 
ensuring they cannot be used to subvert or circumstep the mandatory 
access controls, and demonstating consistency with a top level 
specification.
Cathy Jordan presented the last part of the paper, which described the 
DoDCSC policy on DAC. A set of guidelines is under preparation, which 
will discuss implementation and evaluation issues, and describe 
various mechanisms used to implement DAC (together with their 
benefits and drawbacks) for the benefit of evaluators and designers. 
The suggestiuon is that DACs are 'verified' by testing and penetration 
exercises, the aim being to check consistency with specification and 
conformance with Mandatory Access Controls. The guidelines will also 
cover those environmental control issues on which DAC depends, as 
well as various administrative issues. The first draft of the guidelines 
should become available in July, after consultation with major 
computer system vendors.

A probabilistic framework can be employed to assess the risk of 
disclosure of confidential information in statistical databases that use 
disclosure control mechanisms. We illustrate how the method may be 
used to assess the strengths and weaknesses of two existing 
disclosure control mechanisms - query set size restriction control and 
random sample query control mechanisms. Our results indicate that 
neither scheme provides adequate security. The framework is then 
further exploited to analyze an alternative scheme combining query set 
size restriction and random sample query control. We show that this 
combination results in a significant decrease in the risk of disclosure.

Network Security in a Methodology for Information Security Design and 
Implementation. in: 14th National Computer Security Conference; 1991 
Oct; Washington. USA: NIST/NCSC; 1991; 2: pp.494-504. 
This paper aims to address the complicated issue of network security. 
Network security is approached in this paper from a functional and 
more specifically from a methodical point of view. A network can be 
seen as a collection of nodes that are connected by communication 
media in such a way that information can be transferred between nodes. 
The connection must be such, that resources like databases and 
printers may be shared between nodes. A node can be any computer 
hardware component and may even be another network like a local area 
network or a wide area network. Network security needs to be 
addressed from a technical as well as from an application systems 
perspective. The technological issues on network security addresses 
the broader concepts such as the provision of a variety of network 
security services and mechanisms for example authentication and 
traffic analyses. Applications network security assures that a network 
oriented application system be designed to adhere to the computer 
security policy of the organisation in general.

The IRR research model as proposed in this paper can be seen as an 
important first phase of a research process, aimed at formulating a 
new approach to risk analysis, risk assessment and risk management 
within the information technology environment. Over the past decade, 
considerable resources and efforts have gone into developing and 
automating risk analysis methods, in an attempt to make risk analysis 
more easily applicable and as a whole more successful. This resulted in 
a large number of automated techniques, methods and packages being 
currently available on the information security software market. The 
perspective the authors took in preparing this paper was to address the 
question "which approach combined with underlying business 
philosophies and business technologies?" This opposes the question 
usually asked by organisations, namely "which package?".

The Trusted X Window System (TX/WS) is a prototype of the X Window 
System for the TMach (trusted Mach) operating system. TX/WS is 
designed to support users manipulating information of different 
sensitivity labels simultaneously. In TX/WS, each top-level window on 
the screen may belong to a different application. These applications 
may be running at a variety of sensitivity levels. Each window is 
visibly labeled with the maximum sensitivity label of the application 
which created the window. To assist the user of a multi-level 
windowing system with overlapping windows, a visible labeling policy 
is required to avoid inadvertent misclassification of information. This 
paper describes a prototype which demonstrates various labeling 
policies for overlapping windows. It also summarizes feedback from 
the prototype.

Multilevel secure windowing systems are a key technology for the 
1990's. We have spent the past 20 months designing and implementing a 
prototype of a multilevel secure X Window System as a proof of concept 
vehicle for our software engineering process model for the 
development of trusted systems. The prototype is targeted to B3 
evaluation criteria. In the early stages many doubted that B3 was 
achievable for a windowing system (especially X); we believe that our 
prototype demonstrates that B3 is achievable. This paper describes our 
goals, the architecture of our system, and some of the trade-offs we 
made to achieve our goals. It also contrasts our work with existing 
Compartmented Mode Workstations (CMW) windowing systems.

The MIT X Window System (X) has become a de-facto windowing system 
standard that is widely used throughout the computer industry. In many 
ways X is as important in the 1990's as standard operating systems 
were in the 1980's. Just as trusted versions of UNIX operating systems 
(from C2 systems such as Gould's UTX/32S to B2 systems such as AT&T 
System V Release 4/ES) are critical to bringing trusted systems into 
widespread use, trusted versions of X are necessary in order to make 
the full power of those trusted systems available to users operating in 
today's workstation environments. Adaptation of commercial systems 
to trusted systems generally involves tradeoffs between functionality 
and trust. X is no exception to this rule. Most commercial multi-user 
systems (such as UNIX and VMS) implement mechanisms that enforce 
various security policies, such as access control and privilege policies, 
although those mechanisms are often relatively primitive (eg. 
permission bits and super-user in UNIX). In contrast, X was explicitly 
designed to avoid enforcing any policies and, in fact, provides many 
mechanisms that tend to promote the sharing of data and resources 
among X applications. As a result, the tradeoffs between trust and 
functionality are far greater for X than typically encountered in 
operating systems. This paper surveys the issues and outlines various 
solutions to problems encountered in designing and building trusted X 
systems. The paper focuses on issues that appear both at the B1 and B3 
levels of trust specified in the Trusted Computer System Evaluation 
Criteria, and in The Security Requirements for System High and 
Compartmented Mode Workstations.

Estrin, Deborah. Controls for Interorganization Networks. 1987. 
IEEE Trans. Software Eng SE-13(2) pp.249-261
An Interorganization Network (ION) is a logical network imposed over 
one or more physical computer networks. The physical computer 
networks are owned by different organizations, and IONs are a way of 
supporting interorganization work. As well as supporting IONs, each 
physcial network supports a purely logical network.
Estrin describes a way of maintaining separation between logical 
networks consisting of sets of facilities. In order to minimise the 
disruption of adding IONs to existing networks, two implementation 
constraints are identified: the implementation must not rely on 
physical separation, and those facilities that belong solely to an 
internal logical network do not implement any separation mechanisms.
All messages entering a physical network enter via a gateway. The 
gateway only forwards the message if the source and the destination 
ION facilities belong to the same ION. ION facilities that belong to more 
than one logical network (IONs and the internal network) enforce 
separation between the different networks.
Estrin's aim is to achieve a level of security equivalent to that 
achievable by other interorganization communication mechanisms such 
as phone and post. the final part of the paper identifies the 
vulnerabilities inherent in supporting IONs and how they can be 
removed so as to achieve this degree of security. This primarily 
concerns authentication issues.

Estrin, Deborah. Non-Discretionary Controls for Inter-Organization 
Networks. 1985. 
IEEE Comp. Soc. Proc. 1985 Symp. Security and Privacy pp.56-61
This paper describes a protocol for enabling controlled use of the 
resources on the network for one organisation by systems attached to 
the network for another organisation. Each inter-net gateway acts as a 
border guard one behalf of its local network access control server 
(ACS), letting out only previously authorised traffic, letting in only 
previously authorised traffic, and redirecting authorisation requests to 
the ACS. Control of data flow within the network for an organisation is 
beyond the scope of this protocol. 
The protocol would appear to do the job for which it was designed, 
though it is not optimal - too many messages are rejected by gateways 
(returning the address of the local ACS) instead of being directly 
forwarded to the local ACS.

Computer Science Department). Security Issues in Policy Routing. in: 
1989 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy; May 1; Oakland, 
California. USA: IEEE Computer Society; 1989: 183-193. 
Note: This paper describes some of the security related problems that 
may be encountered when communication is required between/via 
separately owned, maintained and run networks (Autonomous Regions). 
Policy Routing is a technique that is used to choose an appropriate 
route through several autonomous regions based on policy related 
parameters such as cost and access rights.
The paper explains the potential threats that can be posed to policy 
routing protocols (i.e. falsification of policy routes, misuse of valid 
policy routes and denial of service). It then goes on to describe and 
analyse mechanisms designed to prevent these sorts of attack.
The main technique described by the paper is the use of encryption of 
the communications between the policy servers of the interconnected 
autonomous regions (the entities that generate and distribute policy 
information throughout the networks). The encryption of relevant 
information is used to ensure that the information being passed has 
been generated by an authentic policy server and that it has not been 
modified in any way.
A general scheme for a secure policy routing protocol is presented 
which details the steps that any variation of protocol should take. The 
steps include a secure mechanism for distributing session keys to all 
of the autonomous regions in the selected route and ways in which 
senders of packets of information from one autonomous region can be 
authenticated by entities in another.
The final part of the paper examines the costs incurred in using a 
scheme such as the one described and concludes that for a sample (3 
hop) policy route using DES encryption, the costs incurred range 
between 9% and 28% which is a rather high figure.

Estrin, Deborah; Tsudik, Gene. Visa Scheme for Inter-Organization 
Network Security. 1987. 
In this paper we describe a visa scheme for implementing access 
control in Inter-Organization Network (ION) gateways. The purpose of 
the scheme is to allow an organization to modify and trust only those 
internal systems that require ION access; all other internal systems 
can not communicate with the outside. Control is distributed among the 
ION participants so that each may make its own design tradeoffs 
between performance and trust. It is desirable to implement controls 
at the network, i.e. packet, level because of the relative performance, 
flexibility and ubiquity of network-level gateways. However, a new 
mechanism was called for because the only information available to 
existing network-level gateways is the network-level address in the 
packet header and such network-level addresses do not carry the 
higher-level, logical information (e.g., organization affiliation) needed 
to make access control decisions. To overcome these problems, a visa 
ION gateway woeks in concert with an Access Control Server (ACS). The 
ACS carries out high-level evaluation of communication requests and 
the gateway enforces the ACS's decision using the visa scheme. In order 
for a node to send a packet through a visa gateway, the node must 
obtain a key(visa) from the ACS of the visa-controlled networks that it 
wishes to leave and enter. If the node passes an ACS's policy filter, the 
ACS gives its local gateway the source and destination nodes' network 
IDs and a visa with which to authenicate packets coming from or to the 
source node as they pass through the gateway. The same visa is given to 
the source node to stamp all outgoing packets for the duration of the 
session. To prevent or inhibit the acquisition of visas through 
interception of packets, the stamp included in each packet is a function 
of the visa and the packet checksum.

This paper discusses some of the issues in meeting the Compartmented

commercial applications. The reader is assumed to have  a general 
familiarity with  CMW and window systems. The security policy is 
summarised, and followed by a discussion of how it has been 
interpreted in the real world of X11 programming. Applying restrictions 
to the X protocol prevents clients from interfacing with each other, 
while still providing enough functionality to make these programs 
useful. Special considerations are given to the root window, selections, 
grabs, and atoms to meet the needs of existing applications.

The states of knowledge that are attainable in distributed systems are 
characterized, where communication is done by unreliable message 
exchange.  The reason that certain states of knowledge are unattainable 
is a conservation principle which says that information about 'nature' 
that can be obtained by combining all of the knowledge of the members 
of a closed system is preserved.  The class of formulae in the 
propositional modal logic of knowledge are axiomatised, and the 
complexity of the decision problem is determined.

The Distributed Computing System is an information utility designed to 
provide reliable, fail-soft service at relatively low cost to a large 
class of users with modest requirements. The salient feature of this 
system is the distribution of hardware, software, and system control. 
Hardware distribution is achieved using a local area network 
architecture. Software and control distribution is facilitated through 
the use of communication by name, rather than address, among the 
network components. The combined effect of distribution, which 
provides both redundancy and isolation, and of controlled access, makes 
total failure of the computing system unlikely. Reliability is achieved 
by minimizing the probability of total failure, using isolation to keep 
local failures from spreading and causing global failure, and using 
redundancy to negate the effects of local failures.
This paper is quite brief, although it includes a number of references to 
more detailed earlier papers. It describes the organization of the DCS 
hardware system (a digital communication ring) and the resident 
system services in each processor on the ring. Processes are 
distributed about the ring and their relative positions are invisible to 
each other. The functions needed to protect the system and to provide 
resource allocation are dealt with: resource allocation uses a broadcast 
system in which resource allocator processes bid to provide requested 
resources

This paper proposes a three stage method for obtaining a verified 
design. It gives step-wise guidance in the application of the 
verification process at various stages. The guidelines are derived from 
experience gained in the verification of a particular processor, the

Security Model for Object-Oriented Databases. in: 1989 IEEE Symposium 
on Security and Privacy; May 1; Oakland, California. USA: IEEE Computer 
Society; 1989: 110-115. 
Note: The authors are interested in developing a security model for an 
object-oriented database. This work is necessary as previous database 
security models only apply to relational databases and these are not 
rich enough to cope with object-oriented databases. The work done is in 
the context of the database OSAM* which is being developed at the 
University of Florida. However, the authors believe that the work can be 
generalised.
Before defining the model, a number of issues are considered. Should 
the database be open (only preventing access which is forbidden), which 
is good for flexibility, or closed (only allowing access which is 
permitted, which is good for security? Should the database have 
positive or negative authorisations? Should the database uphold a MAC 
or a DAC policy? Only the last of these questions was really answered. 
The authors chose a DAC policy.
The security model has three components; policies, a structure of 
authorisation rules, and an algorithm to evaluate access requests 
against the authorisation rules. The policies are independent of 
security requirements and define access to the database. These policies 
are:
 A user who has access to a class can gain similar access to all the 
inherited attributes of its subclasses;
 Access to a class implies access to all the attributes of that class 
(including inherited attributes); and,
 It is not possible to access the non-inherited attributes of a class by 
accessing a super-class.
The authorisation rules consist of a set of triples; users, accesses, and 
object attributes and say which users have what accesses to what 
attributes of what classes. There are also administration rights which 
dictate who can change the authorisation rules. However, nothing is 
more is said about these.
The notion of a security context is then introduced. A security context 
is a subset of classes in which a query can be answered. The set of 
classes of a security context form a partial order in terms of class 
associations (ie, subclass and superclass). To answer a query within a 
security context, the authors define a Security Query Graph (a subset of 
the security context) and an algorithm for searching this graph. Finally, 
the authors suggest possible extensions which are more efficient.

Another Factor in Determining Security Requirements for Trusted 
Computer Applications. in: 14th National Computer Security Conference;

Computer systems take on security requirements that are unique to the 
operational characteristics and needs of their application. These 
requirements can be applied on an individual basis in reducing 
operational risk. Methods exist to determine security requirements per 
DoD 5200.28-STD by calculation of a risk index. This risk index is used 
to determine an appropriate level of trust (criteria class) per DoD 
5200.28-STD, which is then used to define a set of security 
requirements. However, the resulting security requirements imposed on 
some systems by DoD 5200.28-STD can be overly restrictive, in need of 
interpretation, or in many cases non-applicable. The purpose of this 
paper is to provide insights into determining appropriate security 
requirements for applications within a specified criteria class. 
Observations depend to a great extent on the system's user interface, 
considered as an additional environmental condition.

Using Noninterference to Analyze Systems. in: 1990 IEEE Computer 
Society Symposium on Research into Security and Privacy; 1990 May 7; 
Oakland. USA: IEEE; 1990: 162-169. 
Note: This paper is useful from a methodological point of view. It is
about a method for analysing systems for satisfaction of
Noninterference properties. Thus it is not concerned with theoretical
analysis of information-flow models as such, but rather with what it
takes to apply a given one, Noninterference, to perform a security
analysis of a given system. The author is from the Honeywell-owned
Secure Computing Technology Corp.  It is not quite clear what is the
starting point of analysis. For example, the analyst must have a very
thorough knowledge of the system and yet the relevant state-variants
are to be discovered by the analysis, not available from a
specification. The starting-point appears to be a low-level
implementation-specification, such as might be written in Gypsy.  The
main point of this method is the need, characteristic of
noninterference, for a definition of when two states are equivalent
with respect to a given security-level. The author says there is no
strong rationale available for constructing this relation on states,
and so an algorithm is given.  The algorithm is to make initial guesses
for the set of assumptions which constitute a state-invariant and the
equivalence relation. The guess is repeatedly improved, at each step
introducing for consideration another one of the systems operations.
The example given was for a system which is a security-kernel, and the
operations are kernel-requests.  For each operation, the current guess
for invariants and equivalence relation is modified until three
conditions are satisfied for the operation. These are: state-invariants
preserved, old-state and new- state equivalent at appropriate
security-level, and equivalent old- states produce equivalent
new-states. These conditions amount to an unwound form of the
non-interference property.  Inability to prove the first of these means
the list of assumptions of the state invariant must be extended.
Inability to prove the second means either there is a covert channel or
the state is unreachable or the equivalence relation is too strong (has
identified some high- level part of the state as visible at low level).
Inability to prove the third means the equivalence relation is too
strong or too weak (does not identify all portions of state visible at
low level).  An advantage is said to be that failure at any step does
not invalidate the analysis work done in previous steps. Mentioned in
the presentation, but not in the published paper, was that by keeping
track of reason for each extension, an attack scenario may be
constructed; no details given. The method has not been applied to a
real development.  A method is described for constructing an
appropriate equivalence relation for a noninterfereence analysis.  This
method is constructiv in the sense that it can bwe applied as the
system is developed instead of at the end of the design process.
Additionally, the method addresses the question of the correctness of
the equivalence relation.  /security/security models/non-interference.

Note: 
The Distributed Trusted Mach (DTMach) program is developing a design
for a high-assurance, secure, distributed system based on Mach. To
achieve this goal, it is first necessary to identify the general
threats against which DTMach must protect. The next step is to identify
control mechanisms that are sufficient to protect against each of the
threats. The DTMach design makes extensive use of type enforcement in
ad- dressing the threats. This paper describes the general threats and
the countermeasures provided by DTMach.  Doing so provides more
evidence of the usefulness of type enforcement in general and the high
assurance provided by the DTMach type enforcement policy.

applies the shortest path technique to a military example. The shortest 
path approach appears quite general and provides a method based on 
established mathematics for evaluating network security.

Foley, S. N. Lattices For Security Policies. 1990 Jan 4. 
This report lays the foundation for a new model and approach for secure 
information flow. The model is driven by lattice based information 
flow policy, which describes the permitted dissemination of 
information in the system. System entities are allowed to handle 
different classes of information from the flow policy, and information 
is permitted to flow between entities so long as they do not violate the 
flow policy.With this conceptually simple notion of security we can 
describe many interesting security properties, for example traditional 
multi-level policies, aggregation policies, and chinese walls. Details 
are given on how secure systems based on the model can be 
implemented in practice. We also examine how other types of security 
policies, such as integrity and separation of duty, can be defined in 
terms of lattice based policies.

Foley, S. N. Unifying Information Flow Policies. 1990 Jan 10. 
This report proposes a structure for describing information flow 
policies that can express transitive, aggregation and separation (of 
duty) exceptions. Operators for comparing, composing and abstracting 
flow policies are described. These allow complex policies to be built 
from simpler policies. Many existing confidentiality (and by using a 
dual model, integrity) policies can be captured in this framework. A 
high water mark model is developed that can enforce these information 
flow policies. This model provides the basis for a taxonomy of existing 
high water mark mechanisms.

information flows. The trick basically is to associate with an entity A 
in the system two classifications AH, AL drawn from a lattice, with AL 
 AH. We then require that:
 information in A can flow to any class a only if AL  a; and,
 information at any class a can flow into A only if a  AH.
The idea is developed in a number of rather theoretical, ways. For 
example, the author shows that one can define an algebra of such 
models. This is reminiscent of MacLeans presentation the previous 
year.
The idea is neat but more thought is needed to assess its practical 
utility, in particular as contrasted to, say, assigning caveats in the 
time honoured fashion or indeed the assigning of both integrity and 
secrecy labels to entities. The author remarks that the model may be 
suitable to describe part of the Clarke-Wilson model.
A neat piece of work that merits closer attention to evaluate its 
practical utility.

Policies and Models. in: 1991 IEEE Computer Society Symposium on 
Research in Security and Privacy; 1991 May; Oakland, California. USA: 
IEEE Computer Society Press; 1991: pp.98-108. ISBN: 0-8186-2168-0.
This paper proposes a notation for describing information flow policies 
that can express transitive, aggregation and separation (of duty) 
exceptions. Operators for comparing, composing and abstracting flow 
policies are described. These allow complex policies to be built from 
simpler policies. Many existing confidentiality (and by using a dual 
model, integrity) policies and their models can be captured in this 
framework. A high water mark model is described that can enforce a 
large class of these information flow policies. The model provides the 
basis for a taxonomy of existing high water mark mechanisms.

Foley, Simon N. A Universal Theory of Information Flow. in: IEEE 
Symposium on Security & Privacy; 1987 Apr; Oakland. USA: IEEE 
Computer Society; 1987: pp.116-122. 
Note: Modelling both the system and its users as concurrent sequential 
processes and using a theory recursively based on CSP primitives, this 
paper formally  describes the relation between a system and a user who 
meets the interface implied by the system's behaviour specification.  
Such users never engage in events that the system finds unexpected.  
Information can flow from one such user to another if it can engage in a 
trace (with the system) which will ensure that another user is 
prevented from engaging in one of its own.  This definition is thus 
similar to that for deducibility.  This property of a system, between 
the two users, is called dependency and can be proved or disproved 
using CSP.  Dependency is generalized to a property (leakage) which 
includes the possibility that some additional environmental process (eg 
a third user or group of users), when working in parallel with the 
system, will then produce a dependency between two users - although 
the paper does not describe how these environmental processes are to 
be found.

This paper presented a technique to protect files on distributed 
systems from being usefully accessed by an intruder while 
simultaneously providing a degree of fault tolerance. The method is to 
split up an encrypted file into a number of fragments, which are stored 
on different archive machines (each fragment on more than one, but not 
all on one machine). If an intruder gains access to an archive machine, 
some of the fragments may be compromised, but use of a stream cypher 
means that a copy of each of the fragments are needed to read all of the 
file even if the cryptographic key is compromised. No application (as 
yet), as the project is just starting.

During the past three years, we have investigated how to certify the 
trustworthiness of application systems built to satisfy stringent 
security requirements and have undertaken the certification analysis of 
two command and control systems targeted at the B3 class of the DoD 
Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC). Based on these 
experiences, we have gained many insights into the certification and 
procurement of trusted application systems. Certifying a trusted 
application system in a contractual environment presents both 
technical and programmatic challenges. The procurement policy must to 
some extent take into account the certification approach. This paper 
documents some of the lessons learned during our investigations.

6. 
Note: This speaker argued that not even compilers may be trusted to 
generate virus-free code, since it would be quite possible to infect a 
compiler in such a way as to infect all code which it compiled. From 
this he argued that the only way to be sure that compiled code is virus-
free is to disassemble it and compare it with the source code. He 
further argues that all viruses must contain a conditional statement to 
perform their triggering action, and that only these need to be 
disassembled to achieve the objective.
This paper was not generally well-received and attracted an amount of 
criticism. The speaker appears to ignore the strong possibility that it 
would be easier to write and fully validate a compiler rather than 
write  a suitable disassembler. The technique would not be applicable 
to an optimising compiler, since the expressions found in the 
executable code would not necessarily resemble those in the source 
code. It is also not clear that a virus must contain a conditional 
statement, and it would seem that the use of boolean computations and 
jump statements could be used to achieve the same effect whilst 
bypassing this detection method.

The advent of decentralized computing and an increasingly important 
role for information as a resource has prompted the development of a 
variety of methods and tools for managing the risk exposure of a 
computer system. As a result of the diversity of risk management tools 
currently available, there is no effective means of determining which 
of the tools would be most suitable for any given organization's 
situation. A new technique is proposed to effectively and objectively 
evaluate these tools for suitability and to establish a means of 
comparison of the tools among each other.

8186-0850-1.
Note: This is the second of three papers at the symposium on secure 
databases from TRW. ASD stands for A1 Secure DBMS or possibly 
Advanced Secure DBMS.
In order to be reasonably self-contained about half of this paper 
presents material familiar from the Wilson paper (above). It continues 
the exposition of database views as classified objects. I'm not sure 
two separate papers are justified, and will give this one only a short 
report.
The main theme is the importance attached to getting the TCB down to 
a 'small' size, or relatively small, necessary for certification at B2 or 
better.
The problem is that in general, view-processing is a large part of all 
the code of the DBMS. What is needed here is a trusted view-processor. 
The method of getting a small trusted view processor is to restrict the 
query-language used for defining of views for security.
A secure view is allowed to be defined only in terms of a single base 
relation (ie no joining of relations necessary). The amount of trusted 
code in the view processor is then only 1000 lines, in addition to the 
DBMS's trusted record-level interface. No other numbers are given for 
comparison.
This paper describes a proposed approach rather than a working system.
ASD_Views is an implementation of views as the security object in a 
multilevel secure relational Database Management System (DBMS) that 
results in a small trusted computing base (TCB) as required to meet the 
criteria for evaluation class B2 and above.  A general view is the result 
of a database query.  Since most of the code which implements the 
DBMS is involved in processing the query, most of the DBMS must be 
trusted.  ASD_Views are defined using a subset of the relational 
algebra to restrict the size of the query language available to define a 
secure view.  This approach reduces that part of the TCB required to 
implement secure views to roughly 1,000 lines of code.  Although 
ASD_Views restricts the functionality available in the view definition, 
the flexibility is still greater than if the row or column is the security 
object.  In addition, views preserve data integrity by using the contents 
of the data as the basis for its sensitivity label.

This paper introduces model-based reasoning and discusses how model-
based reasoning capabilities can be applied to intrusion detection. We 
discuss the benefits of the approach and have shown its advantages 
over those currently in use. The use of model-based reasoning 
technology allows intrusion models to be specified much more easily 
and naturally than is the case using other techniques. Most importantly, 
the use of model-based reasoning technology will allow IDES to be a 
much better detector of intrusions.

We discuss work aimed at defining a multilevel, mandatory security 
policy for knowledge based systems. We address two distinct issues: an 
effective implementation formalism based on a multilevel, object-
oriented programming paradigm, and requirements for ensuring the 
correctness of inferences computed on the basis of possibly 
contradictory information from different access classes. We define 
requirements for an object-oriented system capable of handling 
multilevel objects within a single access class. We then outline a 
method by which multilevel objects may be used to implement a simple 
knowledge based system built on production rules. We argue that the 
issues regarding correctness are similar to those of truth maintenance 
in standard knowledge based systems and may be addressed by similar 
methods.

Delegation in a Distributed System. in: 1990 IEEE Computer Society 
Symposium on Research in Security and Privacy; May 7; Oakland. USA: 
IEEE; 1990: 20-30. 
Note: This paper discusses an architecture for the delegation of 
privilege within a distributed system. The method described is intended 
to form part of Digitals Distributed Secure System Architecture 
(DSSA). The idea underlying the approach is that public key cryptology 
can be used to provide authentication without the need for an 
authentication server. The paper uses Girling [PhD Thesis 1983] as an 
example of the authentication server approach.
Typically a user will wish to access resources on some remote device 
(e.g. a server) through a series of nodes (e.g. workstation). This process 
involves delegation of privilege from the user to the first workstation, 
from the first workstation to the second workstation, et. seq. At each 
stage of the process a certification is generated which is signed by the 
delegating node and states that the delegated node may act on its 
behalf. The server collects together all the certificates and is able to 
reconstruct the chain and so deduce the identity of the originator of the 
request.
The certificates are public. However signatures may only be verified by 
the generating node. This is achieved by a public key scheme in which 
each node generates a private key/public key pair. The public key is 
entered into the data portion of the certificate while the private key is 
used to generate signatures. The private key is never released from the 
generating node. When a user terminates a session he is able to request 
of all nodes in the chain that they delete their private keys. This means 
that the certificates become useless since they cannot be verified. 
Hence the system protects the user against a node being subverted 
after he has terminated his session. It does not, of course, provide 
protection against a node which is subverted during the session.
The paper goes on to discuss refinements to the level of privilege that 
is delegated and also to discuss performance. It is pointed out that 
signature verification will be much more frequent than digital signing 
and suggestions are made to exploit this.
Key generation is acknowledged to be a problem, especially since the 
architecture requires a new key for each delegation in each chain. The 
authors suggest several enhancements in this area and conclude by 
putting a wet finger in the air and claiming that some of the 
enhancements must surely be good enough.
Delegation is the process whereby a user in a distributed environment 
authorizes a system to access remote resources on his behalf.  In 
today's distributed systems where all the resources required to carry 
out an operation are rarely local to the system to which the user is 
logged in, delegation is more often the rule than the exception.  Yet, 
even with the use of state-of-the-art authentication techniques, 
delegation is typically implicit and transparent to the remote system 
controlling the resources, making it difficult for that system to 
determine whether delegation was authorized by the user.  This paper 
describes a practical technique for delegation that provides both 
cryptographic assurance that a delegation was authorized and 
authentication of the delegated systems, thereby allowing reliable 
access control as well as precise auditing of the systems involved in 
every access.  It goes further than other aproaches for delegation in 
that it also provides termination of a delegation on demand (as when 
the user logs out) with the assurance that the delegated systems, if 
subsequently compromised, cannot continue to act on the user's behalf.  
Delegation and revocation are provided by a simple mechanism that 
does not rely on online trusted servers.

This gives a design for a LAN that uses TIUs for separation. The TIU for 
an untrusted node will label all messages with the classification level 
of the node, and will only accept messages with the appropriate 
classification level. The TIU for a multilevel node will accept all 
incoming messages in a range of security levels, and will check that 
the security labels of outgoing messages lie in the same range. The 
design makes no attempt to provide authentication; the LAN is assumed 
to be physically secure and TEMPEST-proof.

This compact and up to date volume introduces the reader to the low 
level details (OSI's physical and data link layers) of an impressive 
array of local area networks. After first placing local area networks 
into their historical context it gives separate chapters to the 
topologies that can be used, basic data transmission techniques, and 
major requirements in terms of hardware and software.
A chapter on example local area networks that have been implemented 
and extensively tested includes Ethernet, Cambridge Ring and broadband 
systems. It covers a number of commercially available networks 
explicitly. After a chapter giving a non-mathematical consideration of 
performance characteristics the book is concluded with a brief list of 
possible local area network applications. There is a small number of 
relevent references at the end of each chapter

This paper presents an investigation into a typical local area network's 
susceptibility to covert channels in the use of its low level protocols 
(which will often be available even in secure network architectures). 
Both storage channels and timing channels are identified.
Results of a simple experiment on the BBC micro's Econet are then 
given which are demonstrative of the large bandwidth that can be 
associated with a covert channel based on address data. Some possible 
bandwidth reduction techniques are discussed, including their cost and 
(in)effectiveness.

Note: Operator nets are represented by an interconnected set of nodes 
each arc of which represents a sequence of messages. The nodes 
themselves represent processes, may have several input arcs but only 
one output arc, and are associated with a particular processing 
function. Using this simple model of a distributed computing system 
this paper describes a history (a set of incomplete message sequences 
from each of the arcs in the net), an event (two histories and the set of 
executing processes that take one to the other), what it means for an 
event to cause a message, when one event can be said to precede 
another (without recourse to the physical notion of time), and what one 
message depending-on another means.
Knowledge is taken to be a set of formulae derived from iterative 
reasoning about an initial set of axioms in conjunction with knowledge 
explicit in each message the process has ever received. The above 
notions are then used to build up corresponding definitions involving 
knowledge including: an event Kcausing a process to know a formula 
(i.e. a fact); the knowledge of one formula by a process Kpreceding the 
knowledge of another formula by another process; and the knowledge of 
a formula by a process Kdepending-on another process.
A number of security properties are then defined using these knowledge 
orientated relationships.
The first two security properties (knowledge noninterference security 
and knowledge independence security) express non-interference for 
non-deterministic systems and are informally proven to be equivalent 
and composable. The proof of composability assumes that the 
interfacing processes which are used to generate outputs to one system 
and receive inputs from the other are non-reasoning and have the same 
security levels.
The third security property definition, for knowledge security, requires 
knowledge to have a related security level and simply states that a 
process may only know a formula with a classification that the process 
dominates. This is a very simple and high level description of security 
which, unfortunately, would prove difficult to verify against in 
practice.
The final two properties were not presented but are in the paper.
The knowledge integrity security property is just the dual of knowledge 
noninterference security using integrity levels. It prevents processes 
with high integrity classification knowing formulae through the 
activity of lower processes.
Finally, authority systems security is equivalent to knowledge 
noninterference security except that it relaxes the noninterference 
requirement for highly classified processes which possess a particular 
axiom in their initial set. It allows such processes to determine the 
level of the formulae they deduce themselves (and would, therefore, 
accommodate systems in which a process can perform reasoned 
downgrading).
The implementation of operator nets in 'LUCID' and the unfinished 
construction of a proof system for the security properties are also 
mentioned. Much of this paper, and in particular the knowledge security 
property, is relevant to the UK work on the theory of security.
A method for reasoning about knowledge in multilevel secure 
distributed systems is introduced.  This method, based on a behavioural 
semantics for operator nets, can be used to specify a variety of 
security properties, such as nondisclosure, integrity, and authority 
systems.  The major attributes of the method are the intuitive nature 
of the specifications, and the expressibility of the model which allows 
statements about temporal properties and deductive capabilities of 
processes.

College Park, Md 20742: University of Maryland; 1985 Dec. 
The purpose of this document is to define a set of guidelines for 
Trusted Facility Management and Audit in secure computer systems.  
These guidelines elaborate the requirements of the reference [TCSEC 
83] in these two areas, and define the functions, databases, and 
mechanisms of the system administrators (ie the security 
administrator, the trusted system programmer and the account 
administrator), system operators (ie secure operator, operator) and the 
auditor.  However, the assignment of trusted facility management and 
audit roles to specific individuals is not addressed herein; such 
assignments must be left to the management of specific installations.  
The relationships between the guidelines and the requirements of the 
reference [TCSEC 83] are presented both in the area of trusted facility 
management and in that of audit.  Although the guidelines are abstract 
(eg, they are unrelated to the mechanisms of any specific system), they 
are sufficiently detailed to serve as an architecture-definition 
document in both areas.

1986 Apr. 
IEEE Comp. Soc. Proc. 1986 Symp. Security and Privacy pp.102-117
This paper describes an implementation by IBM of a secure version of a 
UNIX look-alike on a personal workstation. The aims were threefold: to 
provide a compatible interface to UNIX V; to achieve multilevel 
security somewhere between B2 and A1 on the NCSC scale; and, to have 
minimal, incremental performance penalties. Despite the problems of 
difficulty of verification and testing, and of having two coexistent 
security policies, it was decided to enhance an existing implementation 
to provide security rather than provide an emulator on top of a separate 
security kernel. The paper describes in detail the Access Control List 
mechanism that was added to provide finer granularity of discretionary 
access control, and then describes the lattice-oriented mandatory 
access control mechanisms. These mandatory controls assign a current 
clearance to each process, based on the runtime clearance of the user 
(dominated by the maximum for the user and the group) and of maximum 
clearance of the user's terminal; note that the user must have been able 
to set up a clearance higher than a minimum value associated with the 
terminal. As well as groups and users having security profiles, so do 
workstations, reflecting the profiles of attached terminals and 
attached private devices.
After describing the way the mandatory controls are integrated into 
the system, the paper discusses the accountability policies and 
mechanisms, including user identification, the secure attention key, 
auditing, and the system management functions.
An appendix describes the then current security levels, consisting of a 
heirarchical component of up to 256 elements, and a category set of up 
to 40 independent elements, and then describes the ordering relation 
that makes these levels a lattice.

When developing secure systems, there should be a testing process in 
addition to any formal verification procedure. This paper presents a 
way of reducing the number of tests in a systematic fashion by 
eliminating redundancy; the method has been used to assist in the 
testing of a secure version of UNIX.
The ideas underlying the paper appeared to be sensible and useful, but 
unfortunately were very badly presented. Note: automated testing adds 
a level of indirection; how sure are you that the test tools are correct?

USA: IEEE Computer Society Press; 1992: pp. 2-17. 
In this paper we define and rationalize a policy for propagation of 
authentication trust across realm boundaries. This policy helps limit 
global security exposures that ensue whenever an authentication 
service is compromised. It is based on a hierarchical model of inter-
realm authentication, and can be supported by both public-key and 
secret-key systems. As an example, we present a simple protocol 
which selects inter-realm authentication paths of a design which 
provides application transparency for inter-realm, authentication-path 
selection and acceptance as the default mode of operation. The design 
can be integrated with the security services of existing systems; e.g., 
of the Open Software Foundation's Distributed Computing Environment 
(DCE). DCE implementation issues are also discussed.

SIFT (Software Implemented Fault Tolerance) is an experimental fault-
tolerant computer system for flight control of advanced aircraft 
including those that are inherently unstable. Such a computer must be 
extremely reliable.
Life-testing and exhaustive testing of such a computer are both 
impossible. To justify their claims of high reliability the designers of 
SIFT have had to verify that the design is consistent with the required 
fault-tolerant behaviour.
This paper first outlines the basic fault-tolerance approach, the design 
philosophy, the hardware and software structures used. It then 
describes the way in which the design was verified

Identity-Based Capability System. in: 1989 IEEE Symposium on Security 
and Privacy; May 1; Oakland, California. USA: IEEE Conputer Society; 
1989: 56-63. 
The paper described ICAP, an Identity-based CAPability system. ICAP is 
aimed at a distributed network environment in which certain problems 
arise when a traditional capability system is used. For instance, it may 
be necessary to pass a capability for an object to a user via an 
intermediary. Using a traditional system, this would also enable the 
intermediary to gain access to the object.
The solution taken by ICAP is to check against the security policy 
whenever a capability is propagated. This ensures that only authorised 
users gain copies of any capability whilst minimising the performance 
impact.
The problem of ensuring that only the trusted server is able to 
propagate capabilities is solved by including the recipients identity 
in each capability so that it can only be used by the intended user.
When a capability held by a user for an object is to be revoked, an 
exception list for the object is updated making useless all copies of 
the capability for the object held by the user. By keeping track of the 
propagation history for a capability, the OS can ensure that only the 
relevant users can revoke the capability.

Gong, Li; Needham, Roger M.; Yahalom, Raphael (Cambridge Computer 
Laboratory). Reasoning about Belief in Cryptographic Protocols. inin: 
1990 IEEE Computer Society Symposium on Research in Security and 
Privacy; 1990 May 7; Oakland. USA: IEEE; 1990: 234-248. 
Note: The authors claim that suprisingly many protocols dont work - 
despite the fact that they are small. They will often contain flaws and 
vulnerabilities that escaped detection as it is difficult to consider all 
attacks and the security claims are not presented in a systematic way. 
The object of the paper is to improve on the earlier BAN logic so that 
protocols can be specified and analysed in a systematic fashion.
The basic notions of the approach are of principals (state machines), 
protocols (distributed algorithms), messages (the means of 
communication between principals), formulae (bit strings), and sets of 
beliefs and possessions (formulae) known to each principal. It 
introduces the concept of freshness (a message is not a replay of a 
message prior to this session) and recognizability (the recipients 
expectations of the message are satisfied). A notation for expressing 
the reasoning process is presented (informally in the body of the paper, 
and more precisely in an appendix), together with rules representing 
the logical postulates of the reasoning process.
The methodology is used to analyse the Needham-Schroeder algorithm; 
as one would hope, the known flaw was revealed together with another, 
minor one. 
Further work is required, to get the current design to a stable state, 
and then to extend it to support additional properties for the protocols. 
However, to handle aspects of information leakage, more significant 
changes may be required. The methodology, once extended, needs to be 
further tested by analysing other protocols.
In the questions that followed the presentation, Dan Nesset claimed 
that whereas, like BAN, the new methodology can show flaws, it cannot 
say if a protocol works as it can only cope with known types of 
attack.
Analysis methods for cryptographic protocols have often focused on 
information leakage rather than on seeing whether a protocol meets its 
goals.  Many protocols, however, fall far short of meeting their goals, 
sometimes for quite subtle reasons.  We introduce a mechanism for 
reasoning about belief as a systematic way to understand the working 
of cryptographic protocols.  Our mechanism captures more features of 
such protocols than that given in a recent work [1], to which our 
proposals are a substantial extension.

Cambridge: Computer Laboratory; 1989 Mar; Technical Report No 164. 
A new key distribution scheme is presented.  it is based on the 
distinctive idea that lets each node have a set of keys of which it 
shares a distinct subset with every other node.  This has the advantage 
that the numbers of keys that must be distributed and maintained are 
reduced by a square root factor; moreover, two nodes can start 
conversation with virtually no delay.  Two versions of the scheme are 
given.  Their performance and security analysis shows it is a practical 
solution to some key distribution problems.

This report details the development of a guard to monitor electronic 
traffic between two computer systems. The guard is intended to 
operate between two computer systems that are accredited to operate 
at different security levels. One system (the high system) must be 
accredited to process all information on the other system (the low 
system). The purpose of the guard is to automate the delivery of 
information from the low system to the high system while preventing 
any flow of information from the high system to the low system.

This paper describes in some detail the way in which Gould have 
incorporated security into their C2 level UNIX system. Support is based 
on integrity domains. It is stated that the mechanisms will also 
support the security labels etc needed for higher levels, but these 
details are 'topics of later presentation'.
Their protected domains are in fact subtrees of the filing system. A 
restricted process cannot 'see' outside its domain. Common facilities 
are handled by a privileged trusted domain containing 'trusted servers' 
accessed via 'secure sockets'. The 'setuid' facility, whereby a process 
can activate a more privileged subtask, is abolished, so all privileges 
must be passed down the hierarchy.

This paper contains a great deal of mathematical notation and is 
therefore fairly hard to follow. The main point of it seems to be to 
retain the name 'Bell and LaPadula model' and applying it to a model 
which includes a lot of useful recent work. It probably has major 
political significance and little technical significance - it may allow 
people to use non-interference while persuading their masters that 
they are using 'Bell-LaPadula' which has been given official blessing.

Note: Introduction: In this paper, we will describe several interesting 
aspects of the development of a formal security policy model for a 
military command and control system. The command and control system 
is being built to meet the B3 division and class of DoD 5200.28-STD. 
This paper will discuss the real world issues involved in developing a 
useful and accurate model of a very complex security policy. The policy 
developed for our target application has several interesting features 
and consequently the model is interesting in several respects. The 
system has several policy elements that required some novel 
mathematical approaches. These will be explained in detail in later 
sections. The system development has a long history and there have 
been several other attempts to develop a satisfactory model of the 
policy. These attempts were unsuccessful because they attempted to 
model a very complex security policy through an instantiation of the 
Bell and LaPadula model (BLP). The paper is organized in the following 
manner. We will first discuss several of the unique policy elements. We 
will then discuss the modeling paradigm applied to this problem. This 
will be followed by a discussion of some of the formal techniques used 
in the model. Lastly, we will discuss some of the payoffs that resulted 
from this effort.

Dual Labels Revisited. in: 4th Aerospace Computer Security 
Applications Conference; 1988 Dec 12; Orlando, Florida. USA: IEEE: 
pp.167-172. 
Note: This paper advocates the use of dual labels for data storage, in 
particular in the MITRE Compartmented Mode Workstation (CMW). The 
dual labels are a 'sensitivity label', which has hierarchical and non-
hierarchical components, for use with mandatory access control, and an 
'information label', which has a similar structure, containing 
classification, compartments, codewords and other markings.
The purpose of this arrangement is to allow a 'container' (file) to have 
a different label to the information stored in it. The sensitivity label 
must dominate the information label. The information label of an empty 
file will start low, and move higher as more sensitive information is 
added.
It is claimed that this arrangement is more flexible than single label 
schemes, and cites several possible uses.
The scheme described appears to be workable, but it is not obvious that 
it is necessary to use a complex label such as this . The paper appears 
to be well-considered, but would require more detailed examination 
before a definitive judgement could be reached.
One member of the audience claimed that this work was 'surprisingly  
similar' to a paper which he had presented at the 3rd ACSAC (1987), 
and requested that Graubart's subsequent papers should cite this.

IEEE Comp. Soc. Proc. 1985 Symp. Security and Privacy pp.147-159
This paper describes how a commercial database system - the 
MISTRESS relational DBMS running under UNIX - is being adapted to 
support an integrity lock scheme that uses cryptographic sealing to 
enable multilevel data to be handled securely. It assumes that the UNIX 
system itself is B-level secure, that a secure crypto is available, and 
that the DBMS is too big to validate but can be encapsulated.
The problem of inference via Trojan Horse is not examined.

We explore two approaches to introducing noise into
the bus-contention channel: an existing approach called
fuzzy time, and a novel approach called probabilistic par-
titioning. We compare the two approaches in terms of
the impact on covert channel capacity, the impact on
performance, the amount of random data needed, and
their suitability for various applications. For probabilis-
tic partitioning, we obtain a precise tradeoff between
covert channel capacity and performance.

Gray, James W. (NRL). Probabilistic Interference. in: 1990 IEEE 
Computer Society Symposium on Research in Security and Privacy; 
1990 May 7; Oakland. USA: IEEE; 1990: 170-179. 
Note: This paper reports some results from research of which the goal, 
yet to be realised, is to capture perfectly the notion of non-
interference. A further goal is to generalise perfect noninterference 
as to allow a quantifiable amount (e.g. so many bits/minute) of 
interference.
Gray begins by pointing out some problems with McCulloughs 
restrictiveness generalisation of noninterference. These are:
 It does not preclude timing channels;
 It does not preclude a high event from interfering with the 
probability of occurrence of a low event;
 It cannot be relaxed to allow a small amount of interference.
The aim of this paper is to address the second of these problems.
The kinds of system considered here are those which are genuinely non-
deterministic (as opposed to those which are under specified or what 
we would call loosely specified). Moreover, it is assumed that the 
system designer is using randomness for an explicit purpose, to give 
desirable properties such as fairness, prevention of denial-of-service, 
or security. Thus the designer must specify, and the implementor 
accurately implement, desired distributions.
By way of motivation, an example is given of a system which satisfies 
McCulloughs restrictiveness property, and yet, most of the time, the 
outputs accurately convey something about the inputs.
The heart of the paper is the definition of a property called 
probability-extended-restrictiveness, or P-restrictiveness. This is a 
reformulation of McCulloughs definition for a system model which 
associates a probability with a state-transition. The modified property 
is, very briefly, about the existence of corrections (inputs) for 
perturbations of states for which the probability of transiting to a 
final state equivalent to the unperturbed final state is the same as the 
original probability.
It is emphasised that this is an interim and not a final statement of a 
desirable security-property. A simplifying assumption is made, that 
the correction must be a single event, not an arbitrarily long sequence 
of events. This means that P-restrictiveness is acknowledged to be too 
strong: it excludes some systems which are restrictive and do not 
exhibit probabilistic interference.
A large example is presented of the use of P-restrictiveness to 
distinguish between secure and insecure uses of nondeterminism to 
solve a denial-of-service problem.
Finally, the composability of machines with P-restrictiveness is not 
yet proved. A limited result is given that the composition of P-
restrictive machines is P-restrictive if the machines are synchronised.
Probalistic interference in nondeterministic machines can be exploited 
by trojan horses to reliably leak information to unauthorized users.  
This problem has been noted by other researchers but has not 
previously been addressed.  We extned McCullough's restrictiveness to 
additionally prevent probalistic interference.  Then, to illustrate the 
use of our extension, we devleop a nondeterministic system that solves 
a denial of service problem and use our definition to prove that the 
system is secure.

We describe a general purpose, probabilistic state machine model 
which can be used to model a large class of nondeterministic (as well 
as deterministic) computer systems. We develop the necessary 
probability theory to rigorously state and prove probabilistic 
properties of modeled systems. Then we give a definition of 
information flow security making use of this formalism. Intuitively, 
information flow security is the aspect of computer security concerned 
with how information is permitted to flow through a computer system. 
We prove that our definition of information flow security implies an 
information theoretic definition. Finally, we give a verification 
condition for information flow security and prove that it implies our 
definition of information flow security,.

This paper sets out a second order modal logic for reasoning about 
multilevel security in probabilistic systems. We present a possible 
world semantics and prove that the logic is sound with respect to it. 
The semantics is novel in treating probability measures themselves as 
possible worlds. We give a syntactic definition of security and show 
that the semantic interpretation of our syntactic definition is 
equivalent to an earlier independently motivated characterization, 
Probabilistic Noninterference ([14]). We also look at a syntactic 
representation of Gray's Applied Flow Model (a special case of McLean's 
Flow Model, given in [25]), and discuss the relation between these 
characterizations of security and between their usefulness in security 
analysis. We give a syntactic description of a round-robin server and 
sketch the formal proof of its security.

Secure TUNIS Operating System. in: 1989 IEEE Symposium on Security 
and Privacy; May 1; Oakland, California. USA: IEEE Computer Society; 
1989: 84-93. 
Note: The talk was a faithful presentation of the paper which outlines 
some of the work carried out by the Computer Systems Research 
Institute at the University of Toronto to produce a secure version of 
their UNIX-compatible operating system TUNIS. The authors have a 
prototype of Secure TUNIS.
The authors claim that it is not possible to have a secure version of 
traditional UNIX evaluated above B2. However, TUNIS is much more 
amenable to being made secure than UNIX, and the authors are going for 
B3 and above. The achieving of B3 is made possible because TUNIS has a 
simple structure and is written in the verifiable language Turing Plus. 
This is not the case with UNIX, which has a non-trivial structure and is 
written in C.
The security model for the secure version of TUNIS is a modified 
version of the Bell and LaPadula model. It is not clear from the paper 
what these modifications are, but it is claimed that they are necessary 
to retain compatibility with UNIX. To make it possible to verify the 
operating system as being secure, the authors have identified a two-
fold partition of the kernel. One part dealing with the security policy, 
called the security manager, and the other part dealing with the 
security mechanism.
The security manager is a small, verifiable module through which all 
requests must pass. It has a three-fold action. First, it identifies 
events that would be caused by a request. It then gets the appropriate 
security information using the security mechanism. Finally, if 
everything is OK then it authorises the request and allows security 
mechanism to execute the request. What happens if everything is not OK 
is not made clear.
The authors do not claim that the module has been verified and leave 
open the question of the correct operation of the security mechanism. 
All they say is that the problem of verification has been simplified as 
the security manager and the security mechanism can now be verified 
individually. Although this split is claimed to benefit verification, it is 
also claimed that it is detrimental to efficiency.
This paper will be mainly of interest to those developing secure UNIX at 
B3 or above.

Note: This paper is about the prevention of inference in certain types of 
statistical data, for example census data. For a readable introduction 
to the subject see [Denn82].
The paper gives an algorithm for determining the bounds that can be 
deduced for unknown entries in a two dimensional numerical table (of 
non-negative integers) with known row and column totals. On the basis 
of these bounds the possible threat of inference of other data can be 
determined.
The paper does not contain anything of fundamental interest in security 
except perhaps the design of particular algorithms.
In this paper we reexamine a problem of protecting sensitive data in an 
p by p table of integer statistics, when the non-sensitive data is made 
public along with the row and column sums for the table.  We consider 
the problem of computing the tightest upper bounds on the values of 
sensitive (undicsclosed) cells. These bounds, together with tighest 
lower bounds (which can be efficiently computed [G], define precisely 
the smallest intervals that an adversary can deduce for the missing 
sensitive cell values. Small intervals compromise the security of the 
undisclosed data, and in some cases violate laws on public data 
disclosure.  We showed previously [G] that each (upper and lower) cell 
bound can be computed ?(p?) time by a single network flow 
computation, but that the bounds are not independent so that only ?(p 
log p) upper bounds need to be computed in this (relatively expensive) 
way.  That is, after ?(p log p) initial bounds have been computed, each 
of the remaining (possibly ?(p?) bounds can be computed in constant 
time.  In this note we observe that the number of initial needed bounds 
can be reduced from ?( p log p) to 2p - 1,  by exploiting a recent result 
of Cheng and Hu.

Guttman, Joshua. Information Flow and Variance. 1987. 
A flaw in an operating system that had apparently been verified using 
the information flow technique indicates that the approach, as it has 
been practised, is incomplete. The software tool that was used requires 
a specifications to have a format prone to cause errors, so that a 
modification of the design of the tool is needed. Moreover, the 
verification process was logically incomplete, because flow analysis 
of a version of the specification free of errors yields formulas that can 
be proved only via invariant properties. This observation leads to an 
integration of two techniques for verifying security.
IEEE Comp. Soc. Proc 1987 Symp. Security and Privacy, pp. 67-73
This paper, by an author from MITRE, draws attention to weaknesses of 
the HDM flow analysis tool, and inquires into why a security flaw in a 
design was not discovered by a formal verification process using that 
tool.
Flow analysis is contrasted with consideration of invariants of state 
as a means of verifying security. State-invariant analysis alone is 
incapable of exposing covert channels. Two weaknesses are identified. 
Firstly, the security level of source and target of an information-flow 
must be explicitly supplied, since the tool is unable to deduce it. This 
means including it as an extra parameter in every function call. This is 
confusing and error-prone, since it is not always clear what is source 
and target, so there is a collection of 'rules of thumb'. Apparently, 
'enhanced HDM' also has this undesirable feature, while a MITRE-
developed flow analyser does not.
Secondly, verification through proof of formulae generated by the flow 
analyser is alleged to be logically incomplete, since analysis of a 
specification corrected with regard to errors as above yields formulae 
which can be proved only via invariant properties which presumably are 
unavailable to or unused by the flow analyser. 
The security flaw was not discovered because an error of the first kind 
masked the fact that the system was able to enter a state (which an 
invariant property would have precluded) in which an illegal flow could 
occur.
The paper concludes that flow analysis should be used as a guide to 
which state-invariants need proving. On the face of it this seems not 
unreasonable, but to get the most out of this paper one would appear to 
need a working knowledge of the HDM tool.

Architecture. in: 1990 IEEE Computer Society Symposium on Research in 
Security and Privacy; 1990 May 7; Oakland. USA: IEEE; 1990: 333-344. 
Note: The authors goal is given as compositional verification: 
treatment of systems composed of concurrent processes. Guttman 
claims that trace-based approaches, in the style of CCS or CSP, provide 
powerful specification techniques, but CSP or CCS are hard to use as 
theories in current verification environments, where automated 
support is poor. (We think Edinburgh would dispute this claim, as there 
exists a proof tool for CCS.) The position is taken that specifications 
are theories and requirements are candidate theorems.
Work is in hand to provide such support, but still at an early stage, so 
that the proofs described in the paper were performed manually.
The paper begins by describing a trace-based approach to specification 
not unlike CSP. A possibly novel feature is the use of functions of 
histories to serve the purposes for which other approaches use 
state variables.
The main part of the paper is a verification of the correctness of 
certain security-relevant features of the SCOMP hardware architecture.
The verification of SCOMP actually performed was essentially about 
software, and made some assumptions about the behaviour of hardware. 
This work is an attempt to discharge those assumptions, but in turn 
seems to need some assumptions about software, which are said to be 
uncontroversial (that certain system data structures only get altered 
at certain times). There is a bus connecting CPU, devices, file system, 
paged memory, memory-resident process and page tables and a 
specialised memory-management unit, (SPM), developed for SCOMP. The 
SPM combines the functions of virtual address translation and access 
checking. The virtual memory mechanism applies uniformly to a wide 
range of objects: temporary memory, filestore segments and 
devices.
Correctness conditions are informally stated as:
 On access using a real physical address, the CPU or device is 
executing in ring 0, (most-privileged);
 On access using a virtual address, then
1. The access requested is amongst those permitted - that is, kernel 
software has stored in the process table a suitable descriptor. The 
availability and content of such a descriptor is the means used by the 
kernel to implement the security policy.
2. The accessing process is executing within the ring-bracket (i.e. with 
the privilege specified by the descriptor).
3. The data in the page-frame is an up-to-date copy of the appropriate 
data on filesystem disc.
These conditions are formalised and two theorems are given which 
express satisfaction of the informal correctness conditions. Proofs are 
not given, nor an indication of the cost of proof.
I must confess that I had difficulty in following the exposition in 
detail, and feel that the paper attempts to cram too much material into 
the space available. A treatment at greater length would be much 
better. Interesting nevertheless.

Experience using Two Covert Channel Analysis Techniques on a Real 
System Design. 1986 Apr. 
IEEE Comp. Soc. Proc. 1986 Symp. Security and Privacy pp.14-24
The paper reports an investigation on the abstract model for the 
Honeywell Secure ADA Target (SAT); this is the highest Gypsy-
expressed model for SAT. The investigation concentrated on the covert 
channels (which were defined as information transfer via non-data 
objects, viz. buffer size, device flags, passage of time) to see if they 
could be used in collusion to circumvent the Bell-LaPadula based 
security policy.
Two approaches were used to look at the storage channels: SRI non-
interference, and shared resource analysis.
The SRI property is a version of the Goguen-Messeguer non-interference 
principle, and states that a subject is non-interfering with another 
subject if no action taken by the former can have any effect on the 
latter. A system is multilevel secure with respect to the SRI property 
if the levels form a partially-ordered set, and a subject is non-
interfering with another whenever the level of the former does not 
dominate the level of the latter. Unlike Bell-Lapadula, the SRI model 
considers information to be transferred by the permission or non-
permission to perform an operation; however, as current specification 
and verification methods do not reason about time, only storage covert 
channels are detectable.
The shared resource approach requires enumeration of all shared 
resources that can be referenced or accessed by a subject, coupled with 
careful analysis of each of these to determine whether it can be used 
covertly to transfer information. A flow analyser has been developed 
from the Gypsy optimiser, and this can be used to build up a 'shared 
resource matrix' (SRM) whose rows are shared resources and whose 
columns correspond to the operational primitives; the entries of the 
matrix indicate the possibility of reference and/or modification. The 
matrix reveals areas in which the search for covert channels should be 
concentrated. The authors claim that the SRM method requires both 
experience and a devious mind.
The paper describes the authors experience of these two approaches, 
and describes the channels discovered. Both methods were successful 
in finding covert channels, and are flexible enough to cope with variety 
of security policies. Both require skill in application, though limited 
automation may be possible. The authors state that the non-
interference approach probably cannot be sufficient by itself, that the 
SRM might be, and that a combination of the approaches is likely to be 
sufficient. Much work is required to make the systems usable.

This paper develops and applies a non-interferance formalism of 
multilevel security to the Secure ADA Target (SAT) abstract model, and 
shows that the model is multilevel secure. An analogous formulation is 
produced to handle the type enforcement policy of the SAT machine, and 
generalisations and extensions of both formulations considered.

Note: This paper describes a project to build a security monitor which 
abstracts information about unusual activity by the users of a system, 
which may be an indication of abuse of that system, either by an 
intruder or by a legitimate user  behaving in an illegitimate manner. 
Rather than using an audit log, which collects far too much 
information, the system builds up user profiles of statistical data 
about which services are used, from where, in what manner and at what 
times.

Knowledge, Action and Communication in Distributed Systems: 
Preliminary Report. in: Proceedings 4th Symposium on Principles of 
Distributed Computing; 1985. : ACM; 1985: pp.224-236. 
A formal model is presented that captures the subtle interacrion 
between knowledge, action, and communication in distributed systems.  
The standard notion of protocol by defining knowledge-based protocols 
is extended, ones in which a processor's action may explicitly depend 
on its knowledge.  Also considered is what it means for a processor to 
follow an honest protocol, one where, intuitively, it only sends 
messages that it knows to be true.  Defining these notions turns our to 
be surprisingly delicate.

Assisted Verification System. 1986 Apr. 
IEEE Comp. Soc. Proc. 1986 Symp. Security and Privacy pp.25-33
MUSE is a verification system extending the SRI HDM toolset by 
providing a capability for proving invariants (viz. SSP, Star Property) 
and constraints. MUSE was developed to verify the RAP (a guard 
system); also used for MLO. Invariants are those properties that must 
be true in all states: MUSE allows one to prove an initial state secure, 
and then use induction. Constraints are the expression of relations 
between the states before and after a transition; these have to be 
proven for each transition.
The tools added by Muse consist of parser, merge program (allowing 
independent module development), a formula generator and a theorem 
prover. The theorem prover is interactive since users (specification 
writers) often have a good idea how the proof should go. It produces and 
uses command files, which can be edited to prove new formulae and to 
support proof maintenance. Using these command files, a complete 
proof of RAP takes about 11 minutes on a VAX.
Experience implies that there should be a theorem prover kernel which 
remains stable, with heuristic facilities running on top of this kernel. 
These facilities would change and grow to provide a gradually 
improving user interface, but these would not affect overall reliability.

Washington. USA: NIST/NCSC; 1991; 2: pp.634-643. 
To date, there have been no confirmed incidents of a computer virus 
that specifically targets OS/2 systems. However, the many DOS viruses 
loose in the land do present a real and present danger for OS/2 users 
since most OS/2 systems are capable of running DOS programs, 
including DOS programs that have been infected by a virus. This paper 
describes the danger to OS/2 systems posed by DOS viruses and 
suggests countermeasures that may be employed against viruses in the 
future. The information presented is based on a series of experiments 
conducted with various DOS viruses in a controlled OS/2 environment. 
Some prognosications are also offered as to the form OS/2 viruses may 
take when they are eventually created. A plea is made for the notion 
that security and antiviral features should be built into OS/2 and other 
advanced microcomputer operating systems as an integral component.

A new type of data dependency, the Domain Reduction Dependency is 
defined. Given a set of attributes over which a query is being made, this 
dependency allows one to more accurately predict the probability of 
release of sensitive statistics for that query than could have been done 
with table size alone. In addition, the properties of DRD's provide 
metainformation on the gain and loss of information within a lattice of 
queries through the addition or removal of attributes, from a query set. 
This increased formalism on information loss and gain may provide 
insights which will allow the construction of better techniques for 
protecting the security of future statistical databases.

In 1982, S.Akl and P.Taylor proposed an elegant solution to the 
multilevel key distribution problem, using a cryptographic approach. 
Since then, continuing research has been conducted to try to realize and 
simplify their scheme. Generally speaking, our paper focuses on two 
problems associated with the Akl/Taylor scheme. First, we propose a 
time-memory trade-off technique to overcome the problem in their 
scheme of requiring an extremely large memory space. Second, we 
propose an extended scheme that localizes within a small region as 
much as possible, the inserting/deleting problem associated with the 
Akl/Taylor scheme.

Distribution Scheme for A Large Distributed Network. in: 1989 IEEE 
Symposium on Security and Privacy; May 1; Oakland, California. USA: 
IEEE Computer Society; 1989: 300-309. 
Note: A description was given of a scheme to decentralise the 
responsibility of key distribution to groups in a large distributed 
system. The scheme chosen, in essence, is to arrange a number of key 
centers in a tree structure. The key center responsible for providing a 
session key for a particular group communication session is that key 
center lowest in the tree which has all the communicating users as its 
descendants. It is claimed that this will decrease the load on the root 
node.
The system produces secret keys and can authenticate and be 
authenticated by its users.
The key paradigm is that of safe prime factors of very large numbers. A 
key center high in the tree can calculate the keys of all centers which 
are its descendants, so a successful attack on the root node would 
compromise the whole system. An attack on a subsidiary node 
compromises all of its descendants. On the other hand, no set of 
subsidiary key centers can conspire to compromise a higher node than 
then one which is the lowest ancestor of all of them.
A proposal to remove the vulnerability of the system to root attack 
would be to remove the root (and in general all layers of the tree that 
do not serve the users directly). There then arises the necessity to 
establish a protocol to enable cross-branch key communication.
It seems apparent that the system can address problems of key center 
traffic congestion in very large systems. The amount of information 
that needs to be stored at each key center is very small (a few 
numbers) as keys of descendant centers and users can be calculated at 
will. The problem of vulnerability of the root node is not solved. The 
initial key calculations have to be done somewhere, and there is always 
the probability of a security breach at that time even if the root node 
(and others) are subsequently removed.

This paper proposes two distinct cryptosystems based on Rabin's 
scheme. The first incorporates coding theory and provides encryption 
only. The second provides simultaneously both private encryption and 
digital signature for network users. In the cases where the second 
scheme provides only encryption or only digital signature, the scheme 
provides that the bit ratio between plaintext and ciphertext is 1:1, ie. 
equivalent to that of the RSA scheme.

This paper reports on an investigation of the security issues related to 
Ada runtime support. First, the need to use Ada features requiring 
runtime support is motivated. The paper then describes how the Ada 
Runtime Library in the development environment is transformed to 
become the Ada Runtime System in the operational environment. Key 
security requirements, such as protection of the runtime library in the 
development environment, and design of a security architecture in the 
operational environment are examined. The paper concludes that further 
research is required along with the actual development of trusted Ada 
Runtime Systems.

Wiseman Security policy Model and therefore acts as an example of the 
modelling approach. The specification uses the mathematical notation 
Z, and consequently also acts as an example of the use of Z in 
specifying secure systems. However, it must be noted that an 
appreciation of SERCUS, the model and modelling approach can usefully 
be gained even if the formal specifications are not read. The Terry-

This paper provides an introduction to the SMITE approach to developing 
high assurance secure computer systems. This approach can be 
characterised by a formal method of modelling security policies which 
provides a suitable framework for defining security requirements, and 
kernel software which can implement the model concepts directly. The 
modelling approach is illustrated by an English overview of a model for 
military security. How SMITE solves the common problems of Trojan 
Horses and viruses by using a sophisticated Trusted Path is also 
explained.

An interesting idea which provides an enhancement to a simple

follows a normal password entry. It might provide better security than 
a simple password but I suspect that in practice the algorithm will 
become well known and thus worthless either because it remains the 
same for a very long time or because the method of distributing the 
new algorithms to the users is not well protected.

This book introduces the specification notation Z by presenting a series

demonstrates a style of specification that consists of formal text, to

This paper introduces the Security Model Development Environment 
(SMDE); a suite of prototype tools for the development of secure 
systems. The development of the SMDE was performed under contract 
for the Rome Air Development Center and Strategic Defense Initiative. 
The SMDE is based on a methodology for the construction and analysis 
of security models, which supports the model developer via an iterative 
model design process. The methodology supports a concept of automatic 
rule base generation which required the development of the prototype 
tools and the Common Notation for the expression of security models. 
The prototype tools are the Model Translator Tool (MTT) and the 
Testbed. The MTT automatically generates a rule base from a security 
model and the Testbed simulates the activity of a system using a 
model's rule base. The methodology, together with an extended model 
description, provides support for the automated tools and the impact of 
the methodology on security model development is summarized. The 
SMDE provides an iterative modeling approach that increases the 
productivity of model designers, simultaneously causing the model 
development process to be more accessible.

Computer Security Conference; 1991 Oct; Washington. USA: NIST/NCSC; 
1991; 2: pp.644-653. 
This paper discusses the relationship between the high cost of trusted 
computing and the way security requirements are stated in Request For 
Proposals (RFP's). This is done by introducing four types of trusted 
computer systems: Evaluated, Accredited, Tailored and Customized. 
These types of trusted systems along with their associated costs are 
discussed in detail and it is shown how systems transition from one 
type to the next. Finally, examples are given of how misstated or 
conflicting security requirements in RFP's lead to the development of 
each of these types of systems, thus driving up the cost of trusted 
system acquisition.

A Penetration Analysis of the Michigan Terminal System. 1980 Jan. 
ACM SIGOPS OSR 14(1) pp.7-20
Before the advent of formal verification techniques, penetration 
attacks were the best way of establishing a degree of assurance in the 
correct operation of the security controls of a computer system. Even 
now, such attacks provide a way of checking the completenes of a 
formal specification and verification.
This paper is a description of a successful penetration exercise, 
carried out, with permission, by a group of students on the main 
university computer. The SDC 'Flaw Hypothesis methodology' was used, 
which centres on a three stage cycle for locating faults. Stage 1 
consists in hypothesising flaws, using historical weaknesses and the 
experiences of the team; stage 2 filters the hypotheses to see if the 
flaws exist. Stage 3 completes the cycle by seeing if flaws found are 
representative of more general design weaknesses.
The attack reported in the paper was successful: for example (and most 
seriously) certain system subroutines did not fully check their 
parameters, and so a sequence of operations could be done to boost a 
user process to supervisor status (thus bypassing all further security 
checks). Other faults found included passwords being left in shared 
memory, and the existence of a way of causing the supervisor to loop 
indefinitely.
One of the main conclusions is that for 'reasonably secure' systems, it 
is better to concentrate effort on penetration detection rather than 
patching flaws to prevent attacks succeeding

in: 1990 IEEE Computer Society Symposium on Research in Security and 
Privacy; 1990 May 7; Oakland. USA: IEEE; 1990: 296-304. 
Note: This paper is concerned with the security-related issues of a 
network security monitor in a single broadcast LAN environment such 
as Ethernet. The paper formalises the possible attacks on the network. 
It then goes on to describe the basic strategy used in the network 
monitor, and how the monitor performed.
The paper formalises an attack on the network into three phases, the 
preparation phase, the attack phase, and the post-attack phase.
The network security monitors strategy is to build up a profile of the 
usage of network resources and then compare the current usage with 
the previous history to determine possible security violations. Once a 
security violation has been identified the location of the security 
violation can be discovered by refining the resolution of the monitoring 
in a hierarchical fashion (e.g. going from gateway, to workstation and 
finally to a specific user).
Overall the paper provides a broad description of a network monitor and 
its function.
The study of security in computer networks is a rapidly growing area of 
interest because of the proliferation of networks and the paucity of 
security measures in most current networks.  Since most networks 
consist of a collection of inter-connected local area networks (LANs), 
this paper concentrates on the security-related issues in a single 
broadcast LAN such as Ethernet.  We formalise various possible 
network attacks.  Our basic strategy is to develop profiles of usage of 
network resources and then compare current usage patterns with the 
historical profile to determine possible security violations.  Thus, our 
work is similar to the host-based intrusion- detection systems, such 
as SRI's IDES[9].  Different from such systems, however, is our use of a 
hierarchical model to refine the focus of the intrusion-detection 
mechanism.  We also report on the development of our experimental LAN 
monitor currently under implementation.  Several network attacks have 
been simulated and results on how the monitor has been able to detect 
these attacks are also analyzed.  Initial results demonstrate that many 
network attacks are detectable with our monitor, although it can surely 
be defeated. Current work is focusing on the integration of network 
monitoring with host-based techniques.

for intrusion detection has been demonstrated. This paper discusses 
some of the benefits and drawbacks of trying to detect the intrusive 
activity by analysing network traffic. A general solution, based on 
detecting and analysing abstract objects, is formulated. Finally, 
results from applying the solution are presented.

One of the overwhelming problems that software producers must 
contend with is the unauthorized use and distribution of their products. 
Copyright laws concerning software are rarely enforced, thereby 
causing major losses to the software companies. Technical means of 
protecting software from illegal duplication are required, but the 
available means are imperfect. We present protocols that enable 
software protection, without causing substantial overhead in 
distribution and maintenance. The protocols may be implemented by a 
conventional cryptosystem, such as the DES, or by a public key 
cryptosystem, such as the RSA. Both implementations ar proved to 
satisfy required security criteria.

Detection in Database Management Systems. in: 1988 IEEE Symposium 
on Security & Privacy; 1988 Apr 18; Oakland Ca. Washington DC: IEEE 
Computer Society Press; 1988: pp.96-106. ISBN: 0-8186-0850-1.
Note: This paper deals with the problem of inference, of more-highly-
classified data from aggregation of less-highly-classified data, in 
databases. The author distinguishes between two kinds of inference.
The first kind is called cardinality aggregation. For example, the phone-
book as such may be more highly classified than any name-and-number 
within it. Having given a name to this kind of inference, no more is said 
about it.
The second kind is called inference aggregation. An example is as 
follows: suppose the information is classified about which company 
works on which project. Unclassified information is available about 
companies, employees, meetings and projects, and also the unclassified 
relations company-employs-employee, employee-attends-meeting, 
meeting-is-convened-by-project.
From the available unclassified information, can a plausible inference 
be made about which company works on which project? From our 
knowledge of the real world, we would probably say yes.
The paper advocates a method of detecting such paths of inference, 
based on drawing graphs which are called semantic networks.
As far as I can tell, the situation envisaged is where the database 
relations are entirely ad-hoc, perhaps having grown in an ad-hoc way 
over time, and the analysis to be conducted is after the fact. The author 
seems unaware of, or at least makes no reference to, the mainstream 
ideas in relational database, such as data modelling, the entity-
relationship-attribute class of models or Codd's extended relational 
model. These, together with integrity constraints are intended to 
capture the semantics of the database pretty fully. Thus in the example 
above, if one could deduce with confidence something about the 
company-works-on-project relation, the database designer ought to 
have included an integrity constraint.
I will stick my neck out and assert that the best modern practice in 
database design should be to make all such possible inferences explicit 
from the schema and integrity-constraints.
The author suggests means of analysing inference graphs, and the idea 
of testing possible inference by seeing whether any data is returned 
from specially-designed queries. He also suggests adding, for this 
purpose 'catalytic' data, which might represent common knowledge in 
the real world.
In summary, this paper, although pedestrian in presentation, is 
thought-provoking. It points up the fact that existing security-models 
assume that any piece of data can be classified independently of any 
other. Thus there is a confusion, not yet resolved, between a classified 
piece of paper and a classified fact. Further, we don't yet have good 
models for systems which enforce invariants of state.
Makes seven contributions to security aggregation research.  It 
identifies inference aggregation and cardinality aggregation as two 
distinct aspects of the aggregation problem.  The paper develops the 
concept of a semantic relationship graph to describe the relationships 
between data and then presents inference aggregation as the problem of 
finding alternative paths between vertices on the graph.  An algorithm 
is presented for processing the semantic relationship graph to discover 
whether potential inference aggregation problems exist. A method of 
detecting some aggregation conditions within the DBMS is presented 
which uses the normal DBMS query language and adds additional 
catalytic data to the DBMS to permit a query to make the inference.  
The paper also suggests use of set theory to describe the aggregation 
conditions and the addition of set operations to the DBMS to permit the 
description of aggregation detection queries.

This paper suggests the trusted server as a means of injecting 
multilevel security into applications such as command, control and 
intelligence systems. It presents an example trusted database server 
and a trusted gateway server. A taxonomy is presented for gateway 
servers. Finally, the paper argues that the trusted server is a gap filler, 
in that it can off load much of the security design, maintenance and 
distribution complexity from client systems by permitting lower 
evaluation level clients to be used with the trusted server bearing 
much of the cost of multilevel security.

This book supercedes, expands and illustrates the ideas of the earlier 
paper with the same title. A process is defined as an abstraction of the 
interactions between a system and its environment, and it is shown 
how 'traces' (sequences of actions) record the behaviour of processes. 
Systems consisting of multiple processes are then introduced, and then 
the concept of nondeterminism. The theme is developed to consider 
interprocess communication and shows how systems involving resource 
sharing can be structured and implemented using the CSP methodology.
The book ends with a discussion of alternative approaches and the 
motivation for the CSP approach.

assessment, which is concerned with accidents, and security where 
violations are deliberate. It considers the problems, and concludes that 
the assessment process is still necessarily rather intuitive and should 
not be automated too hastily.

Applications Conference; 1990 Dec; Tucson, Arizona. USA: IEEE 
Computer Society Press; 1990: pp.349-355. ISBN: 0-8186-2105-2.
This paper proposes a new approach, SPI, for adding security to 
existing systems. Security functions are added in series to existing I/O 
paths without modification to the host system internals. The result is 
an I/O pipeline of security functions which is adaptable to both trusted 
and untrusted environments. Security of the physically separated SPI 
architecture is easier to analyze than other security products. 
Additionally, SPI requires no modification to the operating system. 
However, SPI is limited to the host processor interfaces. The SPI 
approach is compared with and contrasted to other ongoing security 
pipeline research. Examples of applications are presented which 
illustrate how security functions are added in a pipeline. These include 
a rogue program controller and intrusion detection systems.

This book introduces local area networks and describes their position 
with respect to the OSI basic reference model and related standards 
(the physical, data link and network layers in particular). A number of 
local area network architectures are surveyed (including, Ethernet, 
Hubnet, Floodnet and binary routing networks), and more detailed 
examples are given in sections on the IBM token ring, the SILK register 
insertion ring and the Tornet 'multimode' ring.
A chapter on the Cambridge Ring and its protocols then serves to 
introduce the main subject of the authors' expertise. The hardware and 
software used to interface computers to the ring at Cambridge is 
described in some detail and the Cambridge Model Distributed System 
is then taken as a local network case study, including an evaluation of 
its performance.
The design and implementation of a high-speed ring network, based on 
the Cambridge Fast Ring is then described. The book is concluded with 
an evaluation of the flexibility and use of local area networks. There is 
a brief but informative suggested reading list at the end.

A cascade problem exists in a network of computers
when data of a security level d can be passed to a user
with a lower security clearance u elsewhere on the
network without having to defeat any single component
of the system that has an accreditation range great
enough to allow users of level u and data of level d on a
single system. An algorithm of time complexity order
O(an3) and space complexity O(an2) is given to solve
the cascade detection problem. Also the cascade
correction problem, to remove all cascading paths from
a network for a given cost, under restrictive conditions is
shown to be NP-Complete.

This paper describes the lattice scheduler. The lattice scheduler is a 
process scheduler that reduces the performance penalty of certain 
covert channel countermeasures by scheduling processes using access 
class attributes. The lattice scheduler was developed as part of the 
covert channel analysis of the virtual machine monitor security kernel 
for the VAX architecture designed to meet the requirements of the A1 
rating from the National Computer Security Center.

This paper describes fuzzy time. This is a collection of techniques that 
reduces the bandwidths of covert timing channels by making all clocks 
available to a process noisy. Developed in response to the problems 
posed by high-speed hardware timing channels, fuzzy time has been 
implemented in the VAX security kernel. The VAX security kernel is a 
virtual machine monitor security kernel for the VAX architecture 
designed to meet the requirements of the A1 rating from the National 
Computer Security Center.

The rapid expansion of computer security information and technology 
has included little support to help the security officer identify the 
safeguards needed to comply with a policy and to secure a computer 
system. Los Alamos is developing a knowledge-based computer security 
system to provide expert knowledge to the security officer. This 
system includes a model for expressing the complex requirements in 
computer security policy statements. The model is part of an expert 
system that allows a security officer to describe a computer system 
and then determine compliance with the policy. The model contains a 
generic representation that contains network relationships among the 
policy concepts to support inferencing based on information 
represented in the generic policy description.

Pollyanna is a simple secure DBMS which utilises polyinstantiation. It 
has been designed and implemented to illustrate the problems which 
may be encountered when applications are built on top of a 
polyinstantiating DBMS. The implementation comprises a front end to a 
standard commercial RDBMS. The front end performs query modification 
and result filtering to achieve security. This document describes 
Pollyanna, the front end software and some of the problems which 
arose during the design of the system.

IEEE Project 802. Local and Metropolitan Area Network Standard. 
ISO/DIS 8802/2, ISO/DP 8802/3, ISO/DP 8802/4, and ISO/DP 8802/5; 
also known as ECMA-80, ECMA-81, ECMA-82, and ECMA-90
This is a set of standards in six parts, published both by the ISO and 
ECMA.
IEEE 802.1 'Overview and Architecture' describes in part a) the 
relationship between the standards, and their relationship to the OSI 
basic reference model. Three layers are defined: logical link control 
(LLC), media access (MAC) and the physical layer. The LLC part presents 
an OSI link layer interface and is common to each of the physical 
standards. The MAC part is media dependent and so is included in each 
of the physical standards. The physical layer coincides with the OSI 
physical layer: each different medium having a its own standard. 
Successive parts deal with addressing and management; architecture 
and internetworking.
IEEE 802.2 defines the Logical Link Control services LLC1, LLC2 and 
LLC3. Each of these is based on the MAC service, which is a basic 
service giving sequencing, non-duplication and error detection, but not 
acknowledgement or flow control. LLC1 is a minor extension of MAC. 
LLC2 is a slightly generalized form of X.25 level 2's LAPB (i.e. HDLC) 
and is connection orientated with a destructive reset, flow control by 
the receiver and full error recovery by retransmission. LLC3 is based on 
a General Motor's protocol, being a slight enhancement of MAC to 
include acknowledgement.
IEEE 802.3, 802.4, 802.5 and 802.6 describe the physical layer for 
various different network types. The first three are respectively 
CSMA/CD (Ethernet type), token bus and token ring networks. The last is 
for a 'Metropolitan network', a broadband system.

This paper presents the design and implementa-
tion of a real-time intrusion detection tool, called US-
TAT, a State Transition Analysis Tool for UNIX. This
is a UNlX-specific implementation of a generic de-
sign developed by Phillip A. Porras and presented in
[Porr92B] as STAT, State Transition Analysis Tool.
State Transition Analysis is a new approach to repre-
senting computer penetrations. In STAT, a penetra-
tion is identified as a sequence of state changes that
take the computer system from some initial state to a
target compromised state.
In this paper, the development of the first USTAT
prototype, which is for SunOS4.1.1, is discussed. US-
TAT makes use of the audit trails that are collected by
the C2 Basic Security Module of SunOS, and it keeps
track of only those critical actions that must occur for
the successful completion of the penetration. This ap-
proach differs from other rule-based penetration iden-
tification tools that pattern match sequences of audit
records.

The architecture for an Embedded Secure Database Management System 
(ESDBMS) applicable to Command, Control, and Communication 
environments is presented. The ESDBMS design consists of three major 
components: 1) the GEMSOS tamperproof security kernel 2) an Embedded 
System Run-time Executive, and 3) the Trusted ORACLE RDBMS. The 
ESDBMS is designed to support a fully-functional DBMS while meeting 
high assurance requirements. Future enhancements to the basic version 
of the ESDBMS are identified which will broaden its applicability.

This is the official ISO definition of the 'seven layer' model.
ISO have attempted to define a generalised but complete list of 
services for 'open systems' intercommunications (OSI). ISO 7498 does 
this by categorising these services into seven 'layers' the concept of 
which it defines first. The description of how these layers were chosen 
(given in an annex), provides an excellent introduction to the layers for 
a novice.
The model has been enhanced by the addition of two addenda, ISO 
7498/DAD1 and ISO 7498/PDAD2. The first of these defines the 
slightly modified services that are associated with connectionless (CL) 
rather than connection orientated (CO) communication and the second 
deals with security services at the various layers. Subsequent ISO 
standardization has resulted in standard services and protocols dealing 
with each of the layers. In time each of these layers will have 
associated or modified standards dealing with the topics presented in 
the addenda, but at the moment (Oct 86) insecure, connection 
orientated work prevails.
Further related standards are also relevant:
Services: Data Link Layer - ISO/DP 8802/1; Network Layer - IS 8348; 
Transport Layer - IS 8072; Session Layer - IS 8326; Presentation Layer 
- ISO/DP 8822; Application Layer (CASE) - ISO/DIS 8649/x.
Protocols: Data Link Layer - ISO/DP 8802/x; Network Layer - ISO/DIS 
8473; Transport Layer - IS 8073; Session Layer - IS 8327; Presentation 
Layer - ISO/DP 8823; Application Layer (CASE) - ISO/DIS 8650/x.

Proposed Draft Addendum 2 to ISO 7498 on Security Architecture (IS 
7498/PDAD 2). 1986. 
DD148:1986. ISO 7498/PDAD 2
This addendum to the basic reference model defines the general 
security-related architectural elements applicable when protection of 
communication between open systems is required. It establishes, 
within the framework of the Basic Reference Model, guidelines and 
constraints to improve existing standards or to develop new standards 
in the context of open systems interconnection in order to allow secure 
communications.
In order to accomplish these stated aims it defines a number of 
security relevant services and proposes mechanisms by which these 
services could be realised. It presents a matrix to show which 
mechanisms are appropriate to which services.
It explains the relationship between services and mechanisms and the 
layered model, and the placement of security services in the actual 
layers of the basic reference (seven layer) model. Appropriate 
mechanisms are given for each. It concludes with a matrix showing the 
layers in which each of the services could be provided.
The document concludes with consideration of the management of 
security: authentication management, access control management, and 
key management in particular.
Two annexes give some background information on security in OSI (a 
reasonably long tutorial), and the justification used for security 
service and mechanism placement. At the beginning of the document a 
number of useful security related terms are defined (which are all used 
in the text).Superseded by T777

This paper describes the design of a prototype intrusion detection 
system for the Los Alamos National Laboratory's Integrated Computing 
Network (ICN). The Network Anomaly Detection and Intrusion Reporter 
(NADIR) differs in one respect from most intrusion detection systems. 
It tries to address the intrusion detection problem on a network, as 
opposed to a single operating system. NADIR design intent was to copy 
and improve the audit record review activities normally done by 
security auditors. We wished to replace the manual review of audit logs 
with a near realtime expert system. NADIR compares network activity, 
as summarised in user profiles, against expert rules that define 
security policy, improper or suspicious behaviour, and normal user 
activity. When it detects deviant (anomalous) behaviour, NADIR alerts 
operators in near realtime, and provides tools to aid in the 
investigation of the anomalous event.

Note: The treatise of the talk was that developing computer security is 
hard. This is, of course, a not entirely new concept to most of the 
community. The perception that increasing determinism (i.e. taking 
design steps) will tend to conflict with maintaining users ignorance 
of aspects of the systems behaviour has been around, certainly in the 
UK community, for some time.
What the author has, I think, succeeded in doing is to make more 
precise this intuition and to pin-point the sources of the problem. This 
should, in principle, help suggest ways around the problem. Alas the 
papers tone in this respect was not one of great optimism. By way of 
example it showed that one obvious strategy for refining a system 
failed. Trying to fix up one information flow often messes up another.
The author refers to the security orderings, denoted , introduced 
previously by him and points out that  and = are fundamentally 
different and should not be confused (but frequently are). Recall that = 
is the CSP satisfaction relation that is essentially about removal of 
non-determinism. Another way of putting this is that information flow 
properties are predicates on the space of processes whilst safety 
properties are generally expressed as predicates on the space of traces 
of a process.
The mathematical content of the paper is high.

Note: Jacob uses the traces model of CSP to model what a user can 
deduce about the behaviour of other users from his observations and 
knowledge of the capabilities of the system. With this framework he 
defines a number of security orderings on systems and goes on to 
define a restriction on information flow.
In more detail, he treats the system as a CSP process, and defines a set 
of events that represents the events a user may participate in, ie the 
'window' through which the user can observe part of the system's 
behaviour. He then defines an infer function for a user for an 
observation.
From these definitions, Jacob constructs a number of security 
orderings on systems. He then defines the restriction of information 
flow on the system, which can be paraphrased as follows:
a. any possible observation that B might make can be explained purely 
by a trace of events about which B is permitted to know; or, turned 
round,
b there is no possible observation l that B can make that could only be 
explained by the occurrence of an event (or events) that B is not 
permitted to know about.
Jacob's formulation was criticised by McCullough on the following 
grounds: it does imply that the 'low' observer u cannot rule out the 
possibility that the 'high' user v did nothing but it does not prevent u 
narrowing down the range of possible behaviours of v. McCullough has 
devised an interesting example of a system that satisfies Jacob's 
restriction of information flow but is clearly highly insecure - see 
either McCullough's paper or the review of it in this report.
A version of integrity that is dual to the restriction of information 
flow can also be described in this formalism, rather as one of the Biba 
policies is given as the dual of the Bell/LaPadula model.
Jacob then goes on to describe what he has called 'security 
specifications'. These are generalizations of the infer functions defined 
previously. Whereas the restriction of information flow defined using 
infer functions allowed only the specification of either no flow or total 
flow between windows, these specifications can allow partial flows. 
These specifications form a lattice.
This paper gives a security and specification-oriented semantics for 
systems.  The semantic model is derived from that for the trace model 
of Hoare's Communicating Sequential Processes and is used to define 
various security concepts, such as multi-level secure systems, trusted 
users and integrity.  An indication is given of how implementations of 
secure systems may be derived from their specifications.

Databases Using Replicated Architecture 
 in: 1990 IEEE Computer Society Symposium on Research in Security and 
Privacy; 1990 May 7; Oakland CA. : pp.360-368. 
Note: This paper describes a synchronisation mechanism for replicated 
databases which is claimed to require only a small amount of trusted 
code but is both fast and secure. The good performance of this 
mechanism is claimed to be a significant advantage compared with 
kernelised databases. The method described appears to be flawed in 
that it works for a strict hierarchy but not for a general lattice.
In a replicated database a separate DBMS (or container) exists at each 
classification level. The container at each security level contains data 
at that level and also copies of all the data at lower levels. When a data 
element is updated the update must be copied to all dominating 
containers to maintain consistency. The paper is concerned with 
achieving consistency while at the same time preserving security.
Two plausible but incorrect solutions are outlined to illustrate the 
problems involved. These are followed by a correct solution, which 
as I remarked above I believe to be flawed. The first incorrect solution 
makes use of a two phase Commit protocol. The container at the 
security level of the change is updated but does not commit. Next all 
dominating containers are updated. Finally, if all the updates have 
failed all are aborted. This can cause a covert channel if one of the 
higher level DBMSs aborts deliberately. The second incorrect solution 
involves the TCB executing the transaction on the container at the 
security level of the transaction as before. This time the transaction is 
committed and only then are updates propagated to all dominating 
containers. This is secure but does not guarantee one copy 
serialisability - hence inconsistencies can occur.
The correct solution is essentially a tightening up of the second 
example above. Each untrusted DBMS follows a strict ordering protocol 
in taking requests from and returning responses to the TCB. This 
protocol gives consistency but not security and so it does not need to 
be trusted. On receiving a change request the TCB commits the change 
at the level of the transaction. Dominating containers are then updated 
one by one according to what is described as a topological ordering 
of the security lattice. The idea is explained by saying that the order of 
updates is such that the security level of each container in the update 
chain dominates the security level of the previous container. However 
this implies that the security lattice can be totally ordered, which is, 
in almost all cases, impossible.
It may well be that the algorithm could be refined to take account of 
this problem, but this will be at the cost of complexity in the trusted 
code. The paper is only worth reading if the reader is working directly 
in the replicated database area and even then it should be treated 
sceptically.
In a multilevel secure database management system based on the 
replicated architecture, there is a separate database management 
system to manage data at or below each security level, and lower level 
data is replicated in all databases containing higher level data.  In this 
paper, we address the open issue of transaction processing in such a 
system.  We give a synchronisation protocol such that it guarantees 
one-copy serializability of concurrent transaction executions, it is 
secure since the information always flows in one direction - from 
databases at lower security classes to databases with higher security 
classes, and it can be implemented in such a way the the size of the 
trusted code (including the code required for concurrency and recovery) 
is small.

This paper makes original contributions in two different areas related 
to the concurrency control in multilevel secure, multi-version 
databases. First, it explores the issue of correctness criteria that are 
weaker than one-copy serializability. The requirements for a weaker 
correctness criterion are that it should preserve database consistency 
in some meaningful way, and moreover, it should be implementable in a 
way that does not require the scheduler to be trusted. This paper 
proposes three different, increasingly stricter notions of 
serializability that can serve as substitutes for one-copy 
serializability. Second, it presents a multi-version timestamping 
protocol that has several very desirable properties: It is secure, 
produces multi-version histories that are equivalent to one-serial 
histories in which transactions are placed in a timestamp order, avoids 
livelocks, and can be implemented using single-level untrusted 
schedulers.

Integrating an Object-Oriented Data Model with Multilevel Security. in: 
1990 IEEE Computer Society Symposium on Research in Security and 
Privacy; 1990 May 7; Oakland. USA: IEEE; 1990: 76-85. 
Note: There has been a spate of papers about MLS object-oriented 
DBMSs recently. From a security point of view this is a slightly 
simpler problem than for general object-oriented systems because of 
the restricted nature of objects.
An object-oriented database consists of a collection of objects 
containing a set of attributes. Each attribute has a value. Access to the 
attributes is by means of methods associated with the object. 
Examples of simple methods could be the operations of reading or 
writing values of attributes. A method is invoked by a message sent to 
an object (by another object). The success or failure of a method, along 
with other data, is returned to the invoker as part of the request.
These objects are unlike the traditional objects of security in that they 
are active, i.e. they are really subjects, although they do preserve data. 
Attributes are equivalent to fields in a record. Methods are small 
programs.
In this model, information can flow either when an object is created or 
when a message is passed between objects. In order to control 
information flow a message filter is proposed.
Objects have a security class. Messages have a status, unrestricted or 
restricted. If a message is restricted then it may not affect the 
attributes of the destination object and the status of any resulting 
messages must also be restricted.
Information flow is controlled in four cases:
 if the security class of a destination object is the same as that of 
the source there is no restriction;
 if the security class of a destination object is not related to that of 
the source no message may pass;
 if the security class of a destination object strictly dominates that 
of the source the method is invoked but the message filter returns the 
value nil so no returned data flows downward;
	if the security class of a source object strictly dominates that of 
the destination the message filter sets the status of the message to 
restricted so data can be read but not written.
Timing channels are not controlled by this mechanism. Further 
restrictions are present when an object sends a message to itself.
Since the system is object-oriented there are two other types of 
information flow to be controlled:
 class-instance flow where information flows from a class to its 
instances;
 inheritance flow where, if an object which inherits attributes and 
methods from an ancestor, the security class of the object must 
dominate the security class of the ancestor.
The first case is controlled by the message filter because object 
creation is performed through messages. The second case is not 
controlled.
Although this scheme was expected to be implemented on a secure 
machine with a conventional security kernel architecture it is expected 
that the filter could perform a security critical role. In this case, an 
object can have untrusted methods. In this case the message filter 
needs to know if any attributes have changed or prevent any attributes 
from changing, and enforce the restricted status of resulting messages.
For a clearer exposition of an MLS object-oriented data model see 
[Lunt89]. However, use of the message filter to replace a security 
kernel, although currently undeveloped, is an idea worth watching.
We present a new security model for object-oriented database systems.  
This model is a departure from the traditional security models based on 
the passive object - active subject paradigm.  Our model is a flow 
model whos main elements are objects and messages.  An object 
combines the properties of a passive inofrmation repostory with those 
of an active agent.  Messages are the main insturment of information 
flow.  The chief advantages of the proposed model are its compatibility 
with the object-orientated data model and the simplicity with which 
security policies can be stated and enforced.

Jajodia, Sushil; Sandhu, Ravi (George Mason University). A Novel 
Decomposition of Multilevel Relations into Single-Level Relations. in: 
1991 IEEE Computer Society Symposium on Research in Security and 
Privacy; 1991 May; Oakland, California. USA: IEEE Computer Society 
Press; 1991: pp.300-313. ISBN: 0-8186-2168-0.
In this paper we give a new decomposition algorithm that breaks a 
multilevel relation into single-level relations and a new recovery 
algorithm which reconstructs the original multilevel relation from the 
decomposed single-level relations. There are several novel aspects to 
our decomposition, and recovery algorithms which provide substantial 
advantages over previous proposals: (1) Our algorithms are formulated 
in the context of an operational semantics for multilevel relations, 
defined here by generalizing the usual update operations of SQL to 
multilevel relations. (2) Our algorithms, with minor modifications, can 
easily accommodate alternative update semantics which have been 
proposed in the literature. (3) Our algorithms are efficient because 
recovery is based solely on union-like operations without any use of 
joins. (4) Our decomposition is intuitively and theoretically simple 
giving us a sound basis for correctness. In this paper we also argue that 
some of the alternate update semantics which have been proposed for 
multilevel relations should be available as options, but should certainly 
not be made an integral part of the data model.

Polyinstantiation Integrity in Multilevel Relations. in: 1990 IEEE 
Computer Society Symposium on Research in Security and Privacy; 
1990 May 7; Oakland. USA: IEEE; 1990: 104-115. 
Note: This paper is a critique of (a slightly out of date) version of the 
SeaView multilevel relational data model.
SeaView is probably the most extensively discussed multilevel 
database model. It is a product of some of the best US researchers in 
the field. One of the most significant and controversial aspect of 
SeaView is that it embraces polyinstantiation. This is where, to 
prevent covert information flows, a database stores different 
information about the same entity at different security classes  the 
lower security class data can also be used to give cover stories.
The paper explores three main areas of SeaView:
 the Inter-Instance Property, which is about the relationship between 
views at different classifications of a relation instance;
 the multivalued dependency (MVD) requirement of Polyinstantiation 
Integrity, which is required for consistency of updates;
 the correctness of the lossless decomposition of multilevel 
relations.
The paper has already been overtaken by events for the suggested 
modification to the Inter-Instance Property. It has been incorporated 
into the latest version of the SeaView security model ([Lunt90]).
As this paper shows in figures 4 and 5, the MVD in SeaView can result 
in a large proliferation of elements. Jajodia and Sandhu argue also that 
useful meanings can be assigned for instances of relations without the 
MVD requirement. However, these new instances admit different 
descriptions of an entity which are at the same classification where no 
decision can be taken as to which description is to be chosen.
For decomposition of relations Jajodia and Sandhu use a more complete 
key and store null values in decomposed relations. Also they use natural 
joins rather than outer joins in the recovery. They argue that 
decomposition in SeaView has not been analysed as rigorously as other 
areas and that their use of natural joins considerably simplifies a very 
difficult area. However, even Jajodia and Sandhus decomposition work 
is not yet complete.
Polyinstantiation integrity (PI) as defined in the Sea View multilevel 
relational data model consists of a functional dependency component 
and a multivalued dependency component.  We show that the latter 
component rules out many practically useful relations and is therefore 
unduly restrictive.  This leads us to propose that PI be defined to 
consist only of the functional dependecny component.  For this revised 
definition of PI, we formulate and prove correct a lossless 
decomposition of multilevel relations into single level ones with 
recovery based on the natural join operation.

In this paper we give a formal operational semantics for update 
operations on multilevel relations, ie. relations in which individual 
data elements are classified at different levels. For this purpose, the 
familiar INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE operations of SQL are suitably 
generalized to cope with polyinstantiation. We conjecture that these 
operations are consistent (or sound) in that all relations which can be 
constructed will satisfy the basic integrity properties required of 
multilevel relations. We also conjecture that the operations are 
complete in that every multilevel relation can be constructed by some 
sequence of these operations.

SRI International's real-time intrusion-detection expert system (IDES) 
system contains a statistical subsystem that observes behavior on a 
monitored computer system and adaptively learns what is normal for 
individual users and groups of users. The statistical subsystem also 
monitors observed behavior and identifies behavior as a potential 
intrusion (or misuse by authorized users) if it deviates significantly 
from expected behavior. The multivariate methods use to profile normal 
behavior and identify deviations from expected behavior are explained 
in detail. The statistical test for abnormality contains a number of 
parameters that must be initialized and the substantive issues relating 
to setting those parameter values are discussed.

Trojan horses, viruses, worms, and other malicious logic that seek to 
interrupt service or modify or destroy data are not necessarily 
defeated by confidentiality mechanisms. The Air Force Trusted Critical 
System Evaluation Criteria (AFTCCSEC) supplements confidentiality 
requirements found in the Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria 
(TCSEC) by addressing integrity and service assurance. This paper 
introduces and describes criticality division/class G2 found in the 
AFTCCSEC. The approach imposes mandatory controls including access 
constraints, type enforcement, detection techniques, and use of a 
resource scheduling architecture. It applies to all life-cycle phases: 
development, distribution, operations, and maintenance. Features 
include program/data isolation (eg. physical, logical or use of 
cryptography), protection against covert criticality channels (that 
allow malicious code insertion), and strict configuration control of 
software and hardware. Any TCSEC division.class and G2 criticality can 
coexist, though retrofit of G2 will require an existing TCSEC TCB of B1 
or higher. This paper provides a basic understanding of the concepts and 
policy, and also addresses questions most often asked by reviewers of 
the AFTCCSEC document.

Air Force missions could be forced to fail by an enemy agent launching 
a malicious logic attack. These missions must be protected. Because of 
the imminent, potential danger, a protection approach has been 
developed that is easily understood and implemented for a minimum 
cost - because it uses Orange Book methods and mechanisms. The 
criteria for protection of critical systems are given as the G3 
division/class of the Air Force Trusted Critical Computer System 
Evaluation Criteria (AFTCCSEC).

StarOS is a message based, object orientated multi-processor 
operating system specifically designed to support large collections of 
concurrently executing cooperating processes.
It is an object orientated system where all information is encoded and 
stored in typed objects. The type of an object determines the set of 
functions which can be performed on the object and hence the behaviour 
of the object. To access an object or alter information stored in it, a 
process invokes some function of the object's type. In order to do this 
it requires a capability for that object.
It ran on a cluster of LSI-11s (up to 14) linked together by a memory 
mapping bus. The various clusters, of which there could be an unlimited 
number, were connected to inter-cluster busses by a processor in each 
cluster. A processor could map chunks of its 64K name space onto 
objects (i.e. load them into store) as long as the processor contained 
the relevant capabilities in its capability name space.

Note: This paper describes how two techniques proposed to increase 
reliability can be used to provide protection against attacks by 
computer viruses.
It starts off by characterising a computer virus in reliability terms: it 
is a deliberate design fault; when triggered, the error it causes is a 
change in an executable file. The error in turn causes other errors in 
the 'normal' way it does in the case of a random fault (except with a 
virus the propogated errors are all of the same type).
The two techniques suggested to counter the problem are the use of 
Program Flow Monitors (PFMs) which try to detect errors, and of n-
version programming (NVP) which attempts to detect deliberate or 
accidental design faults before they can cause errors.
PFMs are hardware-based mechanisms to check that the dynamic 
behaviour of a program is 'as expected' - for example, compilers and 
assemblers could generate signatures for each section of code without 
branches or subroutine calls, and the PFM could then be loaded with 
these when a program is run, generate its own version on the fly and 
check the actual matches up to the expected value whenever a control 
flow change occurs.
NVP requires that n (greater than 2) versions of a program are designed 
and implemented independently from a common specification; all 
versions are then run concurrently on a multi-processor computer (or 
pseudo-concurrently on a single processor), with a consensus being 
required at certain points. (A weaker form would require them all to 
run together during a prolonged testing phase, with a randomly-chosen 
one being used thereafter, but this is susceptible to deliberate design 
flaws).
Where either of the above techniques are required for reliability 
reasons, then to extend their scope to cover security is a sensible 
action. However, if security is the primary concern, then both 
techniques can substantially increase the cost of the hardware; in 
addition, neither technique is fully accepted within the fault-tolerance 
community, and in particular the virtues (or lack of them) of the NVP 
technique would appear (from the discussions that followed the 
presentation) to be the subject of much acrimonious debate.
The applicability of fault tolerance techniques to computer security 
problems is currently being investigated at the UCLA Dependable 
Computing and Fault-Tolerant Systems Laboratory.  A recent result of 
this research is that extensions of Program Flow Monitors and N-
Version Programming can be combined to provide a solution to the 
detection and containment of computer viruses.  The consequence is 
that a computer can tolerate both deliberate faults and random physical 
faults by means of one common mechanism.  Specifically, the technique 
described here detects control flow errors due to physical faults as 
well as the presence of viruses.

	The idea of using formal logic to reason about small fragments or 
single layers of a software/hardware system is well-established in 
computer science and computer engineering.  Recently, formal logic has 
been used to establish correctness properties for several realistic 
systems including a commercially-available microprocessor designed 
by the British Ministry of Defence for life-critical applications.  A 
challenging area of new research is to verify a complete system by 
linking correctness results for multiple layers of software and 
hardware into a chain of logical dependencies.
	This dissertation focuses specifically on the use of formal proof 
and mechanical proof-generation techniques to verify microprocessor-
based systems.  We have designed and verified a complete system 
consisting of a simple compiler for a hierarchically  structured 
programming language and a simple microprocessor which executes 
code generated by this compiler.  The main emphasis of our discussion 
is on the formal verification of the microprocessor.  The formal 
verification of the compiler is described in a separate paper included 
as an appendix to this dissertation.
	Combining correctness results for the compiler with correctness 
results for the microprocessor yields a precised and rigorously 
established link between the formal semantics of the programming 
language and the execution of compiled code by a model of the 
hardware.  The formal proof also links the hardware model to the 
behavioural specification of an asynchronous memory interface based 
on a four-phase handshaking protocol.
	The main ideas of this research are 1) the use of generic 
specification  to filter out non-essential detail, 2) embedding natural 
notations from special-purpose formalisms such as temporal logic and 
denotational description, and 3) the use of higher-order logic as a 
single unifying framework for reasoning about complete systems.
	Generic specification, in addition to supporting fundamental 
principles of modularity, abstraction and reliable re-usability, 
provides a mechanism for enforcing a sharp distinction between what 
has and what has not been formally considered in a proof of 
correctness.  Furthermore, it is possible to create generic 
specificaiotn in a pure formalilsm with the expressive power of 
higher-order logic without inventing new constructs.
	Natural notations from special-purpose formalisms offer the 
advantage of concise and meaningful specifications when applied to 
particular areas of formal description.  Semantic gaps between 
different notation are avoided by embedding them in a single logic.  
Special-purpose rules based on these notations can be derived as 
theorems with the aim of implementing more efficient proof 
strategies.
	Finally, it is argued that the primary purpose of using mechanical 
proof generation techniques to reason about software and hardware is 
to support the intelligent participation of a human verifier in the 
rigorous analysis of a design at a level which supports clear thinking.

Most current trusted automated information systems do not allow 
changes to or extensions of the access control policy implemented by 
the system vendor. This closed approach to access control can restrict 
the operation of site applications and commercial off-the-shelf 
applications on trusted systems. This paper presents a flexible, open 
access control framework that provides relief from these restrictions. 
A network license mechanism is used to illustrate the problem and the 
applicability of the framework.

A capability is a precomputed access permission; it often viewed as a 
ticket, and in this case must be unforgeable. The paper claims that 
capability systems can be categorised by the answers to certain key 
questions, viz. what happens: when a capability is created (access 
rights might or might not be added); to the capabilities for a segment if 
the security aspects of that segment are altered (access rights might 
or might not be altered, or they could be flagged as needing change); 
when a capability is copied (access rights could be further restricted, 
set to some suitable maximum or correctly updated by software, or left 
unaltered); when a capability is prepared for access (access rights 
could be further restricted, set to some suitable maximum, or left 
unaltered); and, when the processor attempts to access something (no 
checks could occur, or access rights could be checked against available 
rights, or attempted access could be checked against the computed 
maximum rights)?
Using this taxonomy, the differences between various proposed and 
existing capability systems can be drawn out. In addition, the paper 
shows by examination of the star property how the taxonomy can be 
used to check the suitability of a particular system for a given security 
policy.
When the paper was presented to the IEEE symposium on Security and 
Privacy, a slightly different formulation of these key questions was 
used: when are basic access rights established; what is the timing of 
Discretionary Access Control; what are the limits on capability 
sharing; what is process of preparing to access; and, how expensive are 
runtime checks.

Note: Karger addresses how the Clark and Wilson data integrity model, 
first presented at the previous year's IEEE Security and Privacy 
Symposium, can be implemented on a particular secure capability 
architecture (SCAP).
There are two techniques at the heart of the proposed implementation. 
The first is to enhance the capabilities to support tokens which 
identify who (or what) can use the capability and to prevent multiple 
use of a particular capability. The second is a proposal for Access 
Control List constructs to efficiently support the Clark and Wilson 
model. The proposed constructs are more complex than those found in 
currently available operating systems.
The paper then goes on to briefly examine a range of related work and 
to compare it with Karger's proposals.
Overall the paper covers a wide range of issues relating to integrity 
models, addressing none in any particular depth.
The contents of the paper do not appear to be of immediate interest to 
the CESG Secure Distributed System work, although it should be of 
interest to anyone considering the problems of implementing Integrity 
policies.
Examines the Clark and Wilson model for commercial data integrity and 
proposes an implementation based on the author's secure capability 
architecture.  The paper shows how secure capabilities and protected 
subsystems are ideal for implementing commercial data integrity, but 
also raises areas where the Clark and Wilson model may have 
difficulties in actual use.  The level of formal verification required 
appears higher than most commercial systems would be willing to try, 
and the user interface for specifying separation of duties appears 
extremely complex..

Karger, Paul A. Limiting the Damage Potential of Discretionary Trojan 
Horses. 1987. 
Many discretionary Trojan Horse attacks can be defeated by a table-
driven file name translation that has knowledge of the normal patterns 
of use of a computer system. File name translation is built into a 
protected subsystem, and the human user is queried about possible 
violations of discretionary access control policies. The technique is 
most effective against unauthorized tampering or sabotage and can be 
used in conjunction with non-discretionary security controls.
IEEE Comp. Soc. Proc 1987 Symp. Security and Privacy, pp. 32 - 37
Capability systems can in theory provide a great deal of protection to 
their users, but in practice they are rarely implemented in this way. 
For a variety of reasons, application and system programs are rarely 
constrained in their operation despite the fact that the technology was 
designed to do precisely this.
The main reason for the lack of constraints on programs is the need for 
users to be able to refer to their files by name. This in turn means that 
the runtime environment for a program will provide a way of converting 
names - such as those the user may supply as parameters to the 
program - to capabilities; consequently, the program is not restricted 
to accessing just those files the user intended.
Karger suggests that the standard command line interpreter, or 'shell', 
should be expanded to know - by means of tables - the expected file 
access activity of each program. By analysing the command line typed 
by the user to activate the program, and checking a file open request by 
the program against this analysis, the system will be able to detect 
unusual requests. The user could then be directly interrogated by the 
system, who would be able to permit or deny these requests.
The scheme, operating purely on the basis of the names of objects, 
cannot enforce classification-based rules on the release of 
information, nor can it ensure that proper use is made of the objects 
that the program is expected to access; all it can do is to stop certain 
types of attempts to subvert the 'discretionary' (not label-based) 
controls. The scheme is thus suitable for providing an extra level of 
control on top of more standard mechanisms for implementing access

Immediate Revocation. in: 1989 IEEE Symposium on Security and 
Privacy; May 1; Oakland, California. USA: IEEE Computer Society; 1989: 
48-55. 
Note: The presentation opened with an explanation of why immediate 
revocation (of access rights) is necessary. The author explained that 
aside from the obvious advantage of revoking access rights at the 
earliest opportunity, immediate revocation is a prerequisite for 
immediate deletion of objects and that immediate deletion is required 
in order to prevent some types of storage channel in connection with 
storage quotas.
He then went on to explain that in the past, difficulties had been 
encountered in implementing immediate revocation in operating 
systems such as Multics. These difficulties, and performance issues 
had been noted by the policy makers who had then stopped putting 
immediate revocation into their policies.
Two current schemes for implementing immediate revocation, 
Revocation with Back Pointers (as used in Multics), and Redells 
Revocation with Indirection, were explained and the author then moved 
on to explain two new schemes. Revocation with Eventcounts and 
Revocation by Chaining.
Basically, Revocation with Eventcounts makes use of Reed and 
Kanodias eventcounts to keep track of whether a processs access to 
an object is up to date. If it is not, then its access rights are re-
computed. The author pointed out that this scheme was most applicable 
to systems that use shared page tables.
Revocation by Chaining is only applicable in systems that have multiple 
page table entries for shared objects. The scheme involves adding an 
extra field to each entry. This extra field is used to link all of the 
entries for each object into a circular chain which the operating 
system can then follow relatively easily.

This paper is a study of the covert storage channels found in disk I/O 
optimization schemes. It examines the source of the problems in the 
context of various disk architectures, proposes several classes of 
generic solutions and concludes with recommendations for future 
storage-system architectures. The work was done as part of the covert

in: 1990 IEEE Computer Society Symposium on Research in Security and 
Privacy; 1990 May 7; Oakland. USA: IEEE; 1990: 2-19. 
Note: This paper was adjudged the joint 'Best Paper' at the symposium 
at which it was presented. It is required reading for anyone involved in 
designing systems based on Virtual Machine Monitors. It also provides 
an excellent example of a real, production quality, security kernel.
The aim of the project was to develop a Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM) 
for the VAX Architecture. The VMM was to support the VMS and ULTRIX 
Operating Systems. The product was to take a step forward from the 
research quality security kernel implementations that have been 
developed over recent years and to develop a properly engineered 
production quality security kernel. The VMM is currently in the Design 
Analysis Phase of evaluation at NCSC.
This paper gives an overview of the VMM. The original idea for this 
work was discussed in 1981. The paper acknowledges some fifty people 
who played a direct part in its development. It is a substantial effort.
Steve Lipner, who heads the Security Group at DEC, said that DEC were 
not planning to offer the VMM as a commercial product. He said that 
this decision was a commercial judgement and not a technical one. He 
added that if the commercial situations changed then he saw no 
technical problems in offering the product. However, he also said that 
the market for A1 products was small and that US export restrictions 
effectively cut off some 50% of his potential market. This point came 
up again later in the conference and was clearly of serious concern to 
him.
A VMM is not the same as a security kernel. However, the paper states 
that the requirements for A1 caused them to omit some features 
traditionally seen in Virtual Machine Monitors. The VMM is therefore 
primarily a security kernel and the paper tends to use the terms 
interchangeably.
It was necessary to make a small number of changes to the microcode 
to virtualise the VAX architecture. These ensure that unprivileged code 
may not access the privileged state of the processor. All such 
attempted accesses are trapped. A further change to the Architecture 
is that the four rings available to an Operating System on a VAX 
processor are compressed to three on the VMM. This is achieved by 
concatenating the innermost two rings (executive mode and kernel 
mode) into one. This could cause problems if an Operating System 
running on the VMM had some inbuilt security features. However, the 
paper states that ULTRIX doesnt make use of the distinction between 
the two modes and that VMS uses it only for reliability purposes.
The security kernel is designed in layers with the usual rules that 
layers should only make use of facilities provided by lower layers. Each 
layer has no knowledge of higher layers. This abstraction is an 
excellent one to adapt from the point of view of modularity and 
simplicity. Unfortunately some aspects of security kernel cannot be 
described (sensibly) in this way. See the audit paper for an example of 
this happening and the ingenious solution (patch ?) used to get round it. 
Each layer is, in effect, a reference monitor in its own right since it 
has layer specific subjects and objects and a consequent need to 
mediate accesses.
The approach to I/O is very different to the memory-mapped approach 
traditionally offered by DEC processors. The reason for this is simply 
performance. Each access to a CSR (control and status register) would 
need to be trapped by the VMM is the conventional method was adopted. 
Instead I/O is provided by a kernel call. This approach improves I/O 
performance dramatically but has the disadvantage that untrusted 
virtual device drivers need to be written for each Operating System 
running on the VMM.
The VMM was coded in MACRO, PL/I and PASCAL. MACRO was used where 
enhanced performance was required. The authors remark that the 
switch from PL/I to PASCAL caused many bugs due to programmers 
misunderstanding the parameter passing mechanisms of the two 
languages. The switch was made because of the stronger typing offered 
by PASCAL and because a high quality PASCAL compiler became 
available during the project. The kernel contains 49K executable 
statements of which some 11K are in MACRO. DEC claim that 
performance is 30% to 90% of VMS performance depending on workload.
DEC have given considerable thought to the design of the interface 
between the user and the TCB. The requirement for A1 demands 
simplicity and verifiability while the user wants a friendly, relatively 
sophisticated interface, which means lots of code. DEC have divided 
trusted user commands into two groups: Secure Server commands and 
SECURE Commands. The idea is that Secure Server commands should be 
the ones that the user is using constantly such as login, logout and 
connect/remove VM requests. SECURE commands are more 
administrative in nature and are more likely to be used by the System 
Manager, the Operators and the Auditor. However there is no prohibition 
on the ordinary user using SECURE commands. Secure Server commands 
are implemented in the conventional way by means of a trusted path 
invoked by a Secure Attention Key. SECURE commands are passed 
directly by the untrusted Operating System. The Operating System then 
invokes a kernel call to action the command. Before executing the 
command the kernel forces the user to hit the Secure Attention key and 
informs him of the command to be executed. The user can choose to 
proceed or abort. (Note that Figure 5 which is supposed to give an 
example, is missing.)
The paper gives the impression that the A1 requirements for 
modularity, simplicity and layering were very strong influences on the 
design. Conversely the use of Formal Methods appears to be almost an 
afterthought. The language used is InaJo. The FTLS is not yet complete 
but is expected to contain about 12K lines of InaJo. This gives a ratio 
of 4:1 between FTLS and code compared with the often quoted estimate 
of 10:1. The Security Policy Model is, of course, based on Bell and 
LaPadula.
The paper also discusses various aspects of the management of the 
system development process. It is interesting that the team are using 
the kernel itself as their development machine. They claim that this 
has helped to keep performance near the top of their list of objectives!
Overall an excellent paper that should be read by all with a serious 
interest in security kernel design.
Describes the development of a virtual machine monitor (VMM) security 
kernel for the VAX architecture.  The paper particularly focuses on how 
the system's hardware, microcode, and software are aimed at meeting 
A1-level security requirements while maintaining the standard 
interfaces and applications of the VMS and ULTRIX-32 operating 
systems.  The VAX security kernel supports multiple concurrent virtual 
machines on a single VAX system, providing isolation and controlled 
sharing of sensitive data.  Rigorous engineering standards were applied 
during development to comply with the assurance requirements for 
verification and configuration management.  The VAX security kernel 
has been developed with a heavy emphasis on performance and on 
system management tools.  The kernel performs sufficiently well that 
all of its development is now carried out in virtual machihes running on 
the kernel itself, rather than in a conventional time-sharing system.

Currently there is a great deal of interest concerning polyinstantiation 
in database management systems (DBMS's). However, polyinstantiation 
is a specific solution to a problem faced by all secure systems, and the 
problem itself is not well characterized. The problem stems from the 
interference between subjects of different security compartments. The 
paper focuses on this problem which we have named Multi-party Update 
Conflict (MUC). We discuss and evaluate some solutions to the MUC 
problem, such as polyinstantiation and rigid classification. We describe 
a framework for a class of MUC solutions based on polyinstantiation, 
and enumerate several intermediate solutions between rigid 
classification and polyinstantiation.

Systems. in: 1990 IEEE Computer Society Symposium on Research in 
Security and Privacy; 1990 May 7; Oakland. USA: IEEE; 1990: 369-383. 
Note: This paper discusses scheduling in Multi-Level Secure Databases. 
It is largely concerned with developing a theoretical framework for 
talking about scheduling and the properties of schedulers. It is fairly 
tightly tied in to the database environment. The paper is quite an 
enjoyable read, but ultimately I doubt that it contains much of use to 
people engaged in developing real schedulers. In particular the topic of 
timing channels, which is critically important in most scheduler 
designs is ignored.
The paper defines three kinds of security property: BL-secure, DC-
secure and CC-secure. BL-secure means secure against Bell and 
LaPadula; DC-secure means that there are no covert storage channels 
(DC stands for Data Conflict) and CC-secure means that there are no 
covert channels. Surprisingly the set of CC-secure systems is non-
empty - but then this is a theoretical paper! The paper concentrates on 
DC-security. The meat of the paper is concerned with multi-version 
scheduling, so that the database stores more than one version of 
objects.
A transaction consists of a sequence of actions. The scheduler regards 
actions as atomic events but may interleave actions from several 
transactions, thus creating potential interference between 
transactions. A transaction is, in the cases dealt with, carried out on 
behalf of one subject. Hence a transaction may be regarded as a single 
class event. The case of a principal subject making use of co-operating 
subjects at different clearances is mentioned but not addressed in 
detail. If a schedule can be expressed as a serial execution of its 
component transaction it is said to be serialisable. This is a desirable 
property because it separates contention within a security level from 
contention between security levels and so makes the analysis simpler. 
The paper explores classes of scheduler which do have such 
serialisability properties. An example is given of a scheduler which can 
be serialised in the multi-version case. The scheduler is shown to be 
DC-secure.
The paper draws heavily on the work of earlier papers and uses a lot of 
database jargon. As a result it is quite an effort to get through to the 
fundamentals of the work. It also suffers from a lack of formality in 
places, which makes some of the definitions ambiguous, and so casts 
doubts on the results obtained. However it makes an interesting change 
from the run of the mill database papers.
In this paper, we consider the application of multiversion schedulers in 
Multilevel Secure Database Management Systems (MLS/DBMSs).  
Transactions are vital for MLS/DBMSs because they provide 
transparency to concurrency and failure.  Concurrent execution of 
transactions may lead to contention among subjects for access to data, 
which in MLS/DBMSs may lead to security problems.  Multiversion 
schedulers reduce the contention for access to data by maintaining 
multiple versions.  We describe the relation between schedules 
produced in MLS/DBMSs and those which are multiversion serializable.  
We also propose a secure multiversion scheduler.  We show that the 
scheduling protocol outputs correct schedules and is free of covert 
channels due to contention for access to data, i.e. the scheduler is Data 
Conflict-Secure (DC-Secure).

This paper examines three techniques for evaluating the logical 
consistency of an object-oriented Database security model. The first 
technique consists of judging the model with respect to a set of 
general consistency properties for database security models. The 
second technique compares the SODA model against two other database 
security models. The third technique consists of defining a set of 
entities and mechanisms fundamental to the object-oriented model and 
considering the effect on them by the security model. Each of these 
techniques are applied to the Secure Object-oriented DAtabase (SODA) 
security model and are evaluated with respect to their applicability, 
difficulty and usefulness. Using the results of this analysis we 
characterize the consistency of the SODA security model.

The rapid and sometimes poorly-planned introduction of data 
communications technology into the office environment can create 
opportunities for unauthorised access to both computers and data.  
Latest areas of high risk include the proliferation of data 
communications software, cellular telephones, local area networks, 
compact disk media, ISDN services, and satellite communications.  
Security weaknesses in office automation technology are highlighted 
and countermeasures, which minimise the risks while continuing to 
maintain efficient data communications, are recommended.

This paper presents a security policy for Separation Virtual Machine 
Monitors (SVMM's) and interprets Rushby's Separation Model for SVMM's. 
Applying the technique of Rushby yields a practical method for 
demonstrating that an implementation of an SVMM adheres to the 
abstract Isolation Axiom of the Separation Model, thus providing 
relatively strong assurance for a low level of effort. First we describe 
the relevant characteristics of SVMM's, and note the applicable formal 
modeling requirements. Next we present a summary of the SVMM 
Separation Model, a modification of the original model presented by 
Rushby. The Separation Model technique permits a proof of separability 
among the operating systems under control of the kernel of an SVMM. 
We supply an interpretation of the elements of the Separation Model 
using concepts from SVMM's. Finally, we relate this work to similar 
applications of the Separation Model.

Discretionary Access Controls (DAC) in object-oriented databases 
systems (ooDBS) are difficult to realize for several reasons: (1) the 
DAC concepts are more complex than usual due to the complexity of the 
data model and other factors; (2) access controls must often be applied 
to very small data granules if they shall be effective; (3) applications 
require mostly a very high performance of the ooDBS. This paper 
proposes a method for efficiently implementing access control lists 
(ACL's) in main memory ooDBS's. The main features of the method are: 
(1) ACL's are not stored directly, but via ACL numbers. (2) Each process 
has a cache which records results of evaluations of ACL's for this 
process and certain ACL numbers.

Encryption Protocols. 1987. 
This paper presents an approach to analyzing encryption protocols using 
machine aided formal verification techniques. The desirable properties 
that a protocol is to preserve are expressed as state invariants and the 
theorems that need to be proved to guarantee that the cryptographic 
facility satisfies the invariants are automatically generated by the 
verification system. A formal specification of an example system is 
presented, and a weakness that was revealed by testing the formal 
specification is discussed.
IEEE Comp. Soc. Proc 1987 Symp. Security and Privacy, pp. 134 - 139
Richard Kemmerer illustrated an approach to analysing encryption 
protocols using the Ina Jo toolset. The emphasis of the paper is on the 
protocol rather than the encryption algorithm - the only assumption 
made is that decryption is the inverse of encryption.
The paper emphasizes a role for testing in the analysis of formal 
specifications and illustrates this point with an example. For 
Kemmerer's original specification, this shows how a sequence of 
transformations can be exploited to gain a key in the clear. It is 
suggested that testing could be used to confirm a flaw in a protocol 
previously assumed to be secure.
The points made in this paper seem sensible but they appear less 
convincing in the context of the simple example chosen, particularly 
since one of the flaws in the original specification was a previously 
known weakness of the protocol. Furthermore, there are some mistakes 
requiring correction in the formal specification and proofs.

The five volumes in this system cover pretty much the same ground as 
the paper by Cheheyl et al entitled 'Verifying Security' (ACM Computing 
Surveys 13(3), 1979). The areas covered in the volume reviewed here 
are:  thoughts on the general topic of formal verification, including the 
alternatives, is formal verification the best approach, the need for 
formal semantics for the specification language; the relationship 
between security and verification, and the influence the former has had 
on the latter; a description of a state-of-the-art verification system; a 
discussion of what is needed to obtain production quality verification 
systems; comments on the next generation verification systems; a 
discussion of the verifiability of Ada; and finally, possible research 
directions.
The remaining four volumes discuss the Gypsy, Affirm, FDM and HDM 
verification systems respectively. Each volume includes introductory 
remarks, a critique, a response to that critique by the system 
developers, and worked examples

Despite serious concerns raised by the proven ability of computer 
viruses to spread between individual systems and establish themselves 
as a persistent infection in the computer population, there have been 
very few efforts to analyze their propagation theoretically. The strong 
analogy between biological viruses and their computational 
counterparts has motivated us to adapt the techniques of mathematical 
epidemiology to the study of computer virus propagation. In order to 
allow for the most general patterns of program sharing, we extend a 
standard epidemiological model by placing it on a directed graph and 
use a combination of analysis and simulation to study its behavior. We 
determine the conditions under which epidemics are likely to occur, and 
in cases where they do, we explore the dynamics of the expected 
number of infected individuals as a function of time. We conclude that 
an imperfect defense against computer viruses can still be highly 
effective in preventing their widespread proliferation, provided that 
the infection rate does not exceed a well defined critical epidemic 
threshold.

In an effort to understand the current extent of the
computer virus problem and predict its future course,
we have conducted a statistical analysis of computer
virus incidents in a large, stable sample population of
PCs and developed new epidemiological models of computer virus 
spread. Only a small fraction of all known
viruses have appeared in real incidents, partly because
many viruses are below the theoretical epidemic thresh-
old. The observed sub-exponential rate of viral spread
can be explained by models of localized software e-
change. A surprisingly small fraction of machines
in ell-protected business environments are infected.
This may be explained by a model in which, once a
machine is found to be infected, neighbouring machines
are checked for viruses. This "kill signal" idea could be
implemented in networks to greatly reduce the threat of
viral spread. A similar principle has been incorporated
into a cost-effective anti-virus policy for organizations
which works quite vell in practice.

VISTA is a high-level assembly language: its statements are 
essentially machine instructions embedded in an Algol 68-like syntax. 
It will be superseded eventually by NewSpeak for application programs, 
but in the interim it provides a reasonably friendly programming 
environment and a vehicle for writing a limited range of VIPER 
application software. VISTA is not a safe language, in the sense that 
NewSpeak will be, though it does limit the programmer to structures 
which are reasonably free of complications.

The advent of the Trusted Network Interpretation (TNI) and the 
widespread availability of powerful microcomputers has resulted in 
the development of secure local area networking (LAN) products. 
Potentially, these products provide tremendous economic benefit by 
allowing multi-level secure operation of local area networks. This 
paper examines eight of the most popular secure LAN products from a 
technical perspective. The surveyed products include the Verdix Secure 
LAN, the Boeing Secure LAN, the Sun MLS OS, IBM/TIS's Secure Xenix, 
DEC's Ethernet Enhanced Security System, the Harris LAN/SX, the Ford 
Aerospace Multinet Gateway, and the Xerox Encryption Unit. Following 
the examination of these products, the paper provides subjective 
conclusions about the state of LAN security.

This paper describes a new mechanism for comparing selected program 
properties against a policy, or a set of rules, that states allowable 
program behavior. The motivation for this work is the increased need to 
control undesirable behaviors of programs, such as those inherent in 
Trojan horses and computer viruses. This mechanism, called an 
Automatic Policy Checker (APC), is currently implemented under SunOS. 
This paper will discuss the design and implementation of the APC and 
the application of the APC to the virus problem. Conclusions concerning 
anti-viral policy in light of the test results will also be presented.

This paper discusses a mechanism to aid users in the memorization of 
randomly generated nonsense passwords. The mechanism uses 
association and pictures and is based on techniques that have long been 
used as a means of memorizing information. The motivation for this 
work is the increased need to make passwords more difficult to guess 
and the necessity to keep them easy to remember. This mechanism 
makes an existing mechanism user-friendly, an area of computer 
security often ignored.

Computer Society Press; 1991: pp.90-99. ISBN: 0-8186-2280-6.
Auditing capability is one of the requirements for secure databases. A 
secure database management system, among other things, has to 
provide not only facilities for recording the history of all updates and 
queries against the database but high-level support for querying this 
history as well. In this paper, we present an audit model for object-
oriented databases that satisfies both requirements. Our model offers 
several additional advantages: (1) it imposes a uniform logical 
structure upon both the current and the audit data; (2) it results in 
zero-information loss, ie. there is never any loss of historical or 
current information in this model; and (3) since it captures the entire 
database activity, a complete reconstruction of every action taken on 
the database is possible. We show how this third aspect can be 
exploited to provide high-level support for expressing audit and other 
database queries, and therefore, we make a complete audit trail 
methodology available.

Aerospace Computer Security Applications Conference; 1988 Dec 12; 
Orlando, Florida. USA: IEEE: pp.386-392. 
Note: The Ulysses system is an interactive system which allows a user 
to model a system (h/w or s/w) and to make assertions about its 
security. The model takes the form of a collection of interlinked boxes, 
each of which may be internally composed of similar boxes. The boxes 
may be linked at specified points, known as ports, and, for each box, a 
section of code describes the ports and how they interact. Ports and 
links may be single-level, or multi-level. The code for each box may be 
a formal description of the actual intended code (using a language 
similar to ML), a nested specification involving other boxes and links, 
or a 'start-up' code, which overrides error conditions, allowing the 
model to be initially constructed without excessive error conditions 
arising at each stage. Once the model is constructed, the system 
performs flow analysis on the model, and either points out possible 
security violations.
Part of Ulysses is a system which generates natural language from the 
formal specifications of each box. These take the form of 'The 
multiplexer is a component which accepts multi-level data through 
port A from component XYZ, and outputs single-level data through port 
B to component PQR, etc..' Some attempt is also made to describe the 
functionality of the specification. The examples of output were easily 
readable, and quite impressive.
The Ulysses system is written in Lisp, and is currently Symbolics-
based, although a Sun-based system is predicted. The Symbolics version 
was quoted to be 'deliverable soon'.
The system was demonstated to the conference attendees, and the 
system appeared to perform well in a real-time environment, with a 
well-integrated user interface. The natural language generation from 
the specification was particularly impressive, and the system as a 
whole appeared to be a useful formal modelling tool.

The United States computer security community is one of the most 
influential forces in the international computer security arena. It has 
achieved this position by investing massive amounts of resources. Just 
the man/hours spent attending their annual national computer security 
conference often amounts to a yearly 35 man/years investment by the 
community. This massive investment has produced a socio-technical 
infra structure that is dynamic and vibrant but also very confusing for 
observers outside the United States. This confusion is often 
detrimental for the acceptance of US standards by the international 
computer security community. This paper attempts to shed light on the 
socio-technical infra structure  of the United States computer security 
community by analysing the proceedings of the 12th United States 
National Computer Security Conference using the SBC socio-technical 
analysis methodology. The papers presented at the conference are 
classified using the SBC national-supranational analysis methodology. 
Once the papers are classified the SBC methodology is used to suggest 
trends and tendencies within the United States' computer security 
community socio-technical infra structure.

June 1989 (PO689-7).
As an enhancement to the ISO's Open Systems Interconnection Model, 
the European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA) has developed 
a security reference model or framework for distributed systems.  This 
framework is based on the concepts of security domains and security 
facilities and aims to provide a secure environment for both private 
application software and public communication services such as 
electronic mail.  The different types of security domain within a 
distributed system are discussed and the scope of the ECMA framework 
outlined.  A functional decomposition of security by the application of 
the ECMA framework results in a set of elements termed security 
facilities; these can be specified exactly and form building blocks for 
designing secure systems.

Predicate Differences and the Analysis of Dependencies in Formal 
Specifications. in: 14th National Computer Security Conference; 1991 
Oct; Washington. USA: Nist/NCSC; 1991; 2: pp.436-445. 
Working with formal specifications often involves an iterative cycle of 
development and change, either to correct errors discovered in a proof 
attempt, or to reflect changes in requirements. Making changes requires 
an understanding of the dependencies among terms in the specification. 
Boolean differences may be used to determine dependencies among 
functions in Boolean algebra. This paper introduces the notion of 
predicate differences in predicate calculus. The paper shows how 
predicate differences may be used to analyze the effect of changes to 
formal specifications; to investigate the conditions under which 
invalid assumptions will render a system non-secure; and in some 
cases may help to simplify re-verification of a modified formal 
specification.

Note: This paper describes a set of tools currently being used in the 
evaluation of electronic fund transfer software running on 
microprocessors, but which could also be used in other applications. 
These tools are written in C and designed for use on source code 
written in C. Among the tools described are ccalls, which produces a 
pair of matrices listing all routines called directly or indirectly by 
each routine in the system; by examining the latter, uncalled and 
unreachable routines may be identified. Other tools identify 
subsystems which are logically nested in their calling routines; include 
global variables in the analysis by treating them as functions; and 
identify all possible calling sequences.

This paper describes the application of formal specification and 
verification methods to two microprocessor-based cryptographic 
devices: a "smart token" system that controls access to a network of 
workstations, and a message authentication device implementing the 
ANSI X9.9 message authentication standard. Formal specification and 
verification were found to be practical, cost-effective tools for 
detecting potential security weaknesses, and helped to significantly 
strengthen the security of the access control system.

Kuhn, J. D. Research toward intrusion detection through automated 
abstraction of audit data. 1986 Sep. 
Proc. 9th NCSC/NBS computer security conference pp.204-208
This paper proposes a mechanism for intrusion detection by audit data 
analysis. It is based on reconstructing high level activity from captured 
logs of low level activity, then analysing the high level activity for 
violations. This prevents bypassing of checks in the high level code on 
the main processor. An implementation monitoring a UNIX system uses 
a separate processor for analysis. This is a potentially interesting 
approach

Computer viruses pose an increasing threat to computer data integrity. 
They cause loss of valuable data and cost an enormous amount in 
wasted effort in restoration/duplication of lost and damaged data. Each 
month many more new viruses are reported. As the problem of viruses 
increases, we need tools to detect them and to eradicate them from our 
systems.
	This paper describes a virus detection tool: a generic virus 
scanner in C++ with no inherent limitations on the file systems, file 
types, or host architectures that can be scanned. The tool is completely 
general and is structured in such a way that it can easily be augmented 
to recognise viruses across different system platforms with varied 
file types. The implementation defines an abstract C++ class, VirInfo, 
which encapsulates virus features common to all viruses. Subclasses of 
this abstract class may  be used to define viruses that infect different 
machines and operating systems. The generality of the mechanism 
allows it to be used for other forms of scanning as well.

The results of an experiment that shows that it is very simple to 
contaminate digital images with information that can later be 
extracted are presented. This contamination cannot be detected when 
then the image is displayed on a good quality graphics workstation. 
Based on these results, it is recommended that image downgrading 
based on visual display of the image to be downgraded not be performed 
if there is any threat of image contamination by Trojan horse programs. 
Potential Trojan horse programs may include untrusted image 
processing software.

We present an overview of a theory of modules and interfaces 
applicable to the specification and verification of systems with a 
layered architecture. At the heart of this theory is a module 
composition theorem. The theory is applied to the specification of a 
distributed system consisting of subjects and objects in different 
hosts (computers). Formal specifications of a user interface and a 
network interface are given. Access to objects, both local and remote, 
offered by the distributed system is proved to be multilevel secure.

Rapid advances in communication technology have accentuated the need 
for security in distributed processing systems. The broad 
interconnectivity provided by these technologies amplify both the 
capabilities of a computer network and the security risks. New 
developments in communication protocols promise to alleviate security 
problems by the application of standard security mechanisms. This 
paper examines significant work in the recent development of lower 
layer security protocols. Protocols for link, network, and transport 
layer security are examined and the architectural tradeoffs inherent in 
these mechanisms are contrasted.

Lamport, L. Password Authentication with Insecure Communication. 
1981 Nov. 
CACM 24(11)
The paper shows how a one-way function can be used to protect 
password information against unauthorised access, and extends this to 
prevent an eavesdropper being able to collect useful password 
information by listening to the communication between the terminal 
and the computer system. The user knows x, the system knows G(k,x), 
where G(i,x)=F(G(i-1,x)); when the user tries to log on, he is told i by 
the system and his terminal computes and sends G(k-i,x). The values of 
i given by the system should increase with time, and a new password is 
needed when k is reached. k must be small enough that G(k,x) can be 
computed in a reasonable time.

This classic paper by Lampson introduces the Access Matrix model. The 
access matrix is a rectangular array with one row per subject and one 
column per object. The entry for a particular row and column reflects 
the operations that the corresponding subject can invoke on the 
corresponding object.
The Access Matrix model specifies only that there are rules controlling 
access, but not what those rules are in detail. Because of this the 
Access Matrix model is more often used as a basis for more specific 
models than as a basis for an implementation.

This surveys the then current (1983) state of various projects for 
secure computing; as well as summarising each of them, it also gives 
comparative tables and estimates of DoDCSC TCSEC ratings. There is an 
interesting section giving advice to developers of secure systems; this 
contains useful asides such as formal approaches are good not because 
they can be verified (they can't if there is much code) but because the 
discipline means the designers think about security and are more likely 
to notice loopholes. The summary gives the four main points of the 
advise: '(1) consider security requirements in conjunction with the 
user-visible behaviour of the system; (2) think about security 
throughout the design and implementation of the system; (3) use the 
best available software engineering technology; and (4) be sceptical; 
lots of 'modern' ideas don't work yet.'

This two-page memo is by the person who was responsible for drawing 
up a security model for the military message experiment. In it he 
argues that the need to handle security levels is the direct result of 
policies mandated by government directive, whereas there is no such 
mandatory need for integrity levels. For this reason, and because he 
believes that integrity levels are not the right approach, he proposed to 
omit them from the model; the requirements for integrity would be 
covered by specific assertions as needed.

such systems, there has been some work on security models that are 
related to a particular application or class of applications. The most 
notable of these is the Military Message System model presented in 
this paper. In this model the emphasis is on the particular requirements 
of the application, especially those security features which are 
difficult to handle with a general multilevel security policy model.

Obstacles to achieving anomaly detection in real time include the large 
volume of data associated with user behavior and the nature of that 
data. This paper describes preliminary results from a research project 
which is developing a new approach to handling such data. The approach 
involves nonparametric statistical methods which permits 
considerable data compression and which supports pattern recognition 
techniques for identifying user behavior. This approach applies these 
methods to a combination of measurements of resource usage and 
structural information about the behavior of processes. Preliminary 
results indicate that both accuracy and real time response can be 
achieved using these methods.

This reference, often referred to as CR82, describes the four layers of 
services and protocols used on Cambridge Rings. These are for the R-
service, P-service, V-service and the N-service which correspond to 
the ring component, packet, virtual circuit, and network independent 
services respectively. These services are not related to the OSI basic 
reference model in the document but, if they were the R-service would 
be in the physical layer, the P-service in the data link layer and the V-
service and N-service in the network layer (the former possibly in a 
sub-network layer). The protocols for each service are otherwise 
known as:
R-service: Mini-packet protocol; P-service: Basic block protocol (BBP); 
V-service: Byte stream protocol (BSP); and, N-service: Transport 
service byte stream protocol (TSBSP).
The 'single shot protocol' (SSP) used for idem potent remote procedure 
calls is not documented.
The standard also describes the concatenation and routing functions 
necessary at relays between two N-service implementations.
An annex at the end gives a brief model for layer services, along the 
lines of that used in the OSI basic reference model.

Models of Trust: TCBs vs People. in: 1989 IEEE Symposium on Security 
and Privacy; 1989 May 1; Oakland, California. USA: IEEE Computer 
Society; 1989: 10-19. 
Note: In this paper, the processes of granting clearances and 
accrediting trusted computer systems are compared, both informally 
(in Section I), and through mathematical models (analogies are brought 
out in Sections II and III).
In Section IV, the combination of two TCBs is considered (the so-called 
cascading problem). The example used involves two B2 TCBs, one 
accredited for a (TS,S) range and the other for a (S,C) range, and 
assumes they are connected by a single-level S channel. By the 
authors own admission, the analysis, and original modelling, use 
amateur mathematics and statistics.
The conclusion, with certain qualifications, contradicts Appendix C of 
the TNI, which states that the assurance level associated with the 
combination of two TCBs is, in general, no higher than either given to 
the single TCBs. Under the assumptions that the Human Security Model 
(of Section II), the Computer Security Model (of Section III), and the 
Yellow Books are all valid, and the two TCBs being combined are 
independent with respect to flaws and weaknesses, the conclusion is 
that the resistance to threat of a cascade of two B2 systems is roughly 
the same as that of a B3 system.
It was pointed out during questions that, by a recursive argument, a 
number of D systems could be combined to be as resistant to threat as 
a B3 system! In general, the paper was met with indifference.

Note: Lee proposes the use of Integrity Categories and Partially Trusted 
Subjects together with the concepts of Secure systems at B1 (and 
above) to support the Clark and Wilson integrity model.
An Integrity policy, consisting of a 'Simple Integrity Property' and an 
'Integrity * - property' to be enforced by the system, is described 
together with a set of administrative procedures for setting up and 
running such systems.
Each component of the Clark and Wilson model is addressed and 
expressed in terms of the described procedures, integrity properties 
and TCSEC features. A number of miscellaneous topics are addressed 
showing that the approach taken by Lee is at an early stage and needs 
further exploration.
The relationship between this proposal and accepted computer security 
techniques should make this paper of interest to CESG if it becomes 
necessary to consider how integrity related functions (eg roles) can be 
included in the upcoming generation of Secure Systems. It should be 
noted that Integrity policies and implementation techniques are clearly 
at an early stage in development, compared to their security counter 
parts, and further work is needed to support their useful application.
Government research, development, and standardization efforts in 
computer security have been repeatedly criticized as not being 
applicable to the commercial world.  In particular, they have been 
criticised as not being able to support the kinds of security policies, 
such as separation of duties and well-formed transactions, used by the 
financial and other communities to control unauthorized changes to or 
falsification of information.  This paper demonstrates how two natural 
extensions - integrity categories and partially trusted subjects - of 
the principles of current DoD computer security standards could be 
used to implement such commercial security policies in a way that 
exploits the fundamental strengths of existing or future trusted 
systems.

Inc.). A Formal Model for UNIX Setuid. in: 1989 IEEE Symposium on 
Security and Privacy; May 1; Oakland, California. USA: IEEE Computer 
Society; 1989: 73-83. 
Note: The paper would be more correctly entitled A Formal Model for 
the GEMSOS Discretionary Access Control. Gemini is engaged in the 
development of a UNIX-compatible interface to be supported by an 
underlying TCB evaluated at A1. A distinguishing feature of the UNIX 
operating system is the setuid mechanism. The setuid mechanism 
allows processes to gain permissions which they did not originally 
have. This poses a possible threat to any DAC policy. In his presentation 
Steven J Padilla described the difference between UNIX and the Bell and 
LaPadula model in the way that subjects gain access to objects as:
Suppose Object Island is connected to Subject Land by a bridge. On the 
bridge is a customs officer (Mr Permission) who allows subjects 
access to Object Island if they have the right permission. In Bell and 
LaPadula the subjects arrive individually. Each is checked to see if he 
has the right permission. In UNIX the subjects arrive by the busload, but 
only the driver is checked.
The GEMSOS model seeks to retain as much of the setuid mechanism as 
possible, but still maintain a DAC policy. This is achieved by 
restricting the semantics of the setuid mechanism. These restrictions 
take the form of three modelling and four policy requirements.
The modelling requirements are:
 A process will be represented by a different subject after a change in 
DAC identifier.
 Each object will have an associated DAC identifier.
 A new access mode control.
The policy requirements are:
 A process can only assume the DAC identifier that has been 
associated with an object.
 A process can assume the DAC identifier associated with an object if 
the process has execute access to that object.
 The DAC identifier of an object can only be changed to that of a 
calling process if the identifiers have more than one aspect (eg. user 
and group).
 The DAC identifier of an object can only change to that of a calling 
process if the process has control access to that object.
The paper claims that the GEMSOS model can be derived from the 
principles of Bell and LaPadula. It then goes on to compare the GEMSOS 
model with the Bell and LaPadula model. This comparison is done under 
three headings; Elements, Properties, and Rules. Nothing is said about 
the Rules as these are application specific.
Under the Elements section the notions read-class and write-class are 
introduced. In the GEMSOS model the access of subjects to objects is 
more limited than in the Bell and LaPadula model. This is because the 
Bell and LaPadula model effectively has the write-class as system low. 
Under the Properties section it is pointed out that in the GEMSOS model 
the removal of permission does not result in immediate revocation of 
access. This is not the case in the Bell and LaPadula model, although it 
is claimed that the two are equivalent in terms of information flow.
The paper finishes with a justification for having a separate DAC model 
(as opposed to a combined DAC and MAC model), and a formal 
presentation of the model in the Ina Jo language. This model formalises 
the three modelling and four policy requirements listed above.

It is proposed that all database security controls, except those which 
provide information flow security, can be built using a suitable trigger 
mechanism. The implementation of an example application, which has a 
variety of requirements for confidentiality, integrity and 
accountability, is shown to illustrate the technique. The trigger 
mechanism is to be implemented using query modification as part of 
the SWORD secure DBMS project.

In Brewer and Nash's Chinese Wall security policy model, there is a 
very strong implicit assumption that the "conflict of interest" is an 
equivalence relation. It is called the BN-axiom. Such axiom is valid only 
for some very special circumstances. By modifying their formulation, a 
modified Brewer and Nash model without BN-axiom is defined. Such 
model turns out to be rather "conservative" in the sense that the 
Chinese Walls are built within Chinese territory; it is not really a 
Chinese Wall model. Next, a new formal model is introduced in which 
Chinese Walls are built right on the boundary of China - an aggressive 
model for Chinese Wall security policy.

Note: Introduction: Aggregation and inference problems have been 
investigated by various authors. In our recent works, we have proposed 
a solution to settle the aggregation problems in design phase; solutions 
during the query processing time will be reported in the near future. In 
our recent works, we have investigated not only the case of one 
aggregate (all classical works belong to this case), but also the case 
which consists of "empires" of aggregates. For the case of one single 
aggregate, our solution has almost the same effect as Lunt's solution. 
Both solutions need SSO (System Security Officer) to downgrade or 
release the internal data of an aggregate. Without some practical 
guidelines or references for SSO, the applications for either solution 
will be limited. However, the nature of such guidelines or policies may 
very well be application dependent; hence there might be no common 
guidelines or policy across the applications. This paper proposes a 
probabilistic type of measure theory which estimates the amount of 
security relevant information of every subset of a given aggregate. This 
probabilistic measure theory provides each application a means or 
mechanism to furnish the system a numerical measure to assist the 
SSO for making decisions on releasing or  downgrading the internal data 
of the aggregate. Combining this measurement with our previous 
results, a scenario for solving the aggregation problems during the 
design phase is proposed. In developing this work, two guiding 
principles are applied: Minimum Aggregation Principle (MAP) and the 
Maximum Protection Principle (MPP). MAP keeps both the number of 
elements in an aggregation and the number of aggregates to a minimum, 
while MPP keeps the unnecessary risks to a minimum.

Note: This paper describes a system which attempts to find the 
dominant causes of a program proof failure in the HDM system. This is 
done by logging and categorizing each error as it occurs, and, when 
more than a specified number of categories have been identified, these 
are merged into larger categories. In this way, groups of 'symptoms' are 
collected, such that each group corresponds to one proof 'bug'.
	When originally presented, an example was given that made the 
principle of the system somewhat more obvious. Unfortunately, this 
example was omitted from the papaer in the Proceedings.

Discusses issues related to authentication in a distributed computing 
environment, and descrives authentication approaches employed in 
DEC's Distributed Systems Security Architecture (DSSA).  Node, User 
and proces granularity authentication concerns are considered.  
Authentication is based on a global hierarchic naming structure and 
public-key cryptography.  Directory-resident certificates associating 
entities with long-term keys are used in conjunction with dynamically 
signed certificates which represent transient bindings between 
entities.  Distributed system elements can be mutually suspicious.  At 
the node level, special topics considered include the relationship 
between authentication and secure loading and the relationship 
between authentication and rule-based policy support.  At the user 
level, architectural requirements are identified and authentication 
protocol options based on smart cards and on user-entered passwords 
are described.

Note: This paper discusses various aspects of Authentication within the 
DSSA structure. Some of the ground of the previous paper is re-visited, 
but at a somewhat more abstract level. Once again the approach is 
heavily influenced by the availability of public key cryptography.
Authentication is discussed at three levels of granularity. Firstly at 
that of interacting computer systems on a network, secondly at that of 
human users and finally at that of application processes. The 
architecture is claimed to work between mutually suspicious security 
authorities as well as within a single authority.
The basic technique is that described in the previous paper where a 
certificate carries a public key and a digital signature. Certificates 
may be long term (identity certificates) or short term (dynamic binding 
certificates).
The User Authentication Architecture is claimed to be compatible with 
various levels of user authentication device ranging from smart cards 
offering RSA capabilities down to simple passwords. Techniques are 
described for using the RSA smart card, which is the preferred method 
within DSSA and two approaches using passwords are also given.
The paper provides a discussion overview of the approach adopted to 
authentications in DSSA but does not provide much in the way of 
technical detail.

The first section of this paper introduces the basic notion and 
derivation of the lattice model. It also introduces, for purposes of 
comparison, the results of a previous attempt to apply the lattice 
model in a commercial environment. The second section examines 
commercial requirements for information security and derives an 
alternate application of the lattice model more suited to these 
requirements. The final section introduces a second component of the 
lattice model (the integrity model) and revisits the commercial 
application to show an alternate formulation for achieving security.
The paper's main conclusions are that the lattice model may in fact be 
applicable to commercial data processing, but that such application 
will require ways of looking at security requirements different from 
those prevalent in the national security community. The joint 
involvement of people experienced in commercial applications and of 
people who understand the lattice security model will probably provide 
the most productive course towards the development of successful 
commercial applications of the lattice model. Referenced by the TNI

The DLCN is envisaged as a powerful, unified distributed computing 
system which interconnects heterogeneous midi/mini/micro-
computers etc. This paper gives an overview of the design requirements 
and implementation techniques for DLCNs, message protocol and 
network operating system.
It is a hypothetical system to be used to investigate fundamental 
questions of distributed computing. Its description varies between very 
detailed (the message protocol) to completely general. Probably 
reflecting the achievements current at the time of reporting.
This paper is an interesting example of the design of a distributed 
system, but has no specific computer security implications.

Within the Department of Defense developers have been designing and 
implementing a prototype multilevel secure local area network (MLS 
LAN). Researchers at MITRE have been cooperating in this development 
by doing the security modeling. The MLS LAN has special dynamic 
features, such as the ability to add new security levels during normal 
operations and to modify label translation schemas, which distinguish 
it from other secure LANs. These features enhance the functionality of 
the LAN  without compromising its security. This paper highlights the 
principal features of the MLS LAN and discusses some of the design, 
implementation and modeling issues.

This paper presents an algorithm for key distribution across connected 
networks each with their own ACS. It makes a number of assumptions, 
such as: encryption is at the session layer, using the same algorithm in 
each network; there is to be minimal or no modification to existing key 
distribution protocols at nodes (for use within a network); and, the 
ACS/gateway software can be readily adapted. The usefulness of the 
work depends on the validity of these assumptions in a particular 
environment.

Computer Networks. IEEE Trans. on Software Engineering. 1990 Jun; 
16(6): 647-659.
An efficient design of the security architecture for a computer network 
requires the integration of security implementation considerations 
with a formal security model describing the security policy in the 
network.  The distributed nature of the network, however, offers 
complexities in the development of appropriate models.  In this paper, a 
new model which precisely describes the mechanism that enforces the 
security policy and requirements for a multilevel secure network is 
described.  This mechanism attempts to ensure secure flow of 
information between entities assigned to different security classes in 
different computer systems connected to the network.  The mechanism 
also controls the access to the network devices by the subjects (users 
and processes executed on behalf of the users) with different security 
clearances.  The model integrates the notions of nondiscretionary 
access control and information flow control to provide a trusted 
network base (TNB) that imposes appropriate restrictions on the flow 
of information among the various devices.  Utilizing simple set 
theoretic concepts, a procedure is given to verify the security of a 
network that implements the present model.

Fallacies. in: 1989 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy; May 1; 
Oakland, California. USA: IEEE Computer Society; 1989: 102-109. 
Note: The aim of the paper was to define more clearly the kinds of 
inference and aggregation problems. Having done so she argues that 
many of these so-called problems are not really problems and can be 
tackled by sensible design of the database. That is, no mechanism 
beyond MAC is required.
The gist of this is neatly illustrated by the following example. Suppose 
that employee names are unclassified and salaries are unclassified. 
However, the associations of an employee with his salary is considered 
classified. This is neatly handled by setting up a database with:
(i) a list of employees against employee number;
(ii) a list of salaries against salary number;
(iii) a list of employee numbers against salary numbers.
(i) and (ii) are unclassified whilst (iii) is classified.
The spirit of the presentation was that inference and aggregation 
problems have probably been given undue emphasis. They can generally 
be handled by appropriate design of database and assignment of 
classification. This, after all, is essentially how it has been done in the 
paper world. On the other hand, tools can probably be supplied to assist 
in this design process. Tools, for example, to flag potential inferences.
It was pointed out that a number of problems remain to be understood 
better. These include the effect of external information, statistical 
attacks and dynamic information (derived from observing changes in 
the database).

Security & Privacy; 1988 Apr 18; Oakland Ca. Washington DC: IEEE 
Computer Society Press; 1988: pp.59-66. ISBN: 0-8186-0850-1.
Note: The IDES project is developing a prototype Intrusion-Detection 
Expert System, to test the theory that misbehaviour by a user can be 
automatically detected by looking for variances from their normal 
behaviour patterns.
The prototype is implemented as a stand-alone system, collecting and 
collating information provided by the systems being monitored; 
currently the actions being analysed include login, logout, running a 
program, invoking system calls and using the network. It maintains 
various measures of the current behaviour of each active user, and 
continually compares these against historical records. Deviations by 
more than a preconfigured amount cause alarms. Over a period of time 
the historical records are altered to reflect the current pattern of 
working, so allowing a gradual drift in a user's habits to happen 
without causing alarms.
The system has been used to monitor a DEC machine running a locally-
modified version of TOPS-20 capable of supporting up to 128 users; the 
operating system has been modified to gather and preprocess audit 
data, transform it to IDES format and transmit it in an encrypted form, 
without noticeable degradation of its performance. IDES has detected 
various simulated intrusions, usually within a minute of the event 
occurring, though it has not yet been tried on the audit trails of 
systems that are known to have been penetrated.
Work is underway to determine other measures that could be used to 
detect intrusions of various types, including clandestine use and also 
misuse of their privileges by authorised users.
Describes the design and implementation of a prototype intrusion-
detection expert system (IDES) developed at SRI International.  IDES is 
based on the concept that an intrusion manifests itself as a departure 
from expected behaviour for a user.  The prototype monitors users on  a 
remote system using audit records which characterize their activities.  
It adaptively learns normal behaviour of each user and detects and 
reports anomalous user behaviour.

Database System. 1988 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy; 1988 
Apr 18; Oakland Ca. Washington DC: IEEE Computer Society Press; 1988: 
pp.234-244. ISBN: 0-8186-0850-1.
Note: This was the second of two papers in the proceedings from SRI 
and Gemini on the Seaview multilevel secure relational database 
project. This paper describes a design for Seaview which can be 
implemented 'in the near term'. In essence the proposal is to use a 
commercially available off-the-shelf security kernel (GEM-SOS) and a 
commercially available relational database (Oracle). Oracle will need 
some modification. Additional specific code for Seaview will need to 
be written.
There is an interesting discussion of TCB subsetting, leading to four 
classes of trust, which could map onto GEM-SOS protection rings:
 verified kernel for mandatory security
 enforcement of non-mandatory policy
 still-less-trusted: for example, database manager
 user-written applications.
In summary, the two Seaview papers represent a very fine example of 
what US technology can achieve. There is a drawing together of work in 
two different fields, security and relational database, into an 
integrated whole, with a considerable amount of original work to make 
the whole. There are engineering as well as theoretical problems for 
which a solution is needed and is available. There is a practical 
emphasis and a clear distinction between short-term and long-term 
goals.
The SeaView formal security policy model admits a range of designs 
for a multilevel secure relational database system.  The requirement 
for a near-term implementation suggests that the design should utilize 
existing technology to the extent possible.  Thus the design uses an 
existing database management system ported to an existing TCB 
environment.  A preprocessor translates key constructs of the SeaView 
multilevel relational data model used by the commercial database 
system.  The underlying reference monitor enforces mandatory and 
basic discretionary controls with A1 assurance.  Discretionary controls 
on relations and views as well as the enforcement of data consisency 
are provided by the commercial database system.  The key technology 
introduced in this paper is that by combining single level data into a 
multilevel view, a commercial database system can be used and data 
can be classified at the relation level to implement the SeaView model, 
with element-level classification.

This paper describes a real-time Intrusion Detection Expert System 
(IDES) that observes user behavior on a monitored computer system and 
adaptively learns what is normal for individual users, groups, remote 
hosts, and the overall system behavior. Observed behavior is flagged as 
a potential intrusion if it deviates significantly from the expected 
behavior or if it triggers a rule in the expert system rule base.

A multilevel database is intended to provide the security needed for 
database systems that contain data at a variety of classifications and 
serve a set of users having different clearances.  This paper describes 
a formal security model for such a system.  The model is formulated in 
two layers, one corresponding to a reference monitor that enforces 
mandatory security, and the second an extension of the standard 
relational model, defining multilevel relations and formalising policies 
for labeling new and derived data, data consistency and discretionary 
security.  The model also defines application-independent properties 
for entity integrity, referential integrity and polyinstantiation 
integrity.

Multilevel Security Based on Operator Nets. 1987. 
A security model for the SNet multilevel secure distributed system, 
based on a behavioural semantics for operator nets and expressed in 
Lucid, is described. This model subsumes a previously published model 
of the network within SNet and includes authorized downgrading as 
well as the security policies enforced by trusted hosts connected to 
the network. The previous model described in this paper provides a 
more general abstract model than is provided by those seven 
constraints.
IEEE Comp. Soc. Proc 1987 Symp. Security and Privacy, pp. 150 - 160
This paper describes a security model for a multilevel secure system 
(SNet), expressed using operator nets and Lucid.
The objectives of the SNet project is to develop a multilevel secure 
system with a minimum of trusted mechanism. The paper describes a 
system similar to the DSS proposed by Rushby and Randell, in which 
trusted network interface units (called ladels) mediate access over the 
network to untrusted hosts. The SNet enforces a security policy which 
allows only upward flow of information with respect to the lattice 
structure of security labels, unless through the intervention of a 
trusted downgrader.
An operator net is a graph consisting of nodes and directed arcs. The 
nodes represent the active components of SNet (e.g hosts), and arcs 
represent the communication channels between nodes. Lucid is a 
functional programming language used to implement operator networks. 
Each node in an operator net is defined as a function in Lucid which 
maps the history of communications in the input arcs to a history of 
communications on the output arcs.
The paper uses the combined operator net/Lucid formalism to give 
detailed specifications of the SNet at both the security model and 
component model levels. Consistency between these levels is also 
discussed.

The concurrency control algorithms used for standard database systems 
can conflict with the security policies of multilevel secure database 
systems. This paper describes two new concurrency control algorithms 
that are compatible with common security policies. They are based on 
the multiversion timestamp ordering technique, and are implemented 
with single-level subjects. The use of only single-level subjects 
cannot introduce any additional threat of compromise of mandatory 
security; our analysis will focus on correctness. One of these 
algorithms has been implemented for Trusted ORACLE.

A potential problem in all multilevel networks is cascading. This 
problem can be eliminated in static networks by applying the nesting 
condition. The nature of dynamic networks prevents the use of the 
nesting condition. This paper introduces the concept of a Unidirectional 
Nesting Condition and provides proofs that show the Unidirectional 
Nesting Condition sufficient and sometimes necessary to prevent 
cascading in dynamic networks.

The paper presents a list of considerations for applying a commercial 
off-the-shelf disk encryptor to an environment where hostile overrun 
is a significant threat. The considerations include: how the encryption 
device is configured and interfaced to the workstation, host, or server; 
encryption key management including key entry, changeover, and quick 
destruct; and long term off-line storage.

Computer Society Press; 1990: pp.9-19. ISBN: 0-8186-2105-2.
The National Computer Security Center has issued guidance for Trusted 
Computer Networks called the Trusted Network Interpretation (TNI) of 
the Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC). The TNI 
provides requirements for trusted computer networks that extend the 
guidance provided for traditional stand-alone computer systems by the 
TCSEC. It is expected that this Department of Defense (DOD) technical 
security guidance will be used as the basis for certification of DoD 
network system acquisitions. This paper presents three major steps 
illustrating an application of the TNI. The steps are: 1) formulating a 
TNI view; 2) determining the appropriate TNI security requirements 
that will apply; and 3) formulation of a network security architecture 
based on the allocation of the determined security requirements.

to define a development paradigm for high-performance trusted 
systems in Ada. The paradigm is aimed at improving the construction 
process and the future products of Ada systems that require both broad 
trust and high performance. The need for a Process Model and the 
notions of trust and assurance are reviewed. The foundation for the 
Process Model and its elements are presented. The Process Model is 
contrasted with traditional development approaches. The combination 
of a risk driven approach with the integration of trust and performance 
engineering into a unified whole appears to offer substantial 
advantages to system builders.

This paper looks at a suggested technique for inference control in 
statistical databases, that of perturbing the values by adding noise. The 
motivation is to ensure individual values cannot be determined; the 
hope is that if the noise has a mean of zero, the operation in unbiassed. 
The paper claims this is not true, as we are always interested in 
conditional means.
An assumption is made that the noise is added to the figures in the 
database. Possible solutions to avoid the bias are to add the noise to 
some fields only, which requires the searches to be restricted, or to 
compensate for the bias, which is complex for multivariate samples. 
The latter approach is under investigation.

In the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) communication framework, 
standards are being proposed for cryptographic-based security 
protocols that will provide security services to the user. Many of these 
security protocols provide almost identical security services and are 
being pursued in groups that include ANSI, IEEE, IETF, and NATO. This 
paper examines two of the current security protocols defined for the 
Network Layer of the OSI communications stack that are being proposed 
for use by Department of Defense and commercial networks and the 
issue of interoperability between these two protocols.

a Refined Bell-LaPadula Model for the TMach Kernel. in: 4th Aerospace 
Computer Security Applications Conference; 1988 Dec 12; Orlando, 
Florida. USA: IEEE: pp.368-378. 
Note: This paper examines the extended Bell-LaPadula model (as defined 
by Bell in 1986), and concludes that it is inconsistent, and should be 
further extended to become consistent. Bell's model associates with 
every subject a maximum viewing clearance and a minimum writing 
clearance. The rationale for this is that it minimises the number of 
subjects which need to be trusted to perform write-down operations. 
One example of the quoted inconsistency is that, in Bell's system, a 
subject may create a child which may read objects which the parent 
may not, and may communicate this information back to the parent. It 
is argued that the restriction which prevents direct access by the 
parent is, therefore, pointless. The paper also describes the 
implementation of the scheme in TMach.
This appeared to be an interesting paper which would be worthy of 
studying in detail.

In recent years it has been recognized that the protection of classified

environment requires a total "information security" (INFOSEC) solution, 
combining both communications and computer security technologies 
into an integrated security solution. While the need for INFOSEC 
solutions is clearly recognized, the commercial availability of true 
INFOSEC products is extremely limited or non-existent. This paper 
discusses the evaluation issues involved in an effort to take evaluated 
COMSEC technology and evaluated trusted system technology, and 
integrate them into an evaluatable INFOSEC product.

Conference; 1991 Oct; Washington. USA: NIST/NCSC; 1991; 1: pp.237-
245. 
This paper deals with the issue of preserving and promoting integrity 
within computer and automated information systems. It is intended to 
serve as the starting point for defining those expectations and 
standardizing integrity properties of systems. The paper discusses the 
difficulty of developing a single definition of the term integrity as it 
applies to data and systems. Integrity has multiple definitions in the 
dictionary and the application of those definitions to data and systems 
using a single attribute within the expectation set has led to 
definitions that could not achieve consensus. Concluding that a single 
definition is not needed to advance our understanding, the paper 
develops a more appropriate operational definition, or framework, that 
encompasses various views of the issue. This framework includes the 
two distinct, yet interdependent, contexts for integrity: data and 
systems. The Framework reinterprets, within these two contexts, a 
general integrity protection goal to derive three specific integrity 
goals. The framework also interprets the integrity properties and 
relationships of active and passive entities in a system using the 
conceptual constraints of "adherence to a code of behaviour," 
"wholeness,"and"risk reduction." The paper concludes that it is possible 
to begin to standardize integrity properties. We acknowledge that gaps 
in understanding exist, but recommend that further studies be 
undertaken. We conclude that such studies can be accomplished 
concurrently with standardization and that both efforts could be 
mutually supportive.

All computer systems are vulnerable to abuse and penetration by both 
legitimate users who abuse their authority and individuals who are not 
authorized to use the computer system. Many systems are under 
development to aid in the detection of these abuses. The capabilities of 
these "intrusion detection systems" (IDS) are varied ranging from tools 
that provide for the meaningful reduction of audit data to tools that 
provide in-depth analysis of user and system behavior. The authors have 
performed a survey of the state-of-the-art in intrusion detection 
systems (IDS). This paper presents a summary of this survey.

(Unisys Defense Systems). Beyond the Pale of MAC and DAC - Defining 
New Forms of Access Control. in: 1990 IEEE Computer Society 
Symposium on Research in Security and Privacy; 1990 May 7; Oakland. 
USA: IEEE Computer Society Press; 1990: 190-200. 
Note: This paper starts by describing classification systems in the DoD 
and intelligence areas, which cannot be implemented using 
straightforward MAC and DAC based on individual or group privileges. 
The paper proposes two systems of access control which solve these 
problems, Owner Retained Access Control (ORAC) and an attribute based 
access control system. The paper discusses the problems of 
implementing these policies.
The ORAC system is based round the labelling of objects in the system, 
copies of these objects then inherit the access constraints of the 
original object. This inheritance is dynamic, in the sense that 
modification of the constraints on the original causes modification of 
the constraints on all the copies. The access controls on the copy can 
also be added to, to increase the access constraints on the object. 
However, the original access constraints cannot be weakened except by 
the owner of the original object.
The attribute based access control system proposed is based round the 
labelling of objects, when a subject then attempts to access an object 
the attributes of the subject are checked against the objects list of 
attributes which describe the characteristics of subjects which are 
allowed to access that object. For example the subject may have to be 
British and not have blue eyes.
Although both ORAC and the attributed based system provide a fine 
granularity of access control there are high penalties to be paid for in 
terms of computational overheads. As they are implemented through the 
use of logic based labels, which can be fairly complex. The other major 
disadvantage of the system is that the constraints on access to objects 
steadily increases as the objects are copied or accessed.
Designers of trusted systems have thus far concentrated almost 
exclusively on providing access controls according to the mandatory 
discretionary access control paradigm, with mandatory access control 
based on a lattice of sensitivity labels and discretionary access 
control based on individual and group access privileges.  This paper 
discusses some examples of DoD/intelligence data protection 
requirements that cannot be handled through traditional MAC or DAC 
and proposes two new forms of access controls to respond to these 
problems.  First, a user attribute-based access control for enforcement 
of dissemination controls is introduced.  Second, a type of access 
control know as Owner-Retained Access Control is described, to 
provide a privilege-based form of access control that, unlike DAC, 
prevents access to data being extended to others without the owner's 
concurrence.  For both types of controls, the access control rules to be 
enforced and the implications of providing automated enforcement of 
these controls are discussed.  Finally, a comparison of the two forms of 
control is made, and an informal model is presented that provides a 
common framework for representing both.  In conclusion, the benefits 
and drawbacks of this approach are discussed, and some areas for 
future work are identified.

McCullough, D. A Hookup Theorem for Multilevel Security. IEEE Trans on 
Software Engineering. 1990 Jun; 16(6): 563-568.
Note: Revised version of IEEE Symposium paper.
In this paper, the author describes a security property for trusted 
multilevel systems, restrictiveness, which restricts the inferences a 
user can make about sensitive information.  This property is a hookup 
property, or composable, meaning that a collection of secure 
restrictive systems when hooked together form a secure restrictive 
composite system.  The author argues that the inference control and 
composablity of restrictiveness make it an attractive choice for a 
security policy on trusted systems and processes.

Computer Society Press; 1988: pp.177-186. ISBN: 0-8186-0850-1.
Note: This introduces the problems of nondeterminisim and 
interruptability.  Most McCullough examples in this and the earlier 
paper depend on the type of sequence described in the first two 
paragraphs of section 5 p184.  It attempts to deal with the problem of 
systems which are either non-deterministic or interruptible, either of 
which features cause problems with earlier theories; input buffers, 
since they cannot be made infinite, may either 'block' or lose 
information.  If input buffers are blocked, covert channels may be 
introduced - the author produces a neat subsystem which violates MLS 
in gross fashion by using the blocking of input buffers.  If they lose 
information when full, then nondeterminism is introduced;  
Nondeterminism can also be introduced by using parallel processing.  
There is thus a need for a generalisation of Goguen and Meseguer to 
incorporate the idea of non-determinism.  Finally the author proposes a 
further property, which he calls 'restrictiveness'.  He goes on to 
produce a state-machine characterisation of restrictiveness and to 
compare its good and bad points with those of Goguen and Meseguer 
noninterference, generalised noninterference and Sutherland 
deducibility.
The Problem of composability of multi-level security properties is 
discussed, particularly the noninterference property and some of its 
generalizations.  An attempt is made to show through examples that 
some of these security properties do not compose - it is possible to 
connect two systems, both of which are judged to be secure.  Although 
the examples are 'cooked up' to make a point, there is nothing 
especially tricky done; McCullough ensures that outputs from one 
system become inputs to the other machine at the same security level, 
and uses a standard notion of parallel composition of systems.

McCullough, Daryl. Specifications for Multilevel Security and a Hook-Up 
Property. 1987. 
In this paper we give a brief description of several formalisms for 
computer security, and discuss some of the problems in their 
interpretation an application. We define the property of 'hook-up 
security', which can be shown to imply that a collection of hook-up 
secure systems can be hooked up to form a secure complex system. We 
believe this result addresses some of the problems with other 
definitions of security, and will be valuable in the design of large 
secure systems from simpler secure components.

This is an interesting and significant paper. Its subject is a 
formulation of a security property which may hold for an isolated 
system and which may also hold for the connection of such systems in a 
simple way. (The simple form of connection is to permit the exchange 
of securely-labelled messages by identifying outputs of one system 
with inputs of another, separately for each security class).
It turns out that in general it is not necessarily the case that 'secure 
systems securely connected' are as a whole secure, given an arbitrary 
notion of security, or even a well-established notion such as non-
interference. Clearly this is bad news from the point of view that 
designers want properties of complex systems to be decomposable into 
properties of simple components.
A property is defined, called 'hookup security'; this is a strengthened 
form of non-interference. The strengthening is a condition on the 
relative order in which certain input and output events may occur.
It must be said that the style of this paper is far from clear. There are 
some evident textual errors, there is a crucial obscurity in the main 
example which motivates this treatment, and if the definition given of 
non-interference has been correctly understood, then it is difficult to 
accept. The result is that there is some difficulty in being sure the 
author's intentions have been understood. However, this is a 
stimulating paper: its ideas merit more study, and will certainly help 
to sharpen notions of security.

functions as an assessment, systems development, and evaluation tool. 
The model is unique in that it stands independent of technology. Its 
application is universal, and is not constrained by organisational 
differences. As with all well defined fundamental concepts, it is 
unnecessary to alter the premise even as technology and human

This paper addresses composability properties of component systems. 
By means of analysis of external relations among components, security 
problems associated with composition of the components are 
investigated. To solve these problems, two security models are 
presented. By comparing these two models, important properties of 
secure composition of component systems are identified.

This paper presents some initial experiences in NRL's application

an approach to certifying US Navy application systems that must be 
trusted. We are conducting our research by participating in the 
certification of two NATO command and control systems targeted at 
the B3 class of the Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria. An 
important initial finding of this project is a working definition of the 
role that an informal and descriptive top-level specification plays in 
development of trusted application systems. Other initial experiences 
include the possibility of using the descriptive top-level specification 
as a preliminary specification and the identification of some easily 
corrected shortcomings of natural language descriptions. The paper is 
divided into two parts. The first part discusses the role of the 
descriptive top-level specification and the second part relates three 
initial experiences with descriptive top-level specifications.

The replicated architecture for multilevel secure database systems 
provides security by replicating data into separate untrusted single-
level database systems. To be successful, a system using the replicated 
architecture must have a concurrency and replica control algorithm 
that does not introduce any covert channels. Jajodia and Kogan have 
developed one such algorithm that uses update projections and a write-
all replica control algorithm. Here we describe an alternative 
algorithm. The new algorithm uses replicated transactions and a set of 
queues organized according to security class. A new definition of 
correctness is required for this approach, so we present one and use it 
to show that our algorithm is correct. The existence of this new 
algorithm increases the viability of the replicated architecture as an 
alternative to kernelized approaches.

Information flow analysis is required for A1 certification, so a flow 
analysis tool has been developed to assist in this,the paper contains a 
brief overview of this.
A new Gypsy abstraction is introduced, which defines an abstract type 
called information and the functions which operate on the type. The 
tool uses this abstraction with the results of the Gypsy optimiser 
(which contains an analysis tool to detect 'ghost' unused variables) to 
detect all potential flows. The tool is normally used by first 
identifying the TCB and its 'interface set' (the externally visible 
components of the TCB), then analysing the TCB flows, and then 
producing information flow analogues for the TCB set. Information 
policy specifications and verification conditions can then be developed 
for the TCB interface set, and the VCs proved.
There are three main problems with this approach: most contrary flows 
revealed are due to potential exceptions that will not occur in practice, 
many programs will be acceptable despite certain contrary flows, and 
the tool does not at the moment let the user discover the path of 
information flow. Furrther work is needed to maintain path 
information, reduce the need for a skilled user, and to integrate flow 
analysis with proofs about exceptions and blockages.

Specification for a Multi-level Secure Local Area Network. 1986 Apr. 
IEEE Comp. Soc. Proc. 1986 Symp. Security and Privacy pp.34-39
The Verdix Corporation is producing a secure multilevel LAN, which has 
been accepted for developmental evaluation by NCSC. Hosts are 
connected to the network via a Network Security Device, using shared 
memory for data transfer between the NSD and the host. Mediation is 
performed by both ends whenever a message is sent, with protocols 
requiring no host-host acknowledgement. A Network Security Center is 
responsible for updating tables in the NSDs defining the security 
policy, and also issues encryption and decryption keys for each 
'association' (NSD to NSD path).
The security policy defines only the interaction between the Trusted 
Network Base (TNB) and the outside world. The model is a simplified 
version of the Bell-LaPadula model; objects are datagrams, subjects 
are hosts, and the security classes are drawn from a lattice. Unlike 
Bell-LaPadula, objects are very temporary, and subjects are assumed to 
have access to information up to and including their clearance. There is 
a single operation, communication (Si,Oijx,Sj), which is permitted if:  
the class of the object dominates the clearance of the sender; the 
clearance of the receiver dominates the class of the object; the sender 
is allowed to send to the receiver; and, the receiver is allowed to 
receive from the sender.  An association exists between two subjects 
if both the last two hold. Note that no operation changes the 
classification of an object.
A Formal Top Level Specification (FTLS) has been produced of the 
security-critical functions of the NSD, as a Gypsy procedural model of 
parallel processes communicating via buffers. GVE has been used to 
prove its security properties; due to the distributed nature of the 
mediation, this was fairly complex, and one 'obviously true' lemma was 
beyond the capabilities of GVE.
The FTLS is being extended to cover the NSC, and needs further 
extension to cover communications between (trusted) multilevel hosts. 
The FTLS of such hosts may be required. It is hoped by the authors that 
the FTLS of the network could be utilised by designers of secure 
multilevel hosts, so that statements about end-to-end security can be 
made

Note: Introduction: System Safety Engineering is the application of 
scientific and Systems Engineering methodology and management 
techniques to minimize risk in a product. Software safety is the 
extension of that discipline into software. Significant differences 
exist between the traditional safety approach to hardware control and 
failure modes and safety's new approach to software control and 
failure modes. While the management shell existed, there were few 
analysis techniques which were applicable five years ago. Today the 
safety management shell is being successfully integrated into the 
software realm and several analysis techniques have nearly been 
perfected, showing independently repeatable results. The current 
iteration of improvement involves determining the type and timing of 
specific data from software and quality engineers. We are perfecting a 
process which provides software data which is useful and feeds our 
analysis and reports in a timely, pro-active fashion, rather than "oh, by 
the way I need it yesterday" requests for data. The current analysis 
techniques are labor intensive. The next iteration in perfecting the 
process involves reaching further for active design techniques and 
efficient analysis techniques. I present this paper to acquaint people 
with Software Safety Engineering and call upon computer security 
engineers to call out those design and analysis techniques you possess 
in your repertoire which might assist us in doing our job better.

Symposium on Security and Privacy; 1988 Apr; Oakland, CA. : IEEE 
Computer Society: pp.2-7. ISBN: 0-8186-0850-1.
Note: In essence McLean has extended the basic Bell/LaPadula 
framework in two directions to yield an algebra and a lattice of 
models. The first extension is to introduce the notion of subjects able 
to change the clearances of subjects, and the classifications of 
objects. The second extension allows the formulation of n-person rules. 
The fact that both these extensions form an algebra, and a lattice wrt 
the Boolean operators is, apart from theoretical interest, potentially 
useful to the makers of policy models. More complex models can be 
constructed by combining simpler models.
In a little more detail the development runs as follows: start with the 
Bell/LaPadula framework of subjects, objects, finite lattice, and 
access modes. To this are added functions representing which subjects 
can alter the clearances of which subjects and alter the classifications 
of which objects. By considering the space of such functions we form a 
set of models. It is easily shown that these form a partially ordered 
set. The Boolean operators ,  and ' (complement) can be applied to 
this set to form a (closed) boolean algebra.
The second, further extension is to include the notion on n-person 
rules, where certain access modes to objects are granted only when n 
subjects request it simultaneously. This is achieved simply by 
replacing the set of subjects S by its power set less the empty set 
(S)-{}. The resulting set of models again form an algebra with 
respect to the operations ,  and '.
Unfortunately, this set contains models representing 'bizarre' policies. 
These can be excluded but with the result that the new set fails to 
form an algebra; it does, however, continue to form a distributive 
lattice under  and . Indication is given of how this framework could 
be applied to DAC instead of MAC.
The ideas presented are interesting and potentially useful, particularly 
to the builders of policy models. Some pleasing mathematics is 
presented but on the whole the session left a feeling of disappointment. 
The title and author rather led one to expect something rather deeper 
and more sweeping. In fact this work rests heavily on Bell/LaPadula 
and so carries forward many of its deficiencies. Indeed, somewhat 
curiously, McLean launches into a critique of Bell/LaPadula only to 
resign himself to it in what follows.
An interesting feature of the paper is that it represents another 
illustration of the concerns for the mathematical properties of sets of 
models rather than dealing just with the properties models in isolation. 
This indicates the potential for the application of category theory to 
security models.
A general framework is developed in which various mandatory access 
control security models that allow changes in security levels can be 
formalized.  These models form a Boolean Algebra.  The framework is 
expanded to include models that allow n-person rules necessary for 
discretionary access controls in an industrial security setting.  The 
resulting framework is a distributive lattice.

McLean, John. Reasoning about Security Models. 1987. 
A method for evaluating security models is developed and applied to the 
model of Bell and LaPadula. The method shows the inadequacy of the 
Bell and LaPadula model in particular, and the impossibility of any 
adequate definition of a secure system based solely on the notion of a 
secure state. The implications for the frutifulness of seeking a global 
definition of a secure system and for the state of foundational research 
in computer security in general, is discussed.
IEEE Comp. Soc. Proc 1987 Symp. Security and Privacy, pp. 123 - 131
This is a thoughtful reassessment of the Bell & LaPadula security 
model, maintaining that the model is inadequate to bear the weight the 
computer security community has placed on it.
Attention is drawn to the crucial role of the tranquillity property, 
which prohibits changing the security level of an active subject; this is 
dropped from the later formulations of B-LaP. McLean's 
counterexample, 'system Z', which is obviously insecure and yet 
conforms to B-LaP has given rise to a lot of controversy over the 
networks in the last year, and revealed much confusion over the status 
of the tranquillity property, or more generally, exactly what B-LaP 
means.
McLean argues that uncritical acceptance of the model, and the fact 
that it is in danger of becoming enshrined in official doctrine, are 
harmful to deeper understanding and will impede progress. The model 
has now outlived its usefulness.
The moral is that we should not look for some single essence of the 
concept of security, but rather accept that there may be several 
concepts which bear only a family resemblance. Thus we should look at 
each application separately and adopt the relevant concept.

1990 May 7; Oakland. USA: IEEE 1990: 180-189. 
Note: A most valuable and interesting paper, and winner of one of the 
two awards for best papers. Various information-flow oriented 
security models are criticised, as failing to correspond sufficiently 
well to intuitive notions of security, and a new model put forward. The 
Bell and Lapadula model is re-examined, and found good.
Sutherlands Nondeducibility model is criticised on two grounds:
 It is bi-directional (prohibits flows from low to high as well as high 
to low). Thus it expresses a compartmentalisation policy rather 
than a true security policy.
 It protects high-level inputs only, that is, all high-level outputs are 
presumed derived from high-level inputs. Examples are given to 
motivate this concern. Firstly there is the generation of high-level 
cryptographic keys from low-level seed-numbers. More generally, an 
expensive (resource-intensive) computation may produce high-level 
(or high-value) outputs, to be protected, derived from low-level input.
Bi-directionality is avoided by taking time into account, and saying 
that information flows from H to L only if H assigns values to objects 
in a state which precedes the state in which L makes its assignment. 
This leads to a first approximation to McLeans new model. Advantages 
claimed are: not bi-directional, rules out systems in which low-level 
users can gain probabilistic knowledge of high-level events even if 
they cannot rule out any high-level event as impossible. Finally, under a 
suitable interpretation, rules out timing channels.
The next consideration is that this model is too strong: does not 
distinguish between purely statistical correlations between H and L 
and causality. Consider strong auditing, where a high-level audit 
record must be written before each write to a low-level object, and the 
audit record contains a copy of the low-level data about to be written. 
Here the low objects are apparently tracking the values of high objects 
(audit records). This is a statistical correlation, not causal (the high 
objects do not cause the low objects to be what they are), not insecure.
This leads to McLeans Flow Model, as follows. Let L be an assignment 
of values to low objects in a given state. The probability of L, given the 
sequences of high and low assignments in all preceding states, must 
equal the probability of L given only the sequence of low assignments 
in all preceding states.
Next Goguen and Meseguers Noninterference model, and McCulloughs 
generalisations to nondeterministic systems are considered. 
Generalized Noninterference has two problems:
 As with Nondeducibility, protecting high-level input is not always 
sufficient to protect high-level output.
 Any extension to it concerned with protecting high-level outputs 
must adequately model causal dependencies to distinguish between 
statistical correlations among outputs which are security-violations 
and those which are not.
To overcome these problems, a change to Noninterference or its 
descendants is advocated: not to the syntactic form of the model but to 
its assumptions and interpretation of its primitives. It is to be 
assumed that any high-level output to be protected cannot be generated 
from low-level input data unless that data has been operated on by a 
high-level program, which is itself a kind of high-level input. Thus we 
are back to protecting only high inputs again.
The final section of McLeans paper is concerned with the Bell and 
Lapadula model (BLP) and its relation to noninterference. Although BLP 
is a purely formal model with no interpretation prescribed for its 
primitives (e.g. read-access), with the customary interpretations it 
is equivalent to Generalized Noninterference, and intuitively treats 
causality well. If this is so why is covert channel analysis necessary? 
To make sure of appropriate interpretations of the BLP primitives. That 
is to say, we are concerned with the mappings of models to systems.
Afterthought: McCulloughs motivation was explicitly the desire for a 
compositional property. It isnt clear at the moment whether 
McLeans formulation is compositional, or what it would take to prove 
it.
We develop a theory of information flow that differs from 
Nondeducibility's, which we see is really a  theory of information 
sharing.  We use our theory to develop a flow-based security model, FM, 
and show that the proper treatment of security-relevant causal factors 
in such a framework is very tricky.  Using FM as a standard for 
comparison, we examine Noninterference, Generalized Noninterference, 
and extensions to Noninterference designed to protect high -level 
output, and see that the proper treatment of causal factors in such 
models requires us to consider programs as explicit input to systems.  
This gives a new perspective on security levels.  The Bell and LaPadula 
Model, on the other hand, more successully models security-relevant 
causal information although this success is bought at the expense of 
the model being vague about its primitives.  This vagueness is examined 
with respect to the claim that the Bell and LaPadula Model and 
Noninterference are equivalent.

Information flow models are usually conceived in terms of 
requirements on system traces, while verification that a system 
satisfies information flow requirements is usually done in terms of a 
state machine specification. The necessary translation from one model 
to another may result in a loss of understandability and expressiveness. 
Recently McLean has pointed the way to a solution to this problem by 
showing how a language based on traces of procedure calls may be used 
to reason about security, and how one may prove that a program 
satisfies a specification written in that language. The language that he 
uses, however, does not easily lend itself to specification of 
composition of communicating processes. In this paper we modify the 
language so that it is possible to specify the composition of systems. 
We also describe several different information flow properties 
analogous to properties that have been defined for other systems and 
discuss their composability.

Use in the Absence of a Continuously Available Third Party. 1986 Apr. 
IEEE Comp. Soc. Proc. 1986 Symp. Security and Privacy pp.134-137
This paper presents a secure algorithm to allow representatives of 
organisations to exchange matching credentials without having to 
consult their parent organisations; the algorithm ensures that 
information about the secrets does not pass between the parties if they 
do not match.
Cryptographic techniques, based on the Diffie-Hellman protocol for 
secure key exchanges are used. Each user knows the public key of each 
organisation, and the private key of his own; the protocol starts by both 
parties exchanging signed messages verifying their organisational 
affiliation, containing a function of their credentials, and establishing 
an encryption key. This key is used for an acknowledge handshake, and 
then for a final pair of messages in which users exchange exponentials 
calculated from their own credentials and the supplied value derived 
from the other's credentials.
The protocol is designed not just to protect the users from outside 
parties, but also from each other, so that one side cannot discover a 
match without revealing the fact to the other. The security of the 
protocol depends on each party protecting their private keys, and on the 
difficulty of factorising large numbers and of finding logarithms in 
multiplicative groups.
The paper presented itself as an improved solution to a problem 
addressed by a paper at the 1985 IEEE symposium on security and 
privacy, the difference being that the new algorithm does not require a 
third party to be online at all times. However, there are sufficient 
differences to mean that new algorithm is best considered as a 
solution to a separate problem.

Extending the Brewer-Nash Model to a Multilevel Context. in: 1990 IEEE 
Computer Society Symposium on Research in Security and Privacy; 
1990 May 7; Oakland. USA: IEEE; 1990: 95-102. 
Note: The Brewer-Nash model was motivated by the requirements of the 
UK Financial Services Act for preventing one companys sensitive 
information being passed to another company and for reducing the 
opportunities for insider trading. It formalises these Chinese walls in a 
security model.
The paper applies the ideas in this model to the old and thorny problem 
in multilevel security of aggregation. The simplest example of this is 
the NSA phone book where individual entries are not classified but the 
entire book is. Unlike in the original Brewer-Nash model, sufficiently 
cleared people may have access to the entire phone book. The access 
denial on aggregation is not absolute, but the sensitivity of the data 
increases on aggregation. A useful non-military example given was 
where the budget for departments is not as sensitive as the budget for 
an entire organisation.
The solution presented in this paper is to preserve a history of objects 
accessed by each subject. The objects accessed imply a minimum 
sensitivity level to which accessing subjects should be cleared.
After prolonged use, certain systems where new data continually 
arrives for processing could be rendered inoperable. No description was 
given of any means of ensuring the continuous use of the system, for 
example by deleting objects in a subjects history after a certain 
time.
Unusually, the paper had a rejoinder built into the program. Dorothy 
Denning argued that aggregation is an abstract problem which is man-
made. Since the problem is artificial this model (although a good one) 
brings out the ugliness of the requirements. She said that users must 
have access to all information for which they are responsible and that 
they should not be given access to information for which they have no 
responsibility. The assignment of responsibility was not a matter of 
picking up the data at a users request as described by the paper but 
one of deliberate assignment. The latter process is one which is 
already covered by current models with DAC or a change of user 
clearance.
In the ensuing extended question and answer session the distinction 
between strategic and tactical information was brought out. Strategic 
information was more valuable because it enables one to derive the 
tactical information more readily than in deriving the strategic 
information from the tactical. It was suggested that the protection of 
the different types of data should be such that the cost of obtaining the 
strategic data was equivalent to the cost of obtaining all the tactical 
data.
An analogy was drawn with cryptography where it was asserted that 
given enough cipher text (tactical data) one could deduce the clear text 
(strategic data) and that the strength of mechanism had to be 
appropriate for the two types of data and their availabilities.
Finally, we were reminded that computers cannot take the full picture 
of who has access to what information within an organisation so the 
histories kept within a computer are likely to be inadequate.
In this paper we show how the Brewer-Nash Chinese Wall model can be 
extended to a policy for handling the aggregation problem in a 
multilevel context.  We derive a lattice-based information flow policy 
that can be integrated into both the multilevel and Brewer -Nash 
context.  We use this information flow policy to develop a security 
policy described in terms of labeled subjects accessing labeled objects 
that will allow us to construct a system  that prevents users from 
accessing aggregates that they are not cleared to see.

Meadows, Catherine. The Integrity Lock Architecture and Its 
Application to Message Systems: Reducing Covert Channels. 1987. 
The integrity lock architecture provides a means of constructing a 
secure database management system with a relatively small amount of 
trusted code, using a trusted filter which verifies the integrity of 
security labels on data from an untrusted DBMS by computing 
cryptographic checksums. However, since the trusted filter can only 
check whether or not an individual item of data has been tampered 
with, and not whether or not that item is a correct answer to a 
particular database query, a covert channel exists through which a 
Trojan Horse in the DBMS can leak classified information by encoding it 
in various innocuous queries. In this paper we discuss a possible 
solution to this covert channel problem for message systems.
IEEE Comp. Soc. Proc 1987 Symp. Security and Privacy, pp. 212 - 218
In this paper the method of integrity locks is applied to the 
hierarchical data structure of NRL's Secure Military Message System.
The ideas in this paper are worth further investigation, but increasing 
the complexity of the integrity lock architecture increases the 
diversity of covert channels, the effect of inefficiency of cryptography, 
the difficulty of key management and the number of additional checks 
in the trusted filter. As Dorothy Denning pointed out, it might be 
simpler to have a trusted message handling system in the first place.

In this paper we describe a formal specification language and 
verification technique for analyzing key management protocols, and we 
introduce a prototype verification tool that can be used to apply this 
technique. We formally specify and verify a protocol intended for use in 
the management of resource sharing, and we show how the use of our 
techniques led to the discovery of a flaw that could be exploited by an 
intruder to convince a user of the system that he has obtained a service 
when he actually has not.

Using Narrowing in the Analysis of Key Management Protocols. in: 1989 
IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy; May 1; Oakland, California. 
USA: IEEE Computer Society; 1989: 138-147. 
Note: The security of a cryptographic system is dependent on its 
cryptographic algorithms, their implementing hardware, and its 
communications protocols. This paper considers how techniques used in 
the analysis of term-rewriting systems may be adapted to automated 
analysis of cryptographic protocols.
Consider a network of users, taking part in a cryptographic protocol, 
having the capability of performing a fixed set operations on data. 
Although these operations are undefined, certain properties that can be 
defined algebraically are required (e.g. decryption is the inverse of 
encryption). The results of operations can be represented symbolically 
as words in an algebraic system. A cryptographic protocol can be 
thought of as a set of input data dependent rules.
Assume a penetrator has complete control of the communications 
network; he can analyse, alter or destroy traffic. Assume, however, he 
knows nothing about the cryptosystem except a set of algebraic 
properties. His goal is to obtain secret words, i.e. he is trying to 
determine, in the term-rewriting language, whether there are words 
that reduce to a secret word.
Analysis is a two stage process. Consider the set of insecure system 
states, then work backwards to show that none of these states can be 
reached from any secure initial state. There was agreement that there 
is no rigorous way of establishing the complete set of insecure states. 
Other difficulties are finding all states from which a given state is 
immediately reachable, and analysis may lead to an infinite regression.
To establish whether a penetrator can derive a word of a particular 
form, the output of each of the rules defining the protocol are 
considered and relevant substitutions obtained. General conclusions are 
drawn about what he originally needed to know to achieve his aim. This 
process of deriving substitutions is known as narrowing, a 
technique for solving in equational systems defined by term-rewriting 
languages. An inductive argument can be used to prove that a penetrator 
cannot know any words in the language. Show that, in order for him to 
learn a word, he must already know another word, and that he did not 
initially know any words.
An analysis of the IBM Key Management Protocol is presented in the 
paper, along with intended future research and comparisons with other 
work. The presentation was short, succinct and, in general, well 
accepted.

This is the standard reference given for Ethernet, a baseband mode 
local area network designed at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center. 
Ethernet was designed as a suitable communications system on which 
distributed computer systems could be based. Ethernet is a broadcast 
bus-type of network whose medium is a coaxial cable. The designers 
attempted to make the network as efficient as possible by reducing the 
amount of system bandwidth wasted through packet collisions.
After characterising local area networks the paper gives a brief 
system summary and lists its design principals, one of which is for 
ease of expansion. It classifies the topology of an Ethernet as a tree, 
describes the requirement for cooperation amongst stations, explains 
that broadcast packets as well as individually addressed ones are 
allowed and elaborates on the network's reliability and the mechanisms 
used to provide its packet service.
A description is given of hardware and network packet structure 
details. It is then shown that expansion can be accomodated in the 
three principal areas of signal cover (using packet repeaters), traffic 
cover (using packet filters) and address cover (using packet gateways).
A semi-mathematical evaluation of performance is then given, 
followed by a mention of some higher level protocols (an Ethernet file 
transfer protocol in particular).

Many of today's network products are based on the client-server 
distributed network model. This client-server model was analyzed from 
a security perspective and an expanded client-server model which 
includes security-relevant properties was developed. As the next step 
in developing a trusted client-server network, a network-oriented 
security policy was produced. The various services provided on the 
distributed network map elegantly into NTCB partitions producing an 
easily specified system architecture and simplifying the task of 
resource protection. This approach also allows the NTCB interface to be 
easily specified since the interface is defined by the network protocols 
used to access the individual services.

CACM 19(5) pp.243-250
Describes the verification of a PDP-11/45 security kernel. The kernel 
is described by a hierarchy of specifications of decreasing abstraction: 
Bell and LaPadula formal security model; formal specification of the 
kernel; algorithmic specification written in some high level language; 
and, the hardware and software machine.
The aim is to verify the equivalence between adjacent layers in this 
hierarchy. This paper concentrates on the verification of the security 
model and the formal specification.
The kernel is specified by its state (a set of objects) and a set of 
functions that operate on the state. The functions are defined by the 
state transition they cause.
The problem of covert channels being supported by the kernel is 
discussed. The solution given is to ensure that all state variables 
within the kernel are objects in the security model sense.
Then the paper interprets what the security policy means in terms of 
the formal specification. Finally, an outline of the proof that the 
DELETE function conforms to the star property is given.
This interesting description of security verification gives the flavour 
of how such verifications should be organised.

Millen, Jonathan K. Covert Channel Capacity. 1987. 
Techniques for detecting covert channels are based on information flow 
models. This paper establishes a connection between Shannon's theory 
of communication and information flow models, such as the Goguen-
Meseguer model, that view a reference monitor as a state-transition 
automaton. The channel associated with a machine and a compromise 
policy is defined, and the capacity of that channel is taken as measure 
of covert channel information rate.
IEEE Comp. Soc. Proc 1987 Symp. Security and Privacy, pp. 60 - 66
A most interesting paper. Security-properties such as described by the 
Goguen-Meseguer non-interference model or the Sutherland deducibility 
model are formally related to the Shannon theory of communication-
channel capacity.
Under certain assumptions about probability-distribution of inputs, it 
can be shown that channel capacity is zero, which we would naturally 
regard as as good as non-interference. However, the converse does not 
hold: noninterference is not a necessary condition for zero channel 
capacity; it is simply a sufficient condition.
Consequently, non-interference is pessimistic: it implicitly makes the 
worst-case assumption that inputs from all users other than the one 
under consideration could be known to or controlled by the attacker.
If a source of inputs X interferes with a sink of outputs Y, the amount 
of information transmitted from X to Y depends on the distribution of 
inputs from V (sources other than X). Thus if V is constant, channel 
capacity is maximum. An example is given in which X does interfere 
with Y but X and Y are statistically independent and thus no information 
flows - channel capacity being zero.
In subsequent discussion, two points emerged. Firstly, that work is 
under way to actually measure some of these distributions, for 
example, by logging all system calls under Unix for a period of 3 days.

A multilevel object-oriented system can be implemented on a

single security level that applies to all its contents (variables and 
methods). The informal security policy model includes properties such 
as compatibility of security level assignments with the class 
hierarchy. The representation of integrity constraints and 
classification constraints is illustrated.

shows that cascading is possible in some cases where systems have

This was a most interesting presentation, and the paper appears quite

An access control mechanism based on boolean expression evaluation, 
BEE, is presented. This mechanism allows the implementation of 
customer-specified rather than vendor-specified security policies. The 
mechanism enables one to easily implement such conventional 
mechanisms as access control lists, named access control lists, user 
groups, user attributes, user capability lists, and user roles. Additional 
access restrictions based on time, day, date, location, load average, or 
any customer-supplied function can be incorporated into access 
decisions. This mechanism can directly express Clark-Wilson triples 
and it can easily implement policies that are difficult or impossible to 
implement using the Bell-LaPadula model.

The intention of the National Software Works (NSW) was to provide 
ARPANET programmers with a unified tool kit, distributed over many 
hosts, and a single user interface with a uniform command language, a 
global file system and a single access control, accounting, and auditing 
mechanism. In this way the cost of software production would be 
dramatically reduced. The system was in regular operation from May 
1977.
The main components of NSW are: 'MSG', the inter-process message 
system which supports both generic and specific addressing and three 
types of communication (messages, connections, and alarms); the file 
system and works manager, which manages authentication, job 
creation, file access, and other distributed operating system function; 
the foreman which is the local run-time system/operating system in 
individual hosts; and, the file package, which resides on every host

In a distributed database system, several replicas (copies) of a data 
object may be maintained at different sites to improve reliability. 
However, maintaining replicas may also affect the security of the 
system in terms of secrecy and integrity. Thus, it is natural to 
integrate reliability and security issues within a replica control 
protocol. In this paper, we present a secure quorum protocol which 
integrates a quorum protocol to attain consistency of replicated data 
and a cryptographic technique to attain security of data. We present 
two efficient methods for generating quorums which are best suited 
for the secure quorum protocol. Then, we present an algorithm, called 
the join algorithm, which is very useful for constructing a large set of 
quorums and show that the join algorithm may be used to improve the 
overall security of the secure quorum protocol.

A method of implementing access control for computer resources is 
presented, along with examples and possible enhancements. An 
appropriate application for such resource control can be found in 
computer operating systems. Thus, the need for resource control is 
described first, followed by descriptions of some common 
implementations and the impetus for their development. In light of this 
discussion, the alternative implementation proposed in this paper will 
be presented, followed by a discussion of what improvements over the 
classical implementations are offered. This done, a series of possible 
extensions are presented.

Traditional methods of user authentication in distrlbuted
systems suffer from an important weakness which is due
to the low degree of randomness in secrets that human be-
ings can use for identification. Even though weak secrets
(passwords and PINs) are typically not exposed in the clear
over the communication lines, they can be discovered with
off-line brute force attacks based on exhaustive trials. Since
such secrets are chosen from a relatively small key space,
a determined adversary can try all possible values until a
match is found between the trial value and the message
recorded from a genuine authentication session. Authen-
tication devices like smartcards and token cards offer an
attractive solution by providing a user with a cryptograph-
ically strong key for authentication. In contrast to pass-
words and PINs, the device's key can be chosen from a
much larger key space thus making a brute force attack
computationally infeasible or, at least, diffcult.
	In this paper we present a novel authentication method
whereby the authentication device (a token card) is used
solely to provide a secure channel between a human user
and an authentication server (AS). Since the communi-
cation channel is secured by the card, the user can stlll
utilize weak secrets for authentication purposes, but, with-
out any risk of exposure. Furthermore, the card's and the
user's secrets are mutually independent, i.e., the card is
not associated with any particular user. Since the card is
impersonal, it can be freely shared by several users. This
eliminates the high cost of administration which is typi-
cal of existing designs requiring fixed user-device relation-
ship. Moreover, our method does not require any coupling
between the token card and the workstation (e.g., a gal-
vanic connection) which would be dificult to implement
on a global scale and retrofit onto existing equipment.

1988: pp.245-255. ISBN: 0-8186-0850-1.
Note: A framework is presented with which to discuss the problems of 
inference that occur in multilevel database systems. It is suggested in 
the paper that, due to the inherent complexity of inference detection, 
this framework be the base for a set of computer based tools for the 
detection of inference.
The framework is based on a universe of discourse which is held to 
contain all relations specified in the database and also all 
relationships and constraints external to the database that a potential 
user could know. This universe is potentially infinite and it is thus not 
possible to ensure that all relevant external information has been 
captured.
Data objects in this universe are related by inference. Given a data 
object it is possible to infer (possibly partial) information about other 
data objects. Characterising inference allows the description of the 
sphere of influence of a (core) set of data objects as being all objects 
that can be inferred from this core data.
Safety can be defined in terms of inference and sphere of influence. A 
data object is safe if, from it, you can infer nothing of a higher 
classification. A classification level is safe if the sphere of influence 
of the objects of that classification level contain no objects of a 
higher classification - a sufficient condition for this is that the sphere 
of influence is a fixed point for those objects.
Safety utilises forward chaining of inference: what can be inferred 
from something. Inference channels are backward chaining: from what 
can we infer something. An inference channel for a data object details 
data objects from which that object can be (partially) deduced.
Using the language of inference, spheres of influence, safety and 
inference channels it is now possible to disuss inference and its 
effects on multi-level database systems. The paper describes how, 
once potential inference channels have been recognised, they can either 
be removed, their effect reduced or be monitored.
This paper is closely related to that presented by T.H.Hinke, entitled 
'Inference Aggregation Detection in Database Management Systems' (pp. 
96-106 of the proceedings).
The potential for logical inference of high level information based upon 
lower level visible data presents an interesting and challenging threat 
to multilevel security.  Such compromises of security are rather novel 
since they circumvent traditional security mechanisms and rely on a 
user's knowledge of the application, which is external to the security 
layers of the system.  The potential for such inferences, and the 
multiple consequences of a corrective action, substantially complicate 
the task of classifying the data in a secure manner.  Computer-based 
tools will be needed to assist in this process, especially when 
multilevel databases of substantial size and complexity are considered.  
Heretofore, the problems of inference and security have been 
amorphous and difficult to circumscribe.  This paper proposes a 
framework for studying these inference control problems, describes a 
representation for relevant semantics of the application, develops 
criteria for safety and security of a system to prevent these problems, 
and describes the functionality of the proposed classification tool in 
terms of a scenario for its use.

This paper was mainly concerned with digital telephone systems for 
voice and data transmission, and the types of attack which may be 
made on them. These include transmission confidentiality, 
transmission integrity, denial of service, system software integrity 
and system hardware integrity. The last of these is somewhat more 
likely to be a problem in a telephone system than a computer system, 
because of its wide geographic distribution. It is pointed out, however, 
that this could become a problem in computer systems, since, if chip-
production facilities are available, it is possible to manufacture 
'replacement' chips which could be installed in target machines, 
unknown to their owners. These chips could perform additional covert 
functions whilst mimicking the originals.
Most of this paper is specific to telephone-like networks, but the 
suggestion of 'spoof chips' appears to be significant. These chips could 
be made to carry out many covert functions, the easiest of which to 
manufacture is the 'chip bomb'. This could be designed to generate a 
denial of service attack at a specified time, or, for example, by radio 
command. Many other possible variants of this idea could be used.

This looks at the way the UNIX passsword protection mechanism has 
developed over the years, in response to attacks. It started off by 
holding password information in a heavily protected file, then one-way 
encryption was used. This is vulnerable to attacks through trying likely 
passwords; dictionaries can be built containing candidate passwords 
and their encrypted forms. Adopting DES - which is slow in software - 
improved security; use of DES chips in an attack is avoided by 
modifying the algorithm slightly. Other improvements were to avoid 
predictable passwords by warning users if they chose a bad one, and by 
salting the password before encryption with a 12-bit number stored 
with the encrypted passwords - this 'seed' is chosen randomly when the 
password is set up.

Moser, Louise E. Graph Homomorphisms and the Design of Secure 
Computer Systems. 1987. 
In designing and analyzing the structure and security of a large scale 
computer program or system, one is often interested in how it is 
constructed out of pieces or in the flow of information through it. The 
concepts of dependency, connectivity and separability which arise in 
security verification are handled well by graph theory. As is shown in 
this paper, graph homomorphisms are particularly useful for describing 
the hierarchical/modular design of a system and for demonstrating the 
security of information flow.
IEEE Comp. Soc. Proc 1987 Symp. Security and Privacy, pp. 88 - 96
In this paper Louise Moser discusses the application of graph theory to 
the design and analysis of large scale secure systems. Directed graphs 
are used in which the vertices (nodes) represent processes and edges 
(arcs) represent information flow from a source vertex to a destination 
vertex. Graphs therefore provide a simple language in which to express 
the architecture of information systems.
For the specification of secure systems, the paper goes on to discuss 
coloured graphs in which the vertices are 'coloured' (or attributed) with 
the classification of information handled by those processes. 
Homomorphisms are used to characterise valid decompositions of 
systems described by graphs. The paper proves some theorems about 
the properties of homomorphisms and these are illustrated in the 
context of the security related examples.
The content of this paper appears sound and the techniques may be 
useful for specifying the architecture of some systems. The security 
policy enforced by a system is implemented in the colour of the 
vertices and the direction of information flow. A possible drawback of 
this approach is that coloured graphs assume a static labelling of 
vertices. The work described in this paper will only be of interest to 
theoreticians as it is only at an early stage of development and it is 
unclear in which direction it will continue.

We will investigate the effects of noise upon a simple timing channel. 
Shannon's information theory is used to quantify the resulting 
information flow across the channel. In particular we study how a 
probabilistic response time to a query by a low user affects the mutual 
information and channel capacity. We obtain a result of Millen's as a 
special case.

Management. in: 14th National Computer Security Conference; 1991 Oct; 
Washington. USA: NIST/NCSC; 1991; 2: pp.563-571. 
This paper proposes a reference framework to help improve the 
effectiveness of information security management. The framework is 
intended as a standardized vehicle that can be used by both business 
and security managements to identify and prioritize information 
security requirements on the basis of the intended use of the 
information, the value priority of the information, and the critical 
security factors for that information. The paper also suggests that a 
serendipitous benefit resulting from the use of the proposed framework 
could be a better understanding of the present and potential use of an 
organization's information assets for competitive advantage.

1979. 
IEEE. Proceedings 4th International Conference on Software Engineering
This paper describes CORE, a method for Controlled Requirement 
Expression. The CORE method has been defined to fit into a set of 
standards and procedures produced by Systems Designers Limited. A 
mapping has been defined from the CORE diagrammatic notation into the 
terminology of the automated aid PSL/PSA (ref.1)
 CORE is applicable to description of dynamic aspects of many types of 
system (i.e. not just computer systems). Current applications include: 
specifying requirements for a new avionics system; a description of 
the total project organisation, standards and procedures for the 
software life-cycle; description of the requirements for an automated 
aid for system description.
CORE is supported by a diagrammatic notation whose features derive 
from several widely used specification and design diagrammatic 
notations. The notation can be applied to the description of both 
requirement and design. This paper describes its application to 
requirement.

Note: Introduction: This paper seeks to identify common issues relating 
to the use of security labels within the secure ODA and secure POSIX 
environments. The underlying security concepts of the two standards 
are discussed and mutual requirements highlighted. After an analysis of 
existing security labels, we propose an optimum generic security label. 
Finally, we discuss how a secure system may utilize the security label 
capabilities of both ODA and POSIX to provide appropriate sensitivity 
label protection for documents and information labels for document 
handling restrictions. This paper represents the views of the authors 
and does not represent the views of British Telecom, Alcatel nor those

A cryptographic scheme can be used for controlling access to 
information, since any user who does not have a proper key can not 
decipher. But for this purpose, a user would have to manage a huge 
number of keys when he tries to communicate with a lot of people. The 
practical utilization method of access control by cryptography is 
discussed in this paper. We suppose a typical organizational structure 
called hierarchical group oriented structure. After that, we propose a 
hierarchical group oriented key management method (HGK method) 
based on the multiple keys generated from the combination of pieces, 
and describe that this method is very desirable in terms of reducing the 
numbers of keys required for each user in the hierarchical group 
oriented structure.

system using the RGL250 portable authenticator. While raising a few 
general points the paper does not contain information of any great

This paper examines some questions concenring commercial computer 
security integrity policies.  We give an example of a dynamic 
separation of duty policy which cannot be implemented by TCSEC based 
mechanisms alone, yet occurs in the real commercial world and can be 
implemented efficiently in practice.  We examine and describe a 
commercial computer security product in wide use for ensuring the 
integrity of financial transactions, show that it implements a well 
defined and sensible integrity policy that includes separation of duty, 
yet fails to meet either the TCSEC criteria or the Clark and Wilson 
rules.

This book describes the philosophy of the system that has grown up 
around the Cambridge Ring at the Cambridge University Computer 
Laboratory. Originally the only machines connected were a number of 
minicomputers (2 PDP/11s, a PDP/7, the CAP computer and a DG NOVA 
computer), and the network was used for file transfer between these. 
There was a spurt of activity that led to a number of other machines 
being added, including a printer server (to which files could be 
transferred). As more machines were added, a 'name server' was 
needed, which was implemented on a Z80-based single card computer; 
this Z80 card was used for many more small server machines, each 
providing a separate service.
The next addition to the network was a number of computers with no 
peripherals other than the network; this required protocols to allow 
machines to be allocated to users, loaded with suitable bootstrap 
programs, talked to by their user, and returned when no longer 
needed/used. In addition to the resource manager to handle these 
machines, there was also a need for a network-wide authentication 
mechanism.
The book describes the current state (February 1982) of the system 
including, in an informal style, the protocols used by the various 
servers.

Needham, Roger M.; Schroeder, M. D. Using Encryption for Authentication 
in Large Networks of Computers. 1978 Sep. 
Xerox PARC report CSL-78-4
This paper discusses the use of encryption to achieve authenticated 
communication in computer networks. It presents example protocols 
for the establishment of authenticated connections, the management of 
authenticated mail and for signature verification and document 
integrity guarantee. Both conventional and public-key encryption 
algorithms are considered as the basis of such protocols.
The most important algorithm is the one used for two parties to 
establish a new conversation key for use between them. The method 
employs the services of a trusted (by all parties) authentication server 
which knows the encryption keys of all possible parties. Both private- 
and public- key versions of this protocol are presented.
The problems of this kind of method are related to the inadvisability of 
keeping the secret keys of all participants in the authentication server, 
the difficulty of getting them there and their selective revocation once 
participants suspect that their key has been compromised.

This paper describes the problems inherent in system verification 
where the system is considered as a single black box, and describes a 
method of decomposing the system so that the composition can be 
verified.
The concept of a 'Trust Domain' is introduced; each individual trust 
domain is a component with a well defined functional boundary, which 
is entitled to assume the validity of certain assertions about its 
environment. In return, there are certain properties about its behaviour 
that can be expected, and these typically form part of the 
environmental assertions of other trust domains.
A trust domain can be 'verified' by proving that within the limited 
scope implied by the environmental assumptions it will not allow any 
violations of its derived constraints. An 'untrusted' component is a 
trust domain with no derived contraints; within the assumed 
environment it has no restrictions.
A language has been developed to describe trust domains and their 
structural and contraint relationships, for example: 'node domain A 
shall contain boundary node C; adjoin link B; associate C with B; derive 
for B constraint Y; constraint Z; receive from C constraint X; end A;'. 
This language has been used to describe the Multinet Gateway System, 
and work is underway to translate TD descriptions to Gypsy 
automatically.
Trust domains appear a useful tool to describe components of 
distributed system, where the policy imposed by each component is 
several levels down from the overall security policy, and where a 
number of configurations may require verification. The technique is not 
restricted to multilevel security, and has the advantage that the proof 
of individual trust domains should be understandable.

community, but few practical examples of its usage exist. This paper 
describes and analyses the planned use of polyinstantiation at the 
United States Transportation Command Military Airlift Command

unique to this approach, and proposes several trusted commercial-off-

Central Authentication On Existing Distributed Terminal Services. in: 
1989 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy; May 1; Oakland, 
California. USA: IEEE Computer Society; 1989: 290-299. 
Note: This paper deals with the implementation of a secure logon 
protocol in the context of a distributed system with a single 
administering authority. The implementation is achieved by an attempt 
to layer the authentication protocol over existing terminal protocols. 
The intent is to evaluate the feasibility of this approach in general and 
also to establish requirements in terminal architecture design that 
would help to support secure logon.
The need for centralised authentication becomes apparent when 
considering the procedures necessary to expurgate an infiltrator and 
restore secure operations when the password database is scattered and 
partially replicated throughout a distributed system.
The paper discusses logon protocols, comparing around the horn with 
remote procedure call protocols. It concludes that the former is 
more secure as host logon information does not have to pass through a 
potentially vulnerable terminal process, however it suffers from the 
disadvantage that most terminal protocols require session initiation by 
the terminal process rather than the contacted host.
Despite these security considerations, the system implemented uses 
the RPC protocol, as the horn protocol could not be easily layered above 
an existing virtual terminal protocol.
VMS systems linked by DECNET were chosen as the test architecture. 
The virtual terminal protocol (for technical reasons) was chosen to be 
CTERM. This apparently has a rather RPC flavour and is was principally 
this that led to the decision to use an RPC logon protocol despite the 
security considerations. It is proposed to support session security 
labelling (not supported by the host architecture) by means of trusted 
terminal multiplexers.
There are a number of (unsolved) problems:
 underlying architectures have a significant effect on the choice of 
logon protocols;
 the question of authorization is still not addressed;
 the protocol is sensitive to the underlying virtual terminal protocol, 
leading to increased maintenance costs;
 passage of reusable host logon information through a vulnerable 
terminal process leads to a risk of disclosure;
 if such a disclosure occurs then (in the RPC format) there is no easy 
method to support distribution of information about the compromise, 
since an advantage of RPC is that there is no need for authenticator-
host protocols to be set up;
 multi-level security - the multiplexor solution leads to the need for 
dedicated hardware and net work topology constraints.
The paper concludes with a list of recommendations to future system 
designers which basically boil down to a statement that if secure logon 
protocols and session security labelling are required in a distributed 
environment, then full consideration should be given to these 
requirements at the concept design stage.

This paper describes some important factors, other than node 
evaluation levels and network topology that affect distributed system 
security; these factors may invalidate attempts extend existing 
concepts of single-computer security to networks. Those discussed 
include the difficulty of integration with existing systems, perhaps 
with different physical environments which may vary with time; and, 
the lack of a single authority with responsibility for the overall 
security of the networked systems.

This paper defines a modelling scheme that allows for abstraction to 
simplify security analysis, while at the same time permitting a full 
description of detailed system behaviour. The basis for the model is a 
hierarchy of state machines. The security equivalence of the varying 
levels of abstraction is proven, thereby demonstrating the validity of 
the model. Also, practical considerations regarding the application of 
the model to real systems are presented.

This paper gives a mathematical model for prevention of traffic 
analysis in network security and suggests an approach for prevention of 
unauthorized release of information concerning traffic patterns. The 
model assumes that an eavesdropper may read the contents of all links, 
including the source and destination, and that all countermeasures are 
performed at the transport layer. The goal of the countermeasures is to 
prevent the eavesdropper from gaining any useful information regarding 
the traffic patterns in a cost efficient and feasible manner. 
Countermeasures performed at the transport level include encryption, a 
limited form of message rerouting, delaying messages, and sending 
dummy messages as needed within resource capacities. By formulating 
the problem in terms of systems of equalities and systems of 
inequalities, linear programming methods may be used to find solutions 
to the traffic analysis security problem.

One of the stated goals of communications security is the prevention of 
traffic analysis. This paper analyses a model [7] to prevent traffic 
analysis by rerouting and padding the traffic matrix, so that the 
apparent final traffic matrix is neutral. The objective of this analysis 
is to justify the claims of the model and to show that rerouting of 
traffic via intermediate nodes with minimal padding is indeed a cost 
effective method to prevent traffic analysis. Simulation results 
supporting the above claim are also presented in this paper.  The 
requirement that final traffic matrix be neutral may be too restrictive 
in some cases and we suggest various modifications to the model while 
still ensuring prevention of traffic analysis. Prevention of traffic 
analysis in real time is a very interesting and relevant issue and we 
address this briefly.

Department of Defense systems that process sensitive (including 
classified) information must undergo formal technical assessment and 
approval before they are allowed to operate. The technical assessment 
and approval processes are called certification and accreditation, 
respectively. This paper presents issues involved in certifying and 
accrediting networks with respect to the two network views, the 
Single Trusted System (STS) view and the Interconnected Accredited 
AIS (IAA) view, presented in the Trusted Network Interpretation of the 
Trusted computer Security Evaluation Criteria, NCSC-TG-005. 
Certification and Accreditation procedures differ significantly 
between the STS view and the IAA view of networks.

The implementation of distributed systems includes an extensive 
component integration effort. Integrating secure components into a 
distributed system is a task more difficult than standard integration. 
Current System High distributed secure systems will be transitioned to 
multilevel secure systems as multilevel secure components become 
available. Considerations and changes that are required for successful 
integration of these components are discussed. These changes fall into 
the categories of concept of operations, security policy, and security 
architecture.

This paper presents a case study of two NATO Command and Control 
Information Systems (CCIS) projects with stringent computer security 
requirements. These projects were conceived and initiated at a time 
when trusted products were not readily available and the concepts of 
trusted system development and evaluation were not well understood. 
These circumstances have necessitated the Government and the 
contractor to seek a unified approach to integrating security into the 
development process; to ensuring that security requirements are 
satisfied; and to performing the security evaluation. That approach has 
been adopted and is now permitting the development of the CCIS's to 
advance. This paper outlines the history of the problems and decisions 
which culminated in their definition.

A signature scheme is expected to guard against two risks: C pretends 
to be A, sending message to B; and, B forges signature, claims 
messages came from A. Schemes using RSA encryption algorithm have 
been designed, but the algorithm is slow. Other proposed schemes are 
either suspected of being unsafe (viz Shamir's based on trapdoor 
knapsacks) or about as slow as the RSA-based scheme. The scheme 
proposed in this paper is approximately 100 times faster than the RSA 
scheme, and is intended to have comparable key/signature lengths and 
security.
The scheme is based on quadratic inequalities, and appears to have 
potential. It has yet to be implemented, and would require independent 
mathematical analysis before any reliance is placed on its security.

to be a useful guide to issues involved in RA for security (as opposed to 
financially) sensitive information. The proposed model seems quite 
straightforward, but practical experience will be needed to see how 
good it is. I'm not sure it answers all the criticisms the authors make 
of other models.

Developing a formal definition of vulnerability to provide a basis for 
information system risk management has proven to be a complex 
process. In this paper, we examine the treatment of vulnerability at the 
1988 Risk Model Builders' Workshop and develop a definition that is 
intuitively satisfying and provides a foundation upon which 
mathematical models can be built. We present two such vulnerability 
models that together appear to capture the general conceptualizations 
of vulnerability espoused by other authors.

UNX. in: 1989 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy; May 1; Oakland, 
California. USA: IEEE Computer Society; 1989: 94-99. 
Note: This presentation covered the six types of inter-process 
communication (IPC) provided by the UNIX operating system. These 
were: Files, Pipes, FIFOs, Shared Memory, Messages and Semaphores.
All of the above mechanisms work well provided all processes sharing 
the object are at the same security level. Covert channels appear, 
however, once multi-level use is attempted.
The covert channel produced by multi-level file sharing arises out of 
the ability of a highly classified process to manipulate shared locks to 
a file. This can be read by a less classified process as it tries to set an 
exclusive lock on the same file. A solution is proposed that makes use 
of Reed and Kanodias eventcounts and sequencers.
A covert channel is possible when using pipes and FIFOs between 
processes operating at different security levels. When the pipe 
capacity is reached then the highly classified process may affect the 
lower classified process by either reading from the pipe or not. Two 
solutions are suggested, both of which involve the relaxation of the 
integrity of the pipe.
A similar problem arises with the use of message queues. The author 
mentioned that this problem has already been solved the Trusted Mach 
operating system and that this solution is equally applicable to UNIX.
Semaphores can be used with no changes in their semantics except 
those restrictions based on security levels which decide which 
processes can perform which operations.
The overall conclusion of the presentation was that although secure 
multi-level communication was not possible in UNIX as is, by making a 
few changes to some underlying mechanisms and by implementing some 
additional system calls it should be possible and that such 
modifications would simplify the building of trusted and untrusted 
multi-level applications using UNIX.

Note: Introduction (part of): The remainder of this paper points out the 
looseness, inconsistency, and lack of completeness that typify even 
major efforts (heroic as they may be) to specify major systems of 
security controls or to reach practical and consistent answers about 
the nature and scope of information security. If such limitations can be 
overcome in other disciplines of information technology, why not in 
security? The answer is that an operating system, for example, is 
acceptable if it mostly or partially works; partial success, however, is 
not enough in security where the adversaries are intelligent humans, 
not technical barriers. If it is to succeed, security must be sturdy and 
have a tight enough weave to avoid fatal flaws that skilled and 
determined adversaries can exploit. It is measured by its weakest 
point. In contrast, an operating system is measured by the sum of 
features that work correctly minus the sum of its misoperating 
features. An operating system with flaws may still be acceptable.

Biometrics, the statistical or quantitative study of behavioural and 
physical characteristics is being used increasingly to discriminate 
between individuals and can be used as a supplement to a PIN or a 
smart card.  The term now used to describe such methods of 
verification is Positive Biometrics Identification 
(PBI).  This paper examines PBI applications, namely voice, 
fingerprinting, vein patterns (on the wrist/hand or the retina), 
keyboard rhythm, hand geometry, and signatures.  An appendix lists 
commercially available biometric devices and their vendors (eg IBM, 
TITN, Confirma, ECCO, Esselte, Palmguard, Quest, Voxtron Systems, 
Fingermatrix, Eye D, British Technology Group and PIDEAC).

IEEE Comp. Soc. Proc. 1985 Symp. Security and Privacy pp.230-236
The Entity-Relation Data Model views a database as a collection of sets 
which are themselves collections of elements; sets are entity sets or 
relation sets; relationship sets each connect groups of entity sets, and 
each relation in the set references one element in each element set in 
the group. The model is suitable for knowledge bases used for expert 
systems or intelligence work. This paper describes the implementation 
of an E-R DBMS for a 'large civilian non-industrial organisation doing 
investigation', and the security policy which was based on an Access 
Group Model. An Access group is a set of users with common rights; 
users belong to one or more groups, each resource belongs to one group, 
and resources can only be accessed by those in the owning group. The 
first order security violations that the system attempts to prevent are 
unauthorised retrieval or modification. The second order violations, 
existence detection, might happen accidentally with low probability, 
but deliberate attempts would be detected before they worked. The 
third order violations, interference, do not appear to be discussed in 
the paper.

Intuitionistic higher-order logic - the fragment containing implication, 
universal quantification, and equality - can serve as a meta-logic for 
formalizing various logics. As an eample, axioms formalizing first-
order logi are presented, and proved sound and complete by induction on 
proof trees. Proofs in higher-order logic represent derivations of rules 
as well as proofs of theorems. A proof develops by deriving rules using 
higher-order resolution. The discharge of assumptions involves derived 
meta-rules for 'lifting' a proposition. Quantifiers require a similar 
lifting rule or else Hilbert's ?-operator. The alternatives are 
contrasted through several examples. Hilbert's ? underlies Isabelle's 
original treatment of quantifiers, but the lifting rule is logically 
simpler. The meta-logic is used in the latest version of the theorem 
prover 'Isabelle'. It extends the logic used in earlier versions. Compared 
with other meta-logics, higher-order logic has a weaker type system 
but seems easier to implant.

A trusted application system must support the processing needs of a 
specific operating environment. Its security policy includes many 
constraints that are specific to the application, so the trusted 
application system can be more difficult to develop and evaluate than a 
trusted product. One approach for reducing the development and 
evaluation effort for a trusted application system is to build the 
system on an evaluated product. Among other advantages, this approach 
may relieve the developer from demonstrating that the application's 
trusted computing base enforces those application policies that are 
enforced by the evaluated product. This paper discusses our thoughts on 
modeling a trusted application system based on an evaluated product. 
The paper identifies some lessons learned from our experience in 
evaluating a trusted application system formal model and provides a 
set of guidelines for writing a formal model for a trusted application 
system based on an evaluated product.

Security constraints effect the structural as well as the dynamic part 
of a database. Thus, a design technique for multilevel secure databases 
must capture both the semantics of the data as well as the behaviour of 
the system. We describe the technique of applying a semantic data 
model to express the semantics and secrecy of data and of applying 
data flow diagramming to describe the impact on the security of the 
system functions. For this purpose we develop secure data schemas and 
secure function schemas. As secrecy constraints defined on the data 
and on the functions are influencing each other the design technique 
offers a joint data/function-based design for the construction of 
multilevel secure databases.

In order to overcome certain limitations when applied to relational 
databases, a data model is introduced that is not fully based on the 
Bell-LaPadula security paradigm. The starting point is a conceptual 
relational database schema and a set of views, representing user 
groups and applications. Based on the definition of views, the relations 
of the conceptual schema are decomposed in a set of disjoint 
fragments. Fragments and views are the granularity of data to which 
we provide automated security labeling. In order to keep fragmented 
databases consistent during database update we give algorithms used 
to keep the integrity. Databases based on this model contain data at a 
variety of classifications, serve a set of users cleared only to access 
certain data items and may be implemented by using a general purpose 
database management system extended by a trusted component 
supporting mandatory access control.

Picciotto, J. The Design of an Effective Auditing System. 1987. 
The Compartmented Mode Workstation project (CMW) is an effort to 
provide a prototype implementation of enhanced computer security 
features on a workstation. The ultimate goal of this project is to 
demonstrate that the compartmented mode workstation requirements 
detailed in 'Security Requirements for System High and Compartmented 
Mode Workstations' can be met in an operationally useful manner. One of 
the necessary security enhancements that must be made to a 
workstation is the inclusion of a comprehensive auditing facility. For 
any computer system to be considered secure, it must have the ability 
to generate and store audit information on significant events. This 
information shall then be provided to authorized personnel for security 
and system monitoring. This document describes the design and 
implementation of the CMW'S auditing subsystem. The auditing 
subsystem was developed in conjunction with other parts of the total 
CMW project.

This is the second paper of three in the proceedings on MITRE's 
'Compartmented Mode' project. This is a straightforward description of 
the design and implementation of a subsystem (of Unix) to generate and 
store auditing-information about security-relevant events. The 
description is comprehensive and will no doubt be useful to those 
concerned with implementation of accounting features. Unfortunately, 
it does not make any contribution to the field of modelling.

The X Window System (X) has become one of the most popular window 
systems available. However, to use X in a trusted environment, a 
variety of security issues must be addressed. Among these issues is 
how to mediate interwindow data moves in a manner consistent with a 
system's security policy. Current interpretations of existing security 
requirements state that interwindow moves must be subject not only 
to traditional access controls, but also that users must be able to 
perform certain operations as the data is being moved (such as review 
the data, or alter the data's security attributes). This paper presents 
the issues involved in meeting the security requirements, and describes 
and contrasts two possible approaches for addressing those issues.

During the past several years, interest in architectures for multi-level 
secure versions of the X Window System (X) has grown dramatically, 
primarily in the Compartmented Mode Workstation (CMW) community. 
The architectures and security policies implemented in existing CMWs 
are similar to each other, although they differ in certain key details. 
Alternatives to the current approaches are being investigated. Most 
notably, a TRW-led team of researchers has designed and prototyped a 
trusted X implementation aimed at the Trusted Computer Systems 
Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC) B3 level. The architecture and security 
policies adopted by this implementation differ radically from those of 
all the existing CMWs.
	One of X's greatest achievements is that it provides seamless 
interoperability among all X implementations in a distributed 
heterogeneous environment. Unfortunately, the divergence of security 
policies enforced by trusted X implementations has virtually 
eliminated X interoperability among these systems.
	This paper surveys the architectures and security policies 
implemented in existing CMWs and the TRW prototype, identifies areas 
of commonality and divergence, and notes areas where interoperability 
can be achieved.

Certification. in: 14th National Computer Security Conference; 1991 
Oct; Washington. USA: NIST/NCSC; 1991; 2: pp.553-562. 
The purpose of this paper is to discuss the process of computer 
security certification. It begins with an overview of the 
inconsistencies of certification as encountered in the Department of 
Defense and indeed throughout the Federal government. It discusses 
part of the variety of certification definitions, a general overview of 
the certification process, some prevalent problems with the process 
and some recommendations for possibly alleviating these problems. The 
paper's intent is to provide a basis for creating certification standards 
for computer systems developed or acquired by Program Management 
Offices (PMO) within the US Air Force. It also intends to inform 
Designated Approving Authorities (DAA) who place those systems into 
operational environments about what certification should be. By 
systems, I mean a computer component or subsystem, either that 
typically understood to be an Automated Information System or one 
embedded as part of a larger system. This does not include larger, more 
widely dispersed computer entities commonly called networks. In some 
cases the system will stand by itself, such as a stand-alone mainframe 
system. In others, it will be part of a larger complex system, such as 
the Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF) Information Management System, 
which is part of the overall ATF Weapon System. This paper focuses on 
the stand-alone or sublevel component system. Policy, standards and 
implementation guidance for more complex systems is still under 
development and it is not yet feasible to provide definitive guidance in 
that arena. That does not mean to say that the principles in this paper 
do not apply if the situation warrants.

In this paper, a number of mechanisms are de-
scribed that can be used in the design of a protocol con-
vertor for authentication and key distribution proto-
cols. First, the scope of the mechanisms is defined: we
mark out the class of authentication systems that were
considered during the design of the mechanisms. A
first mechanism, based on proxies and a synchronization
protocol, allows for a transparent protocol conver-
sion. It is generic, and can be tailored to different
specific situations. The second mechanism addresses
the problem of the statefulness of the protocol conver-
tor. Both mechanisms can be used separately or in
combination. When properly combined, they provide
for a robust, transparent, and safe protocol convertor
for authentication and key distribution protocols.

Note: This paper attempts to address data integrity by means of non-
interference-style policies. One result is that post hoc authorisation is 
allowed, in contrast to earlier work.
	Each transaction has an author, and some other system user must 
act as 'authoriser' for that transaction; the 'authoriser' will be 
different for different types of transaction, but separation of duty 
requires that the authoriser is always distinct from the author
	The author derives an appropriate non-interference-style purge 
function and non-interference statement such that unauthorised 
transactions do not affect the future course of the system and the data 
therein.

Note: This paper discusses a number of recommendations for increasing 
the general level of security awareness of the workforce at a sensitive

procedures; the most memorable advertising posters are the best and 
the worst. There are also recommendations about the form and content 
of security briefings to new and existing staff, again with the accent 
on memorability.
	Management awareness of security issues is of course an 
important part of the security officer's brief: there are three aspects 
to the security officer's job in dealing with management: make 
management aware of its responsibilities; advise on the realistic 
consequences of not meeting those responsibilities; and, take good 
notes.
	The security officer is advised to make himself visible to the 
employees at their various workplaces, to be available to answer 
questions, and to look out for: the more than usually cooperative ('thank 
you') and the more than usually uncooperative ('make them an offer they 
can't refuse').

CACM 21(9) pp.737-49
This describes the verification of the kernel of the UCLA secure 
operating system. The paper gives a specification language suitable for 
describing an abstract machine and defines security properties with 
respect to that description; it then applies these to the UCLA kernel. 
Finally it discusses the verification of the kernel.
An abstract machine is described by its state together with a set of 
instructions that operate on that state. The state of the system is 
defined in terms of objects; the instructions of the abstract machine 
are defined by the objects that they access. The security property of 
such an abstract machine is defined in these terms.
The specification notation is then applied to the UCLA kernel. The 
verification is discussed, but not in detail. The discussion deals with 
verifying that the specification of the kernel agrees with the security 
model, and that the specification of the kernel is consistent with the 
code that actually implements it.

Covert Flow Trees: A Technique for Identifying and Analyzing Covert 
Storage Channels. in: 1991 IEEE Computer Society Symposium on 
Research in Security and Privacy; 1991 May; Oakland, California. USA: 
IEEE Computer Society Press; 1991: pp.36-51. ISBN: 0-8186-2168-0.
This paper introduces a technique for detecting covert storage channels 
using a tree structure called a Covert Flow Tree. The benefits of using 
Covert Flow Trees to perform a covert channel analysis are twofold. 
First, by traversing the paths of a Covert Flow Tree a comprehensive 
list of scenarios that potentially support covert communication via 
particular resource attributes can be automatically constructed. 
Second, Covert Flow Trees graphically illustrate the process through 
which information regarding the state of one attribute is relayed to 
another attribute, and how in turn that information is relayed to a 
listening process. Using this visual model to examine the routes that 
information travels during covert communication enhances the 
analyst's understanding of the storage channel and may provide insight 
into the formation of countermeasures. Algorithms for automating the 
construction of Covert Flow Trees and potential covert channel 
operation sequences are presented. To illustrate this technique, two 
example systems are analyzed, and their results compared to two 
currently accepted analysis techniques performed on identical systems. 
This comparison shows that the CFT approach not only identified all 
covert storage channels found by the other analysis techniques, but 
discovered a channel not detected by the other techniques.

This paper introduces a new approach to representing computer 
penetrations called penetration state transition analysis. This approach 
models penetrations as a series of state transitions described in terms 
of signature actions and state descriptions. State transition diagrams 
are written to correspond to the states of an actual computer system, 
and these diagrams form the basis of a rule-based expert system for 
detecting penetrations, referred to as STAT.

This paper examines the accreditation approach for a large, complex 
computer network, namely the Air Force Satellite Control Network. The 
network represents many existing computer networks, and as such the 
approach for accreditation has broad application to the computer 
security community. The paper provides a brief background and history 
of the AFSCN. The accreditation approach is then described, followed by 
specific implementation stages for accreditation. The last section 
addresses "lessons learned" in the development of an accreditation 
strategy for the complex network.

Proctor, N. The Restricted Access Processor: An Example of Formal 
Verification. 1985. 
SYTEK
IEEE Comp. Soc. Proc. 1985 Symp. Security and Privacy pp.49-55
The Restricted Access Processor (RAP) is a guard device being 
developed by CSC for NASA; SYTEK is responsible for developing a 
suitable security model and TLS, verifying the model and TLS 
correspond, and demonstrating the code to TLS correspondance. The 
paper describes how two rounds of the verification process were 
performed, and the techniques in use for the third round.
The RAP is intended to connect uncleared users to a system containing 
both classified and unclassified data, so that the former type can be 
accessed while ensuring the latter is neither read nor altered. All 
message blocks released by the RAP are to be validated and sanitised; 
if any block is invalid, all blocks of the message are to be logged. 
Blocks containing classified data can be recognised as invalid.
The first round was primarily a feasability study, to show that 
verification was practicable. The model was written with a Pascal-like 
syntax, and was about 7 pages long; the TLS, in SPECIAL, was about 67 
pages. A formula generator was produced which took the TLS and a set 
of invariants and produced a set of lemmas to be proved. A theorem 
prover was also developed, that took a set of formulae and applied a 
series of simplifications; any formula that could not be simplified to 
TRUE was automatically split into a number of formulae which were 
then simplified; if unproven, these were output to the user who could 
resubmit them. The major problem with the prover is the user had little 
control over the way it worked.
For round two, the model was rewritten in SPECIAL, with simplified 
phrasing and all existential qualifiers eliminated, and the TLS was 
revised. The theorem prover was replaced by a checker, driven by user 
commands. The model increased to 12 pages to SPECIAL, and the TLS to 
90; to prove the 300 formulae took 20 hours CPU time on a VAX to 
process the 18000 commands needed. The task was made possible by 
makeing the checker automatically save command lists, which could be 
edited and replayed at will.
A change in the RAP design required a third round, still ongoing. The 
major change to the tools for this stage was to simplify the use of 
command lists. The main conclusions so far are: keep prover simple and 
so user-predictable; keep manual checks simple; use simple 
expressions in TLS; use a restricted subset of SPECIAL; and, allow 
proofs to be reused.

The experimental Secure Distributed Operating System, SDOS, is the 
first software development project to use a composable property as its 
mandatory security policy. The security policy also includes a fine 
granularity of discretionary access control immune to Trojan horse 
attacks. The high degree of assurance that composability makes 
practical and the richness of the discretionary controls lead SDOD to 
employ balanced assurance, that is, the assurance measures are fitted 
to the portion of the security policy whose enforcement is being 
assured. Like the Cronus distributed computing environment it is 
derived from, SDOS uses an object model with abstract operations on 
various types of system objects and permits an application to extend 
the paradigm to new types of application objects with new operations. 
The SDOS security policy and enforcement can likewise be extended for 
an application's security policy and enforcement.

Multilevel relational database systems store infor-
mation at different security classifications. An infer-
ence problem exists if it is possible for a user with
a low-level clearance to draw conclusions about infor-
mation at higher classifications. We are developing
DISSECT, a tool for analyziny multilevel relational
database schemas to assist in the detection and elimi-
nation of inference problems. A translation is defined
from schemas to an equivalent graph representation
which can be presented graphically in DISSECT. The
initial focus is on detection of inference problems that
depend only on information all of which is stored in
the database. In particular, we identify as potential in-
ference problems different sequences of foreign key re-
lationships that connect the same entities. Inferences
can be blocked by upgrading the security classification
of some of foreign key relationships. We suggest a
global optimization approach to upgrading to block a
set of inference problems that allows upgrade costs to
be considered and supports security categories as well
as levels.

Note: Both the lecture and the paper were very difficult to appreciate 
and to follow: the lecture in particular suffered from a surfeit of 
information.
The concept of trust is extremely important in computer security: 
without it systems cannot be both secure and functional. This paper 
attempts to formalise trust using a modal logic in which beliefs may 
be expressed - trusts are then proper axioms used derive the truth of 
beliefs.
The paper introduces a logic of belief in which the beliefs of agents can 
be expressed. The semantic interpretation of belief is based on a 
possible-world semantics.
A system is modelled as a set of agents capable of sending and 
receiving messages. The state of a particular agent is the set of 
messages sent and received by that agent. The state of the system is 
the set of agent states. Each agent can hypothesise about the global 
state of the system from their local states. These 'guesses' at the 
global states are known as possible states and are characterised for 
each agent by the possibility relation.
Informally, an agent will believe a proposition if that proposition is 
true in every state that that agent currently considers possible.
The agent believing a proposition is not the same as that proposition 
being true. The truth of beliefs is derived by trusts.
Trusts must be true in all possible states. This is achieved by placing 
constraints on the possibility relation that force the trust to be true. 
These constraints are on the possible states and so consequently on the 
messages that an agent can send or receive.
The paper demonstrates this through examples that are extremely 
difficult to follow. In themselves the examples are very simple and it 
is difficult to ascertain whether the complexity is inherent in the 
theory or in the exposition. The underlying motivation about 
formalising trust is valid and worthy of further research.
Computing systems are evolving into large distributed systems 
interconnecting organizations and even countries.  The relationships 
among these organizations are characterized by the need for 
competition and cooperation without a common trusted  agent.This 
paper presents an axiomatic theory of trust in distributed systems.  
The paper introduces basic notions about developing a logic or theory, 
and shows that modal logics of belief, with their Kripke style possible-
worlds semantics, are appropriate for basing a theory of trust on. A 
modal logic of belief is reviewed, and a model of the distributed 
system is constructed so that the logic is sound and complete with 
respect to the model.  Any sentences in the logic may then be added to 
the logic as axioms and these axiomatic sentences are considered as 
trust specifications.  Methods to map a formal trust specification on to 
mechanisms for its implementation in the distributed system. are 
presented.  Trust and security are closely related in distributed 
systems.  Security specification and verification methods can be 
integrated into the theory of trust.  The trusts required in public key 
based secure communication are analyzed.  A theory of trust has many 
applications, such as design of authentication servers based on trust 
relationships, and design of mechanisms that are tolerant to failures in 
trusts.

pp.78-84. ISBN: 0-8186-2006-4.
This paper describes the design of security audit subsystems for real 
time embedded avionics systems. The selection criteria of auditable 
events and the design of the audit functions are described. The data 
storage requirements and the data compression features of embedded 
avionics systems are analyzed. Two data compression algorithms 
applicable to avionics systems are described. Huffman encoding is 
optimal but Fibonacci encoding is shown to be nearly optimal and better 
suited for airborne avionics systems. The memory capacity needed for 
audit data storage is computed for typical avionics missions.

1992: pp. 18-32. 
A distributed security architecture is proposed for incorporation into 
group oriented distributed systems, and in particular, into the Iris 
distributed programming toolkit. The primary goal of the architecture 
is to make common group oriented abstractions robust in hostile 
settings, in order to facilitate the construction of high performance 
distributed applications that can tolerate both component failures and 
malicious attacks. The abstractions include process groups and casual 
group multicast. Moreover, a delegation and access control scheme is 
proposed for use in group oriented systems. The focus of the paper is 
the security architecture; particular cryptosystems and key exchange 
protocols are not emphasized.

In a distributed system, it is often important to
detect the causal relationships between events, where
event e1 is causally before event e2 if e1 happened be-
fore e2 and could possibly have affected the occurrence
of e2. In this paper we argue that detecting causal rela-
tionships among events can be important for security,
in the sense that it may be essential to the correct im-
plementation of a security policy that a process be able
to determine if two events are causally related, and if
so, how. We formulate attacks on causality in terms
of causal denial and forgery, formalize possible secu-
rity goals with respect to causality, and present simple
algorithms to attain these goals in some situations.

This paper describes the first - and so far (1985), the safest - 
algorithm for public-key encryption; it is based on the use of 
exponentiation in modular arithmetic. It contains a detailed analysis of 
the security of the algorithm, showing that cryptanalysis is equivalent 
in difficulty to factorising large numbers. The paper also describes the 
theory of public-key encryption, and how it can be used for privacy and 
signatures; this is based on the paper by Diffie and Hellman.

Secure distributed systems are not easily constructed, as they combine 
mechanisms based on very different theories of security (encryption 
and reference monitors). We show how these mechanisms may be 
integrated via the Unix STREAMS mechanism. Examples are given of how 
this architecture can support existing security protocols, and it is 
shown why it is consistent with the Bell-LaPadula and Biba 
information-flow models.

The paper proposes a general model for access control policy for civil 
agencies. Different types of sensitive, but unclassified information and 
the special operational requirements for civil agencies are described. A 
wide number of systems were reviewed and hundreds of access control 
requirements were identified. Nevertheless, it was found that the 
access control rules fell into six general categories of 16 rules. A 
model for an access control policy is defined that is comprised of 
entities such as subjects and objects and a set of rules. Then, the 
model is applied to a sample of IRS security requirements in order to 
show how the model could be used to express requirements for a real 
application.

latest versions and require both to be updated together.  Linking 
modules together to form an executable object is performed 
automatically, so it becomes impossible to forget to relink after 
updating a module.  Configuration control and mixed language working

Malvern: RSRE; 1988 Sep; SMITE/PCB&SRW-28. RSRE. 
Note: This paper describes the overall SMITE programme and highlights 
some of the demanding research topics which must be solved to produce 
high assuracne, high functionality computer architectures.
Operational requirements for government command information 
systems (CISs) are increasingly calling for a combination of 
sophisticated database management systems with high assurance 
multi-level security.
Unfortunately, the secure computer architectures currently available 
can only deliver functionality at the expense of assurance, or 
conversely assurance at the expense of functionality and performance.
The SMITE multi-processor computer architecture provides support for 
abstract data types by means of first class procedures and a tagged 
capability instruction set.  Many aspects of SMITE will be formally 
specified using the Z language.  SMITE software will be written for an 
algebraic abstract machine known as Ten15 which will facilitate the 
formal analysis necessary for high assurance and provide alternative 
lower assurance versions of SMITE on other processors for less 
demanding markets.

When displaying results from queries to a (relational) database 
containing multilevel data in a tabular manner, there is sometimes a 
need to display the security labels applicable to the various fields. This 
labelling has to be done in a way that is both unobtrusive and clear, so 
that the user's view of the data and of important labels is not obsured. 
This paper describes one way this can be done using exception marking, 
with letters for sensitivity levels and numbered footnotes for 
category/caveat information.

The report starts with a rather doubtful discussion of the use of access 
control verification and information flow analysis. It then proceeds to 
set out conditions for secure isolation. The first condition is deemed to 
be too strong, a weaker condition is introduced which ignores covert 
(timing) channels. This condition is also considered too strong and a 
third condition is introduced which ignores the problems of one regime 
crashing the whole machine (and thus passing one bit of information!). 
The main body of the paper attempts to be a formal establishment of 
the conditions for secure isolation. Unfortunately some important 
proofs are omitted which means that following the arguments 
rigorously requires considerable effort. The final step is to introduce 
asynchronous input and interrupts but the formal analysis which has 
gone before does not apply to the new scheme. This leaves the 'Proof of 
Separability' hanging on a number of unproven assertions which are 
based upon the previous results without any formal derivation. The 
ideas are based upon a conceptual network which runs on a time-shared 
machine and cannot be applied directly to a real network.

technical report 166 (SSM/9), University of Newcastle upon Tyne, 
Computing Laboratory
This report largely superceded by report SSM/9, which has been 
published in ACM OSR 15(5), Proc 8th Symp OS Principles.
The major thrust of this paper is that most of the existing work has 
attempted to concentrate all security related features into the kernel 
and that this tends to obscure the various essentially independent 
aspects of security control. Also the proof of the security of a system 
has rested upon a proof of the specification by information flow 
analysis and then a proof that the specification is implemented 
correctly, this second stage has tended to be illustrative rather than 
formal but is also the area in which flaws are usually found. It is 
asserted that exising work has rested upon the spurious argument 'It is 
too hard to prove X but we can separate this into parts A and B, it is 
difficult to prove A so we do not need to prove B'. The tendency to put 
too much into the security kernel has led to systems where 'trusted 
processes' are given the right to violate the fundamental principles 
(such as the star-property) on which the system is built with no 
attempt to constrain this privilege to the minimum required. The 
proposed solution is to separate the control of resource sharing from 
the control of security. The kernel is responsible for ensuring that 
different regimes cannot pass information from one to another except 
along known and controlled paths. Security policy is enforced by an 
authority regime to and from which all allowed paths lead. The kernel 
can then be verified by 'proof of separability' to ensure that each 
regime runs in an abstract machine with well known properties and no 
uncontrolled communication channels, the regimes with security 
responsibilities can then be verified by information flow analysis since 
they operate in an environment isolated from the untrusted parts of the 
system and without the unpleasant dynamic sharing forced upon the 
system by the existence of real asynchronous I/O devices and 
interrupts.

Paradigms For Verification of Authorization at Source of Electronic 
Documents In an Integrated Environment. 8th Annual Computer Security 
Applications Conference; 1930 Nov 4; San Antonio, Texas. USA: IEEE

Verification of correct authorisation of an electronic document at its 
source is as essential as the more familiar requirement of 
authentication, and of increasing importance. This verification is a 
relatively new explicit requirement (1990) for electronic documents. 
Currently any checks of authorisation at source are done by human 
elements in the receiving enterprise. Automated technology will force 
changes to current message processing methods to include verification 
of authorisation at source in order to prevent fraud by esoteric 
attackers. This paper explains the necessity for verification by 
authorisation at source, proposes and compares paradigms based on 
audit principles used with paper documents, and examines common 
problems of privacy and disclosure, and overheads on both sender and 
receiver.

Rybczynski, A. X.25 Interface and End-to-End Virtual Circuit Service 
Characteristics. 1980. 
IEEE Trans. Commun COM-28, pp.500-510
X.25 is the CCITT standard interface protocol for packet switching 
networks that defines the message structure required by data terminal 
equipment (DTE) to interface to a public packet network conforming to 
CCITT standards. The X.25 standard consists of three levels of protocol: 
the physical layer (V.24 which is RS232, and X.21), the data link (or 
frame) layer (balanced link access procedures or LAPB, which is 
compatible with ANSI's ADCCP and HDLC) and the network (or packet) 
layer. These three layers conform to the lower three layers of the OSI 
basic reference model's lowest three layers.
After a general description the paper describes the X.25 end-to-end 
virtual circuit service characteristics including the way that virtual 
circuits are established and cleared, the data transfer process and 
error recovery mechanisms. The same topics are then discussed when 
viewed as X.25 packet level interface characteristics.
The optional user facilities of X.25 are described including the 
provision for a closed user group facility.
The paper concludes with a description of the relationship of X.25 to 
the OSI basic reference model as proposed by both ISO and CCITT (in 
which it finds differences) and future developments (X.25 has since 
been extended to a 1984 version which is more compatible with ISO's 
network layer service)

The Schematic Protection Model (SPM) regards a system as a set of 
subjects and objects, with operations on objects authorised by 
possession of tickets (address/rights combinations). A scheme is a 
static set of rules for aquiring tickets.
The paper claims that groups are a good way of specifying requisite 
file protection, provided the grouping is readily specifiable and 
alterable by normal users; it then uses SPM to specify a number of 
different policies, differing mainly in the dynamics of group 
membership.

Note: The basic idea of the paper seems to be to formulate a framework 
that is sufficiently generic as to be able to describe a whole spectrum 
of access control policies. This rests on two kinds of transformation of 
rights: internal transformation and grant transformation.
This was a fiendishly difficult talk to follow and, indeed, the paper is 
pretty obscure too. It seems to be yet another capability machine 
formulation but with additional layers of obscurity. The whole thing 
looks too baroque to be of much use but since I have not yet mastered it 
I may be doing it an injustice. There just may be some useful ideas here 
for modelling integrity policies.

University). The Typed Access Matrix Model. in: 1992 IEEE Computer 
Society Symposium on Research into Security and Privacy; 1992 May 4; 
Oakland, California. USA: IEEE Computer Society Press; : pp. 122. 
The access matrix model as formalized by Harrison, Ruzzo, and Ullman 
(HRU) has broad expressive power. Unfortunately, HRU has weak safety 
properties (i.e., the determination of whether or not a given subject can 
ever acquire access to a given object). Most security policies of 
practical interest fall into the undecidable cases of HRU. This is true 
even for monotonic policies (i.e., where access rights can be deleted 
only if the deletion is itself reversible). In this paper we define the 
typed access matrix (TAM) model by introducing strong typing into HRU 
(i.e., each subject or object is created to be of a particular type which 
thereafter does not change). We prove that monotonic TAM (MTAM) has 
strong safety properties similar to Sandhu's Schematic Protection 
Model. Safety in MTAM's decidable case is, however, NP-hard. We 
develop a model called ternary MTAM which has polynomial safety for 
its decidable case, and which nevertheless retains the full expressive 
power of MTAM. There is compelling evidence that the decidable safety 
cases of ternary MTAM are quite adequate for modeling practical 
monotonic security policies.

Distributed Implementation of the Transform Model. in: 14th National 
Computer Security Conference; 1991 Oct; Washington. USA: NIST/NCSC; 
1991; 1: pp.177-187. 
The Transform access-control model is based on the concept of 
transformation of access rights. It has previously been shown that 
Transform unifies a number of diverse access control mechanisms such 
as amplification, copy flags, separation of duties and synergistic 
authorisation. It has also been shown that Transform has an efficient 
algorithm for safety analysis of the propagation of access rights (ie. 
the determination of whether or not a given subject can ever acquire 
access to a given object). In this paper we propose a distributed 
implementation of Transform. Our design is based on capabilities with 
identities of subjects buried in them. This ensures unforgeability of 
capabilities as well as enables enforcement of "mandatory" controls on 
propagation of capabilities from one subject to another. The design 
provides for immediate, selective, partial and complete revocation on a 
temporary as well as permanent basis.

Polyinstantiation has generated a great deal of controversy lately. 
Some have argued that polyinstantiation and integrity are 
fundamentally incompatible, and have proposed alternatives to 
polyinstantiation. Others have argued about the correct definition of 
polyinstantiation and its operational semantics. In this paper we 
provide a fresh analysis of the basic problem that we are trying to 
solve, ie. How can an honest database keep secrets? Our analysis leads 
us to the concept of restricted polyinstantiation wherein we show how 
to solve this problem without compromising on any of the following 
requirements: secrecy, integrity, availability of service, element-level 
labeling and high assurance. This is the first solution to meet all these 
requirements simultaneously.

Computer Society Press; 1992: pp. 148. 
The concept of transformation of access rights was recently introduced 
in the literature by Sandhu. It has been previously shown that 
monotonic transformations unify a number of diverse access control 
mechanisms such as amplification, copy flags, separation of duties and 
synergistic authorization. In this paper we demonstrate the importance 
and expressive power of non-monotonic transformations. A formal 
model called Non-Monotonic Transform (NMT) is defined. A distributed 
implementation of NMT is proposed using a client-server architecture. 
The implementation is remarkably simple and modular in concept. It is 
based on access control lists and allows for a variety of powerful 
revocation operations.

Trek: Navigating Uncharted Space. in: 1989 IEEE Symposium on Security

1989: 167-175. 
Note: LOCK, the NCSCs LOgical Coprocessing Kernel project, is aiming 
for beyond A1 secure computer design, by providing an open system 
architecture platform on which to develop secure systems. The primary 
objective of the project is to develop universal INFOSEC modules for 
general computers. There are two such reusable hardware modules. The 
System-Independent Domain-Enforcing Assured Reference Monitor 
(SIDEARM) is a COMPUSEC module enforcing separation of different 
levels of classified information. The Bulk Encryption Device (BED) is a 
COMSEC module providing cryptographic services. These modules are 
expected to reduce system development time. Other goals include 
publishing module interface specifications, and developing an A1 
secure prototype (expected to be delivered in September 1990).
A common problem when considering security issues is that of 
degradation of performance. Once the Memory Management Unit has been 
loaded it does not cause a performance burden, and the SIDEARM is not a 
bottleneck. The main problem is context switching.
To show that LOCK is generic it was decided to port an existing 
operating system on top of the LOCK TCB. Integration consists of 
moving security related functionality from the operating system to the 
TCB. The differences between LOCK/ix and UNIX System V are set out in 
Section 5.
The verification approach adopted consists of journal-level proofs 
establishing human proof strategy, and the GVE providing machine 
checks. The kernel interface software is approx. 8K lines of code. 
Kernel Extensions, which are implementation dependent, are in the 
range of 5 - 10K lines of code. The SIDEARM consists of 10K lines of C, 
with some high level TCB interface code.
In BED, the algorithm used is currently limited to the CCI type I module, 
but it is hoped that exportable modules will be able to be used in 
future, to extend releasability. Other plans include the publishing of 
interface control documents, to encourage industry development, and to 
develop secure applications (eg databases).
The LOCK program seems to be a reasonable approach that has 
developed over many years. Its history, design principles and trade-
offs, and the verification approach are documented in this well written 
paper.

the System Security Officer detect malicious or unauthorised use of a 
computer system by both unauthorised and authorised users. These 
systems protect our computer systems from abuse, yet in doing so, it 
violates our privacy. This paper discusses the legal and ethical issues 
involved in using an intrusion detection system to monitor the

This paper introduces new and controversial issues in the area of 
trusted database management system (TDBMS) audit mechanisms. The 
paper describes the results of an on-going study that examines audit 
issues in the context of trusted database management systems 
(TDBMS). The study, funded by the Rome Air Development Center (RADC), 
consists of a survey of the state-of-the-art, an analysis of issues 
raised, and an assessment of future relevant research. The scope of the 
study is broad, and includes a variety of security policies and TDBMS 
architectures intended for commercial and defense applications. Issues 
of interest have included those associated with capture, storage, 
protection, reduction, and analysis of audit data. The study is based on 
extensive interviews with a number of researchers and product 
development groups, and an examination of audit in its historical and 
trusted systems contexts. The authors have found that little guidance 
is provided for either what needs to be audited in TDBMS contexts or 
when, how, or even where audit data should be captured or recorded. We 
have found that audit objectives and implied requirements may be 
specific to each application and security policy. We have also found 
that surprisingly little attention has been given in practice to the 
analysis of TDBMS audit data. In addition it appears to be fruitful to 
explore the use and correlation of data collected from several different 
layers of the composite system (opening system and DBMS) 
architectures. An unanticipated result, somewhat beyond the initial 
scope of the study, was revealed when the authors asked about the 
verisimilitude of event recording in an audit trail. If the audit 
subsystem records that a specific event occurred, how can it be 
determined that the event actually took place? The authors have 
concluded that the credibility of the audit trail is intimately tied to 
the strength of assurance that a TDBMS enforces its security policy 
with sound mechanisms. A lack of audit credibility appears in some 
cases to be symptomatic of more fundamental weaknesses in 
assurances. Thus, the authors believe that is utility in analyzing an 
audit trail's credibility as a means of assessing the trust 
characteristics of a system's security architecture. Tentative 
conclusions drawn from preliminary application of this analysis 
technique are presented.

20-46. 
Note: In this paper the author talks at some of the history underlying 
the TCSEC, and in particular the formal specification and evaluation 
aspects and shows how the use of formal methods can weaken rather 
than strengthen an evaluation if improperly used.
The thesis of the paper is that formal methods are good (a) provided 
they supplement rather than supplant other techniques, and (b) the 
discipline needed for the use of formal methods is carried through into 
the whole approach to development and evaluation. A number are 
particular problems with the use of formal methods are discussed in 
detail:
 few system designers have experience of formal methods, and thus 
tend to be learning on the job - which means they may not be fluent 
enough to be able to relate code to specification;
 If the code is close to the specification, it can be inefficient; if 
not, it is difficult to demonstrate consistency (and inconsistency is 
more likely);
 Abstract specifications can have too little detail, making the 
theorems and proofs too superficial to be of value; if the detail is 
present, then the specification is probably too big to understand or to 
analyse with existing tools;
 Tools may not support notions such as concurrency and asynchrony 
that may be vital in a realistic implementation;
 The tools are fallible;
 The tools are limited in their abilities, in that one false axiom or one 
inconsistency in a specification can allow all theorems to be proved 
true (and proved false, but who looks to prove false something they 
want to prove true?).
While formal specifications and analysis can lend assurance that the 
system is secure at at least one level of the design, it is essential to 
demonstrate by thorough and rigourous testing that the top-level 
design concepts have been faithfully carried through to the 
implementation, and that design decisions made at intermediate stages 
for proagmatic or practical reasons have not lost security.
An interesting paper for those who are interested in the history of the 
TCSEC, and an important lesson on the limitations of formal methods 
and the need for integrity of implementation and information.

Auditing can be used to detect abuse or intrusion into a computer 
system in some cases or if the abuse or intrusion is discovered by 
other means, the audit can be used after-the-fact to help determine the 
amount of damage that has occurred on the system. The deterrent 
presented by the audit trail is also important. In the past, audit trails 
have usually been oriented to stand-alone processors. This paper 
explores issues present when auditing in a networked environment. The 
issues are grouped according to: Collection and Storage, Integration, 
Protection, and Analysis. Some recommendations for further research, 
development, standards, and policy-making initiatives are provided.

The Gemini computer, which uses the Gemini Multiprocessing Secure 
Operating System (GEMSOS), is one of only a handful of computers 
which are designed to meet A1 level requirements. Martin Marietta's 
approach to using the Gemini computer as a process, device and memory 
manager are discussed. An example application which was developed in 
25 man-days with 125 lines of trusted code is presented. The 
evaluatable application is easily enhanced to perform a multitude of 
functions without adding a line of trusted code.

implications of various aspects of integrity are considered, and it is 
concluded that a mandatory integrity policy is required to protect data, 
in addition to the usual policy to protect direct disclosure. It is not yet

We have formally proved, using a mechanical verifier, that a security 
multiplexer for a network is secure and has no timing channels. While 
this multiplexer is only a small piece of a system, it handles multiple 
security levels and contains a process and two procedures that interact 
with other parts of the system. Security is expressed using an 
information flow model, extended to handle time. We show how the 
multiplexer is specified in this model, describe the synchronous 
deterministic security model used, and discuss the security proof.

Information is a vital organisational asset that affects ongoing 
decision making. It has a finite life span therefore if it is delayed in 
its distribution, it has reduced value; if a proper user fails to have 
access, it has no value. The objective of attempts to secure the 
organisational information system is to see that unauthorised use is 
not possible, that destructive viruses are not introduced, and that 
unauthorised study and alteration of records and files does not occur 
during the distribution of data and information throughout the 
organisation while guaranteeing that proper users have easy access to 
their information. Are these objectives strictly technical problems, or 
is it possible and appropriate to broaden the scope to include the 
ethical issues that are raised as the security system is developed and 
installed? The argument in this paper is that it is both appropriate and 
necessary to consider the broader issues.

This paper proposes that real-time auditing be built into modern 
systems at the design stage, and puts forward a mechanism for doing 
this in a systematic way. The transaction-based system model to which 
they apply auditing is a commercial type system, but results should be 
generally applicable.
The mechanism is based on a system-wide rule-based 'trigger' detector 
which activates data capture at a module level. Thus far it is quite 
hand-waving, and the rule-based engine could be the proverbial can of 
worms. However, the description of the proposed mechanism below 
this, with nomenclature and some examples, could be quite useful. It 
includes an outline and example of a proposed language.

Seiden, Kenneth F.; Melanson, Jeffrey P. (DEC). The Auditing Facility for 
a VMM Security Kernel. in: 1990 IEEE Computer Society Symposium on 
Research in Security and Privacy; 1990 May 7; Oakland. USA: IEEE; 1990: 
262-277. 
Note: This paper follows on from the Overview of the VAX VMM given at 
the start of the conference. It describes how auditing is provided 
within the VMM Security Kernel. Again the need to produce a production 
quality system was a prime requirement.
The Security Kernel carries out auditing constantly. If the audit log 
becomes full then the system simply stops. Once the audit log becomes 
75% full reminders are sent to the Auditor that the log is filling up. 
DEC estimate that an archive of audit data is only necessary about once 
per week.
The Audit Trail layer is about halfway down the security kernel. Its 
position is determined by the fact that only higher layers may make use 
of its facilities. Lower layers are unable to do so.
When an auditable event occurs it is the responsibility of the layer in 
which the event occurs to generate an audit request to the Audit Trail 
layer. The Audit Trail layer will action an audit request providing 
certain thresholds related to classification and severity are exceeded. 
Alternatively the requesting layer may demand that the event be 
audited whatever the thresholds.
The Audit Trail layer simply buffers audit events. It does not write 
them to the Audit log itself. This is an area where the layering breaks 
down. Since the Audit Trail wishes to write to the audit log (which is a 
file) it should sit above the Files layer. However the Files layer needs 
to sit above the Audit Trail to perform its own audit. The solution of 
duplicating the Files code in the Audit Trail layer is clearly 
unattractive. Instead an Audit Logger layer is introduced at a high level 
in the layered structure. The Audit Logger calls the Audit Trail (at 
times determined by event counts and elapsed time) and drains the 
Audit Trail buffers to the audit logs. Thus technically the Audit Trail 
does not call the Audit Logger but from a purists point of view its a 
cheat!
A simple privilege mechanism is used to gain Separation of Duties. The 
VMM supports a System Manager, a Security Manager and an Auditor. The 
Auditor will log on as an ordinary user and then requests the privileges 
of an Auditor. These will have been set up by the Security Manager. If 
the Auditor has successfully obtained his privilege he may execute 
audit commands. An extra privilege is required to delete audit 
information. The audit log is at System High, so no user with a lesser 
clearance, even if he obtains the Auditor privilege, will be able to 
access the log. If security events trigger alarms the Auditor is 
informed. However, only the System Manager, in general, has the power 
to recover from the alarm.
As mentioned earlier audit data are buffered before being written to 
the audit log. This introduces problems of sequencing and also data loss 
at times such as system crashes. The paper goes into some detail about 
the mechanisms used to prevent and recover from such problems.
For readers building an audit system this paper provides a good survey 
of the practical problems to be forced. Note that it is a paper on Audit 
Collection and not Audit Analysis.
The VAX security kernel is a prototype security kernel implemented as 
a virtual machine monitor (VMM) for the VAX architecture.  The VAX 
security kernel is capable of emulating one or more virtual machines
(VMs) on a single physical machine allowing multiple copies of virtual 
machine operating systems to execute concurrently.  The system 
presently supports both VMS and ULTRIX as virtual machine operating 
systems.
A fundamental component of any security kernel is the ability to 
produce an audit trail of security relevant events.  While there are 
numerous examples of auditing subsystems at the DoD Trusted 
Computer System Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC) [5] C2 or B1 level, there 
is much less experience with the requirements at the B2 level and 
above.  This paper describes the design and implementation of the VAX 
security kernel auditing facility, built to satisfy the requirements at 
the A1 level.

Operational security problems can lead to intrusion in secure computer 
systems. We justify the need for, and present, a pattern-oriented, 
intrusion detection model that can be used to analyze object privilege 
and data flows in secure computer systems to detect operational 
security problems. This model can address context-dependent intrusion, 
such as use of covert storage channels and virus propagation, and has 
been used to build an intrusion detection system for Trusted Xenix. 
Pattern-oriented intrusion detection is expected to complement, not 
replace, current statistical approaches to intrusion detection.

1990 IEEE Computer Society Symposium on Research in Security and 
Privacy; 1990 May 7; Oakland. USA: IEEE; 1990: 285-295. 
Note: The paper starts by describing the problems of auditing covert 
channels, such as transmitter receiver ambiguity, disguised use of 
covert storage channels and insufficient granularity of recorded time. 
It then shows that a computer system designed for minimal 
satisfaction of the TCSEC evaluation criteria, would be unable to 
detect the use of covert storage channels. Finally the paper describes a 
covert storage channel auditor for secure Xenix. The production of the 
auditor was prompted by the B2 evaluation of Secure Xenix. 
The paper itself is complex and should be classed as heavy reading.
In this paper we define requirement for auditing covert storage 
channels and illustrate some fundamental problems which appear in 
most computer systems.  We argue that audit subsystems designed to 
minimally satisfy the TCSEC requirements [1, 2] are unable to detect 
many instances of covert channel use, and hence require major design 
and implementation changes before they are able to detect all use of 
covert storage channels.  Finally, we present the design of a Secure 
Xenix tools for covert-channel audit that has been in operation since 
July 1989.  Results of experiments indicate that the tool is able to 
detect all use of covert storage channels without raising false alarms.

The n-grid model for group authorization and access control extends 
the NTree representation of two-dimensional partial orders and 
incorporates the implicit authorizations of the MCC model. The n-grid 
is a representation of multi-dimensional partial orders, permitting the 
inclusion of relationships among user (subject) groups, object groups, 
and access-right groups. Each (unique) element in an authorization 
class is represented as a vector, facilitating efficient implementation. 
The model contains two parts: the access control part for mapping 
implicit authorizations onto an n-grid, and the propagation part for 
restricting a user's membership to a single subject group.

The worm programs were an experiment in the development of 
distributed computations: programs that span machine boundaries and 
also replicate themselves in idle machines. A worm is composed of 
multiple segments, each running on a different machine. The underlying 
worm maintenance mechanisms are responsible for finding free 
machines when needed and replicating the program for each additional 
segment. These techniques  were successfully used to support several 
real applications, ranging from a simple multimachine test program to 
a more sophisticated real-time animation system harnessing multiple 
machines.

Note: The Clark-Wilson integrity policy is here resolved into three 
components:
(a)	a mandatory integrity policy
	(which may be implemented by strong typing);
(b)	a discretionary Bell-LaPadula component
	(which may be implemented using access control triples (user, 
object, 	transaction));
(c)	application-specific correctness rules.
The presentation included a demonstration that access control triples 
can be used to give a tighter control over access rights than 
straightforward clearances, thereby improving both integrity and 
security.

This paper describes the port of a multi-Level Secure (MLS) operating 
system to a multi-processor distributed architecture. The 
implementation involved porting AT&T's B1 Rated System V/MLS to the 
AT&T 3B4000 super-minicomputer. Although originally a port of the 
System V/MLS operating system, the 3B4000 port provided valuable 
experience in solving problems associated with MLS networking. This 
type of experience is required for the creation of future secure system 
solutions. Because, just as it is unlikely for a modern computer not to 
be networked, it is equally unlikely for an MLS computer not to have 
need of MLS networking.

This paper describes a flaw (that occurred on the page omitted from 
the proceedings) in a software protection scheme presented at the 
1982 IEEE symposium, and then develops a revised protocol for the use 
of a tamper-resist Secure Cryptographic Module (SCM) that prevents 
the use of unlicenced software. The SCM contains a (DES) crypto unit 
with its own private key, and the licenced user of a piece of software 
is given a composite of the private keys for the software and the SCM. 
Proper use of the protocol results in a useable form of the software 
being loaded into the internal memory of the SCM ready for use.
The protocol can also be viewed as a way to broadcast messages which 
can only be understood by those with permission to do so.

for the IBM Series/1. 1980. 
ACM SIGOPS OSR 14(3) pp.46-54
This paper describes a distributed operating system in which processes 
are contained objects. A process consists of code and its context, 
which in turn consists of a capability table plus some static 
information. The operating system provides the process with private 
memory space and maps it onto the physical processor. The process 
cannot alter its own context, to change it it issues system calls. All 
inter-process communication is via unidirectional FIFOs.
System processes are location-independent and the system can cause 
migration of processes without the process being aware of the 
movement. All process data interactions are made to appear the same 
as process to process interactions so as to maintain this independence. 
The primitive message types and system calls needed to support this 
model are described.

Security and Privacy; 1990 May 7; Oakland. USa: IEEE; 1990: 384-391. 
Note: This is a short but pleasant paper which introduces a means of 
talking about the security relationships between objects in a database. 
The Semantic Data Model for Security (SDMS) is a graphical technique 
which enables the requirements for security in a database to be 
illustrated in an easy to understand fashion. Suggested future work 
includes formalising SDMS to allow the user to reason about the 
requirements expressed.
The author is concerned with the raft of issues which sit beneath the 
standard MAC and DAC concerns. The usual security model uses 
statements like all objects are classified. SDMS allows the 
specifier of a particular application to describe the classification of 
each of the entities in the database. He can also describe the 
classification of associations between entities and he can prescribe 
features such as the hiding of the existence of certain entities and 
associations. The model also provides a method for describing how 
aggregates of data should be classified. Since there is no formal 
description of the model its main use is as an aid to designers and 
security officers to provide a good intuition as to the required security 
features.
The work follows on from an earlier technique for describing integrity 
in databases. There is, perhaps, a lesson to be learned from the paper in 
that not much thought has been given to the presentation of security in 
graphical or diagrammatic form. While diagrams are bound to be 
informal, with all the attendant risks of ambiguity and 
misunderstanding, they do provide a good way for the human brain to 
gain a quick intuition about the subject matter. Much has been made of 
this in traditional Software Engineering methods and perhaps it should 
be more to the fore in security.
A database system must have knowledge of the semantics (the 
properties) of the data it manages to accomplish its tasks.  For a 
multilevel secure database system to provide effective multilevel 
support to users, it must have knowledge of the security-relevant data 
semantics.  Modeling the data semantics of an application domain has 
been a subject of research for many years in the database community, 
but these efforts only address integrity properties of data.  This paper 
demonstrates the use of an extended data model that represents both 
integrity and secrecy aspects of data.  This modeling technique can be 
used as a database design tool and, more importantly, as a vehicle by 
which domain experts, database designers, and security officers can 
precisely define the security requirements for an application domain.  
A second contribution is a comprehensive taxonomy of security 
relevant data semantics that must be captured and understood to 
implement a multilevel secure automated information system.

This paper proposes that users be allowed to define the information to 
which they currently require access. A Trojan Horse would then be 
unable to get at things which the user would normally have access to 
but did not intend to update. The proposed mechanism is supported by 
some mathematics describing a security policy by means of sets. It is 
essentially an extra layer of discretionary policy. The difficulty might 
be pursuading users to use it.

Intrusion detection is the problem of identifying unauthorised use, 
misuse, and abuse of computer systems by both system insiders and 
external penetrators. The proliferation of heterogeneous computer 
networks provides additional implications for the intrusion detection 
problem. Namely, the increased connectivity of computer systems gives 
greater access to outsiders, and makes it easier for intruders to avoid 
detection. IDS's are based on the belief that the intruder's behaviour 
will be noticeably different from that of a legitimate user. We are 
designing and implementing a prototype Distributed Intrusion Detection 
System (DIDS) that combines distributed monitoring and data reduction 
(through individual host and LAN monitors) with centralised data 
analysis (through the DIDS director) to monitor a heterogeneous 
network of computers. This approach is unique among current IDS's. A 
main problem considered in this paper is the Network-user 
Identification problem, which is concerned with tracking a user moving 
across the network, possibly with a new user-id on each computer. 
Initial system prototypes have provided quite favorable results on this 
problem and the detection of attacks on a network. This paper provides 
an overview of the motivation behind DIDS, the system architecture and 
capabilities, and a discussion of the early prototype.

The BAN (Burrows, Abadi and Needham) approach to analysis of 
cryptographic protocols transforms a correctness requirement into a 
proof obligation of a formal belief logic. It is shown that the BAN 
protocol annotation rules make flaws due solely to protocol step 
permutation undetectable by the BAN logic. This is illustrated by a 
short example. In a recently published critique of the BAN logic 
D.Nessett uses the BAN logic to prove the correctness of an insecure 
protocol. In the style of BAN logic we define the concept of a 
terminating idealized protocol. We then show that the protocol due to 
D.Nessett belongs to the class of non-terminating protocols.

In protocols for the distribution of symmetric keys, a principal will 
usually either take on the role as a session key provider or as a session 
key user. A principal taking on the role as session key user may also act 
as the master or the slave. We show that methods for the analysis of 
cryptographic protocols that fail to properly handle multiple roles do 
not yield dependable results.
We present a protocol KP, similar to the Needham and Schroeder 
symmetric key distribution protocol. By means of an example, we then 
show how a multi-role flaw in KP can be utilized by an adversary to 
obtain a session key.
Using a method due to Burrows, Abadi and Needham, and the one due to 
Bieber, we show that KP seems to be suitable for secure key 
distribution. Finally, the approach due to Bieber is modified to 
facilitate the detection of the class of multi-role flaws.

Protocol. 1986 Nov. 
Softw. Pract. Exper. 16(11) pp.1031-1
An experiment is described in which a set of Unix systems linked 
together into a Unix United system by means of the Newcastle 
Connection Protocol is also linked to a system with a dissimilar 
structure. It demonstrates that the Newcastle Connection technique can 
be used to connect together operating systems with differing 
structures and philosphies. The non-Unix system, known as Nimrod, 
offers a set of services which can be mapped onto requests for service 
from standard user processes running on a remoted Unix system. The 
services offered by Nimrod are restricted to those required for 
providing remote input and output to a terminal, but the results of the 
experiment suggest that increasing the range of services offered would 
be possible, despite the substantial differences in structure between 
Nimrod and Unix. Some of the problems associated with greater levels 
of inter-system connection are also discussed.

Symposium on Security and Privacy; 1988 Apr 18; Oakland Ca. 
Washington DC: IEEE Computer Society Press; 1988: pp.156-163. ISBN: 
0-8186-0850-1.
Note: A lightweight paper addressing the issues raised when invocation 
of services is cascaded through a list of nodes.
Messages across a system carry a passport, constituted from cleartext 
and encrypted sections. Each node of the journey, on receiving the 
passport, adds its identification and a list of constraints on the further 
use of the passport to the cleartext. The identification of the next node 
of the journey and the constraints are appended to the encrypted 
section which is then encrypted further using the node's private key. 
The paper shows how the constituents of the passport - an encrypted 
section, a list of nodes and a list of constraints - provide a number of 
benefits.
At any time (and certainly at the final node) the authentication service 
can provide a validation of the passport (i.e. encrypted section => 
cleartext). To guarantee this authentication of the passport there must 
exist either a centralised authentication service (common to all nodes) 
or a set of co-operating authentication services that trust each other. 
Pairwise authentication between adjacent nodes is also neccessary.
The methods outlined in the paper are not breaking any new ground. 
Further the claim that it is 'efficient enough to be usable' is dubious 
due to the fact that each node on the journey re-encrypts the passport 
using its own private key. The authentication of a passport that has 
travelled over N nodes will need N decryptions.
This paper addresses a problem that has arisen in building distributed 
systems in which incomplete trust exists and program composition is 
necessary.  The problem is to permit authentication for both access 
control and accounting when cascading invocations.  The problem can be 
identified as one of providing cascaded authentication.  A mechanism 
has been developed which is called passports that are passed along 
with each stage of the cascade and digitally signed at each transaction.  
The information thus signed is that which is critical to the 
authentication.  The contributions of the work are both in recognizing 
the problem and in devising a solution that is efficient enough to be 
usable, although there will be some cost associated with such a 
mechanism.

The paper describes an architecture for handling multilevel objects, 
and outlines a proposed intelligent secure terminal to text process 
multilevel documents. The technique suggested is to use a series of 
worker processors, each handling data at one level, with a trusted 
feedback monitor and untrusted foreman processor. A trusted host 
interface is assumed and it is assumed that the host can somehow hold 
multilevel objects securely. The proposed design relies on the high 
performance of a dedicated single-user system, and the task time 
predictability when processing text; hardware separation of processes 
in processors is easier to verify than logical separation.

A common problem with systems that use passwords for authentication  
results when users choose weak passwords. Weak passwords are 
passwords that are easy to guess, or likely to be found in a dictionary 
attack. Thus, the choice of weak passwords may lead to a compromised 
system. Methods exist to prevent users from selecting and using weak 
passwords. One common method is to compare user choices against a 
list of unacceptable words. The problem with this approach is the 
amount of space required to store even a modest-sized dictionary of 
prohibited password choices. This paper describes a space-efficient 
method of storing a dictionary of words that are not allowed as 
password choices. Lookups in the dictionary are O(1) (constant time) no 
matter how many words are in the dictionary. The mechanism described 
has other interesting features, a few of which are described here.

Although the term "security policy" is fundamental to computer 
security, its conflicting meanings have obscured important conceptual 
distinctions, especially where concerns other that confidentiality are 
involved. A clearer definition is needed to 1) clarify routine technical 
discourse 2) facilitate resolution of key research issues, and 3) 
establish the scope of security research and standardization efforts. 
The terms security policy objective, organizational security policy, and 
automated security policy are proposed. These terms are based on 
simple generalizations of ideas that underlie the Trusted Computer 
System Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC). Yet, they describe a view of 
security that is more precise, more general, and different than 
"confidentiality, integrity, and assured service". Their usefulness in 
clarifying conceptual and terminological issues is illustrated through 
examples.

pp.25-36. 
The TCSEC is concerned primarily with the DoD confidentiality. As a 
result, for many applications systems that satisfy the TCSEC may 
nevertheless provide an insufficient base for security policy 
enforcement. This paper summarises a study whose objective is the 
identification of a broader range of security policies that merit 
automated support, particularly in tactical computer systems. The 
study analysed operational requirements of a collection of tactical and 
non-tactical application scenarios. Synopses of several example 
scenarios are presented, and the findings of the study discussed. The 
study suggests that while many policies are application specific there 
exists a core of policy elements common to a broad range of such 
policies, and that this core merits automated support in future trusted 
systems.

Note: Introduction: This paper presents information about how IRS has 
implemented the sensitive systems inventory and security plan 
requirements of the Computer Security Act. It covers those activities 
related to the identification of sensitive systems and the writing of 
security plans. Security activities outside of writing security plans, 
which are part of the normal development of all systems at IRS, are not 
addressed in this paper. The IRS approach seeks to implement active 
management involvement in security planning as it relates to the 
specific requirements of the Act, ie. a sensitive systems inventory and 
security plan preparation. We believe that the successful completion of 
a security plan for each sensitive system in our agency is the result of 
a carefully coordinated attempt to take advantage of existing 
organizational structures and processes.

Symposium on Security and Privacy; May 1; Oakland, California. USA: 
IEEE Computer Society; 1989: 126-135. 
Note: A statistical database (SDB) is a database that provides simple 
summary statistics about its individuals, and supports statistical data 
analysis. Summary tables are tabular representations of summary data. 
For a given aggregate function and a set of attributes used to describe 
the individuals of an SDB, all possible summary tables form a lattice. 
Security is a major problem in this area, since a sensitive statistic can 
disclose too much confidential information about an individual. Size-
one cells are, by definition, sensitive and the main security problem in 
the lattice model of summary tables.
The Cell Suppression by Merging (CSM) Technique is discussed. Given 
any size-one elementary cell which has to be suppressed (i.e. not 
revealed to users) select a size greater-than-one elementary cell with 
which to merge it, and suppress them both. Any cell in the lattice 
which contains exactly one of these cells is also suppressed.
A major aim is to minimise information loss. Since information lost is 
determined by the percentage of suppressed cells in the lattice, the 
number of suppressed cells should be minimised. Heuristics for 
minimum information loss are presented.
In this paper, query probabilities are incorporated into the model and 
the CSM technique is extended into the generalised lattice model 
environment, where additional summary tables are formed by secondary 
attributes. In conclusion, CSM is a very useful cell level inference 
control technique with respect to minimising information loss.
The presentation suffered as it was difficult to understand the speaker 
and poor quality, handwritten viewfoils were used. This detracted from 
what is an interesting paper.

Su, Tzong-An; Ozsoyoglu, Gultekin. Data Dependencies and Inference 
Control in Multilevel Relational Database Systems. 1987. 
We investigate the inference problems due to functional dependencies 
(FD) and multivalued dependencies (MVD) in a multilevel relational 
database (MDB) with attribute and record classification schemes, 
respectively. For FDs, we show that, to prevent compromised, the 
security levels of attributes must be assigned by using the knowledge 
of functional dependencies. Under the assumption that all the 
attributes in the database have been assigned classification levels 
acording to real world requirements, we first determine the set of 
functional dependencies to be taken into account. Then, we prove that 
changing the minimum number of attribute levels to prevent 
compromise is an NP-complete problem. However, assuming that the 
number of functional dependencies involved in inference is low, we give 
an exact algorithm to adjust the minimum number of attribute levels so 
that no compromise due to functional dependencies occurs. For MVDs, 
we give a necessary and sufficient condition for compromise due to a 
single MVD, and then propose an algorithm to prevent single MVD 
inferences.
IEEE Comp. Soc. Proc 1987 Symp. Security and Privacy, pp. 202 - 211
This paper goes into great detail about the theory of data dependencies. 
It is an unfortunate characteristic of database theory that great 
complexity must be encountered to state a result that appears obvious: 
this paper is no exception.
The functional dependency information is dealt with in a more 
comprehensible fashion in Denning and Lunt's paper but the multivalued 
dependency work is new. Join dependencies have not been covered 
although these are rather exotic and difficult to identify in real life.
The result is that the classification of a value must dominate the 
classification of a value upon which it depends.
The algorithms for removing dependencies have two problems:
 although they are satisfactory for column classification, in row 
classification they introduce an inference channel in the attempt to 
remove one, and
 they assume total ordering of classifications.

Note: The author presents a new security property, deducibility, in this 
far from lucid paper.  In the model, users can see a view of the system 
that is a function of the states through which it has passed in its life 
time (a 'possible world').  In effect, their interface to the system is 
described by this function.  Assuming a user knows the information 
function corresponding to his own interface and that of another 
interface, information can flow from his interface to the other if the 
set of possible worlds that could account for the view he sees does not 
produce all possible outputs at the other interface.  The user will be 
able to deduce that a user of this other interface cannot be seeing 
certain outputs.  Informally, a system has the deducibility property 
when a user observing events at his low level interface cannot deduce 
anything  about the sequence of inputs delivered to a higher level 
interface.

implementation of operating systems for computer network 
environments. The workshop had the express intention of bringing 
together an international group of researchers. The ten sessions dealt 
with much of the state of the art research both in operating system 
projects, such as: the Newcastle Connection, Apollo's DOMAIN, Project 
Admiral, the Cedar file system and, Cambridge's Mayflower project; and 
in recent thinking about upcalls, broadcasting, persistent objects, and 
remote procedure calls. This paper summarises all the sessions. A 
session on high availability systems may be particularly relevant in the 
security field.

This paper proposes a set of protocols which would allow access 
control procedures to be associated with shared resources. Access 
control policies are decided by the resource creator rather than a 
system-wide policy, so to support MLS policies one would have to build 
a suitable ACP into the kernel to be associated with each resource - 
perhaps allowing the creator to add secondary controls - and then 
protect the kernel from modification by the resource. The work was 
based on the author's experience with the Guthenberg distributed OS 
kernel, and has not yet been implemented.

Logics for cryptographic protocol analysis are presented and a study is 
made of the protocol features that they are appropriate for analyzing: 
some are appropriate for analyzing trust, others security. It is shown 
that both features can be adequately captured by a single properly 
designed logic. The goals and capabilities of Burrows, Abadi, and 
Needham's BAN logic are examined. It is found that there is confusion 
about these. While the logic is extremely useful heuristically, qua 
formal method it is seen to be ultimately unacceptable. Formal 
semantics is explored as a reasoning tool and the importance of 
soundness and completeness for protocol security is discussed. The 
logic KPL is used to resolve a debate over an alleged flaw in BAN logic 
and is shown to be uniquely capable of dealing with certain protocol 
security issues.

In this paper we present a formal language for specify-

ments. We give examples of simple sets of requirements
in that language. We look at two versions of a proto-
col that might meet those requirements and show how
to specify them in the language of the NRL Protocol
Analyzer. [Mea91] [Mea92] We also show how to map
one of our sets of formal requirements to the language
of the NRL Protocol Analyzer and use the Analyzer to
show that one version of the protocol meets those re-
quirements. In other words, we use the Analyzer as a
model checker to assess the validity of the formulae that
make up the requirements.

This book gives a very comprehensive consideration of computer 
communications networks in general, and with particular reference to 
the functional issues and protocols relevant at each layer of the OSI 
seven layer model. The model is applied even to protocols which were 
developed without its benefit.
The ISO reference model is introduced in the first chapter. The book 
then goes on to introduce the other main sources of protocols: 
ARPANET, SNA, DECNET and X.25. Following chapters deal in turn with 
each of the ISO layers in detail, with examples.
Network security and privacy is covered under the heading of the 
presentation layer. It deals mostly with encryption. The use of the 
presentation layer in virtual terminal protocols and file transfer 
protocols is explored. Network and distributed operating systems, 
distributed computation and distributed data base systems are briefly 
covered by the chapter on the application layer.
The book also gives an excellent reading list and bibliography. All in 
all, a very good introduction and survey of networking, particularly 
with regard to the practical implications of ISO standards.

1990 IEEE Computer Society Symposium on Research in Security and 
Privacy; 1990 May 7; Oakland. USA: IEEE; 1990: 278-284. 
Note: This paper describes a way to detect anomalies using a rule-
based system which learns. The system is based on an inductive 
learning process whereby the program starts with general rules, and 
steadily refines them. The initial rules describe the set of usual events 
in a very broad manner, as time passes and more events are examined 
the rules are steadily refined. The resulting set of rules tightly 
describes the usual behaviour of the system so any anomalies can be 
detected.
The system does this by building up a set of rules for each user, or 
group of users. These rules are based on the analysis of events. An 
event would typically contain such information as the time of the 
event, the type of the event, the name of the executable image that has 
been executed, and various other bits of relevant information.
This is a good paper which contains a description of a system, which 
would prove useful in the analysis of audit trails. However a 
disadvantage is that it only appears to detect sequential events.
This paper describes a time-based inductive learning approach to the 
problem of real-time anomaly detection.  This approach uses sequential 
rules that characterize a user's behavior over time.  A rulebase is used 
to store patterns of user activities, and anomalies are reported 
whenever a user's activity deviates significantly from those specified 
in the rules.  The rules in the rulebase characterize wither the 
sequential relationships between security audit records, or the 
temporal properties of the records. The rules are created in two ways: 
they are either dynamically generated and modified by a time-based 
inductive engine in order to adapt to changes in a user's behavior, or 
they are specified by the security management to implement a site 
security policy.  This approach allows the correlation between adjacent 
security events to be exploited for the purpose of greater sensitivity in 
anomaly detection against seemingly intractable (or 'erratic') 
activities using statistical approaches.  Real-time detection of 
anomaly activities is possible.

 1901. 
This report describes a machine which is an abstraction of the 
archetypal Command, Control, Communications and Information (C3I) 
system which system developers meet in procurement requests, 
operational requirements, invitations to tender, etc, from government 
and military agencies.
	The purpose of this report is to set the scope of complexity of 
structure, functionality and policy which we believe the SMITE 
approach to secure systems development can encompass. It thus 
provides background and motivation for future research and encourages 
those involved in secure systems procurement to investigate further 
the SMITE approach.
	The Abstract Machine is first described in English with pictures 
and subsequently in the Z specification language.

Terry, P. F. The SMITE Approach to Security. 1989 Jan 8. 
SMITE is a novel computer architecture implementing a new security 
policy model. It is proposed as the best available technology which may 
be used to develop information systems for operational use where high 
assurance of complex confidentiality and integrity based security 
policies is required.This report records the results of work carried out 
by Retix Systems for CC1 division RSRE. This contract provided a peer 
review of their architecture proposals, characterised the essential 
architectural elements and formulated the security oriented top level 
model. In this way it provided a baseline definition of SMITE to aid the 
future way forward for the project.

Terry, Phil; Wiseman, Simon (TSL//RSRE). A 'New' Security Policy 
Model. : TSL/RSRE; 1988. 
A Model of Security is presented which integrates notions of 
confidentiality and commercial integrity.  This model has been 
developed to fulfill the needs of the RSRE SMITE project because 
existing modelling approaches proved to be inadequate.  The paper 
introduces the model and subsequently compares and contrasts it with 
existing approaches.

Terry, Phil; Wiseman, Simon (Retix Systems//RSRE). A 'New' Security 
Policy. in: 1989 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy; May 1; 
Oakland, California. USA: IEEE Computer Society; 1989: 215-228. 
Note: This paper describes a security model, including both 
confidentiality and integrity properties, for the RSRE SMITE project. 
The presentation wisely avoided details of the formal model, and 
concentrated on the motivation for the model and its relationship to 
selected other models (BLP, Biba, Clark-Wilson; no event-based 
models).
The confidentiality part of the model is state-based (since this is 
claimed to be more familiar to security practitioners), with entities 
(not subjects and objects) whose attributes represent classification, 
role, trusts, conflicting roles and other data. There is no notion of 
secure state; SMITE can handle a very fine granularity of policy, and 
its typing system leads more naturally to the definition of secure 
transitions. Also mentioned in the presentation (but not in the paper) 
were an information flow axiom and a conditional non-interference 
statement to ensure the consistency of the model.
The integrity part of the model is split into two issues: correctness 
of state integrity and appropriateness of transitions (a distinction 
also implicit in Clark-Wilson). The examples in the presentation were 
that accounts must only be amended with a correct program is a 
correctness integrity problem, and can money be transferred into a 
clerks own account? is an appropriateness problem. Separation of 
duty is modelled as n-man rules applied to single operations, and not as 
composable sequences of smaller operations each performed by single 
users of distinct roles.
Future work includes: the conditional non-interference proof using m-
EVES (when available from Canada), examples of the model in action, 
and the use of the model to re-examine DBMS security.
There are several novel features of this model, notably operations 
having several requesters, separation of duty treated as a constraint on 
an n-man operation, and the relationship between role and trust 
attributes of entities. There appear to be some loose ends in this 
approach, for example an interpretation of user input/output, and a 
better justification of the split between roles and trusts. The meaning 
of requests is unclear; there seems to be no guarantee that information 
really does flow only from the entities named as observed in the 
request (  perhaps this is an assumption implicit in the models level 
of abstraction). The formal integrity property is a problem, in that it 
appears to disallow newly-created objects (which are counted as 
observers?), and the three transition rules do not seem to 
conform to the integrity property. Nonetheless, this model includes 
some new and promising ideas, especially in its view of 
appropriateness, and its future development should be of interest.

Note: This paper describes a scheme in which the name of any file has 
the same classification as the contents of a file, so that low-clearance 
users are not aware of the names of highly-classified files. If a low-
clearance user attempts to create a file which has the same name as an 
existing highly-classified file, the user is informed of the failure to 
create the file, but a fixed time delay is inserted, to decrease the 
bandwidth of this covert channel. By inserting the delay only on 
failures, which will be infrequent in normal operation, the covert 
channel bandwidth is reduced without causing unnecessary delays to 
successful create operations.
	A major problem with the file name classification scheme 
appears to be that every directory becomes a multi-level object. This 
means that every program which manipulates directories must be 
trusted, or that a set of trusted directory handling procedures must be 
available, and only these may access directories. This seems to diverge 
from the Unix philosophy of directories being, as far as possible, just 
like files.
The concept of using a delay in 'unexpected' cases seems useful for 
reduction of covert channel bandwidth seems viable, provided that it is 
appropriately implemented. Discussion with the speaker revealed that, 
in his implementation, the delay is created using the Unix 'sleep' 
facility, which allows a process change to occur during the 'sleep'. This 
means that, in this implementation, the system is still vulnerable to 
attack by several processes acting in concert, each attacking in turn, 
while the others 'sleep it off', This could be rectified by using a 'busy' 
loop as the delay, but, obviously, performance will suffer if the 
'unexpected' case occurs frequently. It seems likely that an optimal 
compromise could be found (perhaps delay inversely proportional to 
probability of 'unexpected' event).
It should be noted that, by using appropriate coding, the data rate 
through one of these 'asymmetric covert channels' can be increased to 
at least twice that which is obtained using straightforward encoding.

Note: Abstract in TechGnosis, June 1989 (PO689-51).
The application of prototyping, using Prolog, in the design of multilevel 
secure databases (MLS/DBMS) is examined.  The concept is illustrated 
by and MLS/DBMS prototype based on the Bell and LaPadula model.  This 
paper considers the design issues, including commercial applications, 
involved in building the Prolog prototype. Features of the current 
prototype are discussed, including the security policies used by the 
prototype and how data stored in the prototype is separated.  
Appendices illustrate a sample run of the MLS/DBMS prototype.

This amusing little paper by one of the originators of UNIX describes 
how to insert trapdoors and trojan horses in programs with very little 
chance of detection. You modify the compiler so that it recognises when 
it is compiling itself, and inserts code that will do this and will also 
recognise and modify another program (such as the logon control 
software).

Distributed systems are vital for the efficient processing required in 
military applications. For these applications it is especially important 
that the distributed database management systems (DDBMS) should 
operate in a secure manner. For example, the DDBMS should allow users, 
who are cleared to different levels, access to the database consisting 
of data at a variety of sensitivity levels without compromising 
security. This paper focuses on secure query processing in a DDBMS. 
Implementation of secure query processing algorithms in a DDBMS as 
well as an analysis of the performance of the algorithms is described.

In a multilevel secure database management system, users cleared at 
different security levels access and share a database with data at 
different sensitivity levels. A serious threat to database security, not 
adequately addressed at present, is the inference problem. That is, 
users acquire unauthorized information from the responses that they 
legitimately receive. It is the inferencing capability and deductive 
power of intelligent database systems that could provide viable 
approaches for handling the inference problem. In this paper is 
described secure query processing in intelligent database systems. The 
types of database systems that are considered are augmented 
relational systems, fuzzy relational systems and object-oriented 
systems.

Note: The model discussed in this paper supports a data sensitivity 
level classification scheme appropriate for use in multilevel secure 
database management systems; data is classified on the basis of 
content, context, time and the possibility of aggregation. In order to 
avoid the problem of overclassification of data, the security model 
allows a subject to work with the lowest clearance level necessary to 
complete a task.
	In order to avoid the problem of a lowly-cleared subject either 
overwriting a highly-classified object, or making use of a covert 
channel if he cannot use its name, a form of polyinstantiation is used, 
so that a single name may refer to more than one object.

In the entity layer all information flow to and from the entities takes 
place through the CMSB; such information flows are concerned with the 
management of sessions, and communication between sessions. It is 
the purpose of the CMSB to ensure that these information flows accord 
with the security policy. This document specifies in Z notation the 
functionality of the CMSB as perceived by a connected entity. The CMSB 
is modelled as a state machine whose states are altered by operators, 
which are invoked by the entities, in conjunction with packets of 
information, called primitives, that pass between the CMSB and the 
entities concerned.

We analyze the DEC fuzzy time technique (Hu [2])
for both a single computer system and a network of
hosts. Specifically, we investigate covert channels in a
model of a fuzzy time system and in a network model
of n fuzzy time hosts and one nonfuzzy time host. The
fuzzy time operating system model predicts a covert
channel with a datarate of roughly 50 bits per sec-
ond, given a mean time between upticks of 20 mil-
liseconds as in the VAX security kernel. We suggest
several countermeasures including scheduler redesign
which will close or reduce the channels that we analyze.

Improvement of Data Processing Security by means of Fault Tolerance. 
in: 14th National Computer Security Conference; 1991 Oct; Washington. 
USA: NIST/NCSC; 1991; 1: pp.295-304. 
This paper discusses various different solutions to the problem of 
reliable processing of confidential information. One of the major 
difficulties of this problem comes from the fact that conventional 
techniques for achieving reliability, on the one hand, and security on 
the other, tend to be in opposition to each other. The different solutions 
presented here have been classified in three distinct types: two are 
related to classical security techniques (protection, and encryption) 
and the third is a new technique, the fragmentation-redundancy-
scattering technique, which it is claimed demonstrates a potentially 
advantageous unified approach to the provision of reliability and 
security, based on fault tolerance. Finally, a qualitative comparison of 
these solutions is given, taking into account both dependability, 
openness and performance criteria.

Electrical Engineering). A Bandwidth Computation Model for Covert 
Storage Channels and its Applications. in: 1988 IEEE Symposium on 
Security and Privacy; 1988 Apr 18; Oakland Ca. Washington DC: IEEE 
Computer Society Press; 1988: pp.108-121. ISBN: 0-8186-.0850-1.
Note: The idea is to obtain more realistic estimates for covert channel 
capacities on a shared system, including factors such as noise 
scheduling delays, 'think times' etc. Bandwidth limitations of covert 
channels based on worst-case analysis can lead to serious degradations 
of performance. Using such an analysis would allow for example the 
implementation of dynamically adjustable bandwidth limitations and 
thus minimize the impact on performance.
The work is based on Markov chains and queuing theory and appears to 
be well-founded. It was one of the few papers to present firm, usable 
results.
Most practical policies for handling covert storage channels are based 
on band-width limitation techniques.  In this paper we present a Markov 
model for bandwidth computation and its application to Secure Xenix.  
The model can be used for computing the bandwidth of both individual 
channels and aggregated channels (i.e., serial and parallel aggregation).  
Based on this model, a tool has been built and experiments conducted to 
determine the factors that affect the bandwidth of covert storage 
channels (i.e., noise, scheduling delays, load, 'think times').  The  tool 
can be used to compute the minimum delays for each channel under 
various loads and program behaviour.  Thus, it enables the placement of 
dynamically-adjustable delays in multiprogrammed systems, which 
guarantees minimum performance impact.

Tsai, Chii-Ren; Gligor, Virgil D.; Chandersekaran, C. Sekar. A Formal 
Method for the Identification of Covert Storage Channels in Source 
Code. 1987. 
A formal method for the identification of covert storage channels is 
presented and its application to the source code of the Secure Xenix 
kernel is illustrated. The method is based on the identification of all 
visible/alterable kernel variables by using information flow analysis 
of language code (e.g., C language code). The method also requires that 
after the sharing relationships among the kernel primitives and the 
visible/alterable variables are determined, the non-discretionary 
access rules implemented by each primitive be applied to identify the 
covert storage channels. The method can be generalized to other 
implementation languages, and has the following advantages: it leads to 
the discovery of all storage channels in kernel implementations; it 
helps determine whether the non-discretionary access rules are 
implemented correctly; and, it can be automated.
An additional important aspect of applying this method to a kernel 
interface is the discovery of all kernel variables that are modified 
directly or indirectly through that interface. The analysis of the 
modification scenarios provides the necessary conditions for all kernel 
penetration. This implies that, in any kernel that enforces both a non-
discretionary security and an integrity policy, penetration instances 
are the dual of covert storage channels instances.
IEEE Comp. Soc. Proc 1987 Symp. Security and Privacy, pp. 74 - 86
The method described in the paper is founded on the identification of 
all visible/alterable kernel variables using information flow analysis 
of language code. The method is currently based on analysis of C 
programming language semantics but apparently can be generalised to 
other programming languages with similar control structures.
The paper explains that early attempts to identify covert channels have 
focussed on analysis of formal top level specifications of operating 
system kernels and trusted processes. While it is important to catch 
these flaws as early as possible in the design process it is claimed 
that total reliance on analysis of top level specifications is inadequate 
and can lead to the discovery of 'false flows' i.e flows which appear in 
the analysis but not in the code. In part the problem lies in imprecise 
correspondence arguments between specifications and code, but more 
significantly specifications do not contain sufficient detail of data 
structures and code to detect flows caused by the implementation 
language semantics - eg control statements, pointer assignments.
The paper summarises the authors' experience in applying the method to 
the secure Xenix kernel. The analysis of the entire kernel code is 
complete and was done manually prior to the availability of a support 
tool now being implemented. The results of the analysis are interesting 
and show that the method is successful at finding covert channels of 
surprising subtlety - in all fewer than two dozen channels were 
identified.
As this method is concerned with identifying security weaknesses in 
implemented systems, this paper should interest people involved with 
the evaluation of secure systems; furthermore, the support tool would 
make a valuable addition to an evaluation facility.

Covert Storage Channels in Secure Systems. IEEE Trans. on Software

Note: Revised version of IEEE Symposium paper.
A practical method for the identification of covert storage channels is 
presented and its application to the source code of the Secure Xenix 
kernel is illustrated. The method is based on the identification of all 
visible/alterable kernel variavles by using information-flow analysis 
of language code (e.g. C language code).  The method also requires that, 
after the sharing relationships among the kernel primitives and the 
visible. alterable variables are determined, the nondiscretionary access 
rules implemented by each primitive be applied to identify the 
potential storage channels.  The method can be generalised to other 
implementation languages and has the following advantages: 1) it helps 
discover all potential storage channels in kernel code, thereby helping 
determine whether the nondiscretionary access rules are implemented 
correctly; 2) it helps avoid discovery of false flow violations and their 
unnecessary analysis; and 3) it helps identify the kernel location where 
audit code and time-delay variables need to be placed for covert-
channel handling.

Note: This paper presented an appeal for more interest to be taken in 
privacy as opposed to security. Privacy was defined as the rights of 
individuals to determine the extent that information should be given to 
others.
It was pointed out that the vast majority of work presented at the 
conference on security and privacy was about security. Now that many 
countries have data privacy laws it is appropriate that there should be 
more technical work in the area.
Information privacy deals with protecting individuals against potential 
violations of their rights due to collection, storage and use of personal 
information by the government and private sector organisations. The 
privacy protection laws enacted in the 1970s are inadequate and 
limited in scope.  New applications of computer-communications 
technology involving personal information are now emerging for the 
decade of the 1990s and create new potential for privacy violations.  
The basics of privacy protection, examples of the new technologies and 
the need for new privacy laws are discussed in this paper.

This is the standard reference for the US public packet-switching wide 
area network that developed from Tymshare Inc.'s internal terminal 
network used by their public time-sharing service.
Network switches are interconnected by voice-grade lines. A central 
supervisor creates a virtual connection route for each call at call 
initialization and flow control is performed on a link-by-link basis for 
each virtual connection. Messages between nodes contain data for up to 
20 different calls, packed into 66-byte frames. Data is repackaged at 
each node into new blocks for the next hop.
The network was designed to fulfil the needs of the full duplex 
terminal in the ten to thirty character per second range. The paper 
itself describes this requirement, gives the system's topology and 
hardware and then gives a detailed description of the virtual circuits 
set up between terminal and host through the network. It then 
describes the network supervisor used to establish the virtual circuits

An estimate of the information a database contains and the 
quantification of the vulnerability of that database to compromise by 
inferential methods is the subject of this paper. Such a measure could 
be used to evaluate the deterrent value of extant protection methods 
and provide a measure of the potential for inferential compromise 
through the use of one of the known attack tools. In this paper, we 
explore the use of the concept of entropy a defined for information by 
Shannon for the purpose of quantifying information content in a 
database and develop a measure of vulnerability based on entropy. Use 
of the measure, when exact disclosure through the use of a tracker is 
anticipated, is characterized for both static and dynamic databases at 
design and operational time.

There has been considerable research in database security and 
inference control; however, that research deals primarily with 
statistical databases. Although some of the mechanisms proposed to 
deter compromise artificially introduce dynamicism into these 
otherwise static databases, very little effort has been devoted to the 
area of natural dynamics. The purpose of this work is to determine a 
deterrent value for natural change in dynamic databases. More 
specifically, we investigate how the changing value of an attribute 
prevents the inference of the confidential value of that attribute for 
any particular record. Assuming a restricted query set size, we 
calculate bounds of deterrence to compromise by the individual, 
general, and double trackers.

Note: This paper describes a system called W&S (Wisdom and Sense) 
developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory.
The aim is to make the job of CSSO (Computer System Security Officer) 
less of a bind and therefore more likely to be done properly. The worse 
aspect of this post seems to be the inspection of reams of boring audit 
data. W&S is an attempt essentially to preprocess this audit data 
(possibly in real time) and reduce it to a form containing events only of 
interest from a security point of view. The approach taken is to set up 
a rule base describing likely and acceptable behaviour (by human input 
or analysis of historical audit data) and check off events against this 
rule base.
The rule base in W&S is a highly compacted tree structure, claimed to 
hold a rule per 6-7 bytes of storage, and can be held in memory 
(presumably for performance considerations) typically occupying 0.5-
1.0 Mbyte.
The authors define a thread as a sequence of audit records that are 
related in specified field values, such as user Fred and terminal 
tta1 (the user-terminal combination being a common thread). The 
system keeps a rolling value for the degree of anomaly (the figure of 
merit FOM) for a thread and alerts the CSSO when a threshold is 
exceeded. Previous slight anomalies decay in FOM contribution with 
time (event number).
The essential points seem to be that the rule base contains local 
computer use patterns, can be made to contain rules relating to 
security policies, relieves a human being of the typically unmanageable 
task of inspecting reams of audit data, and can do all this in very 
nearly real time using workstation class hardware.
The system is intended to support logon and normal security protocols 
and not supplant them. Furthermore, it is clear that this system lies on 
top of an operating system (the discussion has a VMS flavour) and 
therefore does not rely on system software modification.
The obvious risks are:
 if a system has already been penetrated when W&S is set up, then 
subversive behaviour by one or more users will be incorporated in the 
rule base as normal behaviour;
 the rule base has to be updated with new historical data as computer 
usage is unlikely to be static but have trends, enabling an attack where 
the hostile slowly expands his or her subversive activities;
 W&S obviously cannot withstand a direct successful attack on the 
rule base itself, such an attack will rapidly compromise the rule base 
as the rules are human-readable (this is held to be a feature).

Practical Security Problem in Distributed Systems. in: 14th National 
Computer Security Conference; 1991 Oct; Washington. USA: NIST/NCSC; 
1991; 2: pp.386-396. 
This paper considers a practical problem that arises when considering 
scenarios in distributed computing environments. In a distributed 
object system, the dependency between objects is common phenomenon. 
This in turn implies that changes occurring in an object's state will 
affect the behaviour of other objects. For correct operation of the 
system these changes need to be properly notified to the other 
cooperating objects. Such situations are very common in many office 
applications and we consider one such typical case, namely the 
producer-consumer scenario and examine its security implications. We 
consider a solution to this problem, referred to as the Notification 
Problem. The solution is based on the increasingly publicized Kerberos 
authentication system. Note that Kerberos forms part of the OSF's 
Distributed Computing Environment (DCE). We then consider the trust 
implications of the proposed solution which leads us to the more 
general problem of proxy or delegation in distributed systems. We 
conclude the paper by proposing an extension of the Kerberos system to 
handle proxy situations.

This paper looks at the problem of delegation of rights, or proxy in 
distributed object systems. We present two signature-based schemes 
to achieve delegation which require different inter-object trust 
assumptions. These schemes have been instantiated using public key 
and secret key based cryptographic techniques. We also consider 
additional trust implications which arise from these implementations. 
Then we consider the issue of revocation of delegations and propose 
several ways of achieving this. These solutions have been compared 
with the mechanism proposed in the Distributed System Security 
Architecture. Finally, to conclude the paper, we consider the Kerberos 
authentication system and propose extensions to implement the 
delegation scheme.

Distributed systems are vulnerable to a number of security attacks. In 
this paper we look at the security problems of object-based distributed 
systems, and propose a model based on labelling for multilevel 
security. The purpose of this model is to preserve the information flow 
security in a distributed object-oriented system. We consider the basic 
concepts of the object paradigm, and also the security threats to such 
systems. We postulate various modelling possibilities, and produce a 
specific set of security properties which describe a multilevel secure 
object model. This particular model should not be considered as a 
panacea, but rather should demonstrate how the various modelling 
decisions are reflected in an actual model. We conclude with a 
discussion of possible avenues of future research.

In the past a number of techniques have been proposed to avoid 
inferential security breaches in statistical databases. The best 
methods qualitatively as well as quantitatively were based on output 
perturbation. In this paper we present four output perturbation 
techniques as deterrents to compromise in statistical databases. We 
analyse the techniques for the deterrent value against compromise and 
the statistical consequences such as the amount of bias they introduce 
in the values of the statistics released. In particular, we analyse the 
techniques for sum queries and also compare the bias and deterrence of 
these techniques. The analysis is done for exact compromise. 
Compromise accomplished by averaging, a common problem with output 
perturbation technique, is avoided by releasing same answer for 
identical query sets.

In a TCB subsetting approach, no part of the database system itself is 
involved in enforcing mandatory security. Instead, a previously verified 
mandatory security kernel is used. This approach places severe 
constraints on the architecture of the database system. Particular 
areas of difficulty are concurrency controls, recovery management, and 
buffer management. This paper discusses these issues.

Guard (WCG) system provides a multilevel secure electronic interface 
between AMC's Top Secret System High Command and Control 
Information System and AMC's Secret System High CAT Global Decision 
Support System (GDSS). The WCG, implemented on HFSI's B3 XTS-200, 
can replace manual air-gap procedures. The WCG supports two-way data 
interchange for the automated release of sanitised High-to-Low Time 
Phased Force Deployment Data (TPFDD) Operation Plans (OPLAN) and 
Low-to-High Joint Operations Planning and Execution System (JOPES) 
update data, as well as operator mediated High-to-Low and automatic

	This paper summarizes the functional capabilities of the AMC 
WCG, citing its unique features and describing its current 
implementation status. A "guard" mediates and controls the flow of 
information between systems operating at different security levels.

49. ISBN: 0-8186-0850-1.
Note: This paper discusses a design intended to overcome some of the 
problems of implementing discretionary access controls using access 
control lists.
The general features of the operating system design were presented in 
a separate paper at this symposium (Casey, Vinter et. al.); it is based 
on the idea of objects being instances of abstract data types. For each 
object, the access control list consists of a series of 'contextual client 
identities' (CCI), each of which incorporates a role; a client can invoke 
an operation on an object if his current CCI is in the ACL and the role is 
appropriate for that operation on that type of object. (In fact, a user 
has a set of current CCI's, and the operation is permitted if any are 
appropriate.) For each abstract data type, the operations can be grouped 
according to the role required to invoke the operation, and typically 
there will be more than one operation in each group; in addition, the 
roles would be applicable to a variety of abstract data types.
The scheme also allows for proxy CCI's, so that, for example, a print 
manager can access the file to be printed on behalf of the user, without 
having to have the print manager appearing in the ACL for the file. The 
proxy CCI can be restricted to apply only to a given set of objects, so 
the manager being given the proxy CCI does not have the full rights of 
the client on whose behalf he is acting. Proxy CCI's are like capabilities 
in that they are transferrable access rights; as with normal 
capabilities, they must be unforgeable.
Unlike capabilities, proxy CCI's cannot be used to identify the object to 
be operated on. When a client supplies a proxy CCI, the kernel adds it to 
the current CCI set for the manager, and it is the responsibility of the 
manager to remove it when no longer required. Managers that cannot be 
trusted to do this removal can, if required, be set up so that they 
cannot obtain proxy CCI's.
The design is an attempt to try and combine some of the features of 
capabilities into an ACL-based system, with much of the complexity 
required in the type managers handled by automatic code generation 
from interface specifications. The authors admit that it is a paper 
study and requires more work to determine its usefulness in practice.
Presents a discretionary access control mechanism proposed for a 
secure distributed operating system being designed at BBN 
Laboratories.  The DOS is an object-oriented system that used access 
control lists to authorize access to objects.  Discretionary controls are 
implemented in a type-specific manner inside the managers of objects.  
Several extensions to conventional access control lists are proposed, 
including a limited form of privilege transfer (temporarily passing a 
subset of one's rights to an object to another user), module 
interconnection control (granting exclusive rights to a program 
independent of who is executing it), support for direct operations 
(operations invocable only by a human via a trusted path), roles (sets of 
rights across many different types of objects that correspond to 
specific activities; e.g., administrator, operator, etc.), and restricted 
roles (rights with a more stringent policy of distribution).  A technique 
for automatically generating access control implementations is 
presented that is based on nonprocedural specifications, and an 
implementation approach is proposed that allows the generated code to 
be embedded with high assurance in untrusted object managers using 
hardware protection rings.  The concepts and mechanisms are 
illustrated with a simple banking example.

The implications of adding security mechanisms to high-level network 
protocols operating in an open-system environment are analyzed. First 
the threats to security that may arise in such an environment are 
described, and then a set of goals for communications approaches to 
communications security, link-oriented measures and end-to-end 
measures, which concludes that end-to-end measures are more 
appropriate in an open-system environment. Next, relevant properties 
of data encryption - the fundamental technique on which all 
communications security mechanisms are based - are discussed. The 
remainder of the paper describes how end-to-end measures can be used 
to achieve each of the security goals previously established.

allow a database to be held and processed at an insecure central site, 
with query initiation and interpretation being performed at a secure 
local workstation. The first method is suitable for keyword searches of 
a large, static text file (too large to be held by the workstation), and 
the second uses homophonic cyphers on a more general database 
allowing complex queries and joins.

Note: The ASOS project is intended to produce a portable, secure and 
configurable operating system for real-time, tactical applications, 
that is capable of being evaluated (depending on the configuration) at 
C2 through to A1. An alternative way of viewing it is as the 
development of a family of operating systems sharing common design 
elements, user interface and user documentation. This talk gave an 
overview of the development, and described some of the lessons 
learned.
As with the applications they are intended to support, the two existing 
ASOS implementations (one targetted at C2, the other at A1) are 
almost completely written in Ada  the Ada packages were used to 
assist meeting the abstraction and data handling requirements called 
up by the TCSEC. Compile-time constant and conditionals are used to 
produce a variety of configurations, for example whether the system 
has multilevel support (C2 or A1). As ASOS-based systems are intended 
for tactical applications, it was deemed practicable to restrict the 
programs that can be run on a given system to those installed at sysgen 
time. The Ada runtime support library is implemented as nonkernel 
software, copies of which run in the same, unprivileged domain as the 
Ada program it supports.
Trusted software outside the ASOS kernel also runs in an unprivileged 
mode, making calls to the ASOS functions either directly or via the Ada 
runtime support library, but is permitted one or exemptions to the 
security policy (as needed to fulfil its role). Amongst the trusted 
functions implemented this way are the system administrator 
interface, the line printer spooler and the secure audit capture (which 
creates the audit trail and sends audit alarms to the system 
administrator interface).
The formal model for the MLS (A1-targetted) version covers both 
confidentiality and integrity; for the former, the model supports both a 
simple security policy and a star-policy, whereas for integrity there is 
only a simple security policy. Gypsy and the GVE were used for the 
FTLS, with the GIFT tool (developed by Computational Logic Inc) for 
covert flow analysis. Evaluation would be specific to a particular 
configuration of the system.
The project found that the programming staff  even senior and 
experienced programmers  took time (3-6 months) to become 
proficient in the use of Ada and more importantly in the subtleties of 
designing for security. Software development would have been eased if 
more automated tool support had been available  it would have been 
cost-effective spending time at the start of the project writing 
suitable tools and better debuggers. On the formal side, Gypsy was 
found good for the formal specifications, and mapped fairly cleanly 
down to Ada code, but the GVE was thought to leave much to be 
desired: it is difficult to master, labour-intensive and has a user-
unfriendly interface (as least on the Symbolics machines used by the 
project). A major omission which would greatly improve the utility of 
GVE is assistance in reproving assertions after minor specification 
changes.
In all, an interesting presentation for anyone proposing to implement a 
secure system of any scale.
The Army Secure Operating System is a family of operating systems 
intended to serve the tatical needs of the U.S. Army.  It is currently 
comprised of two systems designed to be certifiable to Classes C2 and 
A1 of the DoD Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC).  
Both operating systems proved a common user interface, support real-
time applications written in Ada, and are configurable and easily 
portable to alternate hardware architectures.  A Brief overview of the 
development is presented, including a description of the 
hardware/software architecure, the current status of the project, and 
a review of lessons learned during the three-year development.

This paper defines some standard terms such as various operating 
modes, and then discusses 4 different secure network configurations of 
increasing complexity. In this discussion there appears to be a 
fundamental flaw in his thinking, which restricts information from 
being passed to a process running at a higher clearance in a remote 
host, simply because the writing process cannot receive any 
acknowledgement from the receiving process. This argument is in 
general fallacious if there is a trusted component in either host, since 
this can handle any network level ackowledgements, retries, etc.
The paper also discusses the WWMCCS Information System (WIS) and

Security: The Parts of the Sum. in: 1989 IEEE Symposium on Security

Note: The presentation began with an overview of the different network 
security components (e.g. encryption, network protocols and trusted 
system principles) and the relationships between them, the author 
pointing out that these components, and the groups addressing them, 
should really work together even though it may be painful to do so.
The author suggested that rather than treat encryption as a completely 
separate box, as in end-to-end link encryption, it could be useful to 
apply encryption to the host itself, for instance, as a method of 
downgrading by scrambling. This would have the advantage of keeping 
the trusted decision over what is data and what is header inside the 
host, thus reducing the complexity of the cryptographic peripheral.
An example was given of how this could be applied to a PC running a 
trusted operating system. The trusted OS would make use of the 
encryption device to downgrade sensitive data. An untrusted 
application could then append a non-sensitive header and transmit the 
message. It was pointed out, however, that this mode of operation was 
not approved by current security doctrine.
The presentation finished by going through the good and bad news in 
network security so far. The good news was that there is an almost 
universal demand for low trust (C2, B1) systems and that the demand 
for higher (B2+) systems was steadily growing. The bad news was that 
most products currently available were still only attaining around C2 
level. The reasons given for this were that the evaluation process is 
too hard, not only for technical reasons but for financial and 
bureaucratic reasons as well.

Weber, D. G.; Lubarsky, R. The SDOS Project - Verifying Hook-up 
Security. 1987. 
Open systems, now common in many small computers, have given the 
user logical access to all parts of his or her system. At the same time, 
the computing environment is moving out of the computing center and 
into the office and home, giving users physical access to their systems. 
This movement of the computing environment necessitates a 
mechanism to prevent the user from physically accessing certain parts 
of his or her system if logical security (of the type which limits the 
user's ability to make copies, change code etc.) is to be reliable. This 
paper describes the development of a physical security system for 
protecting electronic circuits from unauthorized access. This system 
can be user to ensure that logical security mechanisms will remain 
uncompromised. The requirements, design criteria, and implementation 
of the system are discussed with an orientation towards practicality 
and manufacturing.

Applications Conference; 1991 Dec; San Antonio, Texas. USA: IEEE 
Computer Society Press; 1991: pp.187-200. ISBN: 0-8186-2280-6.
An approach to the inference problem in database security is described. 
This new approach is based on existing ideas in query containment 
theory. This theory may be used to generalize query modification, a 
query answering approach that allows a user to write a query that is 
beyond his access privileges, but the system will construct a set of 
similar queries that is within his privileges. This generalization may 
also be used to approach the inference problem. Examples of 
formalizing inference problems within the framework of queries are 
given, along with an algorithm for the detection of inference violations. 
Finally, suggestions are made for query answering to avoid inferences 
at several granularities by blocking all answers for a query, component 
queries, individual tuples, or individual values.

Weingart, Steve H. Physical Security for the Abyss System. 1987. 
IEEE Comp. Soc. Proc 1987 Symp on Security and Privacy, pp. 52 - 58
This paper describes some of the techniques used to implement a 
physically-secure, tamper-reacting processor for the storage and use 
of encipherment keys. The aim is to ensure that an attacker cannot 
learn the values of the keys currently being held, nor modify the device 
so that keys subsequently loaded can be determined. In addition, 
deciphered data held within the device should also be secure.
The major defence technique is to wrap the whole device in very fine 
multi-strand wire acting as a resistance element, and then potted in an 
opaque material that is harder than the insulation on the wire. Physical 
attacks are likely to cause breaks or shorts, and the change in 
resistance causes the protected RAM to be erased.
This paper is reassuring, in that it indicates that it feasible to produce 
in quantity  tamperproof devices for commercial use. If this were not 
practicable, it would certainly be impossible to produce such devices 
to government and military standards in large numbers.

Physical security technology is being used more often to protect the 
integrity of computing systems and the assets they contain. A physical 
security rating system is defined in terms of the difficulty of mounting 
a successful physical attack against it, quality assurance, 
documentation and system testing. An evaluation system is presented 
for determining adequate physical security, as a function of the 
environment in which the system is placed and the value of the assets 
resident in the system.

The ADEPT-50 time sharing system was one of the earliest systems to 
incorporate a formal security model. The formal security model used is 
called the High Water Mark model. Each subject and object has a 
security class, and the model defines an ordering on the security 
classes that corresponds to a lattice (although it is not identified as 
such). A subject can invoke an operation on an object if and only if the 
level of that subject in the lattice is at least that of the object. The 
High Water Mark model is of particular interest since it is one of the 
few security models to be implemented on an operational system

Software Protection. 1987. 
ABYSS (A Basic Yorktown Security System) is an architecture for the 
trusted execution of application software. It supports a uniform 
security service across the range of computing systems. The use of 
ABYSS discussed in this paper is oriented towards solving the software 
protection problem, especially in the lower end of the market. Both 
current and planned software distribution channels are supportable by 
the architecture, and the system is nearly transparent to legitimate 
users. A novel use-once authorization mechanism, called a token, is 
introduced as a solution to the problem of providing authorizations 
without direct communication. Software vendors may use the system to 
obtain technical enforcement of virtually any terms and conditions of 
sale of thir software, including such things as rental software. 
Software may be transferred between systems, and backed up to guard 
against loss in case of failure. We discuss the problem of protecting 
software on these systems, and offer guidelines to its solution. ABYSS 
is shown to be a general security base, in which many security 
applications may execute.
IEEE Comp. Soc. Proc 1987 Symp. Security and Privacy, pp. 38 - 51
The problem addressed by this paper is the need to ensure that 
commercially-supplied software is only used by the purchaser in 
accordance with the terms and conditions set by the vendors. It would 
not appear that the paper is of direct relevance to the COMPUSEC 
community.
The mechanism suggested is based on the idea of having critical parts 
of the software being executed on a separate, physically-protected 
processor, which is also used to hold decryption keys for the software 
supplied on a read-once token. The paper goes into some detail of the 
architecture, including ways in which safety backups of the keys can be 
taken and used, and how rights-to-execute can be transferred (if 
permitted) from one protected processor to another.
It was claimed that the production cost of the protected processor 
could be of the order of tens of dollars, with the added production cost 
to the software vendors being the cost of the token. As the scheme 
makes software piracy more difficult, 'honest' customers could benefit 
considerably if vendors are able to substantially reduce the price of 
their software.

This paper gives a formal definition of nondisclosure for a computing 
system and describes a functional decomposition of the system into 
two kinds of activities, namely the selection and execution of subject 
instructions. It then gives security requirements for each of the two 
resulting subsystems and proves that if each subsystem satisfies its 
security requirements, then the entire system satisfies the given 
nondisclosure property. Finally, in order to show how security can be  
enforced by the system, an access-control model is given for subject-

Williams, John C.; Dinolt, George W. (Ford Aerospace). Formal Model of a 
Trusted File Server. in: 1989 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy; 
May 1; Oakland, California. USA: IEEE Cmputer Society; 1989: 157-166. 
Note: This paper presents a security model of a file server, aimed at a 
large distributed system being developed by Ford Aerospace. The 
approach to the modelling is to treat a component as a black box, and to 
define security properties with respect to sequences of input and 
output events. No explicit state is defined for a component.
The security condition on the file server is a relation on input and 
output histories, which is to hold at all times, and is concerned only 
with compromise of data, rather than functionality. Requests to the 
file server may result in ACK or NAK responses, depending on whether 
the requested operation was performed. The model specifies that for 
each read response, the data in that response must be identical to the 
data in the most recent write response for that block, and the security 
levels of the read and write responses must be an exact match. The 
model assumes that an operation has only been completed once an ACK 
response has been issued, and that the security label of that response 
is the definitive representation of the level at which the operation was 
performed.
It is claimed that spontaneous creates, or an ACK response to a create 
request having a different security label to the request, are not a 
compromise problem. (Since if the label changes somehow, then the 
original requester will no longer be able to read the file). This is hard 
to believe, since there appears to be nothing to stop a trojan horse in 
the file server signalling the contents of one (high-level) file by 
modulating the creation of other (low-level) files. This would 
contradict the claim that operations on distinct files are non-
interfering.
The paper argues that non-interference was not a suitable technique 
for this model. The idea is that the real world sensitivity of data 
can change (by some unspecified means elsewhere in the system), and 
so in a file server with no regrade facility, the correctness of the 
delete operation is crucial for security. (However there seems to be no 
requirement for a delete response to be issued at all, and so the file 
would still be considered to exist, even if the datas real 
classification had changed). The assertion that their approach is an 
extension of non-interference is not convincing, especially since the 
incorporation of some non-interference statements in the model could 
have prevented the covert channel mentioned above.
The current status of this project is that the security model and 
implementation code have been written in Gypsy, the code has been 
verified against the model, and translation to C has been performed by 
hand. The server runs on a distributed testbed. Work is in progress on a 
grader server, and the problems of hook-up are being studied.
This work is of interest in that an event-based security model has been 
followed through almost to the level of the final code. There appear to 
be flaws in some details of the model, but these may be minor enough 
to be treated as part of a covert channel analysis of the 
implementation, and so elements of the modelling approach might merit 
closer examination.

Williams, John C.; Dinolt, George W. A Graph-Theoretic Formulation of 
Multilevel Secure Distributed Systems: an Overview. 1987. 
Research in developing formalisms for secure distributed systems 
reveals that a graph-theoretic model captures the fundamental notion 
of trust, while permitting a rigorous and elegant decomposition into 
lower levels of implementation. With such a model, security labels 
need be applied to directed edges only, not to events, ports. processes, 
messages, or whatever. Moreover, the usual concept of 'secure state' 
does not lend itself to defining security in a distributed system, 
whereas our Model guarantees secure transitions in precisely this 
context.
IEEE Comp. Soc. Proc 1987 Symp. Security and Privacy, pp. 97 - 103
In this paper graph-theoretic techniques are described for specifying 
multilevel secure distributed systems.
A system is modelled by a labelled, directed graph whose configuration 
changes over time according to a set of security related events. The 
vertices (nodes) of the graph represent processes and directed labelled 
edges (arc) represent classified information flow. Events which affect 
a particular vertex are linearly ordered, otherwise they can occur 
concurrently or in parallel. The occurrence of an event at a vertex can  
transforms the graph by the creation or deletion of incoming or 
outgoing edges.
The paper discusses a Bell-LaPadula-like model of security where 
information is allowed only to flow upwards with respect to the 
lattice structure of security labels. In this context the paper goes on to 
motivate the definition of an untrusted process - this is a vertex 
which, for every event relevant to it, satisfies the condition that the 
label on every outgoing edge dominates the label on every incoming 
edge which has existed to date. While this definition of trusted and 
untrusted process seems to fit the context of the paper it should not be 
viewed as a general definition of these concepts.
The technical content of the paper is complex, and, unfortunately, is 
not very well expressed. However, the paper deserves further study as 
it combines the issues of security modelling and the description of 
parallelism in the behaviour of distributed systems.

A1 DBMS (a Trusted Subject). in: 1989 IEEE Symposium on Security and 
Privacy; May 1; Oakland, California. USA: IEEE Computer Society; 1989: 
116-125. 
Note: This paper describes the security policy of the database 
management system, ASD (an acronym for A1 Secure DBMS). The system 
is currently at the prototype stage running on a prototype operating 
system targeted for A1 certification.
The DBMS is implemented as a trusted subject of a secure operating 
system, i.e. it implements its own mandatory access control (MAC). 
This has been done to avoid the performance/resource penalties of 
using a Hinke-Schaefer type architecture and should also allow the 
DBMS to be evaluated on different secure operating systems without 
having to re-evaluate the operating systems themselves.
The security policy is given in two parts, the first part states the 
constraints that any operating system must meet in order for it to be 
able to host securely ASD, the second (much larger) section describes 
the security policy of the DBMS TCB layer (i.e. the DBMS kernel plus 
trusted processes, e.g. system security officer processes).
The requirements on the secure operating system are essentially that 
it should prevent tampering with or bypassing of the DBMS TCB and that 
it should provide isolation of processes, user authentication, clearance 
checking and output labelling.
The security policy of the DBMS TCB is basically a variation of the Bell 
and LaPadula Model with the restrictions that the security level of a 
subject remains fixed throughout its lifetime and the sensitivity level 
of an object may only be changed by a trusted subject.

in a Multilevel Secure Relational Database Management System. in:

Washington DC: IEEE Computer Society Press; 1988: pp.70-84. ISBN: 0-
8186-0850-1.
Note: This paper from TRW advocates that, in the database world, a 
suitable interpretation for the abstract classified Object of 
Bell/LaPadula is the view.
Some terminology: relation=table; tuple=row (of a table); attribute 
identifies column of table and therefore an element (=field) of a tuple.
Although'view' is carefully defined in the paper as 'predefined named 
retrieval query which defines a virtual relation', evidently what is 
meant by view is 'a virtual relation predefined by a named retrieval 
query'. A virtual relation is constructed on demand from the actual 
'base relations' stored in the database.
The paper begins by assuming that data (elements or tuples) can be 
classified apriori, and we thus need to differentiate between the 
views of a given relation permitted to unclassified users and top-
secret users.
An interesting feature, provided automatically by any serious 
relational DBMS, is the ability to in effect classify data by content. For 
example, we may define a view, which we choose to call 'top-secret', 
such that any element with attribute 'Flight-cargo' and value 
'nuclearweapons' falls into that view. This is because the view is all 
that data which answers (predefined) query, and the query-definition 
may specify the inclusion of data with flight-cargo='nuclearweapons'.
In practice, this feature would seem essential, since presumably 
responsible judgment of appropriate classification is not practical 
separately for every piece of data in large databases. By setting out 
definitions ahead of time, data can be made self-classifying.
Further, explicit classification or labelling mechanisms become 
unnecessary without any loss of fineness of granularity. A disadvantage 
is that definitions of secure views are very revealing and must be 
protected as part of the TCB.
Completeness and consistency may be problematic: solutions are 
proposed. Other advantages and disadvantages are discussed.
The last part of the paper is subsumed to some degree by the Garvey 
and Wu paper so will not be reported on here.

A critical element in the widespread application of trusted systems is 
the availability of user interfaces that support efficient access by 
users to MLS data. This paper looks at functional requirements for an 
MLS User Interface, not in terms of what is typically implemented but 
in terms of user/system interaction. A model of user/system 
interaction is presented based on three security levels: Session Level, 
Update Level, and Field Level. Based on this model, three modes of 
user/system interaction are identified. These modes vary in the 
flexibility offered the user and the degree of difficulty in developing a 
trustworthy implementation. A brief discussion of architectural and 
implementation issues is presented for each mode.

Methodology for Verifying Microprogrammed Microprocessors. in: 1990 
IEEE Computer Society Symposium on Research in Security and Privacy; 
1990 May 7; Oakland. USA: IEEE; 1990: 345-357. 
Note: The author begins by pointing out the large amount of effort 
which has been required for verifications which have been achieved to 
date of the correctness of microprocessor designs. The authors goal 
is to provide a framework in which a student can complete in six 
months a verification of a microprocessor comparable to VIPER.
The case of VIPER is significant: the proof of VIPER remains incomplete 
because of the large case-explosion which occurred and the size of 
proofs in each case (the funding ran out before all the cases could be 
considered). This is judged to be primarily because the decisions about 
levels of abstraction in the description of VIPER were forced upon the 
verifier, and they were wrong, in that they did not control the case-
explosion, or rather the size of each case. The verifier was faced 
essentially with proving many lemmas (one for each instruction, i.e. 
128), each such that the proof involved some expressions several pages 
long.
Windleys approach is to decompose the system description into a 
hierarchy of state-machines, each of which is an interpreter for the 
execution of the machine above it. The bottom layer is not a state-
machine but a circuit. A system description is presented at four levels 
of abstraction. These are called Macro Level Interpreter, Micro Level 
Interpreter (i.e. microcode engine), Phase Level Interpreter (the four 
phases or subcycles of the microcode engine) and finally Electronic 
Block Model.
A correctness proof is then performed for each pair of adjacent levels, 
which are then composed for the final result. Briefly, the results 
required are to the effect that, for example, when a given instruction is 
selected for execution, the transformation of the micro-level state 
produces the correct transformation of the macro-level state.
Specifications and lemmas are presented, in HOL, for a simple 
microprogrammed microprocessor. The exposition is admirably clear. 
This is another microprocessor whose primary purpose is pedagogical, 
and thus was specified by the verifier. (Is is significant that, of all the 
verifications of microprocessors to date, VIPER is the only one not 
specified by its verifier?)
Windleys approach is based on finding levels of abstraction which 
reduce the cost of number-of-cases times per-case complexity. He 
claims dramatic or order-of-magnitude reduction in verification 
costs, and the claim seems convincing in the case of microprogrammed 
systems. For example, the number of instructions at the phase-level 
is only four.
Windley mentioned in his presentation that the word 
microprogrammed in his title was too restrictive and the approach 
was more generally applicable. It may well be so in principle, but it 
still remains to be shown.
To date, several microprocessors have been verified using formal 
methods.  The only successful verification efforts, however, have been 
on relatively simple microprocessor architectures (fewer than 32 
words of micro instruction store, small instruction set, limited 
features for supporting operating systems, etc.).  The goal of the 
research reported here is to develop methodologies for verifying such a 
microprocessor.  This paper presents a hierarchical methodology for 
decomposing microprocessor verifications which reduces the necessary 
effort by more than an order of magnitude.  A secondary result of the 
research is a verified microengine that can be used to quickly 
implement verified microprocessors with varied architectures.

IEEE Comp. Soc. Proc. 1986 Symp. Security and Privacy pp.2-13
This paper describes a study of the feasability of adding mechanisms to 
handle temporal logic to the formal specification language Ina Jo (part 
of the FDM system). This should allow the advantages of formal 
specifications - precision, lack of ambiguity, and amenability to 
machine analysis - to cover systems with concurrency, such as 
operating systems, multiprocessors, and distributed systems.
Ina Jo is based on an underlying model of a nondeterministic state 
machine; specifications consist of global state, assertions and state 
transitions. The paper presents as an example of a specification for a 
secure network (where users have to check with an Access Controller 
before communicating, and then a Key Distribution Centre issues 
cryptovariables for permitted communications).
The lessons learned were: it is relatively easy to extend Ina Jo in this 
manner due to the underlying nondeterministic model; applications 
should drive which logical system to choose; and, there should be a 
written formal definition of specification languages.
As this was only a study paper, it is unclear how much the extensions 
would slow down the proof tools.

The Trusted Database Management System Interpretation (TDI) provides 
a general taxonomy of popular security architectures, and guidance on 
evaluation considerations. An architecture that has received 
considerable attention is hierarchical trusted computing base (TCB) 
subsetting. This architecture is intended to allow database 
management systems (DBMS) to take advantage of the effort expended 
in producing and evaluating trusted multi-level operating systems. This 
paper explores the advantages and disadvantages that result from use 
of this security architecture. Another architecture, functional 
modularization of a TCB, is presented. This architecture gives the DBMS 
much greater control over its security policy and resource management 
than the TCB subsetting approach, allowing for fuller functionality and 
performance.

Secure systems and networks generate vast amounts of audit 
information that may reveal unusual situations or patterns of use. 
While such analysis is usually performed only after other evidence is 
uncovered, a strong need exists for real-time analysis. The system we 
describe is a real-time network and host security monitor which 
allows both interactive and automatic audit trail analysis. Audit 
records - tokens of actual user behavior, are examined in context of 
user profiles - measures of expected behavior. This system combines a 
set of statistical tools for both interactive and automatic analysis of 
audit data, an expert system that works in conjunction with the 
statistical tools, and a hierarchical set of audit indicators which are 
based on an Indications and Warning model. The application of the model 
allows us to both collect audit events at a fine level of granularity, as 
well as effectively direct intrusion and anomaly detection by defining 
levels of concern. A set of discrete tools, capabilities, and components 
are implemented in a hybrid design utilizing control concepts from 
operating systems theory and problem-solving concepts from 
blackboard AI systems.

Providing security in databases is a difficult task and it is essential to 
separate the concerns of confidentiality and integrity Unfortunately, 
high assurance confidentiality controls and useful integrity controls 
are largely incompatible. In answer to IFIP WG11.3 Question 4, this 
conflict can only be solved by fitting a less powerful data model to the 
security model. Most solutions have preserved the full functionality of 
the database, but weakened the integrity controls. The alternative, 
taken by SWORD [Wood90], is to restrict functionality so that integrity 
may be properly enforced. This of course begs the question, "What 
integrity controls should a secure database provide?", and this paper 
offers an answer.

considered as candidates for use in a system where memory address 
space is shared by all users of a computer. The special problems that 
arise from this requirement are described and it is shown that no one 
garbage collector solves all the problems.

IEEE Comp. Soc. Proc. 1986 Symp. Security and Privacy pp.86-94
This paper gives a brief outline of the RSRE Flex computer, and then it 
describes how it will be used to achieve various objectives in a secure 
computing system, such as abstract types. This paper describes Flex, a 
capability computer currently implemented on ICL Perq equipment; 
RSRE are currently developing secure hardware known as SCP3 to 
support Flex.
The RSRE view is that capabilities are items of data; holders can copy 
them, or use them to access objects, but they cannot be forged. FLEX 
allows capabilities and scalars (`normal' data) to be stored in the same 
block (segment) - this differs from all other implementations of 
capability architectures. Procedures are small objects, binding 
together the code and an execution environment (non-local variables); 
as these objects are execute only, the environment is protected. 
Objects can be given a key, and can have unlocked or locked 
capabilities; for the latter type, a key is required before access is 
permitted.
Procedure objects and object locking together allow a user-extensible 
abstract data type mechanism. In the paper, a `classified file' is given 
as an example of an abstract data type, and the problem of an editor 
(used to sanitise) containing a Trojan horse is brought up. This leads to 
the idea of a High water mark (HWM) mechanism, and a trusted type 
manager that can read/set the HWM; this in turn leads to the need for a 
trusted Command Line Interpreter, to ensure downgrading is controlled 
by the user.
Persistent storage on the Flex is capability based, but cannot contain 
main-store capabilities. Discs are treated as write-once storage. FLEX 
does not have a security policy such as MLS, but provides (by means of 
the protection inherent in capabilities combined with the procedure and 
abstract type mechanism) means for providing a tailored security 
policy.

Wiseman, S. R. The SMITE Object Oriented Backing Store. 1988 Jan 3. 
The SMITE computer system is to be provided with a write once backing 
store that allows objects to be stored permanently. Capabilities are 
used for addressing objects and on the fly garbage collection is used to 
recover inaccessible objects. This paper describes the proposed 
implementation of the backing store and its garbage collector.

Wiseman, S. R. Two Advanced Computer Architectures: Their Support for 
Languages and Operating System
 1982 Jan 7. 
The Intel iAPX-432 micro-frame system and the RSRE Flex multi-
computer system, are two computer systems with advanced computer 
architectures. They have been designed to overcome the problems met 
when implementing operating systems and high level languages on 
computers with Von Neumann architectures. The problems, such as 
storage management, parallel processing and the large semantic gap 
between high level languages and the computer's instruction set, are 
approached in different ways with varying degrees of success, by the 
two systems. This report outlines these problems, describes the two 
systems and gives a critical comparison of the solutions they offer. An 
overview of capabilities, and a brief description of two earlier 
computers is also given.

Wiseman, S. R.; Harrold, C. L. A Security Model and its Implementation. 
1988 Jan 9. 
A new security model is proposed which allows the notions of 
confidentiality and integrity to be expressed in one coherent 
framework. Confidentiality is taken to be solely concerned with the 
observation of classified information, while separation of duty is 
employed as the technique for assuring the integrity of the security 
labels which are the basis of confidentiality. Discretionary access 
control is modelled by access control lists whose integrity is also 
provided by separation of duty controls. The specification of a simple 
system is given as an example of the techniques and methods for 
implementation are discussed.

Computer Society Press; 1988: pp.147-155. ISBN: 0-8186-0850-1.
Note: The Trusted Path currently being developed for RSRE's SMITE is 
described, the proposal is radically different to the trusted paths 
available on current systems. The SMITE Trusted Path is a screen 
editor, rather than a command interface supporting a very limited 
number of commands.
The Trusted Path to SMITE is, therefore, an order of magnitude more 
complex than existing trusted paths. The paper describes how the novel 
SMITE architecture will be used to support the secure implementation 
of the interface.
Examples from the Z specification of the editor are included in the 
paper, with an indication that an attempt will be made to implement a 
high assurance version of the Trusted Path using stepwise refinement 
carried out by hand.
The implementation of the Trusted Path is heavily dependent on the 
SMITE architecture, and not applicable to more conventional 
architectures.
If signalling channels can only be driven by the Trusted Path, they 
cannot be exploited by Trojan Horses in untrusted software.  To this 
end, the SMITE system aims to provide a general purpose Trusted Path, 
based on a screen editor, which would act as the users' normal 
interface to the system.  The feasibility of the approach relies on the

Nondeterministic Systems. in: IEEE Computer Society Symposium on 
Security and Privacy; 1990 May 7; Oakland. USA: IEEE; 1990: 144-161. 
Note: The main thesis of the paper is that the combinatorial 
information-flow properties (e.g. Sutherlands Nondeducibility, or 
descendants of Goguen and Meseguers Noninterference) can be 
satisfied by a nondeterministic system and still contain illegitimate 
channels. Shannons communication theory has an important part to 
play here. Examples are given to show the intrinsic inadequacy, for non-
deterministic systems, of purely possibilistic properties which do 
not take probabilities into account.
The paper begins by motivating and introducing a property called 
nondeducibility on strategies, which is a generalisation of 
Sutherlands Nondeducibility. An example is given of a noisy system 
which satisfies Sutherlands Nondeducibility, and yet, by exploiting 
feedback, allows a noiseless channel from transmitter to receiver. The 
transmitter is able to control outputs to the receiver, even though the 
receiver can deduce nothing about actual inputs made by the 
transmitter. The receiver is able however to deduce the transmitters 
strategy, where a strategy is a function used by the transmitter to 
determine next input from previous inputs and their observed effects. 
In the absence of feedback, a strategy is just an input string.
This property is contrasted with McCulloughs Generalized 
Noninterference (aka hookup or restrictiveness), and a 
simplification of it called forward correctability. Thus, in a purely 
possibilistic framework, there are three properties: Nondeducibility (on 
strings), which is too weak; Nondeducibility on strategies, which is 
just right; and Forward Correctability, which is too strong. The third of 
these implies the second, which implies the first. Forward 
Correctability, and hence McCulloughs restrictiveness, is too strong 
because it assumes that the receiver can make deductions from the 
entire history of inputs and outputs, both high and low, up to the point 
of interest.
Next, resource contention systems are introduced, as models for 
connection of transmitter, receiver and noise-process. From a 
contention system, a nondeterministic state machine may be 
constructed, and it is the latter which may or may not have the 
property (e.g. nondeducibility on strategies).
It is shown how the channel capacities depend upon the probability 
distribution of the events of the noise process. It is then conjectured 
that for any contention system, if the corresponding machine has no 
illegitimate flows (i.e. satisfies any of the properties mentioned 
above), then there is a noise-distribution for which all channels have 
zero capacity. This conjecture is shown to be false, by counterexample. 
Thus it is possible to have a resource contention system which 
satisfies every one of the combinatorial security properties 
[considered so far], but nevertheless must have channels of positive 
capacity.
It is interesting to speculate whether the same would hold of the 
property of McLeans Flow Model, presented at the same conference.
The principal aim of this paper is to give an analysis of some recent 
combinatorial theories of computer security from the perspective of 
information theory.  The theories analyzed are information-flow 
theories based on the concept of nondeducibility.  They are intended to 
be applicable to nondeterministic systems that may be networked.

Authentication System. 1985.

IEEE Comp. Soc. Proc. 1985 Symp. Security and Privacy pp.101-107
After discussing various problems with passwords (static, user chosen 
and so guessable, handled carelessly, and subject to both eavesdropping 
and exhaustive search attacks) and some common solutions, the paper 
defines the goals of an identification scheme to be that it addresses 
security issues, it must be easy to administer, and that it must be 
portable portable (commercially-developed units have an extra 
requirement to be profit earning). The paper describes POLONIUS, a 
family of products by Sytek including an Authentication Server and a 
PassPort. The latter is a calculator-like device to which users type in 
their PIN. Once this is done, users can identify themselves to the AS, 
which yields a challenge number to be typed in to the PassPort. The 
identification protocol is completed by the user typing in to the AS the 
challenge response calculated (from the challenge number, the quoted 
PIN and an internal unique secret number) and displayed by PassPort.
Use of POLONIUS means that users do not have to entrust knowledge of 
their PINs to, say, an ATM, and the PIN is not transmitted in clear over 
any transmission lines. It does require that the PassPort has to protect 
its secret number so that it will not be revealed by physical tampering 
or by systematic challenge entry.
The paper has an discussion on one-time pads, that is irrelevant in that 
the PassPort does not contain one. The AS does contain a one-time pad, 
but this is used as part of the challenge number generator in 
incorporation with a challenge count for the user (updated at each 
authentication attempt).

Note: Introduction (part of): Since the publication of a number of early 
papers describing the design of secure UNIX operating system 
prototypes, and a Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC) 
B2 feasibility study for UNIX, the industry has seen the introduction of 
a number of secure UNIX products and the evaluation of one of these 
products by the National Computer Security Center (NCSC) at the TCSEC 
B1 class. In addition, a number of standards bodies including IEEE POSIX 
1003.6, TRUSIX, Open Software Foundation, UNIX International, X/Open, 
and 88Open have all taken up the issue of standardization of secure 
UNIX features. We can expect that in 1990 and certainly by 1991 almost 
every major UNIX operating system vendor will have introduced either a 
C2 or B1 class compliant product. Furthermore, developments in secure 
UNIX technology are likely to continue as evidenced by AT&T's intent to 
introduce a B2 class compliant secure UNIX with System V release 4.0 
Enhanced Security sometime in 1991 and OSF's plans to meet B3 in 
their OSF/2 operating system. This paper is a summary of a recent 
study conducted by Oracle in determining the similarities and 
differences in the various secure UNIX implementations that are now or 
will shortly be available. The five systems that were surveyed for this 
study are: 1) AT&T System V/MLS, Release 1.1, 2) SunOS MLS, Version 
1.0, 3) SecureWare Security Module Package Plus, Version 1.0, 4) 
Addamax B1st Trusted System Kit for System V 3.0, Release 1.0 and 5)

In most systems, authorisation is specified using some low-level 
system-specific mechanisms, e.g. protection bits, capabilities and 
access control lists. We argue that authorisation is an independent 
semantic concept that must be separated from implementation 
mechanisms and given a precise semantics. We propose a logical 
approach to representing and evaluating authorisation. Specifically, we 
introduce a language for specifying policy bases. A policy base encodes 
a set of authorisation requirements and is given a precise semantics 
based upon a formal notation of authorisation policy. The semantics is 
computable, thus providing a basis for authorisation evaluation. We 
also introduce two comparison operators for policy bases, which are 
appropriate for modeling distributed systems with multiple 
administrative domains.

We specify authentication protocols as formal
objects wih precise syntax and semantics, and
define a semantic model that characterizes pro-
tocol executions. We have identified two basic
types of correctness properties, namely, corre-
spondence and secrecy, that underlie the correct-
ness concerns of authentication protocols. We
define assertions for specifying these properties,
and a formal semantics for their satisfaction in
the semantic model. The Otway-Rees protocol
is used to illustrate the semantic model and the
basic correctness properties.

The Seventh lnternational IFIP TC'11 Conference on Information

Since its definition the Ada language has aroused much strong feeling 
about how it can be used in a secure system. In this paper, we show, by 
introducing the notion of 'type security', that strict controls must be 
placed on the use of the language by untrusted software in order to gain 
reasonable assurance. However, it is shown that these controls can be 
implemented without resort to an Ada subset. We thus propose a 
method of building a secure system in Ada which allows almost free 
expression within both trusted and untrusted software.

Wood, A. W.; Lewis, S. R.; Wiseman, S. R. The SWORD Multilevel Secure 
DBMS. 1992 Feb 19. 
SWORD is a multilevel secure relational database management system. 
It adopts the 'Insert Low' approach to the Provision of confidentiality 
controls, rather than the more commonly adopted technique of 
'polyinstantiation'. This allows SWORD to enforce confidentiality and 
elementary integrity constraints, such as uniqueness. Special 
techniques allow a multilevel SWORD database to be created and 
maintained by untrusted database clients working at a single level. In 
particular, 'Place Holders' allow fields to be created so that the 
classification of the field's contents dominates the classification of 
its existence. The report presents an informal description of SWORD 
and provides a general discussion of the issues. The reader should be 
familiar with the technical problems of providing multilevel computer 
security and some understanding of relational databases would be 
helpful.

suggested by the Department of Defense Tusted Computer System 
Evaluation Criteria), and revolves around associating two types of 
security information with objects: mandatory access control levels 
(MACLs), and sensitivity labels. MACLs are analogous to what are 
traditionally called security levels, and represent a failsafe level at 
which an object must be protected. Sensitivity labels accurately 
represent the classification of the data in the object, and also 
represent necessary handling restrictions. Supporting both MACLs and 
sensitivity labels for objects makes the system easier to use, helps 
prevent overclassification of data, and provides the capabiity of 
associating handling restrictions with data
IEEE Comp. Soc. Proc 1987 Symp. Security and Privacy, pp. 23 - 30
This is the third of three papers from MITRE on the Compartmented 
Mode project. This paper addresses what may be regarded as an 
ambivalence in the meaning to be assigned to sensitivity labels.
Although the author does not say so outright, the ambivalence arises 
apparently from a divergence between theory and practice: the practice 
is to disregard the 'markings' content of a label as the basis for 
mandatory access control. (These markings are nothing to do with 
discretionary access).
Thus in this paper, which seeks to codify this practice and support it 
explicitly through system design, a distinction is drawn between:
 What is called a (floating) sensitivity label on data, which is 
computed dynamically as the least upper bound of all labels of data 
which has actually been accessed in the preparation of this data. This 
serves for labelling output 'accurately', i.e. without danger of 
overclassifying, and performs the error-prone computation of 
combinations of labels automatically.
 What is called mandatory access control level (MACL) - a second kind 
of label which represents a ceiling for a floating label and, being a 
property of both subject and object, serves as the basis for mandatory 
access control. The floating label cannot be allowed to float upwards 
indefinitely, or there is no control.
A more descriptive name for these two kinds of labels might be 'actual' 
and 'potential'.
This system differs from conventional controls apparently in two 
respects: simplified versions of classification and clearance are 
compared for granting access, and the system keeps track of an actual 
upper bound for the sensitivity of an object (which starts off 
UNCLASSIFIED for a newly created empty object and floats up). Note 
that there is here a notion of an empty object, so that an object can be 
distinguished from its contents. This is unlike the conventional 
treatment, and is an advance.

Covert channels have traditionally been categorized as either storage 
channels or timing channels. This paper questions this categorization, 
and discusses channels that cannot be clearly identified as either 
storage or timing channels, but have aspects of both. A new model of 
timing channels is presented, which allows for channels that have 
characteristics of both storage channels and timing channels, and a 
method is given for constructing all channels in a computer system 
that have timing channel characteristics. Since Kemmerer's shared 
resource matrix methodology has the potential to detect all channels 
that have storage channel characteristics, the two methods jointly 
have the capability to construct all channels in a computer system.The 
approach to timing channels provides a justification of specific 
mechanisms for reducing their bandwidth which were employed in the 
VAX Virtual Machine Monitor.

In order to be affordable and to satisfy user requirements, todays 
secure systems must be constructed out of trusted and untrusted 
components. We have developed a framework for designing secure 
system architectures, designed four general purpose secure 
architectures and validated one of them on our Secure System 
Integration IR&D. This paper describes this work and what we have 
learned about secure architectures and their implementation using 
COTS secure products.

The notion of trust is fundamental in inter-domain au-
thentication protocols. The goal of this paper is to de-
velop an effective formalism for explicit expressions of
trust relations between entities involved in authentica-
tion protocols. Different relevant types of trust are iden-
tified and classified. A formalism for expressing trust
relations is presented along with an algorithm for deriv-
ing trust relations from recommendations. The advan-
tages of that approach are demonstrated by analysing
and comparing the trust relation requirements of a few
known authentication protocols.

Young, William D.; McHugh, John. Coding for a Believable Specification 
to Implementation Mapping. 1987. 
One criterion for 'Beyond A1' certification according to the DoD Trusted 
Computer Systems Evaluation Criteria will be code-level verification. 
We argue that, while verification at the actual code level may be 
infeasible for large secure systems, it is possible to push the 
verification to a low level of abstraction and then map the 
specification in an intuitive manner to the source code. Providing a 
suitable mapping requires adhering to a strict discipline on both the 
specification and code sides. We discuss the issues involved in this 
problem, particularizing the discussion to a mapping from Gypsy 
specifications to C code
IEEE Comp. Soc. Proc 1987 Symp. Security and Privacy, pp. 140 - 148
John McHugh talked on some 'rules of thumb' for manually translating 
Gypsy to C. He began the presentation with a disclaimer, advising that 
the way to produce verified code is not to use Gypsy, rather we should 
design new languages and environments with this goal in mind. 
However, noting that Gypsy is the language of choice for many security 
applications, this paper is intended to address a translation discipline 
from specification to code.
The salient points of the discipline are:
 Preserve modularity of the specification
 Study semantics of specification and implementation languages
 Subset the languages so as to use only those features with a well-
defined semantics
 Translate similar data structure and operations consistently 
 Optimise cautiously.
The paper also contains an example of translating Gypsy sequences to 
C, and gives some guidelines on how code performance can be enhanced. 
The paper should be of interest to system designers using Gypsy to 
develop secure systems up to A1 certification.

Jun; 16(6): 581-592.
Note: Revised version of IEEE Symposium paper.
In this paper, we present a specification and verification method for 
preventing denial of service in absence of failures and of integrity 
violations.  We introduce the notion of 'user agreements' and argue that 
lack of specificaitons for these arguments and for simultaneity 
conditions makes it impossible to demonstrate denial-of-service 
prevention, in spite of demonstrably fair service access.  We illustrate 
the use of this method with an example and explain why current 
methods for specification and verification of safety and liveness 
properties of concurrent programs do not handle this problem.  The 
proposed specification and verification method is meant to augment 
current methods for secure system design.

Commercial service systems should allow customers to control their 
service configurations. The challenge is to make this feature feasible 
in such a way that the system is easy to administer while ensuring the 
security of both customer's service and the control system itself. We 
argue that simple security mechanisms such as access control lists 
used in general-purpose computer systems are insufficient for 
administration control and authority delegation in commercial systems. 
We propose a security policy called an "authorization policy" suitable 
for administration and authorization controls. This security policy is 
enforced through a unified protection mechanism called an "access 
control hierarchy". The application of this access control hierarchy is 
demonstrated by examples.

1988 Apr 18; Oakland Ca. Washington DC: IEEE Computer Society Press; 
1988: pp.187-202. ISBN: 0-8186-0850-1.
Note: This paper received the (joint) best paper award from the IEEE 
program committee because of its comprehensive treatment of a 
difficult and formerly generally avoided topic.
It presents general skeleton specifications showing the areas which 
must be defined in order to verify the prevention of denial of service. 
The skeletons specify not only aspects of a service but also aspects of 
its users. It argues that the latter, a user-agreement, is always 
necessary even though the user's conformance to it cannot be checked 
by the service itself, because some reliance inevitably must be placed 
upon users to ensure, for example, that resources allocated by the 
service are eventually returned.
A user-agreement consists of liveness and safety statements about 
both an individual user's service invocation sequence and the service 
invocation sequence formed by the sum of all its users.
A user's invocation sequence is said to be safe if the operations 
invoked are only those allowed to that user and, where those operations 
consume and release resources, occur in an order which does not return 
unallocated resources. A service's invocation sequence is said to be 
live if their is always a sub-sequence of operations which will take a 
user out of a blocked condition into one in which execution can be 
resumed.
A complete service-specification model consists of a user-agreement 
specification and a service specification. The latter is divided into a 
specification of the service's sharing mechanisms and the sharing 
policies which the mechanisms are required to maintain. The sharing 
policies: simultaneity and fairness, together with the user-agreements, 
define the service's finite waiting time (FWT) policy.
The simultaneity policy ensures that a user will continue to have 
oportunities to progress provided the user-agreement is upheld. If 
progress is dependent upon a number of conditions this policy ensures 
that they will eventually all become true simultaneously.
The fairness policy then ensures that a user will not be blocked for 
ever assuming it has many oportunities to make progress. The service, 
will not, for example, continually allow other users to make progress 
at the expense of any given user.
Two examples, a resource allocator and Dijkstra's dining philosophers, 
are then used to illustrate the approach in practice. The example 
policies are written in temporal logic, which is well and briefly 
described in appendices, and which seems to be well suited to the task.
In this paper a formal specification and verification method for the 
prevention of denial of service in absence of failures and of integrity 
violations is presented.  The notion of 'user agreements' is introduced, 
and an argument presented that lack of specifications for these 
agreements and for simultaneity conditions makes it impossible to 
demonstrate denial-of-service prevention, in spite of demonstrably 
fair service access.  The use of this method is demonstrated with two 
examples and it is explained why current methods for specification and 
verification of safety and liveness properties of concurrent programs 
have been unable to handle this problem.  The proposed specification 
and verification method is meant to augment current methods for 
secure system design.

A brief review of the history of computer viruses is illustrated with 
examples of a number of viruses and details of how they replicate 
themselves.  A checklist of methods of prevention and detection is 
given, together with advice about the actions that can be taken in the 
event of infection.  There is also a consideration of the possible 
avenues of legal action that might be open to an organisation that has 
suffered from a virus and that wishes to claim redress, but these 
appear to be limited in practice.
